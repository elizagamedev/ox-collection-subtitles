# The Ox Collection - Subtitles

This is a collection of SRT subtitle files generated by OCR from Mandarin
Chinese DVD editions of various movies.

Currently, it contains a random selection of subtitles from DVDs I have
inherited, which are freshly spat out of OCR and haven't really been cleaned up
much. It's likely that some files were misclassified in metadata with the wrong
language, and are complete nonsense; it's likely that some files were classified
with the right metadata, but were arranged in such a way that was too confusing
to the OCR; and it's likely that a lot of the subtitles are already very good
and useable without much twaeking. There are often multiple tracks for each
language for various reasons, e.g. simplified vs. traditional Chinese,
commentary track subtitles, etc. I haven't sorted through them yet, so right
now, these duplicates are just named with their original track IDs.

PRs to fix mistakes or rename files to have more meaningful names are welcome!
