1
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,330
Long ago, in a land far away,

2
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,762
there once rose an empire that
stretched from the steppes of China

3
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,678
to the shores of the Mediterranean.

4
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,966
That empire was Persia.

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,430
Fierce in battle, wise in victory,

6
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,678
where the Persian sword went,
order followed.

7
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:40,012
The Persian king, Sharaman,
ruled with his brother, Nizam,

8
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,767
upon the principles of loyalty
and brotherhood.

9
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,156
The King had two sons
who gave him great joy.

10
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:50,723
Rejoice!

11
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,728
But in the eyes of the gods,

12
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,880
the King's family was not yet complete,

13
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,084
not until the day he witnessed
a single act of courage

14
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,458
by an orphan boy
from the streets of Nasaf.

15
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,231
Get out of the way!

16
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,533
Stop!

17
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,638
-Stop!
-Help!

18
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,505
Run! Run, Bis! Run!

19
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,481
Stay here.

20
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,351
Stop him! He's getting away!

21
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,310
Let go of me!

22
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,663
Come here!

23
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,257
In the King's name!

24
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,994
What is your name, boy?

25
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,735
-Dastan, sire.
-And your parents?

26
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,547
Boy!

27
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,257
Brother, take him up.

28
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,015
Moved by what he saw,

29
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,073
the King adopted the boy, Dastan,
into his family.

30
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,435
A son with no royal blood

31
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,267
and no eye on his throne.

32
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,004
But perhaps there was
something else at work that day,

33
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,498
something beyond
simple understanding,

34
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,805
the day a boy
from the unlikeliest of places became

35
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,305
a prince of Persia.

36
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,648
The fabled Alamut.
Even more stunning than I'd imagined.

37
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,317
Don't be fooled by beauty, Prince Tus.
It's a city like any other.

38
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,567
Soft countries make soft men.

39
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,829
They stoop to treachery
and now must pay for it.

40
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,161
My father's made clear
Alamut's not to be touched.

41
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,354
Some consider it sacred.

42
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,772
But since our wise father isn't here,
the decision rests with me.

43
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,526
I'll have one last council
with my noble uncle

44
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,719
and my two brothers,
trusted Garsiv and...

45
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,613
Where's Dastan?

46
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,045
Come on! I bet my entire
month's allowance on this!

47
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,294
This is embarrassing!

48
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,924
-Why don't you give it a try?
-Get in there!

49
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,202
Is that all you got?

50
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,692
Prince Dastan!

51
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,965
Where is Prince Dastan?

52
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,200
Prince Dastan isn't here!

53
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,063
Your Highness, please.

54
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,214
Prince Tus has convened
a war council.

55
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,260
I'm on my way.

56
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:07,599
Our finest spy intercepted a caravan
leaving Alamut.

57
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,183
Swords of the best workmanship.

58
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,786
Steel-tipped arrows.

59
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,985
And promise of payment
from the warlord Kosh to Alamut.

60
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,704
They're selling weapons
to our enemies, Dastan.

61
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,096
An arrow such as this
slew my horse in Koshkhan.

62
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,588
Blood will run
in Alamut's streets for this.

63
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,061
Or our soldiers will fall from its walls.

64
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,520
Our orders were to subdue Koshkhan,
not to attack Alamut.

65
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,064
Wise words, little brother.

66
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,519
Words won't stop our enemies

67
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,355
once they're armed
with Alamutian blades.

68
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,946
We attack at dawn.

69
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,094
Well, if that's your decision,
then let me go in first.

70
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,821
Thoughts to share, Garsiv?

71
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,516
l ride at the head of the Persian army.

72
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,901
Dastan leads a company
of street rabble.

73
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,600
They may not be much for manners,
but they're pretty handy in a fight.

74
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,306
The honor of first blood
should be mine.

75
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:16,959
Garsiv, your hand is
on your sword again.

76
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,360
-Where it should be!
-Oh, my brothers!

77
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,767
Ever eager.

78
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,500
It's said the princess of Alamut
is a beauty without equal.

79
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,902
We'll march into her palace
and see for ourselves.

80
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,154
There can be no doubt
of your courage, Dastan.

81
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,328
But you're not ready for this.

82
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,837
Garsiv's cavalry will lead the way.

83
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,479
Princess Tamina.

84
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,558
The Persian army, my princess,
has not moved on.

85
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,186
Their faith has little love for any truth

86
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,176
other than its own.

87
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,034
Perhaps it would be safer
if you didn't stand so close.

88
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,466
Whatever their faith,
their bows aren't that strong.

89
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,758
Nor is their aim.

90
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,285
Gather the council.

91
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,207
Tell them I sit in the High Temple.
I must pray.

92
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,350
The High Temple?

93
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,218
Alamut hasn't been breached
in a thousand years.

94
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,221
Everything changes with time.

95
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,841
We should know this best of all.

96
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,023
Remind me why we're disobeying
your brother's orders?

97
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,665
Because Garsiv only knows
how to attack head-on.

98
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,318
It'll be a massacre.

99
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,904
The Alamutians will be busy
with the main gate,

100
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,306
so we'll slip through the side.

101
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,243
Have you been drinking?

102
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,755
That's our way in.

103
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,730
There are two gates.
The outer one's easy.

104
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,945
It's the inner gate that's impossible.

105
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,069
That gate mechanism is protected
by two manned guard towers.

106
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,977
Yeah, well,
there's always a way in, Bis.

107
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,529
You take care of the outer gate,

108
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,243
you leave the impossible one to me.

109
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,329
You know, sire, you won't be happy
till you get us all killed.

110
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,981
Wonderful speech, Bis. Rousing.

111
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,035
Sound the alarm!

112
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:15,674
Hold this.

113
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,089
Watch your back.

114
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,347
Eastern gate's open.

115
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:19,705
That's Dastan's man.
He's gotten in. Dastan's done it.

116
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,681
Redeploy to the eastern gate.

117
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,939
Redeploy to the eastern gate!

118
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,558
Come on.

119
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,922
They've breached the eastern gate.

120
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,174
Collapse the passages to the chamber.

121
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,890
Princess.

122
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,162
Go now, everyone.

123
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,533
You know what you must do.

124
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,462
Above all else, it must be kept safe.

125
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,684
Out of the way!

126
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,144
Silly songs and scented smoke
will do little for you now!

127
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,574
I think you'll find there's more
to her than that, eh, Garsiv?

128
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,666
So for once the stories are true.

129
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,071
We know you secretly build weapons
for enemies of Persia.

130
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,048
-Now show us where.
-We have no forges here.

131
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,665
And what weapons we had,
you overcame.

132
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,134
Our spies say differently.

133
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,555
-You can save a lot of pain...
-All the pain in the world

134
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,121
will not help you find something
that does not exist.

135
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,680
Spoken like one wise enough
to consider a political solution.

136
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,216
Join hands with Persia's future king.

137
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,915
I'll die first.

138
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,969
That can be arranged.

139
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,962
Don't!

140
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,502
Prince Tus.

141
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:42,411
Promise me the people of Alamut
will be treated with mercy.

142
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,764
-Hey, the Lion of Persia!
-The Lion of Persia!

143
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,527
They're calling you the Lion of Persia.

144
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,298
You've never excelled
at following orders, Dastan.

145
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,935
-l have some explaining to do, Tus. I...
-No.

146
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:09,915
No.

147
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,444
No! We have some celebrating to do.

148
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,989
There is, however, tradition.

149
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,191
Since you took the honor
of first assault,

150
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,908
you owe me a gift of homage.

151
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,726
A beautiful dagger.

152
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,040
He delivered you the city
and its princess.

153
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,536
-I think that's homage enough.
-l suppose it is.

154
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,829
First dispatch has just arrived,
.
my prince.

155
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,481
Wonderful news.

156
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:37,183
Your father has interrupted his prayers
at the eastern palace to join us.

157
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,691
No doubt to commend us
on our great victory.

158
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,014
We had indications
Alamut was arming our enemies.

159
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,570
Indications?

160
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,135
You better have more than indications

161
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,721
to occupy a holy city with my troops!

162
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,014
This adventure

163
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,655
won't sit with our allies.

164
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,707
But I suppose
you didn't take that into account.

165
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,778
Don't look to your uncle, boy.

166
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,321
The decision, and its consequences,
rest with me.

167
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,152
I know you're eager to wear the crown,

168
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,897
but trust me when I tell you
you're not yet ready.

169
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,003
No man would know
better than you, Father.

170
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,140
Because your trust is something
I deeply cherish,

171
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,166
I will oversee the search
for weapons myself.

172
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,219
I vow I will not stand before you
until l hold proof of Alamut's treachery.

173
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,476
The third step is the hardest!

174
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,524
Brother! Brother!

175
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:45,098
We've uncovered signs of tunnels
on the eastern edge of the city.

176
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:46,848
I'm on my way there now.

177
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,972
But you'll miss the banquet!

178
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,208
You and Garsiv can handle Father
in my absence.

179
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,335
-You do have a gift to honor him with?
-Of course!

180
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,888
-Bis, gift!
-What?

181
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,122
It's been momentarily misplaced.

182
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:07,001
I knew you'd forget.
The prayer robe of Alamut's Regent.

183
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,227
The holiest in the eastern lands.
A gift the King will appreciate.

184
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:16,072
You fought like a champion for me,
Dastan. Glad to return the favor.

185
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,472
A rare jewel.

186
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,317
Present her to the King for me
this evening, Dastan.

187
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:27,364
Sure you really want
another wife, brother?

188
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,021
Listen to me, Dastan.

189
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,441
A marriage to the Princess assures me
the loyalty of her people.

190
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,535
Unbound to us,
she's a dangerous liability.

191
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,486
If Father doesn't approve our union,

192
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,165
I want you to end her life
with your own hand.

193
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,404
So, I'm escorted by Prince Dastan,

194
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,640
the Lion of Persia.

195
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,645
Must feel wonderful
winning such acclaim

196
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,404
for destroying such an innocent city.

197
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,458
A pleasure to meet you, too, Princess.

198
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,485
And allow me to offer that if punishing
the enemies of my king is a crime,

199
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,472
then it's one I'll gladly repeat.

200
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,504
Then you are a true prince of Persia.

201
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,902
Brutal, without honor.

202
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,375
Don't make the mistake of thinking
you know me, Princess.

203
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,928
And what more is there?

204
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,517
Wait here with Her Highness.

205
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,583
If you can manage it,

206
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:32,238
l suggest a hint of humility
when you're presented to the King.

207
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,201
For your own good.

208
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,149
You've eased Father's anger, Uncle.

209
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,938
One day, you'll have the pleasure
of being brother to the King, Dastan.

210
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,580
As long as you remember your most
important duty, you should do well.

211
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,573
And what's that?

212
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,782
Making sure his wine glass stays full.

213
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,629
I'm told that another of my sons
has joined the rank

214
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,886
of great Persian warriors.

215
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,349
We missed you, Father.

216
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:20,274
Il was praying for you
and your brothers, Dastan.

217
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,251
Family.

218
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,423
The bond between brothers,
that is the sword

219
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,283
that defends our empire.

220
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,088
And I pray that
that sword remains strong.

221
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:38,636
Il was hoping my actions would spare
our men unnecessary losses.

222
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,943
A good man would've done
as you did, Dastan,

223
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,100
acting boldly and courageously
to bring a victory and spare lives.

224
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,256
But a great man
would've stopped the attack

225
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,375
from happening at all. A great man

226
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,640
would've stopped
what he knew to be wrong,

227
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,356
no matter who was ordering it.

228
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,919
The boy I saw in that square

229
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,056
was capable of being
more than just good,

230
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,019
but of being great.

231
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:22,351
Well, in the meantime,
l have a gift for you.

232
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,628
Some questioned
the wisdom of my bringing a boy

233
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,998
from the streets into my family.

234
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,667
l saw a boy whose blood wasn't noble,

235
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,747
but whose character was.

236
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,023
A king in spirit.

237
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,544
Thank you, Father.

238
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,179
Thank you, Father.

239
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,097
May I present
the prayer robe of Alamut's Regent.

240
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,657
What can I grant you in return?

241
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,100
Roham!

242
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,225
May I present Princess Tamina.

243
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,262
Tus wishes to make a union
with her people through marriage.

244
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,482
It is my deepest wish
that this win your approval.

245
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,324
In all of my travels,

246
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:30,524
I have never looked upon
a more beautiful city, Your Highness.

247
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,721
You should have seen it before
your horde of camel-riding illiterates

248
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,387
descended upon it.

249
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,133
Clearly she will make a fine queen.

250
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:48,617
But Tus already has enough wives.

251
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,902
You, Dastan, might take fewer chances

252
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,975
if such a jewel
waited in your chambers.

253
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,279
The Princess of Alamut
will be your first wife.

254
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,121
What say you, Dastan?

255
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,308
He plunges into a hundred foes
without thought,

256
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,414
but before marriage
he stands frozen with fear.

257
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,054
And there are those
who say he is not yet wise.

258
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,839
I need a drink.

259
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,768
Stand aside! Out of my way!

260
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,358
Father.

261
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,766
God help us! The robe is poisoned!

262
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,055
Somebody help him!

263
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,309
-The robe Dastan gave him!
-Why?

264
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,182
-Somebody help him!
-Seize the murderer!

265
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,981
-Somebody help him!
-My prince, save yourself!

266
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:53,974
Seize him!

267
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,136
Move!

268
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,680
Bis!

269
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,349
Bis!

270
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:06,484
Come with me!

271
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,383
-What do you think you're doing?
-l can get us out of here.

272
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,540
You're going to need my help.

273
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,788
Come on!

274
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,571
-Close the gate!
-That way!

275
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:46,724
Close the gate!

276
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,194
Get down!

277
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,933
There! After the murderer!

278
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,841
He's on my horse! He stole my horse!

279
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,406
Aksh, come on!

280
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,566
My loyal subjects,

281
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,535
the whole world grieves at the death
of our beloved king.

282
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,639
We are all stricken by his loss.

283
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,004
That the murder came
at Prince Dastan's hand

284
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,023
only makes our pain worse.

285
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,766
I didn't murder my father.

286
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,578
That robe was given to me
by my brother.

287
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,000
Tus did this.

288
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,338
And now he stands to be crowned king.

289
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,286
I didn't kill my father.

290
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,313
I believe you.

291
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,806
You shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have let you come.

292
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,322
But you did.

293
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,139
I promised my brother I'd kill you
if he couldn't have you.

294
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,960
Well,

295
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,088
the solution would be to kiss me

296
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,621
and then kill me.

297
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,064
But I have a better solution.

298
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,596
I kill you,

299
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,371
and your problems are solved!

300
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,839
Perhaps we can find another solution.

301
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:53,105
Well, the solution would be to kiss me,
then kill me.

302
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,319
But I have a better solution.

303
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,255
-No.
-[ kill you!

304
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,424
Give back what you stole, Persian!

305
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,745
Don't!

306
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,187
-Did you see that?
-See what?

307
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,784
Go for that sword again,
and I swear I'll break your arm.

308
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,143
Again?

309
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,713
You've used up all the sand!

310
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,358
What?

311
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,866
What is this?

312
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,531
Incredible.

313
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,674
Releasing the sand

314
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,300
turns back time.

315
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,028
And only the holder of the dagger
is aware of what's happened.

316
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,970
He can go back and alter events,
change time,

317
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,677
and no one knows but him.

318
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,795
How much can it unwind?

319
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,806
-Answer me, Princess.
-You destroyed my city!

320
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,206
Our invasion wasn't
about weapon forges.

321
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,778
It was about this dagger.

322
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,588
After the battle,
Tus asked for this dagger as tribute.

323
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,741
I didn't think anything of it,
but now I see.

324
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:28,973
With it he could change anything.

325
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,986
He could change the course
of a critical moment in battle.

326
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,062
He could foresee the blade of a rival.

327
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,419
He wouldn't just be king, he'd be the
most powerful ruler Persia's ever seen.

328
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,308
Greater even than my father.

329
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:39,577
It was all about this dagger!

330
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,352
My treacherous brother
must be brought to justice,

331
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:47,085
and as such, ! have doubled
the reward for his capture.

332
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,022
Meanwhile, 1 shall strive
to protect our empire,

333
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,512
as my father would have demanded,

334
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,011
A new reign has begun.

335
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,485
-What are you doing?
-Garsiv can't be far behind us.

336
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,095
And Aksh is the most famous horse
in the empire.

337
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,077
-This will obscure his tracks.
-Tracks where? Where are you going?

338
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,214
To Avrat,
where my father will be buried.

339
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,596
You're wanted for the King's murder

340
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:10,047
and you're going to
march into his funeral

341
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,125
alongside thousands
of Persian soldiers?

342
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:15,324
Well, Nizam will be there.
He's the only one I can trust.

343
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,220
He'll see 1 was set up by Tus.

344
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:18,775
Step aside, Princess.

345
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,774
Every road to Avrat will be covered
with Persian troops.

346
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,556
I'm not taking roads. I'm going
through the Valley of the Slaves.

347
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,135
No one goes near that wasteland.

348
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,507
It's filled with murdering cutthroats.

349
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:27,635
So they say.

350
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:30,496
-Your whole plan is suicide!
-My brother murdered my father

351
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:33,159
and left his blood on my hands.
If l die trying to set that right,

352
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,591
then so be it.

353
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:40,052
So you're going to leave me here
in the middle of nowhere?

354
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,775
Noble Dastan, abandoning
a helpless woman in the wilderness!

355
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,562
What does your precious honor
have to say about that?

356
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,958
Give me the strength not to kill her.

357
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,475
Mount up. We can't be far behind him.

358
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,880
Without the right sand,
it's just another knife.

359
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,760
Not even very sharp.

360
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,824
This sand, is there more of it?

361
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,764
Of course not.

362
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,589
Well, how can I get some?

363
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,576
Try standing on your head
and holding your breath.

364
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,356
See what you were looking for, Prince?

365
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:38,572
Start walking.

366
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,295
If you can't prove to your uncle
how the dagger works,

367
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,231
why in the world would he believe you?

368
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,240
It's not your problem, Princess.

369
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,869
You know, you really walk like one.

370
00:34:56,728 --> 00:35:00,628
Head held high, chest out,
long, stomping strides.

371
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,610
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.

372
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,620
No doubt it comes from being told
since birth the world is yours,

373
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,375
and actually believing it.

374
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,478
l wasn't born in a palace like you.

375
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,820
l was born in the slums of Nasaf,

376
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,219
where I lived if 1 fought
and I clawed for it.

377
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:18,992
Then how did you become a prince?

378
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,760
The King marched into the market
one day, and he...

379
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,052
I don't know. He...

380
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,121
He found me.

381
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,825
He took me in. He gave me a family.
He gave me a home.

382
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,660
What you're looking at

383
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,881
is the walk of a man
who just lost everything.

384
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,407
Welcome to the Valley of the Slaves,
Your Highness.

385
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,089
I'm desperate for a drop of water.

386
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,946
That's more than we have, since you
emptied our canteen hours ago.

387
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,279
l wasn't born of this desert
like you Persians,

388
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,062
all shriveled and angry.

389
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,434
My constitution is much more delicate.

390
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,825
Il think you mean "spoiled."

391
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,800
The wells of Alamut are famed
for their clean, cold water.

392
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:27,038
Perhaps less time admiring your wells
and more time guarding your walls,

393
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,259
and you wouldn't be here.

394
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,016
A miracle!

395
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,957
I've silenced the Princess!

396
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,699
Tamina?

397
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:44,695
Tamina?

398
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,272
Can you hear me?

399
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,581
Yes, Dastan, I can hear you.

400
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,288
Do you know where you are, Persian?

401
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,116
And yet you enter still?

402
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,475
In the heart of Sudan,
there is a tribe of warriors

403
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,234
known as the Ngbaka.

404
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,846
They strike fear into the hearts
of all they cross.

405
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,932
The Ngbaka are masters
of the throwing knife.

406
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:34,562
Wielding blades said to have been
blessed by the Creator himself.

407
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:39,712
Their aim is so murderously accurate
they can decapitate three men

408
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,296
with one strike.

409
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,109
Oh, I wouldn't even bother doing that
if l were you. Do you know why?

410
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,323
This is Seso. He's a Ngbaka.

411
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,046
I had the good fortune of saving his life,

412
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,562
which means that he is now
enduringly indebted to me.

413
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,404
So tell me, Persian,

414
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,362
is there any good reason
why I shouldn't tell Seso

415
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,825
to put his next throw just a little higher?

416
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,970
So! This is the one, eh?

417
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,420
Yes! You were right. She's not bad.

418
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,766
She could smell a bit better, though.

419
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,152
Still, we have a deal.

420
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:03,946
Clever princess.

421
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,186
Deal? What deal?

422
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,413
-Such a noble prince!
-Such a gentle princess!

423
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,814
How taken you were
with my fainting act,

424
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,309
eagerly leaping to assist
the fallen beauty.

425
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,116
Who said you were a beauty?

426
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,540
There must be a reason
why you can't take your eyes off me.

427
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:24,378


428
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:25,562
I don't trust you.

429
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:26,967
And you're not my type.

430
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,745
I'm not some desperate slave girl.

431
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,083
I'm actually capable
of voicing my own thoughts!

432
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,572
Yeah, too many for my taste!

433
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,200
Oh, yeah.
She'll make a very nice addition.

434
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,048
What do you intend to do with her?

435
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,363
Yes, do tell him.
Can't you see how concerned he is?

436
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,115
-Give me a moment.
-Yeah.

437
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,429
It's hard for me to admit,

438
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,095
but you were right.

439
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,942
I did see what I was looking for.

440
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,965
Dastan, listen to me.

441
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:02,414
When my uncle sees the power
of this dagger, he'll believe me.

442
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,055
Dastan, I know I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

443
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,465
Oh, but your lies are so clever.

444
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,060
lam the guardian of a divine covenant.

445
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,720
-That dagger is sacred.
-Well...

446
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,712
It was being smuggled to safety
when you stole it.

447
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,560
If the dagger gets
into the wrong hands...

448
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:18,985
I will take care of your knife.

449
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:20,594
You won't want to miss this.

450
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,622
You don't understand what's at stake!

451
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,884
This is a matter for the gods, not man!

452
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,380
-Your gods, not mine.
-Come on!

453
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,120
Come on!

454
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,754
-Ostrich racing?
-Yeah. Every Tuesday and Thursday.

455
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:53,521
Whatever they lack in beauty,
they make up for in fighting spirit.

456
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,426
And the races are easy to fix.

457
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,012
I've heard all these
terrible stories of this place.

458
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,718
The bloodthirsty slaves
murdering their masters?

459
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,261
That's a good story.
It's well-told, ever-evolving.

460
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:08,721
Yeah, but, alas, untrue.

461
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,300
But the skeletons that we saw
at the front...

462
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,585
I bought those
from a gypsy in Bukhara.

463
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,624
I crafted our lurid reputation

464
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,290
in order to fend off
the most insidious evil

465
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,813
that's been lurking
this forsaken country of ours.

466
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,412
You know what I'm talking about?

467
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,573
Taxes.

468
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,446
And all these Persians

469
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,794
with their armies, their fortresses,
their roads.

470
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,049
Who pays for it all?
The small businessman!

471
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,241
See, that's why I started
a little campaign

472
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,170
to spread some false notoriety.

473
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:42,243
I spread it like a venerable disease
in a Turkish harem.

474
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:04,487
Behold the mighty ostrich!

475
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,173
Come on, my beauty!

476
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,060
I love this!

477
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,683
And the tax collectors steer clear of me
and my customers.

478
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,834
Everybody's happy.

479
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,037
Hey! Get the girls on!

480
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,935
Get the girls on! Come on!
Crowd control!

481
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,734
Don't just stand there! Run, don't walk!

482
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,412
If you drop anything, you pay for it!
It's out of your wages!

483
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:46,195
Now, don't look at me like that.
You know what I'm talking about!

484
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,254
Do your job! Crowd control! Thank you!

485
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,007
You know, I think our little arrangement

486
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,725
is gonna work out very well,
young man.

487
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:56,996
Don't touch!

488
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,325
She's a lively one!
Where did you find her?

489
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:02,956
In the slave markets of Lur.

490
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,371
l was headed to Iraq
to trade her for a camel

491
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,026
when she attacked me.

492
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,175
The camels are safer.

493
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:12,287
Noble Sheikh Amar,
l appreciate your hospitality.

494
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:13,974
You run a fine establishment,

495
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,268
but if you could give me
the supplies that we...

496
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,360
You know something, Persian?

497
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,212
You bear a remarkable resemblance
to the disgraced prince

498
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,148
who fled after murdering the King.

499
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:35,548
Have I told you about the Ngbaka?

500
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,768
-Yes, you have.
-Yeah. Nothing beats a good story, eh?

501
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,140
But yours, however,
trading her in for a camel?

502
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,973
Please! 1 mean, look at her.
She's worth at least two.

503
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,574
And as for you, young man,

504
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,560
did you know your brother's offered
a reward for you

505
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,258
which, quite frankly, between you
and me, borders on the obscene?

506
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,014
I'd trade in my own mother
for that kind of gold.

507
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,635
What? You didn't know
what she was like.

508
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,533
Take him down to the Persian outpost.

509
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,174
Wait, wait, wait. Look. That...

510
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:09,489
-Nice knife.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

511
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,609
It's nothing.

512
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,772
-No, look, that's worthless!
-Really?

513
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,457
Melt it down for the jewels.

514
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,322
What's the boy doing?

515
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,042
No, you might kill a bird!

516
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:52,288
Hey! Over here!

517
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:04,473
I wouldn't do that if 1 were you!

518
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:05,868
Get to the tunnel!

519
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,602
Look at this! That's it!

520
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,674
No more fermented goat's milk
after the third race! You hear me?

521
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:13,973
Get after him! Come on!

522
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,738
-The gate!
-Get him!

523
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,251
Stop!

524
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:25,021
Lift the lever! It'll open the gate!

525
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:26,516
-Give me the dagger!
-What? You're...

526
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,124
This is not the time! Just lift that lever!

527
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:29,379
Give me the dagger!

528
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,731
Don't think it didn't cross my mind.

529
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:42,626
Move, Princess!

530
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:44,237
Persian!

531
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:45,404
Dastan!

532
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:48,345
Persian!

533
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,285
Looking for this? Key?

534
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,391
Next time, you!

535
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:18,123
They've all come
for my father's funeral.

536
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,606
There are 100 Persian soldiers
watching that gate.

537
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,329
Maybe more.
If you want to stay close to this dagger,

538
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:36,212
you're going to have
to help me into Avrat.

539
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,776
All these foreign dignitaries,

540
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,041
I'm guessing you know a few.

541
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,200
Couldn't you have found
somebody lighter?

542
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,953
The Mughals of the Hindu Kush
are a noble people.

543
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,719
You should be honored.

544
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,321
Oh, yes. Terribly.

545
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,261
Dastan, where's the dagger?

546
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:24,373
You're welcome to search me for it.

547
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,375
You'll have to be very thorough.

548
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,937
Tus isn't here.
He must still be in Alamut.

549
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:45,722
The sand that fuels the dagger,

550
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,766
there's more of it hidden
somewhere in Alamut, isn't there?

551
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,830
That's why Tus stays there.

552
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,282
That's what he's got our army
searching for.

553
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,533
Il have to get a message
to my uncle to meet me.

554
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:57,647
That's impossible.

555
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,625
Difficult, not impossible.

556
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:02,038
Or more proof you're insane.

557
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,989
Then why do you look so impressed?

558
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,245
Out of the way! Make way!

559
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:12,645
-Turn around.
-What?

560
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:13,717
Turn around!

561
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,243
You used to buy those for me
when I was a boy.

562
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,036
You used to spit the seeds at Garsiv.

563
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:34,877
You should not have
brought me here, Dastan.

564
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,479
l had no choice, Uncle.

565
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:37,907
Follow me.

566
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,794
I didn't kill Father.

567
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,133
You know I would never do
such a thing.

568
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,038
Your actions speak otherwise.

569
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,014
But I had no choice but to flee.

570
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,314
Tus gave me that cloak.

571
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,320
-He was the one who poisoned it.
-Dastan.

572
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,888
Well, he's not here, is he?

573
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:18,073
At his father's funeral.
Instead, he remains in Alamut.

574
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,462
Our allies will see
our invasion was just.

575
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,834
The search for
Alamut's weapons forges is important.

576
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,962
Yes, but not if there are none.

577
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,560
The invasion of Alamut was a lie.

578
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:30,552
Tus is after power.
That's why he murdered Father.

579
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:32,812
And now he searches not for weapons,

580
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:36,283
but for the sand
that fuels a mystical device.

581
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:40,005
This is why you brought me here,
Dastan? Mystical devices?

582
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,391
Do you remember, after the battle,

583
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:43,352
you stopped Tus
from taking the dagger I'd won?

584
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:47,522
That dagger is the reason
he invaded Alamut.

585
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,163
This dagger, you have it with you?

586
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,499
Yes.

587
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,948
It has incredible powers.

588
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,154
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?

589
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,966
What? No, it was in there.

590
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:16,596
Then where's your so-called evidence?

591
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:19,849
Tamina.

592
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:21,578


593
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,712
Your hands are burned.

594
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,683
Yes.

595
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,733
From trying to pull
the poisoned cloak off your father.

596
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,498
-ls something wrong, Dastan?
-No, no.

597
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,884
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.

598
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,731
It's just that

599
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,741
Tus is my brother.

600
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,176
How could he betray me like this?

601
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,465
Il can't say, Dastan. Perhaps he

602
00:51:57,715 --> 00:51:59,265
never respected you as you deserve,

603
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,126
only saw you as someone he could use.

604
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:02,965
Someone to keep his wine glass filled?

605
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,000
My service to your father was different.

606
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,287
We shared the same blood, Dastan.

607
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,752
How many times did Father speak
of you saving him from that lion?

608
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,897
-That was his favorite story.
-One of many, yes.

609
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,893
No, that was his favorite.

610
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,215
I'm afraid you're
speaking in riddles, Dastan.

611
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,455
Wait! Dastan!

612
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:58,608
Over here!

613
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,820
Murderer!

614
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,769
I didn't kill Father!

615
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:37,173
Out of the way! Get out of the way!

616
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,124
What are you going to do now?

617
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,125
Where is he?

618
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,746
Where is he?

619
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,781
Hey.

620
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:56,926
Garsiv.

621
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,944
I didn't kill Father.

622
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,221
Then God will pardon you

623
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,063
after your head rolls.

624
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,578
Not fighting with sticks anymore,
little brother.

625
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:28,651
That's all you got?

626
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:48,985
Your Majesty.

627
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,516
! thought you were staying in Alamut.

628
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,171
Tell me about Dastan, Uncle.

629
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,305
Dastan came to Avrat to kill me.

630
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,194
In the marketplace. I just got away.

631
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:04,655
Tus, my death would weaken
.
your young reign.

632
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,286
Dastan hopes to stir a rebellion.

633
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,642
-He wants the throne?
-l fear so, my lord.

634
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:18,551
Putting Dastan on trial would
only give him a stage for his sedition.

635
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:22,493
My advice would be to avoid a trial.

636
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,790
Don't bring him back to Nasaf alive.

637
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,920
Whatever Dastan's crimes,

638
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:41,112
a public trial will best communicate
the king I hope to be.

639
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,562
Strong, honoring the rule of law.

640
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,462
We are not savages.

641
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,636
You grow more a king every day.

642
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:54,725
Dastan must be found.
He must be brought to justice.

643
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,615
I need to speak with our guests.

644
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,810
Oh, about them, my lord.
Their practices are unusual.

645
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:13,064
The servants have seen things,
heard strange sounds.

646
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:15,737
Last week, one of the horses vanished.

647
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:18,403
Well, just make sure
the servants keep their mouths shut.

648
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:20,072
Or I promise you,

649
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:23,332
they will vanish, as well.

650
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,437
l have another task for you, Hassansin,

651
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,839
but you'll have to be quick.
Your prey has a head start.

652
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,782
You brought what I requested?

653
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,138
These practices,
they don't interfere with your skills?

654
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,803
In the trance
we can see visions of our future.

655
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,108
Visions of death.

656
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:56,285
A destiny

657
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,667
and a curse.

658
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,605
In that trance, we can find anything,

659
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,044
including your nephew, Prince Dastan.

660
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,524
Then I hope you shall see more death,

661
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,387
soon.

662
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,363
Get down! It's a Persian patrol!

663
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,048
Garsiv.

664
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:09,658
What aren't you telling me?

665
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,512
The tribesmen left.

666
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,797
Maybe they tired of your penchant
for lies and backstabbing.

667
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,074
I had no choice but to leave you.

668
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,893
I take it your uncle didn't listen.

669
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,598
It wasn't Tus that killed my father.
It was Nizam.

670
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:29,167
-Your uncle?
-His hands were burned.

671
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,433
He said it happened trying to pull off
the cloak that killed my father.

672
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:33,986
I've gone over and over it in my mind.

673
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,770
He never touched the cloak.
He must have handled it before.

674
01:01:39,763 --> 01:01:41,573
It was Nizam who poisoned it.

675
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,429
What good does turning back
a few moments of time do my uncle?

676
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,072
None.

677
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,017
He murdered my father
for more than just a dagger.

678
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,243
What aren't you telling me?

679
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,815
You know, you've got quick hands.

680
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,377
But so dol.

681
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,569
If you want it back,
you tell me everything.

682
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:00,846
No more games, no more lies.

683
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,685
Can we get out of here?

684
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:24,694
Only a princess would think
she could outrun a sandstorm.

685
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:32,593
Nizam's coming to kill us.
He needs me dead.

686
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:35,457
I need to know why.

687
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,850
In Alamut rests the beating heart
of all life on Earth,

688
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:47,806
the Sandglass of the Gods.

689
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,629
Long ago,
the gods looked down on man

690
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,801
and saw nothing
but greed and treachery.

691
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,401
And so they sent
a great sandstorm to destroy all,

692
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,946
wipe clean the face of the Earth.

693
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:04,096
But one young girl begged the gods
to give mankind another chance,

694
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,644
offering her life in exchange.

695
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,621
Seeing the purity within,

696
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,500
the gods were reminded
of man's potential for good.

697
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,352
And so they swept the sands
into the Sandglass.

698
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:35,653
The dagger was given to the girl
who saved man,

699
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,820
making her the first Guardian.

700
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:42,369
The dagger blade is the only thing
that can pierce the Sandglass

701
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,459
and remove the Sands of Time,

702
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,081
but the handle only holds one minute.

703
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:49,544
What if one were to place the dagger
in the Sandglass

704
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,699
and press the jewel button
at the same time?

705
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,528
Sand would flow through endlessly.

706
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,252
You could turn back time
as far as you like.

707
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,138
Yes, but it is forbidden.

708
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,207
When my father was a boy,

709
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,053
Nizam saved his life hunting.

710
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,560
One day, the two princes
were stalking a beautiful buck.

711
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:17,071
But they were unaware
of a lioness stalking them.

712
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:19,350
Nizam saved Sharaman.

713
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:22,959
My father told us the story
over and over again.

714
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,980
I don't understand.

715
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:29,096
Nizam wishes to go back in time
and undo what he did.

716
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,939
Not save my father. Let him die.

717
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:34,716
Then he would be king for a lifetime,

718
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:38,022
and my brothers would never be born.

719
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:46,725
Storm's passed.

720
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:19,025
Dastan, the sands contained within
the Sandglass are incredibly powerful.

721
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,673
Opening the dagger while
it's inside the glass breaks the seal.

722
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,008
That would destroy the Sandglass,

723
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,903
causing it to crack and shatter.

724
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,512
The Sands of Time
would no longer be contained.

725
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:38,312
And they would carry
the gods' wrath with them once more,

726
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,311
destroying everything in their path.

727
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,321
And all of mankind would pay
for Nizam's treachery.

728
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:51,506
This is all that would be left of us.

729
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:56,670
The secret Guardian Temple
outside Alamut is a sanctuary,

730
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,020
the one place
the dagger can be hidden safely,

731
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:01,252
the only way to stop this Armageddon.

732
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,533
That's the truth, Dastan.

733
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,120
Give me back the dagger

734
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,317
so that I can take it there.

735
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:16,895
Il can't do that.

736
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:22,314
I'm coming with you.

737
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,683
You're going to help me?

738
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,527
We could sit here and chat,
or you could get on the horse.

739
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:47,679
Our journey is blessed.

740
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,521
We'll stop for water and push
for the mountain pass by nightfall.

741
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,339
You enjoy telling me what to do.

742
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:57,315
Only because you're so good
at following orders.

743
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,509
Yeah. Don't press your luck.

744
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,260
Persian!

745
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,369
We parted under
such rushed circumstances,

746
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,371
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

747
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,662
We've been tracking you for a week!

748
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:27,937
That little riot you started,
it went on for two days!

749
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,479
My beloved racetrack,

750
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,788
all washed away like footprints in sand.

751
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,432
You see Anita there? Hmm?
Look at her.

752
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,560
She's all that's left
of my gaming empire.

753
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:42,346
And no matter your skills
as a promoter,

754
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,613
you can't organize an ostrich race

755
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:48,079
with just one ostrich!

756
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:49,587
Am I right?

757
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:50,666
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

758
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,717
Yes, sir. Come with me.

759
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:03,265
Did you know that ostriches
have suicidal tendencies?

760
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,391
Look at this poor thing.

761
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:09,506
She used to be a grand champion.

762
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:11,979
Now I have to watch her night and day

763
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:14,188
to make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

764
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:21,927
So, it occurred to me

765
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,118
the only way to recoup
my tragic losses was to track down

766
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:26,618
-the two young lovers...
-Sheikh Amar.

767
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,613
..who cast this dark cloud upon me.

768
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,304
Yes! I'm going to need
the price on your heads!

769
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,953
Your brother will be
very pleased to see...

770
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,067
It's sand dervishes, Persian.

771
01:08:39,314 --> 01:08:40,575
They're common as camel turd
in the desert.

772
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,033
-No, Sheikh Amar, listen to me!
-I'd rather not.

773
01:08:44,886 --> 01:08:46,376
-Nice knife.
-Noble Sheikh,

774
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,292
we are on a sacred journey
to the Temple...

775
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:49,621
Temple, the Temple.

776
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,012
There's nothing more sacred
than Persian gold!

777
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,300
Give me the dagger.
There are too many of them.

778
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:48,024
You can't kill them all.
You want to live? Give me the dagger!

779
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,000
Give me the dagger!

780
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,146
Persian, how...

781
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:26,644
How did you do that?

782
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:30,545
Instinct.

783
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:34,543
What?

784
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:45,323
We have to get out of here.

785
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:50,722
What happened last night?

786
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,946
Those vipers were controlled
by Hassansins.

787
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,239
Hassansins?

788
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,317
For years, they were the covert
killing force of the Persian kings

789
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,318
until my father
ordered them disbanded.

790
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,777
Nizam must have disobeyed
my father's orders

791
01:11:01,124 --> 01:11:02,353
and kept them intact.

792
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,728
This secret government killing activity,

793
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:06,634
that's why I don't pay taxes.

794
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:07,943
We can't stop.

795
01:11:08,131 --> 01:11:10,001
Well, perhaps you can't, but we can.

796
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,029
We could use your help
getting to the Temple.

797
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:15,279
By crossing the Hindu Kush
with a storm blowing?

798
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,884
You attract trouble
like flies around rotting mango,

799
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,291
-and you're insane...
-There's gold at the Temple.

800
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,860
More than 10 horses can carry.

801
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:24,953
Tax free.

802
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:26,825
Sir!

803
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:58,568
Do you have any idea
where you're going?

804
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:01,191
I memorized this path as a child.

805
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:03,131
Every princess must.

806
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:04,993
It's sacred.

807
01:12:08,224 --> 01:12:09,484
It's here!

808
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:19,941
The sanctuary.

809
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:22,356
The one place the dagger
can be hidden safely.

810
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,559
Il was expecting
golden statues, waterfalls.

811
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,710
Give me back the dagger
so that I can take it there.

812
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,481
Don't cut yourself, Princess.

813
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,026
Hey! Here!

814
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:08,134
Not long dead.
Last night maybe. Tortured first.

815
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:12,205
-Hassansin.
-Nizam knows this place.

816
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:14,299
All dead.

817
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,460
The entire village. My gold?

818
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:20,684
Where are you going?

819
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,503
There is only one way to stop all of this.

820
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,495
-What? What?
-To make sure the dagger is safe.

821
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,577
The Temple holds the stone
the dagger came from.

822
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,039
What Temple?
This is a pile of stones and rocks!

823
01:13:29,372 --> 01:13:30,832
The first thing we learned,
if all else fails,

824
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,333
put the dagger back into the stone.

825
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,791
The stone will envelop it.
Pull it into the mountain,

826
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:36,434
returning it to the gods.

827
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,697
The original promise

828
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,220
must be paid.

829
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,388
What promise?

830
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:55,128
The gods must take back the life
they spared.

831
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,827
That'll mean you'll die.

832
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,531
Stay there! Stay there!

833
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,960
-Stay there!
-Listen to me. Listen to me!

834
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:14,619
Give me your sword!

835
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,600
Give me your sword,
or do you forsake even that honor?

836
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:17,786
There are bodies down there.

837
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,643
Murdered by Hassansins,
on Nizam's order! He's the traitor!

838
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:22,456
Hassansins no longer exist!

839
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:24,125
You always thought you were so clever.

840
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:25,757
-No, this is no trick, Garsiv.
-Sir!

841
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,062
All dead inside, sir. More in the village.

842
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,459
-There's one in there and...
-Stay there!

843
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:38,268
Nizam wants me dead.

844
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:41,588
Wants me silenced.
A trial would be too public.

845
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,739
You know this?
He said as much, didn't he?

846
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:50,935
I know it hasn't been easy
between us, Garsiv,

847
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:52,764
but still,

848
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,282
we are brothers.

849
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,400
Touching words with my sword
at your throat.

850
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,209
You often questioned why Father
spent so much time in prayer.

851
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:01,625
Before he died, he told me
that the bond between brothers

852
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,737
is the sword that defends our empire.

853
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:06,403
He was praying that
that sword remain strong.

854
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,469
Why would I go into Avrat
for Father's funeral

855
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:10,378
when I knew it was so dangerous?

856
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,598
Nizam recommended your death.

857
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:23,453
Tus disagreed,
ordered you brought back alive.

858
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:25,046
Nizam wants me dead,

859
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:28,415
and he's hired the Hassansins
to make sure that that does happen.

860
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,288
He's afraid of what I might say

861
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,382
and who I might tell.

862
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,531
Tell me, brother.

863
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:45,240
Garsiv?

864
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:51,710
Wait. Garsiv!

865
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:54,232
Garsiv.

866
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:57,972
Hassansins!

867
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,053
Shut up! Shut up!

868
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,744
Protect the dagger!

869
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:51,646
Persian! Behind you!

870
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,244
Tamina!

871
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:05,683
Tamina!

872
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:07,585
Forget them! Throw these!

873
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,145
Find her!

874
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,184
Hey! Hey, over here!

875
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:23,237
You know what they say
about men with big swords?

876
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:39,967
Tamina! Let me do it.

877
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:44,341
Only a Guardian can return the dagger.

878
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:47,154
This isn't something
you can do, Dastan.

879
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:51,222
I'm ready for this.

880
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:54,819
I'm not.

881
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:11,078
Tamina!

882
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:04,899
Out! Enough! Out!

883
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:25,323
Garsiv!

884
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:27,027
Garsiv.

885
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:28,929
Dastan, I'm sorry.

886
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:34,995
Save the empire.

887
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:39,317
Brother.

888
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,476
Brother.

889
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:46,571
Where is the dagger?

890
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:48,863
It's gone.

891
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,749
"Protect the dagger,
no matter the consequences."

892
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:54,865
That was my sacred calling.

893
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:57,708
That was my destiny.

894
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,540
We make our own destiny, Princess.

895
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,366
We'll get it back.

896
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:44,437
We're gonna need another horse.

897
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:48,753
Where will you go?

898
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:50,565
To Alamut.

899
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:56,302
Nizam will use that dagger
to pierce the Sandglass,

900
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,995
and he has to be stopped.

901
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,410
"And he has to be stopped.
He has to be stopped.”

902
01:21:00,756 --> 01:21:01,896
That's good...

903
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:05,863
What?

904
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:09,476
A knife thrower with a conscience.

905
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:32,719
Our friends in the palace say
the Persians have broken through

906
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,630
to the first level of the tunnels.

907
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:37,353
They'll reach the Sandglass
within hours.

908
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,780
Nizam's keeping the dagger
in the High Temple,

909
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:43,525
guarded by some sort of demon
covered in spikes.

910
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:46,109
The Hassansin that killed my brother.

911
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,952
It's the only thing that stands
between us and the dagger.

912
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,455
No man can stand
within 20 yards of him and live.

913
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:55,478
Some don't need to get that close.

914
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:18,121
Spare some water, sire?

915
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:28,866
You sure about this?

916
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,305
-l owe the boy.
-What?

917
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:34,534
You're a Ngbaka!
Scourge of the Numidian plain.

918
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:37,227
Me? I'm a slightly
dishonorable entrepreneur.

919
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:40,516
This nobility business
is not the cloth we're cut from.

920
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,006
Hurry!

921
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:44,851
My friend, has anyone ever told you

922
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,114
that you talk too much?

923
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:56,134
Come on.

924
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,280
Have I told you about the Ngbaka?

925
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:49,834
Yes, you have.

926
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:51,712
l hope your brother
listens to you, Persian.

927
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:03,173
He's here.

928
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:04,768
Seal every gate!

929
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:06,326
Find him!

930
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:42,469
-It's clear.
-Dastan, I don't think...

931
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:46,183
I don't think you should do this.

932
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:48,469
Is that concern I hear?

933
01:26:49,438 --> 01:26:51,548
-Caution.
-Sprinkled with concern.

934
01:26:52,107 --> 01:26:53,837
You flatter yourself, Prince.

935
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:56,889
And you used to be
a better liar, Princess.

936
01:26:58,013 --> 01:26:59,943
Perhaps I'm out of practice.

937
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:03,636
This won't be the last time
we'll be together.

938
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:16,732
-Where is the dagger?
-You Persian bureaucrats.

939
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:18,892
Such soft hands.

940
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:29,816
It's been found, my lord.

941
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:31,722
The Sandglass?

942
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:35,611
I don't have the dagger.

943
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:39,049
Leave me.

944
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:41,318
Hello, Tus.

945
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:43,447
Dastan!

946
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,059
-We need to talk.
-Then talk.

947
01:27:47,963 --> 01:27:49,893
-Alone.
-Wait outside the chamber.

948
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:52,642
Now!

949
01:27:54,803 --> 01:27:56,263
We are brothers, are we not?

950
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:00,023
The robe that killed Father
was poisoned by Nizam.

951
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,504
Nizam? You're mad.

952
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:03,410
Who gave you the robe, Tus?

953
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:05,545
Who gave you the robe?

954
01:28:06,515 --> 01:28:08,295
You trust him, as did I.

955
01:28:08,984 --> 01:28:10,884
But Alamut wasn't supplying
our enemies with weapons.

956
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:12,209
Nizam lied to us.

957
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:14,116
Why would he do such a thing?
What could he gain?

958
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:16,506
Listen to me carefully.

959
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:19,209
Beneath the streets of the city
lies an ancient force.

960
01:28:19,528 --> 01:28:22,138
A container holding
the fabled Sands of Time.

961
01:28:23,265 --> 01:28:24,845
Nizam wishes to use it
to corrupt history.

962
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,000
He wants to turn back time
and make himself king.

963
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:30,217
"Sands of Time"?

964
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:33,212
-Heresies, Dastan. Pagan madness.
-No.

965
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:35,778
I've seen its power
with my own eyes, Tus.

966
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:37,721
And Nizam discovered
its resting place.

967
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,939
If we don't stop him,
our world could end.

968
01:28:40,749 --> 01:28:42,059
If you're going to kill me,

969
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,214
best you do it now.

970
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:51,668
This is no ordinary dagger.

971
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:54,521
You press the jewel on its hilt

972
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,031
and you will see.

973
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:01,968
I should have had the strength
to do this before we invaded the city.

974
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:04,110
What are you talking about?

975
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:06,203
To act on what I know is right,

976
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,545
no matter the consequences.

977
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:22,701
-The soldiers remain on...
-Stay where you are!

978
01:29:29,998 --> 01:29:31,577
He took his own life.

979
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:35,522
Then God have mercy on the traitor,
for he chose the path of the coward.

980
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:39,145
We both know
Dastan was many things,

981
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:41,084
but not a coward.

982
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,612
"This is no ordinary dagger.

983
01:29:46,915 --> 01:29:49,845
"Press the jewel on its hilt
and you will see."

984
01:30:11,306 --> 01:30:12,705
..no matter the consequences.

985
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:15,065
Stop!

986
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:18,044
A moment ago
you died before my eyes.

987
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:21,759
You pressed it.

988
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,267
How did you know I would?

989
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:27,367
Because we are brothers.

990
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,553
On the day we left for war,

991
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:37,045
our father told me a true king
considers the advice of counsel,

992
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:40,322
but always listens to his heart.

993
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,850
You shouldn't have had to go so far
for me to believe you.

994
01:30:45,307 --> 01:30:47,447
Your Majesty,
the soldiers tell me that...

995
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,554
l see that Dastan has indeed returned.

996
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,317
Tus, remember what I told you!

997
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:04,794
No! A moment.

998
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:09,494
Poor Tus. So eager for the crown.

999
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:15,326
And you, Dastan, always charging in.

1000
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:17,497
So desperate to prove

1001
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:22,098
you're more than something
the King scraped off the streets.

1002
01:31:24,346 --> 01:31:26,016
What a glorious mess we are.

1003
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:30,056
It seems the bond between brothers

1004
01:31:30,919 --> 01:31:33,409
is no longer the sword
that defends our empire.

1005
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:35,789
Yes!

1006
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:01,007
He was one of us.

1007
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:05,191
He was a priest of the Temple.

1008
01:32:06,154 --> 01:32:08,814
That's how Nizam discovered
the existence of the Sandglass.

1009
01:32:09,424 --> 01:32:11,764
They've corrupted the Guardians.
Infected us.

1010
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:14,437
We're no longer pure.

1011
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:17,641
We must hurry.

1012
01:32:26,241 --> 01:32:27,351
Pulley.

1013
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:28,969
The pulley!

1014
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:30,376
Now!

1015
01:32:33,815 --> 01:32:36,004
The Guardians built passageways
underneath the city

1016
01:32:36,351 --> 01:32:37,871
as secret access to the Sandglass.

1017
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,608
If we move fast enough,
we can get there before Nizam.

1018
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:09,128
That will lead us down
to the Sandglass chamber.

1019
01:33:11,186 --> 01:33:12,585
There is only one safe path.

1020
01:33:14,122 --> 01:33:15,022
Faster!

1021
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,004
Follow in my footsteps.

1022
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:41,550
Nothing can touch the surface
other than where I step.

1023
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:05,342
Run, Dastan!

1024
01:34:06,374 --> 01:34:07,273
Run!

1025
01:34:16,284 --> 01:34:17,513
Dastan!

1026
01:37:04,118 --> 01:37:05,018
Nizam!

1027
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:09,245
You murdered your own family.

1028
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,830
Sharaman was your brother!

1029
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:12,592
And my curse.

1030
01:37:15,863 --> 01:37:16,943
l looked up to you.

1031
01:37:20,401 --> 01:37:21,510
Dastan!

1032
01:37:21,703 --> 01:37:25,303
I never understood why my brother
brought trash into the palace.

1033
01:37:26,107 --> 01:37:27,777
Enjoy the gutter, Dastan.

1034
01:37:28,643 --> 01:37:30,223
It's where you'll stay under my reign.

1035
01:37:41,656 --> 01:37:42,556
Tamina!

1036
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:47,289
Nizam! Don't use the dagger
to undo your past!

1037
01:37:47,729 --> 01:37:49,659
-It will unleash...
-Unleash what?

1038
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:51,984
God's wrath? Hell itself?

1039
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:58,437
Don't do this!

1040
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:17,259
Stop him! If the glass shatters,
the world dies with it.

1041
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:22,393
It's not my destiny, it's yours.
It always has been.

1042
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,598
-Let me go.
-l won't.

1043
01:38:26,868 --> 01:38:29,178
-Let me go.
-I'm not letting you go!

1044
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:32,214
I wish we could have been together.

1045
01:38:33,775 --> 01:38:34,674
No!

1046
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:37,563
No! No!

1047
01:38:40,548 --> 01:38:41,858
-Dastan!
-No!

1048
01:38:42,517 --> 01:38:45,237
Tamina! No!

1049
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:52,291
No!

1050
01:38:53,995 --> 01:38:54,894
No!

1051
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:17,403
Dastan!

1052
01:39:18,553 --> 01:39:19,863
Tamina!

1053
01:39:53,788 --> 01:39:55,017
Family.

1054
01:40:34,562 --> 01:40:35,702
Prince Dastan!

1055
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:37,431
Prince Dastan!

1056
01:40:38,466 --> 01:40:40,016
Bis? You're here!

1057
01:40:40,268 --> 01:40:41,528
Of course I'm here.

1058
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:44,293
Our men have surrounded
Alamut's palace.

1059
01:40:44,972 --> 01:40:45,962
The battle is over.

1060
01:40:46,474 --> 01:40:47,644
Not yet.

1061
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:57,250
Wait!

1062
01:41:02,189 --> 01:41:03,359
Wait!

1063
01:41:07,828 --> 01:41:08,908
Wait.

1064
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:12,859
Brave soldiers of Persia,

1065
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:15,924
we have been deceived
into attacking this holy city!

1066
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:19,934
Alamut has no weapon forges!

1067
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:21,273
Dastan!

1068
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:23,576
Have you gone mad?

1069
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:27,888
I cannot stand silent in the face
of treachery. This war was set up

1070
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:30,499
by one trusted above all else,

1071
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,315
our Uncle Nizam!

1072
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,220
Dastan has fought hard today,

1073
01:41:34,488 --> 01:41:35,628
perhaps too hard!

1074
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:38,403
What he needs now is to get out
from under this burning sun to rest,

1075
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:39,933
gather his wits!

1076
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:43,575
The weapons we found are forgeries!

1077
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,861
There are no weapons here, Uncle,
and you know it!

1078
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:49,980
And the spy who supposedly
intercepted them was hired by you

1079
01:41:50,504 --> 01:41:53,114
to persuade all of us to invade Alamut!

1080
01:41:53,507 --> 01:41:56,027
What is this, Dastan?
Victor's remorse?

1081
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:59,160
You yourself led the attack!
Brought us this great triumph!

1082
01:42:01,382 --> 01:42:03,462
I should never have
let the attack happen.

1083
01:42:06,187 --> 01:42:08,437
I knew in my heart that it was wrong.

1084
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:12,865
It will never be you.

1085
01:42:14,028 --> 01:42:15,318
You will never be king.

1086
01:42:16,197 --> 01:42:17,507
You don't have the heart.

1087
01:42:18,065 --> 01:42:21,315
You will die in the shadow
of a great man.

1088
01:42:27,108 --> 01:42:29,768
Get him down from there before he
makes an even bigger fool of himself!

1089
01:42:30,277 --> 01:42:33,967
Tus! Before you left Nasaf,
Father told you this,

1090
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:36,265
that a true king
considers the advice of counsel,

1091
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:39,070
but he always listens to his own heart.

1092
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:42,164
Father and I were alone.

1093
01:42:42,423 --> 01:42:43,763
-How could you know that?
-He was right.

1094
01:42:44,325 --> 01:42:46,545
He knows us,
and he knows what we're capable of.

1095
01:42:47,028 --> 01:42:49,578
-Just listen to your heart.
-He defies your order

1096
01:42:50,264 --> 01:42:51,754
in the attack
and now wants to turn back.

1097
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,339
Tus.

1098
01:42:54,969 --> 01:42:56,109
Take measure here.

1099
01:43:09,717 --> 01:43:10,857
The spy knows the truth.

1100
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:13,299
Find the spy! Bring him to me!

1101
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:15,704
We'll wring it from him!

1102
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:55,190
You had what every man
could ever dream of.

1103
01:43:55,496 --> 01:43:58,106
Love, respect, and family.

1104
01:44:00,301 --> 01:44:02,671
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?

1105
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,730
Princess of Alamut,

1106
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:44,450
Il was misled to attack your city.

1107
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:50,059
Forgive me, Highness.
Let me try to make amends.

1108
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,960
It would be to our mutual advantage

1109
01:45:02,329 --> 01:45:05,959
that our nations be united
by a bond stronger than friendship.

1110
01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:08,244
Marriage.

1111
01:45:10,004 --> 01:45:14,344
Your marriage, to one who is both
conqueror and savior of your city.

1112
01:45:20,214 --> 01:45:21,114
Dastan.

1113
01:45:22,616 --> 01:45:26,076
Royal blood or not,
he's every bit a son to our father.

1114
01:45:26,887 --> 01:45:28,666
Every bit a brother to Garsiv and me.

1115
01:45:29,657 --> 01:45:31,407
A true prince of Persia.

1116
01:45:36,797 --> 01:45:39,107
Get up there before I take your place.

1117
01:45:44,905 --> 01:45:46,335
Hello, Princess.

1118
01:45:48,709 --> 01:45:52,369
It is customary to accompany
a proposal with gifts,

1119
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:56,013
but I was surprised,
and, alas, I'm unprepared.

1120
01:45:57,618 --> 01:45:59,318
l have nothing for you,

1121
01:46:00,454 --> 01:46:03,884
save that which was already yours.

1122
01:46:15,769 --> 01:46:18,519
Walk with me, Prince Dastan.

1123
01:46:27,248 --> 01:46:29,737
How can I trust the man
that breached the walls of my city?

1124
01:46:30,718 --> 01:46:33,818
I'm starting to think I'm no longer the
same man who breached those walls.

1125
01:46:34,288 --> 01:46:36,918
That's a short time for a man
to change so much.

1126
01:46:37,324 --> 01:46:38,523
Perhaps.

1127
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:45,780
It sounds as if
you've discovered something here.

1128
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:47,750
What might that be?

1129
01:46:48,102 --> 01:46:49,882
A new spiritual awareness.

1130
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:52,624
-A destiny?
-Yes, exactly.

1131
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:56,221
But I believe we make
our own destiny, Princess.

1132
01:46:57,044 --> 01:46:59,354
You have an unfortunate
lack of curiosity.

1133
01:46:59,713 --> 01:47:01,413
No doubt one of my many flaws.

1134
01:47:01,682 --> 01:47:03,581
Please don't mock me, Prince.

1135
01:47:04,184 --> 01:47:07,724
Oh, I hardly think we know each other
well enough for that, Princess.

1136
01:47:08,989 --> 01:47:10,249
But I look forward

1137
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:12,265
to the day that we do.
