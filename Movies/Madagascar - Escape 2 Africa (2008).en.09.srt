1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:05,702
- I'm Mark Swift, one of the producers.
- Mireille Soria, producer.

2
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:09,643
Tom McGrath, director, co-writer.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,897
And Eric Darnell,
another director, co-writer.

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,186
The other 12 producers and directors
couldn't make it.

5
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:22,978
The boy in the moon is actually
Mr. Jeffrey Katzenberg at a young age.

6
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,774
Bernie Mac. I love Bernie.

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:00,492
We were able to use Ben Stiller's son
for some of these vocalizations

8
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,934
of the baby Alex lion.

9
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,874
The rattle used to be a zebra rattle.

10
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,437
And baby Alex bit the butt
of the zebra rattle and the dad said,

11
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,871
"That's a bad habit."

12
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,639
But it seemed more appropriate
for the story that it was a lion rattle.

13
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,520
Yeah. We wanted to stay away
from food issues.

14
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:28,297
Setting up this idea that,
just like lions in the real world,

15
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:32,856
in this world you have to sort of
be tough and fight your way to the top.

16
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,270
It's not a Manifest Destiny
situation here.

17
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,136
There's Alec Baldwin's character.

18
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,528
Very much a coincidence
that they have the same hair style.

19
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,147
Actually, a lot of baby Alex,

20
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,676
it is Ben's son, Quinn,
but also Mark's son, Declan.

21
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,664
- Yeah.
- Baby Declan.

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,100
We went about 50 times to record
the six lines that he did.

23
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,967
No, he does a great job.

24
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,982
He's got a real future.

25
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,515
l hear he's turned into quite the diva.

26
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,241
He was asking about his credit.

27
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,041
He's three years old,
asking about his credit.

28
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:29,238
We thought this was a great opportunity
to just set up the story from the start.

29
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,073
That's the benefit of a sequel,
‘cause, you know,

30
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,577
people are familiar with the characters,

31
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,762
so we could jump right into story,
which is great.

32
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,246
I think this beginning really
helps the story, just seeing

33
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,419
what happened to baby Alex
and how it impacted his father,

34
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,906
sets it up for the rest of the movie.
It really makes it powerful at the end.

35
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,956
We spent a lot of time
on the music in that opening part,

36
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,835
how to make it different, feel different
from Lion King, that other movie

37
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,959
that shall never be mentioned,
in Africa.

38
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,495
I like that hunter's voice.
It's really good.

39
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,534
- Eric.
- Such a mean man.

40
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,363
This grass was a huge challenge
for the film. Millions of blades

41
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,853
blowing in the wind and moving
when characters walk through it.

42
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,203
The beginning of the film,
we didn't think we could do it.

43
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,329
But the guys figured out some
technology, and between our effects

44
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,928
and lighting department, we were
able to create massive fields

45
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,811
of savannah grass.

46
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,596
This is the intense moment of the film.
We sometimes screen this to kids,

47
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,414
and it can be really
a little bit disturbing for them.

48
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,715
- Again...
- Right there.

49
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,697
Half dozen versions of that ear,
tried to get it to be clear,

50
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,630
- but not too gross.
- Right.

51
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:07,463
The blood had been fluorescent
at one time. Just really bright.

52
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,317
This is where some kids cry
in the theater.

53
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:15,087
We debated whether or not to reveal
that Zuba was OK or not here.

54
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:15,908
We debated whether or not to reveal
that Zuba was OK or not here.

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,219
We thought that might
have been too power... too sad.

56
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,886
Yeah. In retrospect, it seemed
like the right thing to do.

57
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,116
Here's the magic of the movies.
He comes from Kenya,

58
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,436
floats in the ocean,
and will make his way to New York.

59
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,893
- It could happen.
- It could.

60
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,988
It's fun. When we were figuring out
the timeline of when this was happening,

61
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:39,835
it was in the '70s.

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,270
We just thought it would be appropriate
to have the Twin Towers in there.

63
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,048
But some people thought it was
disturbing to have the Twin Towers,

64
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:52,095
even though, historically, they'd be
there. There was a debate about that.

65
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,709
l felt it was disturbing
if we hadn't had it.

66
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,340
It's like rewriting history.

67
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,271
Just to prove it was in the '70s,
earlier, in the last sequence,

68
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,205
the characters actually had sideburns.
Just to make it feel legit.

69
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,305
A natural performer, Alex.

70
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,718
Gets to the zoo and he's right at home.

71
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,991
This is the first song that will.i.am
worked on with Hans Zimmer

72
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,864
using some themes from the first film.

73
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,127
That's Willow as Gloria.
Jada's daughter.

74
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,956
The butterfly maneuver,
which comes back later.

75
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,390
It was nice to revisit the zoo,

76
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,879
and have an opportunity, in this movie,
to set up where they came from.

77
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,864
Good thing we still
had the set lying around.

78
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,130
So to speak.

79
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,843
We reused some footage
from the first film.

80
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,613
- Give it a TV look.
- That's Meredith Vieira

81
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,756
from The Today Show, which I love.

82
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,568
- Yeah.
- Watch every day.

83
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,630
Setting up Nana here.

84
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,882
Previously, on 24.

85
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,459
This is a good opportunity,
even if you didn't see the movie,

86
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,176
we kind of just replayed a bit...
The first movie, if you didn't see,

87
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,566
it would just keep people up to speed.

88
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,577
- Al Roker.
- Lesley Stahl was the other one.

89
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,327
60 Minutes.

90
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,698
The song that drove parents crazy
. .
Is coming up soon.

91
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,438
We thought it'd be fun
to have this NASA moment

92
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,787
with them going up in the elevator.

93
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,584
Guillermo Navarro came in.
We should talk about him.

94
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,743
He helped us with our cinematography.

95
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,632
This is a shot he devised.
He thought it was important to set up

96
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,329
the world and where we left off and...

97
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,266
An excruciating shot for people who
had to light it. Mark, I don't know...

98
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,377
For a year. I think this is the most
expensive shot in the movie.

99
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,405
And it's a great shot, though.

100
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,095
When we play this with the kids,
they start getting up and dancing.

101
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,082
It's great. This song is like...

102
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,041
- ...candy to these kids.
- There's the duty-free shop

103
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,271
in the background, if you see it.
Buy coconuts and masks there.

104
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:54,153
We thought it'd be fun to use that plane
that we set up in the first movie.

105
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,671
Originally,
it was Amelia Earhart's lost plane.

106
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,310
It turned into a Madagascar
tour plane, right? In French.

107
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,542
Sacha Baron Cohen is King Julien.

108
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:26,445
A lot of improvisation for us,
like this little song there...

109
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,919
We can use about ten percent of his
improv. We want to get a PG rating.

110
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,740
l was just thinking and watching this,
going back to the beginning,

111
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,348
we'd be watching it in boards,
a long time ago.

112
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,198
But thinking about Rob Koo,
our head of story,

113
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,438
especially the opening and all that,
but through all of this

114
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,241
and how it developed.
Talking about Guillermo,

115
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,217
but how it all starts with those boards.

116
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,267
Yeah. For those of you who don't know,
we start with drawings.

117
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,877
We draw thousands and thousands
of drawings to put the film up,

118
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,924
and watch it like a movie
before we do any animation.

119
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,993
We really count on these artists
to kind of help with our cinematography,

120
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:24,187
our story. They come up with
a lot of gags and lines as well.

121
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,610
Andy Richter as Mort. He's so funny.

122
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,093
Doesn't seem like airport security
will change in the next 20 years,

123
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,270
so that gag might hold up.

124
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,203
We always joked about
the world's biggest slingshot,

125
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,246
since this is the second...
"Madagascar Space Program."

126
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,586
- That line got cut.
- It did get cut.

127
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,110
Great effects work on this plane
from Scott Peterson and his team.

128
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,367
All through this scene and coming up
with the plane crash,

129
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,793
just an incredible amount of work
to get all this smoke

130
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:22,018
and props and pieces of metal falling
off the plane, that sort of thing.

131
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,639
Vines right there. Huge effort.

132
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,031
- Great sound, as that plane falls.
- Skywalker guys.

133
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,811
That's a great joke.
Always gets a huge laugh.

134
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,544
- love the one guy that falls off.
- Yeah.

135
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,490
We could have ended the movie there.

136
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,630
That was the end of the movie
for Mort for a while.

137
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,450
- Yeah.
- We just loved Andy so much.

138
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,549
Loved Mort.

139
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,221
We used to have this dream Alex would
have about being back in New York

140
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,155
and being a nightmare, and he
would be waking up from it here.

141
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,122
It ended up being cut and it
seemed to work OK with the lightning.

142
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,587
This was a tough scene
‘cause we'd had fun action,

143
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,276
and we needed
to get out some information.

144
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:44,556
We used to have dozens of different
versions of this conversation.

145
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,983
l always liked the tourist skeletons.

146
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,529
They didn't really do much
to clean out the plane.

147
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,220
All these old tourists
from the Madagascar tour.

148
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,293
That was a great example
of what the animators do

149
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,132
to capture the essence
of David Schwimmer,

150
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,582
especially when he's looking
awkward and gets up and leaves.

151
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,508
It helps to videotape him
while they're recording,

152
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,985
but the animators are great
at caricaturing these expressions.

153
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,115
l felt that was one place
where Rex Grignon, head of animation,

154
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,772
pushed more on this.
It's not quite as...

155
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,788
We don't have as much of that,
like, stretchy, kind of goofy,

156
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:50,026
but we put more into acting.
It's much more subtle.

157
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,293
- Don't you think?
- Yeah. It was great to push the nuance.

158
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,843
It's one of the things
we were able to do with this film,

159
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,473
since we knew the characters
after working with them for five years

160
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,324
on the first film.
We knew we could go to deeper, richer,

161
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:12,075
more emotional places with them.
It put demands on the animators

162
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,992
to, at times, really get that subtlety

163
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,369
and really show what's going on
deep inside our characters.

164
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,217
Some of those emotional moments.

165
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,412
We're coming into the plane crash,
which is the first sequence

166
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,563
we put into production.
Tom, you originally boarded this,

167
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,549
and it's close to what
you did three years ago.

168
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:38,623
It was one of the hardest sequences,
and our first sequence, which was good,

169
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,159
but a challenge getting it through.

170
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,237
- Bold move.
- The effects work in this

171
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,181
is just fantastic.
That's what makes it.

172
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:53,355
The Skipper is your alter ego.
Do you have a little doll at home?

173
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,997
Yes. The doll is great.
That was the first scene with the doll.

174
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,630
And I think Mireille wanted to...

175
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,270
Eventually, we named it Lola,
after the Copacabana song

176
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,917
at the end of the movie.

177
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,305
Amazing shot here.
All these objects floating around.

178
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,805
Big challenge for the effects guys.

179
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,113
This is one of the scenes where
we actually got Ben and Chris together

180
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,000
and recorded them performing this scene.

181
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,939
So it was really funny to just sit back
and watch them play off each other.

182
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,904
They did more iPod humor
with Marty saying,

183
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:38,147
"l had 10,015 songs on that thing."

184
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:42,315
Alex would say, "Neil Diamond
didn't write 10,000 songs."

185
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,051
"So now you're dissing Neil Diamond?"

186
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,800
I think it was also an area where
Guillermo Navarro, who came in,

187
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,514
really helped us do some cinema on that.

188
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,067
It's really fun, we had layout people.
We just shot it live-action.

189
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,934
We had some layout artists
sitting on top of chairs.

190
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:05,404
He'd move the camera around. I think he
helped us push to make it more dynamic.

191
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,518
Dumped the couch on its back
so the animators were in the couch

192
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,446
looking up into the ceiling,
shaking the couch.

193
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,775
It was very low-rent, low-tech stuff.

194
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,965
But it really helped us
in a very quick and inexpensive way

195
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,103
to find ways to shoot the sequence,
keep it dynamic

196
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:27,033
and not get locked in
to standard cliché setups.

197
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,834
I miss a line there. It says,
"Kiss it like you kiss your sister."

198
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,588
- Tom, you also used to say...
- "Like you're kissing the pope's ring."

199
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,232
"Kissing the pope's ring." I love that.
We had to cut it out for timing.

200
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:43,339
It was a great line. Being a good
Catholic boy, I like that one.

201
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,639
Just to mention the clouds here.
We took a trip to Africa.

202
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,428
We realized clouds
would be two-thirds of our set.

203
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:02,105
So we had to come in
and talk to the smart people

204
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,798
about how to build the clouds.

205
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:09,384
Make them three-dimensional so we
could light them in particular ways.

206
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,830
Remember Kendal Cronkhite,
our production designer's,

207
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,175
early vis-dev on this,
the visual development on this?

208
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,045
Remember how graphic,
beautiful paintings

209
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,848
of very, very graphic trees.
We wanted this to look not...

210
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,695
We didn't want it to
tip off that we were in Africa.

211
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,609
- More ambiguous.
- We wanted to be ambiguous in this.

212
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:37,215
We hid the horizon line.
Kendal kept it moody.

213
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,563
There's Ben ad-libbing,
which brought about that

214
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,669
"69 months" gag throughout the film.

215
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,182
When the switchblade came up, too, we
wondered if we could get away with it.

216
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,628
We were prepared to do a switchblade
comb in case we couldn't.

217
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,490
But a switchblade's fine.

218
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,727
There's so many little details
that are great.

219
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,599
You can look at this endlessly,
controls in the cockpit

220
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:31,733
or the air mask that Melman's
breathing through. It's in French.

221
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,752
- On the air bag...
- The little guy with a beret.

222
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:34,893
- On the air bag...
- The little guy with a beret.

223
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:35,991
Yeah.

224
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:44,246
There's even an artist creating Marty's
drink. Making sure it looks...

225
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,764
...bumps around
and the cubes are floating correctly.

226
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,864
You get nothing for free in these
movies. Always an artist behind it.

227
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,577
Bill Winter Safaris.
There's our tribute to Bill Winter.

228
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,574
He was our guide in Africa,
when we went to Africa.

229
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,548
We took all the creative leads
from the film.

230
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,235
Jeffrey Katzenberg said, "If you're
gonna make a movie that takes place

231
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,798
in Africa, you've got to go and see it."
And he happened to have a plane.

232
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,560
He took us there.
We had a great trip. Ten days...

233
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,847
- It was amazing. Unbelievable.
-...and nine reserves.

234
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,324
When Alex was chasing the Jeep,
the shot seemed a little bit soft focus.

235
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,786
Could we fix that, you guys?

236
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:37,181
I'm keeping a file of notes we've
gotten since the movie's come out.

237
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,230
This is another scene we talked about,
was it too violent?

238
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,563
Was it over the top?
What really helps here is the music.

239
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,454
The music makes it so silly
and ridiculous

240
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,669
that I don't think anyone's
questioned that since it came out.

241
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,880
- Yeah, go ahead.
- We did that polka theme for Nana.

242
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,958
We could do covers in polka.
That was her music.

243
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:02,471
We originally had the Star Trek
fight music in there.

244
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,509
If you didn't get the joke,
seemed really dark.

245
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,077
The thing is, you can beat Nana up,
as long as she never gets hurt

246
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,052
and she always wins.

247
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,317
We're just about
to reveal the beautiful...

248
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:32,581
We called it the Jurassic Park shot.
Our first reveal of the watering hole.

249
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,192
The is where the art team
did an amazing job.

250
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,515
You can really see that they went
to Africa and took it all in.

251
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,813
I think this is such a beautiful shot.

252
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,185
Mireille, you always wanted
to make sure we did this right.

253
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,726
To make sure we landed the moment here.

254
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,032
- Well, it's like landing in Oz.
- Yeah.

255
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,736
We always...

256
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,209
Here's the first sighting of our crowds,
which is an incredible task for us.

257
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,117
We didn't know if we could do this.

258
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,963
Our crowd scene did four times
the amount of crowds

259
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,497
we've ever done in a movie before.

260
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,923
They did an amazing job,
Justin and his team.

261
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:21,014
On top of the fact that
you've got thousands of animals,

262
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,797
you've got animals of all different
sizes, some are on two legs,

263
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:25,924
some are on four.
Managing those extras

264
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,915
some are on four.
Managing those extras

265
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,600
and making sure they're not crashing
into each other is a monumental task.

266
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,711
- Putting them in grass.
- Yeah.

267
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,780
Here's a piece where a lot of the
animators used to film themselves

268
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,439
doing the line and show it
to the director

269
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,085
so they'd have a
quick feedback on the acting.

270
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,028
One of the animators, Carlos,
did a few of these shots.

271
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,756
Every time 1 see these shots,
l see Carlos acting them out.

272
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:58,219
It's also a testament to Ben Stiller
and just his creativeness,

273
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,828
- ad-libbing all this stuff.
- Yeah.

274
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:07,332
- That's Fergie.
- Yeah. Fergie is the hippo.

275
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,857
Little cameo.

276
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,723
So, now, we're not in the '70s anymore.
So no more sideburns.

277
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,938
Then the coughing that Bernie
had done there, he did cough

278
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,578
when he tried to roar. It just
seemed fitting for the character.

279
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,552
- So we actually put it in.
- We searched and searched

280
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,211
for the right voice for Zuba,
Alex's father here.

281
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:43,042
And it was really tough
because we needed this conflict

282
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,668
between father and son.
But we're not making The Great Santini.

283
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:50,483
We wanted him to still be warm
and for audiences to know

284
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,120
that he still loved his son.

285
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,379
Ultimately, you hope
that they come together again.

286
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,069
Then when we found Bernie,
he was just perfect.

287
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:03,166
- And Sherri Shepherd, too.
- Yeah.

288
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,809
- Yes.
- One person that can hold her own.

289
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:09,002
- She's a great actor.
- Yeah. Up against Bernie Mac.

290
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,571
We wanted somebody tough.

291
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:15,121
We went through so many birthmark signs.

292
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:19,064
Some were African symbology
for "fighting lion,"

293
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,125
and it ended up being Africa
and Madagascar.

294
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,171
- Not too subtle.
- Kids understand it, 1 suppose.

295
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,781
- Yeah, not too subtle.
- This is one of the areas

296
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:32,307
the animators really landed.
This was John Hill's team.

297
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:36,412
This sequence, I think,
was just seen as the starting

298
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,765
to recognize as Alex, is really powerful
and the animators, with very little,

299
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,856
really landed this. It's so emotional.

300
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:50,160
Even little eye twitches and eye darts
really helps out the subtlety.

301
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:05,641
We end up having a lot
of these 360 shots,

302
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:09,905
which... 360 shots in the movie
that are hard to light.

303
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:14,029
You have to light it from every angle.

304
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,963
But we had a lot of these,
and the lighters really

305
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:21,463
made a great effort
to give us what we wanted.

306
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:26,231
We have Zuba, 20 years later. He's
got a little grey streak in his hair.

307
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,982
- You mean Makunga?
- Makunga, sorry.

308
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,561
I think this was partly...
Didn't Kendal see someone at an airport

309
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,038
who had a grey streak and thought
it'd be great for the character?

310
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,005
l saw that guy, too,
at the airport the same day.

311
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,928
Rob Koo put the dik-dik in Makunga's
hands that he's playing with.

312
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,433
Like in Africa,
we just saw dik-diks everywhere.

313
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,873
- What do you call them, Tom?
- Africa's Cheetos.

314
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,299
Every animal snacks on them.

315
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,434
Kendal was great.
We did this Lawrence of Arabia bit here

316
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,245
Kendal was great.
We did this Lawrence of Arabia bit here

317
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:03,395
and she made sure that it was...
their hats were made out of

318
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:07,196
the parachute they landed in.
To try and keep the details real,

319
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,203
to make the world a little real.

320
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:18,297
We said, "Chris, we want you
to voice every zebra in Africa."

321
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,317
- He just said, "OK."
- It was amazing.

322
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,307
He was so wonderful about it.

323
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,175
Then we had him say the same line
over and over again.

324
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,178
He would have to say
"It's crack-a-lackin'" 50 times.

325
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,231
"It's crack-a-lackin’.
It's crack-a-lackin’."

326
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:43,826
It was very difficult
in the production design of this

327
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,740
to differentiate our characters
from the other African animals.

328
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,901
Kendal Cronkhite and Shannon Jeffries
did a great job of, like,

329
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:57,239
desaturating the other animals,
having them different designs.

330
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,760
And to pull our main characters out,
which is really hard.

331
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,893
Then the problem of getting the animals
to stand out from the background

332
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:08,751
because they're made to blend in
so they don't get eaten.

333
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,494
We learned that Mother Nature
knows what she's doing.

334
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,292
We put our lions out in the field
of grass, and we couldn't see them.

335
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,625
So we had to bring up their color,
knock back the color of the grass

336
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,680
and other tricks
to make sure our characters popped.

337
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,803
I think, with the lions,
we designed them once,

338
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,657
and Kendal felt strongly that they
looked too similar to Alex and Zuba,

339
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,266
that we had to go back in and redo
our lions to make them stand out more.

340
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,332
With the zebras, it's the other way.

341
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,578
They all look just like Marty,
with little variations.

342
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:06,341
Originally, these
were individual scenes, and then...

343
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,715
It's great that we kind of
did the intercutting here.

344
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:14,089
We really tightened them up
so we could make it a party scene.

345
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:18,656
We had Will on the film
to help with...

346
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,728
..work with Hans Zimmer to do music.
But he also did voices.

347
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,985
He did what he called his
"deep, dark, chocolate" voice

348
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:31,214
for... Moto Moto.

349
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,437
We just knew we had to use him.
It was so much fun.

350
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,793
We were even in the studio
doing that voice then,

351
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,423
and he said, "I've got an idea
for a song." It just hit him.

352
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,184
He pulled a piano bench over and started
banging on it in front of the mike.

353
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,813
Boom, boom, boom.

354
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,833
- Then he started to do that...
- Amazing. So wonderful.

355
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:56,311
He ran back behind the end of the booth
and pushed the engineer aside

356
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,225
and started using his software
to cut it together.

357
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,457
In 20 minutes, he had the song.
Pretty much as it appears in the film.

358
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:15,322
Also, with Moto Moto it's great that the
guys who rigged our virtual puppets,

359
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:19,911
we wanted him to be able to flex
his pecs and also flex his butt cheeks.

360
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:25,306
His pecs... So they gave the animators
the tools to do that.

361
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,551
It's surreal when you're doing
your job and saying things like,

362
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,331
"We need more butt cheek flex."

363
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:41,782
Always, the little hairs on Moto
Moto's chest kind of creeped me out.

364
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,278
They used to go a lot lower.
We had to...

365
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,901
What is it called, manscaping?

366
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,428
Sacha did this...

367
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,535
It wasn't even in the film, this song.

368
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,377
He said, "It'd be great
if Julien sang Private Dancer."

369
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,423
He went off for ten minutes
doing this song and dancing and...

370
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,987
Didn't he do an hour
of all different songs?

371
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,823
Yeah, he did many songs.

372
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,911
My favorite was when he was singing
Word Up! by Cameo. That was great.

373
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,430
This little sequence, we just thought
a nice comedic introduction

374
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:35,104
to get us in, and then
we remembered Sacha's singing

375
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:38,074
and found a place to put it in.

376
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,352
We could make a film
on each of these characters.

377
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,100
That's the hard part of the job.

378
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,409
Losing a lot of stuff to fit it into...
the story into the movie.

379
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,687
It was a big challenge on this story
‘cause we carry 12 characters,

380
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:56,635
13 characters from Mad 1,
and the characters they met.

381
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,389
So it was a big challenge
just to service everybody.

382
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,077
This is the first sequence we did
the 3D clouds in.

383
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,771
It took them a long time
to get it worked out,

384
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,023
but I think it looks beautiful.

385
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,276
This is fun, with the penguins.
They never support the story,

386
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,660
so they can always
be comic relief, in a way.

387
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,853
That's why they're so fun to work with.

388
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,862
We just all love Boston so much.
We wanted to get them into the film.

389
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,395
What about Nana getting
tossed out through the windshield?

390
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,995
Is that a Rob Koo special,
or was that...?

391
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:55,427
We had a whole fight sequence
here at one point.

392
00:29:55,927 --> 00:30:00,466
This joke was Jeffrey's joke.
We showed it to Jeffrey, and he said,

393
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,706
"They gotta stop and say, ‘Is she dead?
No?' And go back for her."

394
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,490
The sound effect
was really important on that.

395
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:10,423
- When they hit, the beach ball sound.
- Right.

396
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,682
When it was too harsh, you went...

397
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,396
No one likes their grandmas
being hit by Jeeps.

398
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,109
This is the extension sequence.

399
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,531
We completed the sequence
and added this beat

400
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:31,824
as Nana became a bigger character
throughout the movie.

401
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,577
Originally, we had
many types of villains.

402
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,805
We had evil hunter-poachers,
we had... Who was it?

403
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,080
- German princess.
- Goethe von Ishkabibble.

404
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,804
We needed a blue-eyed lion.
So it was all these diabolical plans

405
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,995
to dam the river that feeds the reserve.

406
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:55,014
- She was a princess from...
- L6wenbrauenstein.

407
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,022
- Sounds like a bottle of lager.
- It does.

408
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,423
- Sounds like a bottle of lager.
- It does.

409
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:04,584
This was great. It was suggested in
a story meeting that we just use Nana.

410
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:08,723
It fell into place because it became
more of a cause and effect situation

411
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,407
with her and the tourists
losing their Jeep.

412
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,458
She's not the villain, either.

413
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,660
It's really more Makunga
who's pulling the strings

414
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,297
- and doing the evil stuff.
- Let's talk about lighting, here...

415
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,360
It's so beautiful.

416
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:34,622
I love Bernie in this sequence.
He does such a great job.

417
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:38,257
So much of it was ad-libbed.
It makes him so sweet.

418
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,694
This is a great sequence
for the family dynamic.

419
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,187
Bernie went into this whole ad-lib
about Alex hiding in a box.

420
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,480
He wouldn't come to dinner.
We didn't have boxes in Africa,

421
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,020
so we couldn't use it,
but it was really cute.

422
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:55,386
The music here is really beautiful
underneath this scene.

423
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,053
It helps with the emotions.
Again, Hans Zimmer.

424
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,158
We knew we wanted this nice,
warm light in here.

425
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,102
And weren't sure exactly
how to achieve it. You never...

426
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,390
Throughout the scene,
you never see the source of that light,

427
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:25,863
until the very end.

428
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,387
Which is another idea
that came from the story department.

429
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,857
Kids always like the foofie joke.

430
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,620
They can identify.

431
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,342
That was a great line
that Sherri ad-libbed.

432
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,788
As opposed to the first one, you were
talking about this before, Mireille,

433
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:03,535
we wanted the opportunity
to flex muscles in animation,

434
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,949
both with broad and the subtle stuff.

435
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,154
This is where the animators
came through with bringing that.

436
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,961
We didn't have too much
of that in the first movie.

437
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:16,167
The story alone created opportunities
to do this kind of acting.

438
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,685
She had this moment coming up where
she kisses him. I love that moment.

439
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,169
- We used to have dialogue.
- Wasn't this you insisting here,

440
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,336
when you had little children,
you used to just stare at...

441
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,391
My kids are older. They still get mad.

442
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,989
go in when they're sleeping
and stare at them.

443
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,165
They're trying to go to sleep,
saying, "Go away, Mom. Go away!"

444
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:50,285
- We should have just kept her there.
- Peeking.

445
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,896
We did have her there. Zuba would come
get her. "Come on, let the boy sleep."

446
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,827
We did have her there. Zuba would come
get her. "Come on, let the boy sleep."

447
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,011
We're back to our polka.

448
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,623
That's Philly Joe, who's Stephen.

449
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,619
Stephen was the reader who'd work with
the actors every time we're recording.

450
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:19,190
He's an actor himself and does voices.
He was great.

451
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,848
He's Philly Joe, with the video camera,

452
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,797
as well as one of the giraffes, Stephen.

453
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:29,554
- Named after him.
- You're in my light, Stephen.

454
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:35,081
This is great work that
Philippe Gluckman and Scott Peterson

455
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:39,076
did with lighting and effects
to make this gag play.

456
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,491
There's the corporate ladder people.

457
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:48,625
There used to be 25 of them. "What's up
with the corporate ladder people?"

458
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,209
So we had to find
more variety with t-shirts.

459
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,939
Mort's so fun.
Andy Richter is just like,

460
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,026
he created the "tra-la-la" song.

461
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,129
He's the only one that could get
to that falsetto voice

462
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,336
and not have it be
really super annoying.

463
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,356
He's just funny, you know?

464
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,982
But that was a challenge.
We had to make sure the shark...

465
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,969
...we didn't see him in the water.

466
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,031
- Oh, yeah.
- We added that scene.

467
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,693
We couldn't show the shark in the water.

468
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:23,832
It's sort of the "infinite number
of monkeys" concept,

469
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,779
which allows you to accomplish anything.

470
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,055
We had jokes about writing
works of Shakespeare, eventually,

471
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:34,882
- but those kind of went away.
- Mason, played by Conrad Vernon,

472
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,600
one of the directors
of Monsters vs. Aliens and Shrek 2.

473
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,109
I love the fact that most
of the animals in the movie talk,

474
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,669
apart from the monkeys. They're
actual monkeys. They don't talk.

475
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:50,013
- And the flamingos.
- And the flamingos.

476
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,091
And the dik-diks.
The dik-diks talk a little bit.

477
00:36:55,513 --> 00:37:00,143
We call that monkey Mason. Conrad does
his best James Mason impersonation.

478
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:04,042
- He's the only talking monkey.
- Whenever Phil does sign language,

479
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,476
as well, do our research and bring
in people that know sign language

480
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,844
so the animators
can actually get it right.

481
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:25,846
We used to have Alex here with
mime makeup. He looked like a mime.

482
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:30,484
We're just... Since we wanted this
emotional scene after he gets banished,

483
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,746
it didn't really...
He was hard to take seriously

484
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,495
- with the mime face makeup.
- He looked like a clown.

485
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,558
Yeah, it was a clown.

486
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,627
This was one
of the first ideas in the film,

487
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,814
that Alex would go through this rite
of passage. We tried many things,

488
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:58,445
you know, even alluding
to circumcision at one point.

489
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:02,477
Different gags.
But it kept coming back to this idea

490
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:07,524
that Etan Cohen,
our writer, came up with,

491
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,209
that Alex would do
this dance performance

492
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,865
and actually do West Side Story.

493
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,457
We went away from it a few times,
but it kept coming back.

494
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,069
We went away from it a few times,
but it kept coming back.

495
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,060
It just seemed so Alex.

496
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,203
His dad was explaining it,
he used to say,

497
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:23,022
"There's not gonna be any snipping,
is there?"

498
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,714
Zuba would laugh and say,
"Not if you're quick."

499
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,615
We use to have this to make it
clear cubs would pick out

500
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:54,747
partners to fight. One of them
fought Grampy, the elderly lion.

501
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:58,625
- Picked lions they could beat.
- The other one, his little brother.

502
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:02,871
I think Grampy said, "Get off my lawn!"

503
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,622
- Wheezy, I think, was there.
- Yeah.

504
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,423
Teetsi was fun. This is great.
We wanted to do these muscles

505
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,602
popping out of him.
They went to great lengths

506
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:18,513
to have two models of Teetsi.

507
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,486
One was the lethargic one,
and one was fully ripped.

508
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,733
They could make muscles pop out of it,
which is really fun.

509
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,350
l like, despite all his fierceness,
he gets kind of,

510
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:45,116
"Not 'dance' dance."
He gets bummed out.

511
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,444
This was great.
And, as earlier before,

512
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:53,168
the animators would act this out
and videotape themselves dancing.

513
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,211
We had a choreographer, Yeko,
who also broke down

514
00:39:56,628 --> 00:40:00,228
the West Side Story choreography

515
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,817
and was an aid to the animators,
as well.

516
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,158
Also, the cubs coming out,
a lot of African movement.

517
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:11,302
African dance, choreographed
a whole dance for them.

518
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,199
Even for things like Alex's black eye,

519
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,891
we had to track it through the movie
and, you know, different stages.

520
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,229
I'm sure it's the same continuity
to have in live-action.

521
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,892
But there's three stages
for Alex's black eye

522
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,295
that thread throughout the movie.

523
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:50,774
As well as the fruit hat
has three stages of wilting.

524
00:40:57,522 --> 00:41:01,971
Just for the choreography here,
with these grandstands, again,

525
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,640
Guillermo Navarro encouraging us
to shoot these scenes low-tech

526
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:11,305
with video cameras and just people
around the studio being the actors.

527
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,096
It really helped in our low-tech version
of shooting these shots

528
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,746
to choreograph the staging and blocking.

529
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:21,889
In this one, I remember we went outside
and shot it on the stands,

530
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,940
where they had baseball,
so we could have steps

531
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:29,190
and Nol on the team,
out there in the cold, shooting it.

532
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:33,707
Yeah. There's probably 60 percent
of the movie, we shot that way.

533
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,274
I just wanted to have H.,
our editor, cut that together

534
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,846
so we had a version
of video of us acting it out.

535
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,928
Yeah.

536
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,611
These Hats of Shame, they have
this in some tribes in Africa.

537
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:04,192
Eric had researched.

538
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,879
When we were unsure of whether
we should have Alex wearing a fruit hat

539
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:11,823
for a third of the movie,
it was justified by reality.

540
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,613
They make kids,
if they fail the rite of passage,

541
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,339
wear this big, flowery, feathery
hat of embarrassment.

542
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,353
We used to try and justify where they'd
gone, far away from the watering hole

543
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,314
in the dik-dik area
with dik-diks surrounding them.

544
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:34,224
But we decided we didn't need to explain
it as much as just get into the scene.

545
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,439
We used to have a lot of dik-dik jokes.

546
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:41,985
We were afraid people wouldn't know
that it was a real animal.

547
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:46,937
This was one of the sequences we
reworked more than any other sequence.

548
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:52,138
Right. It was tough. It's the big split
between father and son.

549
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:55,967
- Finding the right tone.
- Hans, with this bit,

550
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:58,908
wanted to be subtle with the music.
And had that nice piano beat.

551
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,580
wanted to be subtle with the music.
And had that nice piano beat.

552
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,048
When we were in London scoring,

553
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,104
Eric's son had the opportunity
to sit at the piano

554
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,951
- and play those chords.
- He was thrilled.

555
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:13,948
Eric's tearing up now
as we're talking about it.

556
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:26,669
In this sequence, we used
to have the ostrich giving birth.

557
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:31,752
- Melman was delivering an egg.
- Twelve pound omelette.

558
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,430
Schwimmer had a great line.
He said, "Don't worry about the shell.

559
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,403
He'll grow out of it."

560
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:45,108
He also had an assistant, Sandy,
who is on the cutting room floor.

561
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,506
The gum-chewing, clipboard-toting Sandy.

562
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,120
I'd love to know what the elephant did
to get his trunk in such a knot.

563
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,970
Melman says he's been naughty.
l wanna know what that means.

564
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:57,991
Don't ask.

565
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,784
That was the old magic trick.
The knot was not part of his trunk.

566
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:07,852
It was a model put on there. We had
to find a way to get rid of the knot.

567
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:13,042
The animator pulled it off screen
and did the old switcheroo.

568
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,381
This is Cassidy Curtis' sequence.
Did a great job with his crew

569
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,995
- to bring out the comedy in Melman.
- This is from the first film,

570
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,862
when Marty did his show in the zoo
in New York City.

571
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,236
They helped him, too,
because I believe they used...

572
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,956
They started with the effects of water
that we used in the first movie.

573
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:42,346
So it gave the effects artists
a helping hand there.

574
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,213
Water is extremely difficult

575
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,516
for effects to get it to look right.

576
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:53,086
This, actually, you wouldn't think of
as being a difficult effects sequence.

577
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:57,324
But between the water and grass,
it's not like it's explosions.

578
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,555
It was a really tricky sequence
for our effects team.

579
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:04,428
We had many debates
over this shot here about the water

580
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,519
hitting Marty...

581
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:14,421
... cause that's a really hard contact,
when water contacts another character.

582
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,299
And wet characters are very difficult.

583
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:24,738
Something that's probably easy in live
action, but hard in computer animation.

584
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,064
A lot of help from Skywalker Sound.

585
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,341
Mixing a million zebras and trying
to make it feel like a huge group.

586
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:45,301
This is Eric's joke that was always
funny. "Folding it here."

587
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:49,647
Another huge scene.
This took a long time

588
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,447
to choreograph all these monkeys.

589
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,660
If you notice here, that's meant
to be toilets that get knocked over.

590
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:00,125
We move by it so fast,
it's hard to catch it.

591
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,461
But a lot of thought
went into that joke.

592
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,133
Another great thing,
when we come in on the plane,

593
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,459
you see lunch monkey underneath
the plane eating his banana.

594
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,453
I love seeing that little guy.

595
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:13,045
The crowds people would put
monkeys everywhere.

596
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,717
They have their own little jokes...

597
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,157
Find Waldo. Where's Waldo?

598
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:22,944
This was another scene
we shot with Guillermo.

599
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:26,314
A lot of the ideas with these monkeys
tearing apart the plane

600
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,684
is sort of their relationships
all get torn apart

601
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:33,144
- came out of that live-action shoot.
- When we started,

602
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,964
it played like talking heads.

603
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,470
It's like, what do we have
around the plane?

604
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,459
Monkeys came up
and people pretended to be monkeys,

605
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:45,679
pulling chairs out from under them.
It gave it a little bit of life.

606
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:49,230
One of the tools
that the art department team used...

607
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:53,136
Before the movie starts, they ask us
about emotional highs and lows

608
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:56,368
going on in the film.
This is a moment where things

609
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,183
are going wrong for the characters.
Skies are grey.

610
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,953
Maybe people don't connect that.
But it really helps with the film,

611
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,117
that when things are down,

612
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,486
you'll see skies are grey,
the color's pulled out.

613
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,270
When things are happy for characters,
they're the most colorful scenes.

614
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:16,698
Kendal and her team will track this
and plan sequences around

615
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:20,208
the emotional beats of the sequence.

616
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,834
It's fun to hear the ripple
go through the crowd as they realize,

617
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:34,328
"Wait a minute. That's Mart...
He's not Marty... Oh!"

618
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:39,142
As Alex is discovering it,
the audience is, too.

619
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,920
This is another great scene.
Ben and Chris, again in the same room,

620
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:47,817
played off each other
and brought this scene to life.

621
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,054
This is another one where you see

622
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,926
the live-action reference
coming from the animator,

623
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,539
- it's Jason Spencer-Galsworthy.
- It looks like Jason.

624
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:09,536
It does.

625
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:12,973
A lot of times, animators will look
in a mirror when doing performances,

626
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:17,151
and as much as you can get Ben Stiller,
you can also get the animator in there.

627
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,372
Way in the distance, behind Marty,
there's a thousand zebras.

628
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,076
If you watch close, you'll see them,
they're grazing, moving around.

629
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:50,013
It's that little touch,
just helps keep it real.

630
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:56,856
Great scope in this.

631
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,504
This film could have benefited
from 3D, in a way.

632
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,578
But we're fortunate. Not have to
jump through all those hoops.

633
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,272
It is the last 2D movie for DreamWorks.

634
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,759
If you kids run up and touch the screen
and feel how smooth it is.

635
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:16,864
Enjoy, because it
will soon have 3D effect.

636
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,638
Stereoscopic.

637
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:29,641
In all these environments, you know,

638
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:33,347
a lot of the tone and
the feel of these spaces

639
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:37,061
come from our trip to Africa.
We really...

640
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:41,205
.. shared these sunsets,
what have you, together.

641
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,239
When we came to the studio,

642
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,764
it was shorthand for us
with the creative leads.

643
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,080
"Remember that day, sun was going down
on the Maasai Mara,

644
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:52,863
- trees were silhouette?"
- We'd get up to watch the sunrise,

645
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,759
And so it was kind of
a real shorthand for us.

646
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:02,381
King Julien's moved up in the world.

647
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,129
He's riding ostriches
instead of flamingos.

648
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,130
Throughout the movie, we track
King Julien's apparent rise as king.

649
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,454
You'll notice he's riding
a higher class of animal each time.

650
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,975
Sacha ad-libbing this scene.
We had something else in here,

651
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,849
and he decided,
"Julien would want to whistle."

652
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:25,442
He probably whistled a dozen songs, too.
"This is Maneater, by Hall and Oates."

653
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,630
He did the entire song, too.
So we have that recorded.

654
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:39,172
"Invade a neighboring country, impose
your own ideology," that was all Sacha.

655
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:47,086
I love this little bit here
with Julien embracing Melman's head.

656
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,964
And ignoring him at the same time.

657
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,478
We had so much flamingo trouble.

658
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,197
We used to have many flamingos.
They were hot pink.

659
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,089
- It was very distracting.
- Your eye kept going to it.

660
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:16,663
So we had to make Julien
and Maurice forefront.

661
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:21,629
- This is a really beautiful shot.
- Yeah.

662
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:25,862
And this one looks exactly like
the color key that was painted.

663
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,080
One of those scenes where
you see the original color key,

664
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,480
and it turned out exactly
how the art team envisioned it.

665
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,676
That's what's great
about the art department, is we...

666
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,116
All these key scenes and shots,
they do paintings of.

667
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,697
Very elaborate paintings
that set the mood and lighting

668
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,660
that the CG artists
then try and emulate.

669
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:50,607
These scenes, like before,
talking about each character

670
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:54,504
could have their own movie.
l always feel like Cedric...

671
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,215
He's a great partner for Julien.

672
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,741
He's clearly the smarter one,
but he loves to get into whatever

673
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,421
Julien's into at the moment.

674
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,946
Cedric's great. You go, "Wanna sing?"
He's like, "Yeah! I'll sing."

675
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,902
Did some great stuff in here.

676
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:22,633
Again, will.i.am,
creating a song for the scene.

677
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:29,555
This choreography is also derived
from African dances

678
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:32,933
Yeko pulled together for us.

679
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:36,784
We started this without the
choreography, originally, in animation,

680
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:41,131
and it just wasn't feeling right.
So we brought a choreographer in,

681
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,275
and it made it feel more African.

682
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:48,095
Right. They had
a very traditional waltz there.

683
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,973
Through no fault of their own,
that's how we were directing them.

684
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,129
It didn't feel right as we were
seeing the scenes animated.

685
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,913
We stopped, brought the choreographer
in, and she did a great job.

686
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:03,544
Denis and his team did a great job
in this sequence.

687
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:07,587
More moving camera. This is something
we weren't able to do on the first

688
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:11,692
because we couldn't render
these elaborate camera shots.

689
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:14,685
This is just another example

690
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:19,512
of how technology has improved so much
and enabled us to let the camera

691
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,037
be choreographed as well as characters.

692
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,556
The layout team, lead by Nol Meyer,
they're really excited to be able

693
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,940
to move that camera around a lot more
than they could on previous films.

694
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,971
This is... Also, in this sequence,
at different times

695
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,211
we have Moto Moto animated.

696
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:41,523
And I think he came across slightly more
aggressive than what we wanted.

697
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:44,866
- Seedy?
- Yeah. We started testing him.

698
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:47,569
People weren't responding well
to the character.

699
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:51,358
We went back and looked at every scene
Moto Moto was in and said,

700
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,295
"Are we pushing him
in a slightly seedier way?"

701
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,798
We went back in.
l guess we adjusted five or six shots...

702
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:00,322
- We dumbed him up.
- We dumbed him up.

703
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:03,100
He played so much better
the next time. It was amazing.

704
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:06,757
In those few moments where we changed
him, the difference it could make

705
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:11,877
to his overall character. He comes
across like Joey from Friends now.

706
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,753
At the time, he was
coming across more macho,

707
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,429
and not quite as dumb,
and certainly not as sweet.

708
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:21,661
- Making Gloria seem more victimized.
- Fine-tuning.

709
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,449
We had a love story with Melman
and Gloria in the first movie

710
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:29,423
that we tried to play so many different
ways, but ultimately we could never

711
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,337
fit it into the film.

712
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,672
So when we had the chance
to do the sequel here,

713
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:41,056
we found a way to put it in.
It's such a great component of the film.

714
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:45,259
And works with the theme
of just being who you are,

715
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:49,276
whatever the rest of the world
might expect you to be.

716
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,010
In the first movie we had boarded...

717
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:55,349
They did a dance to...
It was like the Dirty Dancing...?

718
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:59,196
Yeah. And then Gloria had a baby.

719
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,190
She had been at the breeding program.
She had a baby.

720
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,529
Water broke, penguins were washed away.

721
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,087
- My favorite.
- It got around and round,

722
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:10,051
and we had forgotten to tell Jada

723
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,644
that her character
was no longer pregnant.

724
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,140
When we were doing the EPK at the end
of the movie, she mentioned it.

725
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:20,157
- And Mireille had to update her.
- That is a sweet speech you wrote

726
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:24,967
for Melman there. I really
believe he loves her, it's so sweet.

727
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,270
If you look closely, you'll see
Makunga's face drawn on that nest.

728
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,967
It's moving around so much,
it's hard to catch.

729
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,673
But, again,
one of those things we put in,

730
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,259
and sometimes it's hard
to read in the movie.

731
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:46,468
Another huge challenge, to get all
these birds to do the right thing here.

732
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,263
And go back into their nest.

733
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:02,348
This is a plot point that we
started with, about the watering hole,

734
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,779
a crisis at the watering hole.
When we went to Africa,

735
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:10,180
there was a big drought. It confirmed
in our minds that this is a legitimate

736
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,851
crisis that could happen
to these animals.

737
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,633
The importance of it. We see herds
of animals searching for the water.

738
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:25,806
There's one tiny watering hole
near one place that we visited.

739
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:30,183
Elephants just stood there
24 hours a day and guarded it

740
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,397
so they could have it to themselves.

741
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,006
- Little squeak toy.
- Yeah.

742
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:48,559
It's amazing, with these crowds,
they're cycles of animation

743
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,532
that are cleverly designed
so that the characters can actually

744
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,386
transition from mood to mood.

745
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:59,699
When we'd speak with the crowd animators
of what we needed here,

746
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:03,417
it'd be like "confused chatter" to
"confused, worried looking"

747
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:07,461
to "confused silence" to...

748
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:11,975
They do a great job of keeping animals
alive, making them feel independent

749
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:16,466
of each other,
but still being able to emote.

750
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:20,547
We were talking, before, about the
different villains we had for the film.

751
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,593
At one point,
we had Alec Baldwin, early on,

752
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,317
playing a completely
different character.

753
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,490
He was playing himself in Africa,
hiding out from the PETA folks.

754
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,615
He was tired of PETA...

755
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,648
I think he got a PETA plaque
in the mail for his hard work,

756
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,018
and he used it for skeet shooting.

757
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:43,287
He recruited help to build
his hunting lodge with actors.

758
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,570
- It was an acting school.
- He tricked actors to build this...

759
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,480
Saying it was an acting school.
What was the line about the carpenter?

760
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:55,888
Yeah, they're building his lodge,
complaining about having to build.

761
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,462
"When do we start acting?" He goes,

762
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:02,269
"Suppose you had to play the part
of a carpenter or a painter.

763
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,333
You'll be well prepared."

764
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:10,564
That character went away,
and, fortunately, we were able

765
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:16,218
to re-pitch the Makunga character
to Alec. He was perfect for that.

766
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:21,697
Just in case anyone wants to know,
there's 4,231 zebras in that shot.

767
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,442
- But we asked for 8,000.
- l know.

768
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:27,731
Also, sound-wise,
with all these zebras chattering,

769
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:31,955
the Skywalker folks had to
actually take in the dialogue

770
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,912
from Chris behind the mic,
when just talking to him,

771
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:38,852
and they used anything they could
to fill out the sounds

772
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:41,816
of thousands of zebras.

773
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:44,799
So if you listen closely,
there might be Chris talking

774
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:47,302
about his
Kill the Messenger tour or...

775
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,482
..if he could have a water.

776
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:56,402
We had a version where Alex
doesn't recognize Marty in the crowd,

777
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,467
and just gives such
an emotional heartfelt speech

778
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,740
that Marty comes out.
One of the executives, Bill Damaschke,

779
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,776
thought it'd be more powerful
if Alex actually recognized Marty.

780
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:09,744
We tried it and we all agreed.

781
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:13,457
Marty's turned the other way,
so Alex, technically,

782
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:19,144
is able to pick him out
with the butt-bite mark on his butt.

783
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:23,292
At one point, we even did that gag
at the end of the film here,

784
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:26,817
where as they're walking off to
the jungle, we see Alex take a peek

785
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,817
at Marty's butt to make sure
he's got the right zebra.

786
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:34,013
In a way, it undermined the moment here.
We wanted to just make it

787
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:38,413
up and positive and heartfelt,
as these two guys go upriver.

788
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:42,109
Later, we get the gag in at the end
of the film, where we realize,

789
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,512
"He saw the butt mark.”

790
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:47,368
So if you have
a big screen TV or Blu-ray,

791
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,914
you'll see, as Marty's walking off,
he doesn't have his bite mark.

792
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:55,576
It would be confusing here,
but later they magically appear.

793
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:03,189
This is another example of where
the computer world will generate

794
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:07,557
so much of the set and light it.

795
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:10,768
But it can't do everything.
There's too much data.

796
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:15,078
So these really talented matte painters
really kind of

797
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:20,219
extend the set off into the horizon,
or the clouds, if they have to.

798
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:24,047
They add to where the set ends up.

799
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:31,828
Sometimes Michael Collery and his team
would take a matte painting

800
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,055
and break it into levels
so we could do a camera move on it

801
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:39,249
and get a little bit of parallax,
even though there's not 3D elements.

802
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:44,256
And make the leaves move
within the paintings or clouds.

803
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,812
Chris Rock...
We showed him the scene and he thought

804
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:58,238
it'd be funny if all the zebras
were into Alex's hat.

805
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:01,622
We jumped in the booth
and recorded all these hat lines.

806
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,432
Probably the last few weeks
of animation.

807
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,419
Notice he's on top of an elephant now.

808
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,450
Because he's getting
more powerful in Africa.

809
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:22,909
This was an animator's idea,
that he'd lose his staff here.

810
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:32,802
Which, in our minds, some dik-dik
retrieved and gave to him.

811
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:35,560
This is a great beat
that Sacha came up with.

812
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:39,206
He should have an argument with himself.
He came up with it on the fly.

813
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,339
It lasted about ten minutes.

814
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:46,520
Unfortunately, we did have to
cut it down to keep the story moving.

815
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:03,088
Again, with production design,
they took a lot of leaves off the trees

816
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:07,263
to make it feel drier. They added dust
and atmospherics

817
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:10,104
to make it feel drier.

818
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:14,533
There's hardly any clouds in the sky.
Everything is desaturated

819
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:18,065
to sell the dryness of it.

820
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:28,001
We went through this with King Julien,
same thing we did with Moto Moto.

821
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:30,945
Walking that line
of not wanting to feel like a jerk

822
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:33,778
because he's gonna sacrifice an animal.

823
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:36,324
So just going through
and making him sweet.

824
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:40,496
He used to call everyone "twit"
and "nincompoop" and seemed a little...

825
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:54,573
This was a huge challenge for the
crowds. All running, chasing and...

826
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,461
I was thinking of the music,
how themes are done different ways.

827
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,465
In the...

828
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,511
With King Julien,
l remember being so surprised

829
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:12,401
when Hans did Move It, Move It
in a orchestral... version.

830
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,669
But it sounds beautiful.
The song that's like...

831
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,992
I've got kids. I'm sick of that song.

832
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,728
But when I hear Hans' version of it,
it's so beautiful.

833
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:26,141
All the animals here used to be
chanting "Sacrifice, sacrifice!"

834
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:27,636
It just felt kind of dark.

835
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,927
It just felt kind of dark.

836
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:32,452
Then we changed it
to celebrating Melman.

837
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,816
But the lip sync is still "sacrifice"
if you look closely.

838
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:50,642
These are one of the scenes you write

839
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,390
and you overwrite them,
and they're two pages long.

840
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:58,107
When you boil it down, there's only a
couple of key lines that sell the point.

841
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:10,587
We always loved this scene, too,
with Makunga coming here.

842
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:15,387
So we kept having to change the ending
of the watering hole scene,

843
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:19,802
when it dries up, to make sure
we could motivate him coming.

844
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,730
But it was like how to
keep that connected.

845
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:32,491
Sean Mahoney did this shot here.
Great tribute to Alec

846
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,329
and his expressions.

847
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:43,673
This was a Baldwin ad-lib. Funny.

848
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:53,096
Now, we come to the jungle. Very
different than jungles in Madagascar,

849
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:58,256
which were very colorful,
filled with beautiful foliage.

850
01:04:58,962 --> 01:05:01,452
This is the scary jungle.

851
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,880
It's difficult, within the story,
to try and find variety

852
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:11,117
within the landscapes to...
This is all set in Africa, and...

853
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:17,363
The art department did a fantastic job
of making you feel like

854
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:21,451
you come to a new, dynamic area
with its own feel and mood

855
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:25,178
and not get environment fatigue.

856
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,678
I love that Alex still has his hat.

857
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,683
He's left, and he still insists
on wearing the Hat of Shame.

858
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:34,167
- The wilted, stage three hat.
- Stage three.

859
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:39,402
Here, we used to have this scene
where Nana showed them how to hunt

860
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:44,002
with her purse,
and she was beating up a straw zebra.

861
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,613
She was just thrashing it
and thrashing it.

862
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:53,993
She's funnier when she's more benign.
It made this reaction even funnier.

863
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:58,717
This is a reaction
to her bashing the zebra.

864
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:02,755
Only when she's provoked
is she violent.

865
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:11,015
They're doing all these maneuvers
to escape spears,

866
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:14,124
and Ben and Chris were just
making up their own maneuvers,

867
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:18,491
- the squiggly squid and...
- Etch A Sketch is my favorite.

868
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:23,008
- Is itin The In-Laws?
- The serpentine.

869
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:27,212
Serpentine. It started with
an homage to The In-Laws.

870
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,624
They took it to a new level.

871
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:39,815
This was a tricky scene as well.
They used to be chanting "jump."

872
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:43,116
It's a very dark-looking scene.

873
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:46,875
And Melman's about to kill himself.

874
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:50,153
So, again, musically, with Hans,

875
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:55,527
they made it more a celebration of
Melman, which kind of made it more...

876
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:58,009
.. less dark.

877
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:01,824
For a long time, we were gonna use
songs here. Didn't we have...?

878
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,025
- Jump.
- By The Pointer Sisters.

879
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,250
- We had The Ohio Players doing Fire.
- Fire.

880
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:10,504
- Hans shot down Van Halen.
- Hans just refused.

881
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,950
"We're not even gonna do that."

882
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:17,015
This witch doctor scene, which is Eric,
used to be at the end of the movie.

883
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,380
It just felt like such an add-on,
that we decided to put it in here,

884
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:25,131
- which meant more.
- Now, we realize he's not dying.

885
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:28,631
The last thing we want him to do,
obviously, is throw himself in.

886
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:35,852
There's that pull-out shot,
and the crowds were Justin's group.

887
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,375
- He just really went to town.
- This was a big challenge

888
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:41,116
for all the departments.

889
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:46,366
The way this rock breaks away here...

890
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:48,352
All that's done by hand.

891
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:54,564
Every crack is pre-scored into the rock
so they can pull it apart.

892
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,872
- That was a Schwimmer add.
- Really helps.

893
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:14,601
We thought it'd be funny
if Melman was dressed as the bride,

894
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:17,808
and Gloria's more the groom.

895
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,691
So he has this little bridal veil
and orchids and...

896
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,861
It's kind of a reversal.

897
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:29,202
His lashes seem to go with it.

898
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:36,216
It's amazing what these actors do.
We go into a studio

899
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,989
with just a microphone and nothing else.

900
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:42,781
We describe the sequence to them
and they imagine all this stuff

901
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,249
going on around them. For Schwimmer,

902
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:48,337
he picked up on the fact
that Gloria's holding him by the horn.

903
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:52,221
Thinking about that,
how would Melman respond?

904
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,751
It comes out of his imagination.

905
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,913
This scene we had
with the monkeys striking...

906
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,053
It was before the big Hollywood strikes,

907
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,636
the Writer's Guild or the Actor's Guild.

908
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,273
Probably a year before those happened.

909
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:14,679
We worried if we could keep those in,
in good taste.

910
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:20,023
- Hopefully, the actors won't...
- Yeah.

911
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,633
But yeah, discussions
of all the strikes.

912
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:31,996
This last photo used to have Skipper's
tongue on the hula doll's cheek.

913
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:35,671
- But it looked a little bit too much.
- Tone it down.

914
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:44,352
I love this first reveal of the
new plane as it's coming together.

915
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:49,388
We did so much work on the different
stages of the plane. Alex did them all.

916
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:53,773
In the movie, you get glimpses of it,
but a lot of work went into it.

917
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:57,837
We didn't want to reveal the plane
completely, which was the trick of it.

918
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:03,174
Save it for the third act.
For the big moment, the climax.

919
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:10,310
This sequence looks beautiful,
and it's one of the sequences...

920
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:14,587
Often, what happens on these movies
is towards the end, you run out of time

921
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:18,278
to get them finished
and give less time to some departments.

922
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:22,621
The lighting department had, probably,
half the time they're used to.

923
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,469
They, somehow, pull out beautiful images
and you can't tell at all.

924
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:28,829
They always pull it together at the end.

925
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,721
These are the stage three tourists
that are created.

926
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:49,154
- All dirty and torn up.
- Lord of the Flies tourists.

927
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:53,679
The Alex performance used to be
more of a pastiche act,

928
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:57,683
where it had a little bit of everything,
not just dancing. It had mime,

929
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:02,061
as Eric called it, the "mimax."
And other bits.

930
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:05,728
But the dance worked so well.
Then the music just

931
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:08,919
pulled it all together,
that Hans and Will created.

932
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:12,495
You think about what the animators
added to this, ‘cause it was...

933
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:16,842
It would be funny and it got laughs,
but when it got animated,

934
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,490
- it just completely got big laughs.
- Yeah.

935
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:23,212
It really was one of those scenes
where it was never gonna work

936
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:25,736
- until it was completely done.
- It became,

937
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:29,652
- "Who knows how to do The Worm?"
- We actually had people who knew.

938
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:33,729
- "Are there any poppers in the house?"
- All the poppers came.

939
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,480
Funny. A talented group.

940
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:48,413
But, early on, this was always...
In the early versions of the story,

941
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:54,344
in different forms, Alex would save
he and his father with some performance.

942
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:02,076
We're back to the butterfly that
we saw little Alex doing at the start.

943
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:09,022
I love how the father's just off-kilter
here. As he gets in the air,

944
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,924
he's doing a great job,
but no, no, no! Panic.

945
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,258
Faceplant.

946
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:23,442
We never explain why all these African
tourists happen to be from New York.

947
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,636
A happy accident.

948
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:30,296
Some effects artists,
instead of ricocheting off the barrel,

949
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,563
had Alex getting shot
and blood pouring out of him.

950
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,266
And put it up for us
to review at one point.

951
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:39,232
- It kind of worked, in a way.
- It was pretty funny.

952
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:46,348
We were happy to get a barrel
of monkeys into this movie.

953
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:50,763
We started with that idea
and constructed the movie around it.

954
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:55,177
We went around and around
with these telephone lines.

955
01:12:58,074 --> 01:12:59,914
What would happen. The lines change.

956
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:04,253
So we had to keep finding twisted
versions of lines going up the chain.

957
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:09,391
You can't hear everything that Skywalker
did with the sound with this plane.

958
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:13,156
They did amazing stuff where they took
old engines and opened them up

959
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:17,606
and dropped microphones into them
and hand-cranked them to get the sound

960
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:21,737
of gears meshing. It's really
cool stuff they came up with.

961
01:13:22,298 --> 01:13:25,398
Of course, there's music and dialogue
that covers a lot of it.

962
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:29,682
We used to have Walking on Sunshine
be the music in here as a joke.

963
01:13:30,273 --> 01:13:32,293
No one seemed to get the joke.

964
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:36,541
Hans and his guys were
trying all these different songs.

965
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:40,625
- They hit on Copacabana, which is...
- Perfect.

966
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,373
- And Lola got her name.
- Lola got her name.

967
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:49,192
That's what I love about Lola,
it makes it so absurd.

968
01:13:49,692 --> 01:13:53,262
It was absurd before, and when we added
Lola, it became even more absurd.

969
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,056
She's so determined.

970
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:06,855
Throws a gun, got her magic bag. She's
gonna take that plane out with her bag.

971
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:09,816
That was Mireille's joke,
the medic and the tape.

972
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:18,928
This is probably the biggest effects
shot, one we were excited to get.

973
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,975
- The breaking water.
- Costs hundreds of dollars.

974
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:25,960
Hundreds. We had
to have a collection for that.

975
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:32,783
We had a different version of this.
Sacha saw it,

976
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:36,599
and thought he could do better.
This brought the whistling back around.

977
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,419
- And...
- Reanimated it.

978
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:44,059
Reanimate it, yeah.
John Hill and his team.

979
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:48,084
We had explored having lots of cutaways
to Mort and this shark

980
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:53,217
traveling through the African landscape.
It just became too much film for us.

981
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:58,282
A bus? Didn't he hijack
a bus at some point?

982
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:02,331
There it was, the only death
in the movie. The shark.

983
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,360
The gods needed a sacrifice.

984
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:16,194
Usually, animated films kill off
parents. We just killed off a shark.

985
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:19,099
Another beat. We had lots of,
"You did it. I did.

986
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:21,532
I did it 50 percent.
You did it 60 percent."

987
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:24,314
Great Sacha beat
that went on for about five minutes.

988
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,090
"The eagle's landed."

989
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,905
We used about
one second of it in the end.

990
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:35,769
Now the fish. It's gonna be OK.

991
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:41,193
We went around and around on how
to take care of Makunga here.

992
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:45,364
We had a version where Zuba took
him out, where Alex took him out

993
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:50,630
with a dance kick.
We thought it would kind of

994
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:54,067
make closure to the Nana story

995
01:15:54,517 --> 01:15:57,037
- if she was the one who took him out.
- Less expected.

996
01:15:57,453 --> 01:15:59,383
Yeah.

997
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:02,621
We were gonna have a beat,
later on at the end of the credits,

998
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:07,512
where Nana would be back in New York,
and she'd see tourists come in

999
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:11,947
to JFK, and there's Makunga
in a cat carrier.

1000
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,168
I like their expressions in that shot.

1001
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:23,379
This is a great bit.
Just pitching the scene to Alec,

1002
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:27,005
saying, "Alex hands you a purse."

1003
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:31,705
He thought he should really admire it
and ad-libbed this hiking line.

1004
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:40,753
We had to make the bag with an
adjustable strap because he said that.

1005
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,550
- We liked it so much.
- We had to change it.

1006
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:52,086
This scene actually went on about
three times as long as it ended up.

1007
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:57,626
It felt a little brutal. She did
a lot more to him than just that.

1008
01:16:58,214 --> 01:17:01,724
We had fun thinking of all the Catholic
schoolboy things the nuns used to do

1009
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,624
to you at school.
We had a list of all those things.

1010
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,770
Our board artists
love those challenges.

1011
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,815
Again, we were... The animals,
we wanted them to get in the water.

1012
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:33,245
Water's really expensive,
so you can't touch it.

1013
01:17:33,716 --> 01:17:36,406
Because it's a great deal
of effects work there.

1014
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:40,192
At the end, they said...
They made an effort to make that happen,

1015
01:17:40,723 --> 01:17:43,353
that the animals could go in the water.

1016
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,567
- Our little misdirect here.
- Yeah.

1017
01:17:56,038 --> 01:18:00,107
l always liked, "For better, please."
Like there's a choice.

1018
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:03,703
Tom's always wanted to marry
a hula doll, so this was his dream.

1019
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,250
- Closest thing he could achieve to it.
- Yep.

1020
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,490
l also like that we have eight-track
tape players in this movie.

1021
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:19,207
Kids'll see that: "What's that new music
technology? I gotta get one of those."

1022
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:28,061
I love the idea of the penguins
being in Monte Carlo.

1023
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:38,963
This is one of the last scenes
we recorded with Bernie, too.

1024
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,925
There was a couple of lines
we didn't get with him

1025
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:44,338
before he passed, unfortunately.

1026
01:18:44,687 --> 01:18:48,347
We reviewed a lot of the material
he'd done, sequences that were cut,

1027
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:51,004
and it was great listening
to all that again.

1028
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,580
Just brought back
many great memories of him.

1029
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:57,942
He did this little bit. Eric found
this bit with him doing a little

1030
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,027
song and dance.

1031
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,867
"l got you, son!"
This bit here, which was great.

1032
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:08,563
It worked better
than any line we would've written.

1033
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,442
These are the last shots
that were done in the film.

1034
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:25,609
It's rare in a film, where that would
ever happen. You jump around so much.

1035
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,840
There's our little butt bite.

1036
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:35,679
Off they go.

1037
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:38,878
We always joked about...
Eric wanted to have the butterfly

1038
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,331
come in here at the end,
at the beginning.

1039
01:19:41,677 --> 01:19:43,897
Thought it'd be funny to see it,
then go to another

1040
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,981
lion father playing with his cub.
It was all the butterfly's fault.

1041
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:47,882
lion father playing with his cub.
It was all the butterfly's fault.

1042
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:53,285
Just to try
and do something interesting.

1043
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:56,478
Producers brought on Jamie Caliri
at Duck Studios

1044
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:59,065
to create something unique
for the credits.

1045
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:01,178
So they're not just a scroll.

1046
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:04,017
It was fun to have
something completely different,

1047
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:07,533
as far away from 3D as we could.
He did a great job.

1048
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:11,607
These are actually practical
paper sculptures that they did.

1049
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:13,784
Just absolutely beautiful.

1050
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:21,145
And we opted to put the credits here,
which the cast was great about.

1051
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,630
So we could just get right
into our story, right away,

1052
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:27,107
and not have a big intro.

1053
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:32,963
When you watch these credits,

1054
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,909
it's a huge long list,
they may be boring,

1055
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:39,872
but these are the people we work with,
who we represent when we make movies.

1056
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:44,415
There's 400-plus people at the studio
and artists that pitch in

1057
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,710
to make these movies.

1058
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:52,590
So really enjoy the credits and know
that everyone had a great deal

1059
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:54,698
to do with this movie.

1060
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:05,962
Thanks, everybody. Three and a half
years to make this movie.

1061
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:09,388
An incredible timeline.
It was made with a lot of grit,

1062
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:14,144
- spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
- Lot of laughs and love.

1063
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:16,733
- And tears.
- And tears. And blood.

1064
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:20,002
- And blood.
- We hope you enjoy it.
