1
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,384
A world...known as Vast.

2
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:25,921
It is a peaceful realm, save for one thing.

3
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:31,887
Every 333 years, a terrible
creature is born.His name is Kuiba.

4
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:40,025
The coming of Kuiba brings
death and chaos throughout the land.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,881
Even the gods are not spared.

6
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,699
Every time, Vast has marshaled
all of its forces against Kuiba.

7
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,325
But always, he is reborn 333 years later.

8
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:00,939
In Kuiba Year 1042, the goddess Trueheart
fell in the battle against the fourth Kuiba.

9
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,679
Mommy!

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:13,380
In the Year 1058, the gods mobilizde
for a final attack on Kuiba.

11
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,865
Ch'i-hung San!

12
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,948
Kuiba summoned his
fearsome Pulse Beast

13
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:25,109
and his loyal forces for a
last stand against the gods.

14
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:31,042
Thunderclap! Rally at the top of the tower.

15
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,928
Da-ts'ang!

16
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,056
Ling! Jia! Everyone who's still alive!
Get to the tower!Distract the enemy!

17
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,736
Yu-mi-k'uang! To me!

18
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,353
Save yourself, Kuiba!

19
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:24,251
At the instant of his death,the fourth Kuiba
opened a Torque Path with his Soaring Lance,

20
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,942
allowing his lieutenants to escape.

21
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,649
No! Kuiba!

22
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,605
His lance became the stone pillar
that stands on Maelstrom Island.

23
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,658
There, Kuiba's surviving
lieutenants gathered

24
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,379
to await the coming of the next Kuiba.

25
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:50,595
In Kuiba Year 1331 ,the Goddess Pureheart
took command of the heavenly armies,

26
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,105
and successfully destroyed the fifth Kuiba.

27
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,708
In Kuiba Year 1664,
the sixth Kuiba was to be born.

28
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:07,317
The monolith at Soul Mountain.
That's where he will be born.

29
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,457
Signs of life are growing stronger.

30
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,008
We can pinpoint the location
and time of his return.

31
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:19,324
Sun, Moon, and Star gods, stand by.
Prepare to attack the Radix Point!

32
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:29,161
Awaken, Primus. By the will of the five
great gods,Open the Radix Point.

33
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,014
It's been a long time.

34
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,527
Everybody in position. Commence countdown.

35
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:40,876
10. 9. 8 7,

36
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:51,033
Careful! It will stay open
for only a millisecond.3 2 1

37
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,471
Fire!

38
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,424
Target hit!

39
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,894
All signs of life have
disappeared. Bulls-eye!

40
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,489
He's dead.

41
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,345
That's that, then.

42
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:18,796
The nightmare is over.

43
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,459
I'll never give you a chance,
Kuiba, not as long as I live.

44
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:35,652
But Pureheart
and the other gods didn't know

45
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,600
that the sixth Kuiba had escaped the attack.

46
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,743
Against all odds, he survived.

47
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,566
Manji!

48
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,039
Here!

49
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,398
Feel the Pulse energy.

50
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,057
Be one with the Pulse!

51
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,726
Clear the Pulse channels!

52
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,481
Prepare for Pulse attack!

53
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,519
Faster! Faster! Faster!

54
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,260
Control it! Good! Steady! Steady!

55
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,912
Channel it through your Hsuan bone!

56
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,067
Circulate it through your body!

57
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,612
Still it at your Lun Springs!

58
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,179
Now get ready to fire it.

59
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,142
One, two, three, four...

60
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,160
Colossus blast!

61
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:34,053
Don't stop! Try again.
Through the Hsuan bone...

62
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,428
Hsuan bone...

63
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,876
Can you feel the Pulse?

64
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,162
Nnnnnnot...yet...

65
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,801
Steady, steady, steady!
First, the Hsuan bone...

66
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,192
Hsuan...bone...

67
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,264
Then circulate it through your body...

68
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,639
Circulate...

69
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,321
Still it at your Lun Springs...

70
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,139
Lun...Springs...

71
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,094
Good. Still it...

72
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,104
Sssssssiill...it...

73
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,500
Clear the Pulse channels!
Prepare for Pulse attack!

74
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,323
Go!

75
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,688
The Soaring Lance is feeling Kuiba's power.

76
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,661
Kuiba has returned!

77
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,983
Welcome back, dear master!

78
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,449
We have waited so very long.

79
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,893
This can't be. Kuiba...is alive?!

80
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,544
Alert the Immortal Alliance immediately!

81
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,695
According to our calculations
for the Liesen locus convergence,

82
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,981
Kuiba is most likely to
reappear at Maelstrom Island.

83
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:01,171
Every country in the Alliance should
send spirit warriors to the Tree Kingdom.

84
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,750
The first squad will
board the ship Toque Path

85
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,241
1 at the Greenleaf Bay and
leave for Maelstrom Island.

86
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:15,988
Manji!

87
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,093
Here!

88
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,854
Make sure you watch closely this time.

89
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,167
The finest Pulsecraft you'll ever seen.
No repeat performances.

90
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,901
And whatever you do, don't interfere-- huh?

91
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,732
I, spirit warrior Manji of the Nomad Tribe,
of Youwei County in the Great Beast Nation,

92
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,013
challenge the Lord Chieftain
of Backwater Village! Lord Chieftain!

93
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,490
All right, all right. No need
to shout. People are still sleeping!

94
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,404
Master Man will be my witness this time,
Lord Chieftain!

95
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,656
Had breakfast yet?

96
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,935
Breakfast can wait.
We'll start once the witness gets here.

97
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,299
As you like. But a good breakfast
is important, you know!

98
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,053
I won't hold back this time,
Lord Chieftain!

99
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,629
Huh? Hang on. Yyyyyyyah!

100
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,441
Coming! Coming!

101
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,216
I can't believe you guys
get up before the rooster.

102
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,223
Thanks for helping, Gujitai.
Had your breakfast yet?

103
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,530
I'll have it after.

104
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,571
Once I've defeated the Lord Chieftain...

105
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,902
everyone will be able to sleep late
and eat breakfast whenever they like!

106
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,743
If only.

107
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,109
I witness that a challenge has
been made by Master Man --

108
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,530
And Manji!

109
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,314
--for the 132nd time --

110
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,097
13 1st!

111
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,782
and that the Lord Chieftain has accepted.

112
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,091
The both of you bear all
mortal risks willingly and honorably.

113
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:42,517
Make your move.

114
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,170
Colossus...blast!

115
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:09,814
What?

116
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,130
I did it!

117
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,415
"Poplar blossoms drift to the ground!"

118
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,131
"Poplar blossoms"? When did he get that?

119
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,180
Triple-Pulse blast!

120
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,290
"The sword howls and the dragon rages!"

121
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,448
Mm. You're getting there.

122
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,678
Then watch THIS!

123
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,159
Stop!

124
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,867
We have a winner. No more fighting.

125
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,330
Please sign here for the winner...

126
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,842
Remember -- breakfast is important!

127
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,264
Daddy?

128
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,199
Don't call me "Daddy." Call me Master Man.

129
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:13,726
Master Man?

130
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,767
How many times have
I told you not to interfere?

131
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,398
I tell you and tell you,
and you still interfere!

132
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,443
Must you always mess up my strategy?

133
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,357
It Chieftain seemed tougher today.

134
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,474
Sign here for the loser.

135
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,709
You called it too early!

136
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,182
What, you didn't get hit enough?

137
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,989
I was looking out for you, Man.

138
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,963
Every morning you show
up here and get thrashed.

139
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,984
Is it really that much fun?

140
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:41,764
Just wait till tomorrow!

141
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,232
And tomorrow will be different...how?

142
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,827
I'm on top of it.

143
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,126
They're nothing but bad news,
the pair of them.

144
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,031
I can't take another
minute of this! 1 swear!

145
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,334
What did we ever do to deserve this?

146
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,518
I'll pay 1,000 silver
credits to get rid of them!

147
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,838
Backwater Village hasn't seen
a moment of peace since those two came.

148
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,843
The granary burnt down
and the crops were all ruined!

149
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,570
The roof of my house collapsed!

150
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,839
And the bridge at the village gate!

151
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,955
And that water-wheel had been there since
my granddaddy was Chieftain...

152
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,191
It's intolerable! When will it all end?

153
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:26,999
Master Man?

154
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,720
Does...does it hurt?

155
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,101
Don't talk when there's nothing to say.

156
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,922
Don't feel bad, Master Man --

157
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,771
we'll practice hard today,
and tomorrow we'll beat him for sure.

158
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:39,875
Go on then, practice.

159
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,100
Yes sir!

160
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:46,922
Practicing!

161
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,488
Look!

162
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,712
You think you can win
a battle with a little trick like that?

163
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,316
Well, you could...
you could startle him, maybe.

164
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,077
No more playing around.
Practice. Colossus blast!

165
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,177
Yes sir! Colossus blast!

166
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,316
Colossus blast!

167
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,848
Stop looking at me. Feel the Pulse energy.

168
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,182
I can't feel anything when
you get angry like that.

169
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,714
I'm not angry!

170
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,771
I've only lost for the 131st time in a row!

171
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,353
Why would I be angry?

172
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,806
Still at it, ] see!

173
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,363
On a beautiful day like this...

174
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,401
..no sense in just sitting around.
We thought we'd exercise a bit.

175
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,646
Looks good, looks good.
I'll let you get back to it...

176
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:45,978
What are you waiting for?

177
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,443
Right! Colossus...blast! Colossus...blast!

178
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,464
Heavens! My goodness!

179
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,910
It's happening again!

180
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,302
They're still out practicing!

181
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,857
If you guys don't stop them,
I'll find a husband in another village.

182
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,277
Me too!

183
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:14,333
There's got to be a way
to get them out of our hair.

184
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:19,188
Bury them, drown them, poison them!
Gujitai will take care of it.

185
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:21,627
Why not you?

186
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,194
Oh, I couldn't do it.

187
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,296
Why me?

188
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,650
We're here for a meeting, not for nap time.

189
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:32,574
But those two...
their Pulsecraft really isn't all that good.

190
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,805
But nothing ever
happened before they came here.

191
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,106
No more talking. We need to ACT.

192
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,422
We can't do anything nasty.

193
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,652
Backwater has always been
the most upstanding village in the county.

194
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,636
We can't have people
thinking we're bad hosts.

195
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,116
Forget about being upstanding!

196
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,976
We need a decision today!

197
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,315
Or else, or else, I'll...'ll...
I'll go on hunger strike.

198
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,936
It's important to eat well...

199
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,401
And you are...

200
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,476
An emissary from the king
of the Great Beast Nation.

201
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:12,911
I bear a royal edict.

202
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,469
A royal edict?

203
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,859
It must be something terribly important.

204
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:25,076
Whatever it is, Lord Emissary,
please tell us all.

205
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:29,724
Kuiba, has returned.

206
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,646
Kuiba!

207
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,370
It's not all that scary, is it?
Kuiba came back plenty of times before,

208
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,765
and we're all still here.

209
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,314
Surely you didn't come all this way
just to bring us the news.

210
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,384
His Majesty calls for all spirit warriors
to join the Immortal Alliance.

211
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,481
They will go to Tree Kingdom,
and set out from there.

212
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,509
Oh? Sounds like just what we need.

213
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,606
We've got two ideal candidates for you.

214
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,257
Huh? Oooh. Yeah, ideal!

215
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,883
As ideal as can be!

216
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,595
Our prayers have been answered.

217
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,607
Who? Who do you mean?

218
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,979
But they haven't even got a proper Shard...

219
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,805
Oh, now I get it.

220
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:23,898
Gujitai! Now that you get it, go tell them.

221
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,594
Why me again?

222
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,756
They're your friends, aren't they?

223
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,854
I talk to them every now and then,
that's all.

224
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,212
Besides, they're the only
ones who'll listen to me.

225
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,381
Don't worry, Gujitai.

226
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:47,678
Nobody has to go tell them.
I think they'll join the army to fight Kuiba

227
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,348
all on their own.

228
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,989
Are you ready, Lord Chieftain?

229
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,915
Just had my breakfast.

230
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,113
I witness that a challenge has
been made by Master Man --

231
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:03,462
And Manji!

232
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,683
--for the 133rd time--

233
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,924
132nd!

234
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,868
and that the Lord Chieftain
of Backwater Village has accepted.

235
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:12,477
Make your move.

236
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:14,696
"Triple-Pulse blast "!

237
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:15,621
That's fast!

238
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,355
For my first move...

239
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,838
"Poplar blossoms drift to the ground!"

240
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:26,704
Blossoms didn't work!

241
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,499
How could they have broken
the bridge with such weak Pulsecraft?

242
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,716
The builder must have
been skimming. I'll get him next.

243
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:35,714
Things are looking good today!

244
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,045
Don't let up! "Ring blast"!

245
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,891
I can't lose this too obviously...

246
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,366
"The sword howls and the dragon rages!"

247
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,021
Hold it...hoooooocold it!

248
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,575
Holding! Holding! Holding!

249
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,395
Mm. That ought to do it.

250
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,125
Stop!

251
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,754
We won! We won!

252
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,839
Daddy -- 1 mean, Master Man
-- can you give me your Shard now?

253
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,543
A single victory isn't nearly enough...

254
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,318
...fo earn you this Shard,
the mightiest in all the word.

255
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,139
And don't give me that look!

256
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,229
Master Man, what was that for?

257
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,436
You're clearly not ready.

258
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:34,359
A spirit warrior is always
on guard against sneak attacks.

259
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:35,881
Please sign here for the winner...

260
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,084
You called it too early!

261
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,695
Would you rather he called it too late?
We might have hurt the Lord Chieftain.

262
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,712
Sounds like the victory's
going to your heads.

263
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,019
At last! The 132nd time!

264
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,599
Some victory. You beat up the

265
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,590
old chieftain of a tiny
little village, that's all.

266
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,465
Now, if you were to fight the
most powerful enemy ever known...

267
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,186
Yeah! We'll fight the most
powerful enemy in the world,

268
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,902
and we'll beat them,
and then we'll be the most powerful!

269
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,446
So who's the most powerful?

270
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,293
Kuiba, of course.

271
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:15,691
Kuiba?

272
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:27,243
Destroy Kuiba! Preserve the peace!
Serve with honor! Destroy Kuiba!

273
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:32,370
Great heroes shouldn't be
stuck in the middle of nowhere.

274
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,851
They belong to the whole world.

275
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:41,719
Of course, we all hope that our
heroes can stay here in this village...

276
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,221
.. to keep us safe.

277
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,980
But Kuiba poses mortal
threat to all living souls.

278
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,392
Therefore,we must be
selfless in our sacrifice,

279
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,383
and send off our heroes for
the good of the entire world!

280
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,174
Send them off! Selflessly!

281
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,243
Remember to dress warmly.

282
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,655
Destroy Kuiba!

283
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,000
Protect the peace!

284
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,210
To our two spirit warriors...

285
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,328
Here!

286
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:18,612
Remember, you carry the love
and trust of Backwater Village...

287
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,468
and the hopes of the whole world.

288
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:26,931
Don't worry, Lord Chieftain.Backwater
Village will be famous wherever I go.

289
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,610
Absolutely for sure!

290
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,556
Very well. Off you go, then!

291
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,077
Destroy Kuiba!

292
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,422
Destroy Kuiba!

293
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,684
Preserve the peace!

294
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,213
Preserve the peace!

295
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,231
Serve with honor!

296
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:41,933
Serve with honor!

297
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,200
So this Kuiba...what's he like?

298
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,116
We won't know until we see him.

299
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,351
Where is he now?

300
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,530
Shhh.

301
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,042
Hsueh-lun?

302
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,482
Who's he? What does he do?

303
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,334
Pretty much everything except good deeds.

304
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,389
What is the meaning of this?

305
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:26,392
It's been a long time, Lord Chieftain.
You have been well, I trust’?

306
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,973
Quite well, Master Hsueh-lun,
thank you. Can I be of assistance?

307
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:36,817
Kuiba has returned. I'm taking men
to fight him and protect the peace.

308
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,043
How wonderfully heroic of you.

309
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,003
We fight Kuiba
to protect every one of you...

310
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,633
and we expect everyone to contribute.

311
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,608
I think I get your drift.

312
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:53,268
Empty out the bank, every last silver.
To support our heroic cause.

313
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,350
You've come to rob us.

314
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:56,775
To solicit donations.

315
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,606
We've already sent out
spirit warriors to fight.

316
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,621
We will support them, and no one else.

317
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,551
You don't know anything, you miserly,
tight-fisted old codger.

318
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,212
We'll have to teach you!

319
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,695
They've started fighting?

320
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,431
How did Master Man and Manji get so far?

321
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,603
I've got to catch them...

322
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,195
You know a trick or two, old man --

323
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,717
but you're still just an old man.

324
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,340
Don't throw your life away
for a few coins. Give it up.

325
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,916
Nonsense! As Chieftain of this village,
it is my duty to protect the villagers.

326
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,417
The money in that bank is all they have.

327
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,155
I'll die before
I let you get your hands on it.

328
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,570
Shut up!

329
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,186
I've only let you live
this long because killing

330
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,877
a useless old man would
be bad for my reputation.

331
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,248
Do you hear me?
Your chieftain wants to die for you.

332
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:23,888
If you want him to live,then tell him you'll
give me the money of your own free will.

333
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,205
Give it up.

334
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:43,852
Anybody else?

335
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,780
Me.

336
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:47,759
Me too!

337
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,985
Is that little Man?
l haven't seen you since school!

338
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,738
What are you doing here?

339
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,706
Since...school?

340
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,755
Call me Master Man, if you would be so good.

341
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,531
Oh, that's funny, little Man.

342
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,654
This is our chance.
We'll take the silver, fight Kuiba...

343
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,092
..and make a name for ourselves.
What do you say?

344
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,455
We can make a name for ourselves
without taking the silver. We're --

345
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,225
This is my village, Hsueh-lun.

346
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:29,851
Your village?

347
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:31,603
And I'll protect it.

348
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,292
You can't have been
here more than two years!

349
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:37,992
So what?

350
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:39,938
Are they worth protecting?

351
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:44,752
This miserable bunch of selfish,
short-sighted, grasping piss-ants?

352
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:48,181
Call them what you want.
I know these people.

353
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,991
We drink from the same river,
we eat the same crops,

354
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,331
we breathe the same
fresh mountain air...

355
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,678
...we may even dream the same dreams.

356
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:04,646
How poetic. I've always wondered
what the Princess saw in you.

357
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,514
No more nonsense, Hsueh-lun!

358
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,783
You'll rue the day you ran into Master Man.

359
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,790
If you don't clear out pronto,
I won't play nice with you!

360
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,596
I'd like to see you try.
"Snowstorm on Wolfpack Mountain!"

361
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,093
Colossus...blast!

362
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,739
"Blinding blizzard!"

363
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,240
Double-Pulse blast!

364
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,109
"Rice fireworks!"

365
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,078
Gah!

366
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,940
Triple-Pulse blast!

367
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:39,494
Pierce! Smash! Flatten!

368
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,080
Scram!

369
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,764
You've never beaten me, little Man.

370
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:52,991
That was then!

371
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,936
How come it's not working?

372
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,145
The Pulse won't work when I am rushed...

373
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,157
Colossus...blast!

374
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,432
"Crushing avalanche!"

375
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,796
I've got to be calm. Calm! Step by step!

376
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,620
Feel the Pulse, be one with the Pulse...

377
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,458
Master Man!

378
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,504
Can't get distracted.

379
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,276
Again! Feel the Pulse...why can't I feel it?

380
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:47,417
Start over! Feel the Pulse,
be one with the Pulse...the Pulse...

381
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,984
No good. I have to stay calm!

382
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,343
You're too young...

383
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,512
Focus. Back to basics.

384
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,147
Pulse-craft transcends physical reality...

385
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:12,667
it attunes the body to the Pulse
particles that exist in all things.

386
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:14,948
Draw your sword, Master Man!

387
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,534
Draw your sword first, Hsueh-lun.

388
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,592
You'd only make it dirty.

389
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:32,565
Feel the Pulse... become one with
the Pulse...clear the Pulse channels...

390
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,484
..unleash a Pulse attack!

391
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,270
Such astonishing power!

392
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,080
The Great Kuiba is great indeed!

393
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,339
Where could he be?

394
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,030
We have no way of knowing. Nobody does.

395
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:58,414
That's the only reason
the Great Kuiba survived.

396
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,258
Does he know that
we're waiting to serve him?

397
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,716
No, he doesn't. Nobody
would expect anything

398
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,087
to be alive still on Maelstrom Island.

399
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,727
But Kuiba will surely come
to retrieve his Soaring Lance.

400
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:18,048
But how?No ordinary being can
pass through the Torque Path here.

401
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:22,533
Kuiba is no ordinary being. He is Kuiba.

402
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:29,509
He will follow the call of his Soaring Lance
like a war song off beyond the horizon.

403
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:36,190
He will sing along quietly as
he comes to retrieve his weapon,

404
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:43,233
Nothing can stop him.
He is the greatest in all the worlds.

405
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,693
So what do we do now?

406
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,141
We wait for Kuiba. And for his enemies, too.

407
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,341
I'll get you for this, Man!

408
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,891
I never thought Man had
it in him to fight like that!

409
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,901
Could it be that when we fought,
he was...going easy on me?

410
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:08,525
Lord Chieftain?

411
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:10,982
Where's Gujitai?

412
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,180
He went to look for you. Didn't you see him?

413
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,024
No.

414
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:18,082
Then why'd you come back?

415
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:24,107
It was Master Man's idea.He saw Hsueh-lun
coming and knew he was up to no good.

416
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:29,927
It was nothing, really. A trifle.
Just wait'll we take on Kuiba...

417
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,572
Kuiba won't be so easy to deal with.

418
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:37,932
Don't worry.Kuiba's only tough because
he's never met Master Man before!

419
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,737
Absolutely for sure!

420
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:44,715
Mm. Er...Everyone wishes that our

421
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,755
heroes can in this
village to keep us safe...

422
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,508
That's right! Stay, please, stay here!

423
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:56,061
But nobody will be safe
until Kuiba's destroyed.

424
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,315
He really thinks he can take on Kuiba.

425
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:04,975
You put it well, Lord Chieftain.Great heroes
shouldn't be stuck in the middle of nowhere.

426
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,951
We belong to the whole world.

427
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,950
Look after yourselves,
my friends. We have a mission!

428
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:13,531
Yeah!

429
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:17,966
Oh... 1 thought maybe...
you'd stay for a meal first...

430
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,410
That's the last we'll ever see of them.

431
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,415
So is Kuiba even worse than Hsueh-lun?

432
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:31,069
Much worse.He's the baddest, meanest,
scariest monstor ever.

433
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,930
Worse than a hundred
Hsueh-luns put together.

434
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,869
So the Chieftain couldn't beat him?

435
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,141
Not at all.

436
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:38,846
The Governor?

437
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:40,308
Not a chance.

438
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:41,439
Wow, that is bad.

439
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,997
It's all up to Master Man now.

440
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,605
And me too!

441
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:52,733
Keep up the good work.We'll be the
most famous heroes after we kill Kuiba.

442
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,289
And our Shard will be the
most respected one of all.

443
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,388
We'll be the greatest spirit warriors ever!

444
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,068
So it's the Tree Kingdom on the other side?

445
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:19,694
That's right. Up ahead is the capital,
Mirado the greatest city in the world.

446
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,590
And then there's a boat, right?

447
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,697
Yes, in Greenleaf Bay.

448
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,726
Wow! Look at all those houses!

449
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:32,743
See the biggest tree over there?
The King's palace is right under that.

450
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:34,692
And what's tha--

451
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,284
Come along now.
There'll be plenty of time to look later.

452
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,784
Hey, innkeeper! We're spirit warriors
from the Great Beast Nation.

453
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,900
Here's our Shard.
We'll take your finest room.

454
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,140
In my admittedly limited experience, sir...

455
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:10,598
.. this is the first time I've ever seen
such a Shard. Truly remarkable.

456
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,796
It's the most powerful
Shard in the whole world!

457
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,598
We'd like a room facing the street,
with a view of Sunrise Boulevard.

458
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:17,945
We don't have any.

459
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:25,669
A room without a view would be OK too.

460
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,318
We're all out.

461
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,629
What?

462
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,548
We don't have a single room available.
ldo apologize,sir.

463
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:40,759
At this fine time of year, sir,there's
a lot to be said for sleeping in the street.

464
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:42,617
What?!

465
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:43,791
l beg your pardon.

466
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:50,661
What is it?

467
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,888
The Shard of the Dragon tribe!

468
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,014
The Shard of a spirit warrior
of the Dragon tribe, no less.

469
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:12,108
Master! Master! Words can't
describe what an honor this is, sir!

470
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:20,398
Let's go.

471
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,233
Why is he crying?

472
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:23,828
He's crying?

473
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,445
A Dragon spirit warrior!

474
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,367
The Shard of a Dragon spirit warrior!
And such magnificence --

475
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:32,427
Those eyes!

476
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:33,384
That hair!

477
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:34,262
That nose!

478
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:35,726
Those lips!

479
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,214
So dashing!

480
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,792
He's to die for!

481
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,547
Might I trouble you?

482
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,651
I would be the luckiest man in the land
if l could help you, my lord!

483
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:51,291
It is a small inn, of course,
and we only have three rooms.

484
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,836
If you would care to choose...

485
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,161
Four rooms would be better.

486
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,841
Consider it done, my lord!

487
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,394
This way, my lord.

488
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:04,753
Please rest a spell, my lord.
Your rooms will be ready shortly.

489
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,017
Hey, innkeeper.

490
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,797
Refresh yourself, my lord.
And have some tea - fresh-picked...

491
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,634
Innkeeper! Didn't you just say
there weren't any rooms?

492
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,522
Sir, please control your child.

493
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,118
Don't tell me what to do.

494
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,974
All we want is a room with a view.
Do you have one or don't you?

495
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:35,204
Sir, l treated you with courtesy
earlier because your child was present.

496
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,444
Please don't make things difficult.

497
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,422
I apologize for the...disturbance, my lord.

498
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,339
Do you have a map of Tree Kingdom?

499
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,097
Right away, my lord.

500
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,226
That guy with the long face is weird --

501
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,592
why do you want
all those rooms for just yourself?

502
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,156
Please mind your manners, young sir...

503
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,732
I just asked a question.
What's wrong with that?

504
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,433
Hey, Long-Face, I'm talking to you.

505
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,917
He's adorable.Please give him some sweets.

506
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:23,093
I don't want sweets.I want to know why
you want so many rooms for just one person.

507
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,239
Sir!

508
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:32,776
And my answer: I want a room for myself.

509
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:34,654
That's one room.

510
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,953
Through all my many battles and adventures,
my trusty sword has been at my side.

511
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:45,319
It's my closest friend - so naturally
it should have a room to itself.

512
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,698
If you say so, but that's only two rooms.

513
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,284
In my bags I have clothes my mother
made for me with her own hands.

514
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:58,848
I carry them so that it will
be as if she were with me..

515
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,111
Fine, a room for your mother,
too. That's three.

516
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:06,202
l also carry an edict from the Dragon King.

517
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:12,971
As his subject, I treat it with the same
respect I would show the King himself.

518
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,587
That's four, sure enough.

519
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:24,497
If every flea on your body wanted a room
to itself, four wouldn't even be enough!

520
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:31,609
Hey, why didn't I think of that?
You sure are clever, Master Man!

521
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,494
Surely you must know the meaning of the
Shard of a Dragon spirit warrior means, sir!

522
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,162
It's just a Shard, isn't it?

523
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,271
Master Man's Shard is also the
most powerful one in the world!

524
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,357
Looks like there's no way out of this.

525
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,691
Please, sir, be realistic. A nameless,

526
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:54,971
crude Shard like yours -- why,
it's hardly worth anything.

527
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:02,360
Nonsense!Shards aren't what make
a spirit warrior -- it's Pulsecraft!

528
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,423
With a Shard like yours,
I'm sure I have nothing to fear.

529
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:12,224
x You think a famous Shard
is equal to powerful Pulsecraft?

530
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:18,911
Why, of course.That's how the Ten Great
Shards became the Ten Great Shards.

531
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,648
We'll settle this with a Pulsecraft duel!

532
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,125
A duel!

533
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,083
What do you say? A Pulsecraft duel?

534
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,553
How come he's still reading?

535
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,579
He doesn't even look offended!

536
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,982
To be sure, a Pulsecraft duel is how
spirit warriors settle matters...

537
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,306
...but going by your Shard,
I'm afraid you simply don't qualify.

538
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,851
What? We can't even challenge him?

539
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:54,447
Oh, young master, a true spirit warrior
would know all about these rules.

540
00:37:55,874 --> 00:38:00,823
I really didn't know there were rules
about this! Now what do I do?

541
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,128
Damn it!

542
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:18,421
Very well.
l accept your challenge.

543
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:20,961
He accepted?!

544
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:22,456
Then make your move!

545
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,102
Your opponent is Keraschok
Pan, spirit warrior

546
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,593
of the Secluded Dragon Pool,
from the Dragon Kingdom.

547
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,441
Your opponent is Man
Xiaoman, spirit warrior of

548
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,402
the Nomad tribe,from
the great Beast Nation.

549
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:34,928
And I'm Manji!

550
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:43,422
The arrogant bastard won't even stand
up to face me?Fine, then. Stay sitting.

551
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,096
They're starting!

552
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,433
"Coiled cyclone dragon?"

553
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:03,913
Why's the Pulse coming back at us?

554
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,813
Watch this!

555
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,672
A spirit warriors' duel is between
two people and two people only.

556
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,152
Really?

557
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,569
Didn't that man tell you anything?

558
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,802
I thought you wanted a fight.
How come you don't fight like it?

559
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:35,595
Shut up! Colossus - Eclipse - Blast!

560
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,555
I didn't know he could do that! Wow!

561
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,448
Master Man!

562
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,000
Hold on. I'm not finished yet!

563
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:27,396
Let it go, sir! It's plain to see that you
simply haven't got the technique --

564
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,730
You're out of your depth here.
Just look at your Shard--

565
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,440
You won't find another Shard like mine,
no matter how long you look.

566
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,107
Wow!

567
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:45,306
Everyone knows the power of my Shard.
All l have to do is hang it right here,

568
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:49,084
and thieves will run away
at the mere sight of it.

569
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:50,917
When will you pass it on to me?

570
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,383
Something this powerful,well...

571
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,134
it's not something that
just anyone can handle.

572
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,136
Please, Master Man!

573
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,484
Not until you're as powerful as I am.

574
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,041
Watch this!

575
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,308
His fourth Pulse channel!

576
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,663
Fourth -- there are four Pulse channels?

577
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:15,952
Watch and learn. When the
fourth Pulse channel is opened,

578
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:19,048
it vibrates to create
what's called Shard Resonance!

579
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:24,348
You should be grateful, young man.

580
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,929
This mighty warrior is
showing you true Pulsecraft,

581
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:32,498
so that you won't be so easily
fooled by frauds in the future.

582
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:39,098
Such status, such artistry --
it's wasted on an opponent like your father.

583
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,341
Master Man, how many
Pulse channels can you open?

584
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,497
Even opening one Pulse channel
takes impressive skill, you know.

585
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:53,141
Even a great master like me
can only open up three.

586
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,207
Three! Wow!

587
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:02,355
It's not about how many you can open,
but about how nimbly you can use them.

588
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:09,298
Don't listen to these fools, Manji.
They don't know greatness when they see it.

589
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:15,242
"Greatness" isn't something you can
just claim. It has to be earned.

590
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:23,587
If l were a weak braggart who
couldn't even open his fourth channel...

591
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,598
...l wouldn't use the word so freely.

592
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:31,048
If you need someone new
to admire, young sir,

593
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,209
you couldn't do better
than this great warrior.

594
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:39,643
Quiet, you! So you can open your
fourth Pulse channel. So what?

595
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,275
You use your fourth Pulse channel on me,
and I'll use real Pulsecraft on you!

596
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,758
So that's how it is.

597
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,004
Shard in the dirt! the shame --

598
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,921
So that's how it is!

599
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:19,495
What's going on?

600
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:22,382
I'll pay for all the damage.

601
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:23,947
Very well, my lord.

602
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,384
Manji, I...

603
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:39,687
This was all your fault! You started
the fight over your worthless Shard,

604
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:42,408
and you let the child down who trusted you!

605
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,290
It's not a worthless Shard!

606
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:04,576
l always knew the Shard
wasn't famous or powerful,

607
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:09,577
or from the Immortal Alliance.
I knew he made it himself.

608
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,136
One time he broke it by accidentally

609
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,040
so he made himself
a new Shard from wood. I saw it.

610
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,480
Manjj...you -- you knew?

611
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:26,730
So what? I knew that Master Man,

612
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,921
who can't even open his
fourth Pulse channel,

613
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,774
carved this Shard himself
to make me feel prouder,

614
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:38,729
because he didn't want me to know the truth.
Because he didn't want me to give up.

615
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:42,412
That's why he's the
greatest spirit warrior!

616
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,903
That's why this is the most
precious of all the Shards!

617
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,288
You'd still want a Shard like that?

618
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,998
Absolutely for sure!

619
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:56,923
Then I, Master Man, will now pass
my Shard on to you. Manji!

620
00:44:57,762 --> 00:44:58,582
I -- I'm not ready yet...

621
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,043
Bring it here.

622
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:01,121
Yes sir, Master Man.

623
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,660
Manji?

624
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:03,737
Yes sir!

625
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,956
Let Heaven and Earth be my witnesses:
l bequeath to you, here and now,

626
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:12,284
this Shard of the Nomad tribe.
Use it wisely.

627
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:14,953
Yes sir, Master Man! I won't let you down!

628
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,960
But what about you...

629
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:24,989
Oh, don't worry.
I've got another one right here.

630
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,880
Didn't see that one coming, did you?
That's the Nomad tribe for you!

631
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,279
The first rule of the Nomad Shard:

632
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,152
Never give up, as long as you live!

633
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:46,486
Let the duel continue!

634
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:47,821
Master Man!

635
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:48,779
.ls that Xiaoman?

636
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:55,776
Her voice sounds so familiar. Could it be...

637
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:02,556
Mother?

638
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,558
Shut up! She's not your mother!
How many times do I have to tell you?

639
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:08,595
What a good boy.

640
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:13,125
The Princess! Your Highness,
er, this -- l can explain...

641
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,681
Never mind. There's a war on,
after all. Things get messy.

642
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:22,519
lam Keraschok Pan,
a spirit warrior of the Dragon Kingdom,

643
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,761
and a decorated member of the advance guard.
I wish Your Highness health and happiness.

644
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:30,335
Thank you. I hope you will
feel at home in our kingdom.

645
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,491
Wait -- Manji!

646
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:39,517
Manjji...and XiaoMan...

647
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:28,154
Wow, look at that!

648
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:31,366
That's the Torque Path 1.
Smaller than you imagined, I bet.

649
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:36,649
It's pretty huge. I bet they can fit a lot
of people on it.Once we get on there,

650
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:40,587
we'll be on our way
to fight Kuiba! This is great!

651
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:41,862
Hang on!

652
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:43,503
What?

653
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:44,897
Don't forget these.

654
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,986
See that? That's a Shard scanner.

655
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,937
When that light hits a powerful Shard,
the Shard begins to glow.

656
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,471
That's the Shard resonance thingy?

657
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:18,395
Yeah, more or less.

658
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:19,336
Got it.

659
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:14,748
That guy's everywhere!

660
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,015
Manji?

661
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,462
Why not do this the easy way?

662
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:24,987
The easy way? Absolutely for sure,
we'll do it the easy way!

663
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,565
Uh -- what's the easy way, Master Man?

664
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,560
Let's get our hands on a couple
of Shards that they'll recognize.

665
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:39,372
Sure, we'll get our...
you don't mean...stealing?

666
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:44,080
Call it what you like, but
if we don't get on that ship,

667
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:47,391
we'll never make
a name for ourselves.

668
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,469
But we've got Shards already.
Why do we have to steal Shards?

669
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,670
Look, you know this.
They don't know about our Shards.

670
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,402
But they will, someday!

671
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:04,000
"Someday" is a long way in the future,

672
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,901
and we need to find a way
onto that ship right now.

673
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:07,961
Then...we'll just shove our way on.

674
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,616
That -- that would be
unbecoming to a hero like me.

675
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:13,633
This is what happens to thieves!

676
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,584
There's a fight!

677
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,286
Who is it?

678
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:19,222
Stop! Stop! Don't let him get away!

679
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:28,587
The Dragon warrior?!

680
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:30,643
Long-Face! What's all this about?

681
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,880
This Shard is stolen! The code
on it was revoked a year ago.

682
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:37,957
And his royal edict is fake, too!

683
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:39,892
Shameless!

684
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:41,261
How dare he steal a Shard?

685
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:42,939
Kill him!

686
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,591
Order! Order!

687
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:45,842
Everybody stay calm!

688
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,516
Come on -- this is our chance
to get on that ship. Move!

689
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:02,292
Stop! Trying to sneak on, are you?
Get back, all of you!

690
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,001
Nobody's dared to steal a Shard in years.

691
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:07,763
Get back! Deck crew!

692
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:08,992
He's a dead man.

693
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:15,025
You there, don't move!
Why are you still moving? Get back!

694
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,289
Scram! Don't make me use force!

695
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,625
You, you, you, and you
that's right, you --

696
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,621
Get off, all of you.

697
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:27,984
That's right, get back. Thank you.

698
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:32,295
And you too -- yes, you.
You think you can slip on?

699
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,362
Everybody, please cooperate.

700
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:42,105
So it was that guy, eh?

701
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,740
You know him?

702
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:48,175
He had some talent, once.What would
he go and do something like that for?

703
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:56,125
I never thought you could be so low!
You're disgusting!

704
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:03,343
I knew a guy who didn't have a Shard either.
1 don't mean he didn't have a Great Shard,

705
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,589
I mean he didn't have any.

706
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:10,400
Nobody took him seriously.
Nobody wanted to be his friend.

707
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,731
When children from
families with Great Shards

708
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:16,752
had their big coming of age ceremonies,

709
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:20,837
he just stood off to
the side, watching them.

710
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:23,268
They were born into
fortune and happiness,

711
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:25,924
and he never got a taste of it.

712
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:32,111
He was jealous of them, of course.
He dreamed of having a Shard of his own --

713
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:36,486
but he never thought of
stealing!He didn't want

714
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,827
to be just given respect;
he wanted to earn it.

715
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:44,614
No matter how hard, no matter how risky,
no matter how much blood, sweat and tears,

716
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,026
he knew he could do it.

717
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,484
He knew that one day he would be
the greatest spirit warrior in the world --

718
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:56,997
and he knew that a stolen Shard
wouldn't make him a great warrior.

719
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:00,642
He wanted to make a name for himself

720
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,894
something more valuable
than any Shard could ever be!

721
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:06,810
Yeah! What's so great
about a stupid Shard anyway?

722
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:09,862
Skills speak louder than Shards!

723
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:14,557
You've got powerful skills
-- why don't you use them?

724
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,188
Show them you're stronger than them!

725
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:27,520
Why don't you fight back?

726
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,125
What's that child yelling about?

727
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:33,855
Why don't you show them how
powerful your Pulse blasts are?

728
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:44,893
Didn't you say this was your closest friend?
Why don't you pick it up?

729
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,578
What about the clothes your mother made?

730
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:57,133
You said they made you
feel like she was with you

731
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:59,504
- and now you let people step on them?

732
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:05,768
What about your fourth channel?
Your Shard resonance? What happened to them?

733
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:08,821
What are you talking about, kid?

734
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:15,638
Don't you know? He's so much stronger
than all of you, but he's not fighting back.

735
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,689
He knows he's done the most
disgraceful thing a man can do.

736
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,620
Small wonder he doesn't fight back.

737
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:25,528
And you beat him
knowing full well that he

738
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:27,309
wouldn't hit back.
Where's the honor in that?

739
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,466
Why don't you ask yourselves why he
stole that stupid thing in the first place?

740
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,171
If he could get into the
army on his own skills,

741
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,013
Why would he do something like this?

742
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,420
Stand up, Long-Face. Like at the inn.
Show them what you can do.

743
00:54:44,081 --> 00:54:47,241
See if they can stand up against you.
Let them see who's the strongest here.

744
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:53,365
Stand up! What's wrong with you?

745
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,968
He doesn't have the heart for it.

746
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:58,868
Then I'll fight you both for him.

747
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,231
If l win, you'll have to let him go.

748
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:07,461
This is...a bit much
for you to take on, kid.

749
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:11,445
We'll see. What do you say
-- challenge you to a warrior's duel!

750
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,035
Awarriors' duel?

751
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:17,097
You think you can challenge us to a spirit
warriors’ duel with a Shard like yours?

752
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,721
I'll have you know that this is
a Shard of the Nomad tribe!

753
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:23,345
Yeah! Go for it!

754
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:27,774
This kid is really going to fight
a duel over a Shard thief?

755
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,219
The crowd's too big. We don't
want this to get out of control.

756
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:35,365
With you and me here, Your Excellency,
I don't think that will be a problem.

757
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,975
lam Manji of the Nomad Tribe,
from Backwater Village,

758
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,286
Youwei County, in the
Great Beast Nation.

759
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,860
Accept his challenge.

760
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:57,687
l, spirit warrior Dicho
of the Gleam tribe,

761
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,238
instructor of the first army
corps of the Immortal Alliance,

762
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,526
and captain of the Imperial
Guard, accept your challenge.

763
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,637
Perhaps you'll learn some respect today.

764
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,033
Please begin.

765
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:15,268
From the Beast Nation, eh?
He's one of yours, General...

766
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:18,241
After all the trouble we
had getting on board...

767
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:20,292
I don't believe it; l won't
believe it; 1 can't believe it!

768
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,432
He's really fighting...fighting...fighting
the captain of the Imperial Guard?!

769
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:34,083
This is a travesty.

770
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,192
It's not often that
you get to see something

771
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:39,004
you've never seen before.An
age difference like this?

772
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:43,336
Get him!

773
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,399
Now's my chance!

774
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:02,998
I thought the kid was going
to be some kind of prodigy.

775
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:04,850
Not a chance.

776
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,296
don't remember seeing any spirit
warriors like this in my country.

777
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:09,935
Why so serious?

778
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,290
You think you can fight a
duel with Pulsecraft like that?

779
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:13,428
It's not over yet.

780
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,555
Wow, that's fast!

781
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,567
What am I going to do?

782
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,822
Huh? Hey, not bad!

783
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:40,274
The kid's trying to hem me
in so I can't fire any Pulse blasts.

784
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:43,395
If l can just tangle him up, he won't
have the chance to get any blasts off.

785
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,991
I've got to get free of this
and knock him down with a single blast.

786
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:48,571
Uh-oh.

787
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:53,459
"Dizzying meteors!"

788
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:01,631
Hold tight!

789
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,025
He's not going to hold up
much longer. I've got to...

790
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:10,419
..Wait a minute. If I get
off this ship I won't be

791
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,000
able to get back on.
What am I going to do?

792
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,281
Just keep wearing him out.
His Pulse blasts are getting weaker.

793
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:20,939
"Dizzying meteors!"

794
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:23,926
Impossible!

795
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,287
If lcan charge up and stay close...

796
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,446
He's got no chance.
If it were me fighting, what would I do?

797
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,592
Charge forward and stay in close...

798
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,078
.if it were me,
I'd try to divert his attention.

799
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,580
The ship is about to sail!

800
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:37,844
The ship's leaving.

801
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:41,005
I've got time. "Dizzying meteors!"

802
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,086
The ship is leaving!

803
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:10,843
Wow! Amazing!

804
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,175
That's my boy! I mean, er,
where are that little kid's parents...?

805
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:19,906
The hell with this! "Ground chop!"

806
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,104
Sneak attack! That's a dirty trick!

807
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,831
"Heaven's net!"

808
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:35,511
That was a sneak attack!

809
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:36,989
What kind of warriors’ duel is this?

810
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:38,491
Shame! Shame on you!

811
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,995
Oh? Why so serious now, general?

812
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:48,947
Like Master Man said, a true warrior
is always on guard against sneak attacks.

813
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,470
You can't just jump into a
warrior's duel unannounced!

814
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,225
Your opponent is Manji,
of Backwater Village,

815
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:58,536
in Youwei County in
the Great Beast Nation.

816
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:00,522
Yeah!

817
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,365
Game over,
kid. don't have time

818
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,556
to play with you -- I'm
here to keep order...

819
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,949
You're just saying that because you lost!

820
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:10,906
Your opponent is Manji,
of Backwater Village,

821
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,047
in Youwei County in
the Great Beast Nation.

822
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,180
I'm not going to fight a duel against
a boy with a wooden Shard.

823
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:18,346
Don't talk about people's Shards like that!

824
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:21,156
You just think you're special because
you've got one of the Great Shards!

825
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:27,335
Pulsecraft like that, and a Shard that
can't resonate -- you got lucky, that's all.

826
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:29,348
You lost! Admit it!

827
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:30,843
Shut up about the Shard!

828
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:32,021
What's so great about Shard resonance?

829
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,363
Your little tricks might
impress people back home,

830
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,764
but they're no good in a fight.

831
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:40,553
You'd be no use to us,
even if you could get on that ship.

832
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,471
We'll show you!

833
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:44,767
Your opponent is --

834
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:48,922
..Manji, of Backwater
Village in Youwei County...

835
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,420
Stand still! Don't come any closer!

836
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:59,183
He's scared! The man is scared!Ouch!

837
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:02,298
Your opponent is Manji,

838
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:06,446
..in the Great Beast Nation.

839
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:07,900
Manji!

840
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:10,415
Stop!

841
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,308
Stand still!

842
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:15,381
No closer!

843
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:27,761
I've got to get down there.
Excuse me -- coming through...

844
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,272
I've never seen a kid like that before.

845
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,508
Your opponent is Manji,
of Backwater Village,

846
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:54,939
in Youwei County in
the Great Beast Nation.

847
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:21,908
A Pulse array?! Who's doing this?

848
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:26,816
"Me!" "I am!" "Over here!"

849
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:31,145
A person who has opened
their fourth Pulse channel

850
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,337
can create a Pulse array
through another spirit warrior.

851
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,430
Right now, it's like the boy is
acting like a resonant Shard.

852
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:43,306
This child is all of our Shards,
all of our resonances, combined!

853
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,951
Don't ignore the boy.
He's a spirit warrior, just like us!

854
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:51,134
Everyone here is a spirit warrior!
Everyone here has the right to fight!

855
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:55,537
Maybe we'll never have the
chance to fight the enemy

856
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,318
and show the world what we're made of.

857
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:02,232
So what! We can still show
the people from the Immortal Alliance

858
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:06,546
just how powerful those
warriors you ignore can be.

859
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,485
This -- this is mutiny against
the Immortal Alliance!

860
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:12,808
Your opponent is from --

861
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:13,639
Boundless Mountain...

862
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,720
Misty Land...

863
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:15,571
Iron River...

864
01:03:15,859 --> 01:03:16,589
The Talik tribe...

865
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:21,358
Wow! I've never seen such
a powerful Pulse array!

866
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,022
Should we order the troops to open fire?

867
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:28,000
Do you want to start a civil war? Besides,
any damage to Torque Path 1...

868
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:31,415
...means Kuiba gets more time
to grow up on Maelstrom Island.

869
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:33,654
But the situation is getting out of hand...

870
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:36,854
So we roll with the punches.

871
01:03:38,615 --> 01:03:42,895
Hundreds of strangers, with no training,
somehow create a Pulse array

872
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,710
to protect a little boy who
doesn't even have a Shard...

873
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:54,319
To ensure that safety Torque Path 1,
they're asking for permission to launch.

874
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,052
Prepare to launch!

875
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:00,208
Get down! Down! Are you all right?

876
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:01,457
I'm fine.

877
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,548
Torque Path 1, prepare for launch!

878
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:10,279
What do I do now? Manji's
always trusted me like a father,

879
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,120
but now there's nothing
l can do for him...

880
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:20,354
It looks like the odds are pretty heavily
on his side. The boy will be fine.

881
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,371
What happened?

882
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:45,054
What?

883
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,329
A spirit warrior's duel is between
two people - never three.

884
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,555
I may not be able to
open my fourth channel,

885
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,276
and I may not have a Shard
-- but I'm a Nomad warrior,

886
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:01,176
and I want to fight a fair, one-on-one
duel like any other spirit warrior!

887
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,072
Wow! I just love this kid!

888
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:07,621
The Nomad tribe...is that one of the
older tribes in the Beast Nation?

889
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:12,101
It's no tribe at all -- the child
made it up out of thin air.

890
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:14,645
Enough! Time to put an end to this farce!

891
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:19,381
Once you've opened
all your channels, kid,

892
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:22,132
you'll be ready to take
on Kuiba by yourself!

893
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:24,343
Your opponent is --

894
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,584
Enough!

895
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,015
General,sir!

896
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:30,786
This duel...is over.

897
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:31,961
Who's that guy?

898
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,129
The general from the Beast Nation.

899
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,031
I thought a spirit warrior from
the Beast Nation would know that.

900
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:39,344
Oh, him.

901
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:41,506
Maybe he'll let the kid join the army...

902
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,805
If you're the general...
then order that man who

903
01:05:43,807 --> 01:05:45,386
attacked me without
even giving his name...

904
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:48,592
..to accept my challenge
to a fair warrior's duel.

905
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,212
Yeah!

906
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:53,417
Enough of this!
l command you to go back home!

907
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:55,711
The duel isn't over yet!

908
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:59,426
He's just a boy, sir -- he doesn't know
any better. There's no need for a fight --

909
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,120
we could charge him
with disorderly conduct...

910
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,063
Did I ask your opinion?

911
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:06,727
No more talking! This is a duel!

912
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:07,803
Silence!

913
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:12,287
The Beast Nation general...

914
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,120
.. is used to getting his way.

915
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:28,096
Lord General, why did --

916
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,131
Insubordination!

917
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:32,544
This is bad.

918
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:39,898
Whaaa -- the ship is moving?

919
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:44,232
Your childish tricks are an insult...

920
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:47,074
.. to every true spirit
warrior of the Beast Nation!

921
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,729
Let me off! I have to get off! Let me off!

922
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:54,530
Stop shoving!

923
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:55,481
I need to get off this ship!

924
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:58,092
We've already left our moorings.
Nobody gets on or off this ship!

925
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,501
But I --

926
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:00,862
Just calm down, friend.

927
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,341
Lord General, why are you --

928
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,388
Warrior Manji! You are
wounded, and in no condition

929
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,520
to keep fighting.
Perhaps a later rematch...

930
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:14,596
The first rule of the
Nomad tribe: never give

931
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,497
up as long as you live! Lord General...

932
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,274
You still want to fight?
I'll seal off all of your

933
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:28,116
Pulse channels! Let's
see how you fight then!

934
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,685
Seal my Pulse channels?!

935
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,747
Remember, you can
never let your opponent

936
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:35,058
get close enough to seal
off your Pulse channels.

937
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:38,185
If they do that, then no amount of

938
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:40,237
Pulsecraft will save
you. You'll be done for.

939
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:44,218
If he seals my channels,
I won't be able to fight Kuiba!

940
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,105
Daddy!

941
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:02,162
Ch'i-hung San!

942
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:11,636
Master Man!

943
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,721
Ch'i-hung San!

944
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,764
Kuiba!

945
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:32,497
What's going on?

946
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,316
Don't panic!

947
01:08:46,022 --> 01:08:47,421
Wh- what on earth is that thing?

948
01:08:48,256 --> 01:08:50,336
It's Kuiba's Pulse Beast!
Everybody prepare for battle!

949
01:08:53,895 --> 01:08:57,435
Don't panic! Emergency
formation! Fire warning shots!

950
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:03,483
Torque Path 1, move to full speed!
Activate optical shields!

951
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,510
Optical shields activated!

952
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:08,033
Kuiba --

953
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:09,461
Manji...

954
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:11,877
What do you think you're doing?

955
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:13,442
Let me off!

956
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:17,006
At a time like this? Are you deliberately
trying to damage the optical shields?

957
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,307
I have to get off this ship, right now!

958
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:21,767
That guy's crazy! Stop him!

959
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,045
Manji!

960
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:30,245
If they seal your channels,
no amount of Pulsecraft will save you.

961
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,783
I'll seal off all of your Pulse channels!
Let's see how you fight then!

962
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,299
Pulse array!

963
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:02,167
Form lines of defense! Everybody
spread out! No crowding!

964
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:05,422
Rapid retreat! Spread out!

965
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,029
You can't use Pulsecraft inside
the optical shields - it could destroy them!

966
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,443
Lord Officers, I have
a confession to make.

967
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:16,464
You know those Shards
that you were checking?

968
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:21,650
Mine's not one of the Great Shards.

969
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:25,111
I shouldn't even be on this
ship! Kick me off, why don't you?

970
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:29,522
Cool it, friend. You took all that trouble
to get on board, why run off now?

971
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:33,583
You were just saying that
you'd beat Kuiba, Shard or no Shard --

972
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,629
now there are many other warriors
who snuck on just like you.

973
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:42,835
You can't just turn your back on them
after firing them up with your speech.

974
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:50,083
What about your boy? He kept fighting,
even though he knew he couldn't win.

975
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,518
That was my doing.l
wish I'd never filled his

976
01:10:56,519 --> 01:10:59,269
head with ideals I
can't live up to myself.

977
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,791
All that stuff about
fame, about defeating Kuiba

978
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:05,042
- l should've kept it to myself.

979
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:11,032
I'm coming, Manji! I'm coming!

980
01:11:56,312 --> 01:12:02,962
Blitz attack formation! Full power!
Give it everything you've got!

981
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,110
Resonance array, prepare to
launch a combined Pulse blast!

982
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:09,721
Fire!

983
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:43,233
Anyone still alive, attack its back as
hard as you can. Draw its attention.

984
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:46,934
Don't let it near Torque Path 1!

985
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:50,755
It's coming this way!

986
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:54,936
Stay calm and focus on the enemy.

987
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,367
Increase optical shields and prepare
to move through the Torque Path portal

988
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:13,755
We're just going to
be sitting ducks here?

989
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,976
Turn off the stupid shields
and let us fight back!

990
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:19,339
Shut up, you lunatic, or I'll teach you
to take orders the hard way.

991
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:30,862
Optical shields are in danger!

992
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:40,012
Hang on!

993
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:45,754
Your opponent is Man Xiaoman,
a warrior of the Nomad

994
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,245
tribe from Backwater Village
in the Great Beast Nation.

995
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:50,692
Nomad tribe?

996
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,400
That's the Nomad tribe for you!

997
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,500
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, that I ever even
thought of making a name for myself.

998
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:02,275
Sorry that I brought a child
to this awful place.

999
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:07,582
Sorry that I filled the boy's head with
nonsense about shards and warriors.

1000
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:12,615
Sorry that I ever said "Never give
up as long as you live." That was crap.

1001
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:16,782
But I'm not sorry
to be facing you now,Kuiba!

1002
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:22,907
I bet I'm the first warrior to tell you
his name this time around, aren't I?

1003
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:28,853
You'll rue the day you ran into Master Man!

1004
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:33,165
Master Man? Master...Man?

1005
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:39,033
My pleasure, Kuiba!May we both bear
all mortal risks willingly and honorably.

1006
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,389
Colossus Blast!

1007
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:52,718
Master Man...

1008
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:56,393
Don't call me "Daddy," call me "Master Man.”

1009
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:03,074
Daddy...Master Man...Daddy? Who...

1010
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,009
Colossus - Eclipse - Blast!

1011
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:12,054
No, no counter-attack. Not a single move...

1012
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,944
I... can't control it!

1013
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:22,946
Soaring - Colossus - Burst!

1014
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:30,772
You mustn't attack this one!
Don't harm a hair on his head!

1015
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:35,421
What are you waiting for?
We're dead anyway, let's go out fighting!

1016
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,752
Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

1017
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,239
You still want to fight?
I'll seal off all of your

1018
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,990
Pulse channels!Let's
see how you fight then!

1019
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:51,715
That's it -- better to seal off my Pulse
channels than to attack this warrior...

1020
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:55,617
Are you all just waiting to die?

1021
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:00,648
There's no time!

1022
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:05,863
Focus our power --
get ready to attack together!

1023
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:13,285
Shut off the optical shields.
Fire everything you've got! It's do or die!

1024
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:26,883
Last chance -- give it everything you can!

1025
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,853
Use all your power!

1026
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:07,415
Begin searching for wounded personnel.
Reorganize and reload,

1027
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:10,124
and increase our defenses against
another Pulse Beast attack.

1028
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:14,239
Torque Path 1,
full speed ahead to Maelstrom Island!

1029
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:29,627
Manji...

1030
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:35,777
Manji...

1031
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,218
Manji!

1032
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,359
Manji!

1033
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,540
The ship's left...and Master Man?

1034
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,585
Master Man! Wait! Take me with you!

1035
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:17,425
Hold tight! Daddy will be right there!

1036
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:19,911
...My leg!

1037
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:26,639
Master Man! You said we'd
go fight Kuiba together...

1038
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,421
Manji!

1039
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,918
Master Man! I don't want to be here!

1040
01:18:56,665 --> 01:19:07,565
Take me with you,
Master Man! Daddy! Daddy!

1041
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:19,491
Long-Face?

1042
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:24,229
Manji!

1043
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:49,711
Manji!

1044
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:50,999
Daddy!

1045
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:58,913
Long-Face?

1046
01:19:59,695 --> 01:20:01,884
Hang on - I've got to thank him.

1047
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:05,249
Where did he disappear to?

1048
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:09,880
Now that's what I call skill. Oh well
- we'll have our chance, I'm sure.

1049
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:12,186
You think we'll see him again?

1050
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:18,328
I'm sure of it. When we go up against Kuiba,
all the world's warriors will be with us.

1051
01:20:19,682 --> 01:20:23,371
Yeah - and then he'll see we're the
greatest warriors in the whole wide world.
