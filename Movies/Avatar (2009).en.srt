1
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,763
When I was lying there in the VA haspital,

2
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,692
with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,

3
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,049
I started having these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,010
l was free.

5
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,551
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

6
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,078
In eryo, you don't dream at all.

7
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,087
lt doesn't feel like six years.

8
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,586
More like a fifth of tequila
and an ass-kicking.

9
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,032
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

10
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,231
He was the one whe wanted te get shot
light-years out in space

11
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,767
to find the answers.

12
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,206
Are we there yet?

13
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,081
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,260
We're there.

15
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,795
it's about your brother.

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,110
So, a week
before Tommy's gonna ship out,

17
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,763
a guy with a gun ends his journey
for the paper in his wallet.

18
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,955
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

19
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,038
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

20
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,738
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks...

21
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,907
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.

22
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,068
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going someplace he's gonna regret.

23
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,086
Up ahead was Pandora.

24
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,240
You grew up hearing about it,
but never figured I'd be going there.

25
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,757
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

26
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,724
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

27
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,147
And since your genome is identical
to his, you could step into his shoes,

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,470
so to speak.

29
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,261
lt'd be a fresh start on a new world.

30
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,755
And the pay is goed.

31
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,357
Very good.

32
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,411
-Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
-Exo-packs on! Let's go!

33
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,090
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

34
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,575
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

35
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:49,026
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

36
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,517
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,550
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,140
One life ends,

39
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,319
another begins.

40
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,005
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

41
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,407
-Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
-Harnesses off! One minute!

42
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,437
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

43
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,248
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

44
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,436
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

45
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,529
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

46
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,479
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude.

47
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,637
l told myself l could pass
any test a man could pass.

48
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,448
They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,

49
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,267
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.

50
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,089
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

51
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,028
Well, well, ladies.

52
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,332
Look at all this fresh meat!

53
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,949
Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

54
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,863
fighting for freedom.

55
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,105
Look out, hot rod!

56
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,401
But out here they're just hired guns,

57
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,253
taking the money,
working for the company.

58
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,902
Check this out, man.

59
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,995
Meals on wheels.

60
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,027
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

61
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,175
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

62
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,751
Got it! Need them!

63
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,220
You're not in Kansas anymore.

64
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,361
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

65
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,212
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

66
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,337
If there is a hell,

67
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,349
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

68
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,682
Out there, beyond that fence,

69
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,828
every living thing
that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

70
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,202
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

71
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,684
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

72
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,412
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

73
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,228
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

74
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,478
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

75
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,219
They are very hard to kill.

76
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,423
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

77
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,432
I will not succeed.

78
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,049
Not with all of you.

79
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,102
If you wish to survive,

80
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,977
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

81
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,057
You've got to obey the rules.

82
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,860
Pandora rules.

83
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,859
Rule number one...

84
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,599
There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief

85
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,394
to put your mind at ease.

86
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:59,805
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

87
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,140
Wow! You look just like him.

88
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,796
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

89
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,084
..into the bio-lab.

90
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,039
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

91
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,774
-Hi.
-Hey.

92
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,399
Link... Here's the link room right here.

93
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,687
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

94
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,580
Me and Norm are here te drive

95
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,717
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars.

96
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:31,597
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

97
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,012
-Hey. Welcome.
-Hey.

98
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,427
-Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
-Thanks.

99
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,361
Damn! They got big.

100
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,907
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

101
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,343
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

102
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,365
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

103
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,304
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

104
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,329
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

105
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,265
There's yours.

106
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,505
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

107
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,323
-Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
-Good to meet you, yeah.

108
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,920
Looks like him.

109
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,946
No, it looks like you.

110
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,969
This is your avatar now, Jake.

111
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:38,316
And the concept is that every driver
fis matched to his own avatar,

112
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,499
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

113
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,242
or something.

114
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,789
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

115
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,001
which is insanely expensive.

116
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:57,047
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

117
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,434
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

118
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,579
You know, what we see, what we feel.

119
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,275
-It's all part of the science.
-And good science is good observation.

120
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,817
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

121
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,667
All right. Whatever.

122
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,411
So...

123
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,944
Well, here lam,

124
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,111
doing science.

125
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,857
They're coming out!

126
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,324
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

127
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,155
Oh, God.

128
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,725
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

129
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:42,606
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

130
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,504
-Thank you!
-Grace Augustine is a legend.

131
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,204
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

132
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,987
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

133
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,379
Well, that's ‘cause she likes plants
better than people.

134
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,836
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

135
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,381
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

136
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,850
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'‘vi?

137
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,308
May the All Mother...

138
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,510
smile upon our first meeting,

139
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,651
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

140
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,180
studied for five years...

141
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,449
...but there is much to learn.

142
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,853
-Grace? This is Jake Sully.
-Ma'am.

143
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,391
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

144
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,149
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

145
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,923
He's dead.

146
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,848
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

147
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,161
-How much lab training have you had?
-I dissected a frog once.

148
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,750
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

149
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,260
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

150
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,722
-I'm going to Selfridge.
-No, Grace,

151
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,257
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-No, man, this is such bullshit!

152
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,910
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

153
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,671
He has no business
sticking his nose in my department.

154
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,395
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

155
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,597
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

156
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,658
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

157
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,959
-You see that?
-Yes, sir.

158
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,021
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

159
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,930
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

160
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,876
Parker, you know,
l used to think it was benign neglect,

161
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,070
but now I see
that you're intentionally screwing me.

162
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,626
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

163
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,491
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

164
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,435
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

165
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,050
-Lucky?
-Yeah.

166
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,091
How is this in any way lucky?

167
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,963
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

168
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,829
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

169
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,978
A Marine we can use.

170
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,894
I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

171
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,239
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

172
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,396
Look, look,
you're supposed to be winning the hearts

173
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,624
and the minds of the natives.

174
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,469
Isn't that the whole point of
your little puppet show?

175
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,084
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

176
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,822
then they'll start trusting us.

177
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,861
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

178
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,949
but after, what, how many years?

179
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,612
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

180
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,743
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

181
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,080
Right. Come here.

182
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,963
I can't... ] can't...

183
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,028
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

184
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,174
Because this little gray rock sells
for 20 million a kilo.

185
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,464
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

186
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,597
It's what pays for your science.

187
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,951
Now, those savages
are threatening our whole operation,

188
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,511
we're on the brink of war,

189
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,574
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

190
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,139
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

191
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,673
So, how much link time have you logged?

192
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,246
-About 520 hours.
-That's good.

193
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,598
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

194
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,536
Zip. But l read a manual.

195
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,614
Tell me you're joking.

196
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,434
This is cool.

197
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,303
Let's go.

198
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,898
Don't. I got this.

199
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,734
So you just figured you'd come out here,

200
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,430
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

201
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,132
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

202
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,710
What was going through your head?

203
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,552
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

204
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,019
-Biometrics are good.
-Link three is ready.

205
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,519
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

206
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,483
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

207
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,314
That shouldn't be hard for you.

208
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,224
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

209
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,813
Initiate link.

210
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,955
Run sequence unit three. Go.

211
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,611
Launching.

212
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,514
l have the first congruency.

213
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:39,948
-That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
-Go figure.

214
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,436
Phase-lock 40%.

215
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,019
All right. Going in.

216
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,221
I'm going in in four.

217
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,766
Phase-lock 99%. Link is stable.

218
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,100
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

219
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,279
Pupillary reflex is good.

220
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,910
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

221
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,217
Hey, guys.

222
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,776
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

223
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,288
Good!

224
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,846
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

225
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,964
-And touch your thumb to your fingers.
-Yeah.

226
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,527
-Thumb to your fingers.
-No problem.

227
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,165
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

228
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,333
-Got it.
-Well, if you want to sit up,

229
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:40,809
-that's fine.
-Okay, good. Just take it

230
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,677
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

231
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,175
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?
You're wiggling your toes!

232
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,227
-Good. Good, Jake.
-That's great.

233
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,670
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

234
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,455
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

235
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,260
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

236
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,479
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

237
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,044
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

238
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,267
-so take it easy.
-Wait.

239
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,915
-Jake.
-Sit down, Jake.

240
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,273
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

241
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,690
-l need you to sit down. Jake!
-It's okay.

242
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,549
-Buddy, listen to me.
-It's all good. I got this.

243
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,057
-Jake, you need to sit down right now.
-Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

244
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,444
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

245
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,266
You need time to adjust to the avatar...
Whoa! Jake!

246
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,669
-God, Jake, watch your tail.
-Yeah!

247
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,615
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand
milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

248
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,206
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

249
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,455
By the numbers.

250
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,916
-Jake. Come on.
-Jake! Listen to me.

251
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,556
You're not used to your avatar body.

252
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,316
-This is dangerous.
-This is great.

253
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,464
-Jake? Jake, listen to me.
-Come on. They're gonna put you out.

254
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,770
-Norm, sit down.
-No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

255
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,569
God damn it! Bring them home!

256
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,178
-Norm! Do not leave control!
-You're not ready for it!

257
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,641
-Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
-So close!

258
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,579
I don't even have to play defense on it.

259
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,168
Hey, guys. Hey.

260
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,436
-It's okay, I'll get him.
-Jake, you have to come back!

261
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,365
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

262
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,555
-Watch it!
-Sorry!

263
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,118
Come on!

264
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,914
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

265
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,916
-Jeez! Sorry.
-Watch it!

266
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,803
Hey, Marine!

267
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,063
Damn.

268
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,050
-Grace?
-Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

269
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,014
Think fast.

270
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,940
Motor control's looking good.

271
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,899
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

272
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,434
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

273
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,985
Hey, hey, hey!

274
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,624
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

275
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,286
That's kind of freaky.

276
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,704
Come on. Scat.

277
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,198
Good night.

278
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,824
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

279
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,165
Welcome back.

280
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,290
-You okay? You all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

281
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:16,910
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

282
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,584
Hold on a second.

283
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,872
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

284
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,289
-We bounce at zero-nine.
-Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

285
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,227
Vine strike's still loose.

286
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,463
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

287
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,002
Watch it!

288
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,144
Yeah, that's ‘cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

289
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,030
Or the biggest.

290
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,798
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

291
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,821
I thought you'd never ask.

292
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,161
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

293
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,370
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

294
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,041
This low gravity'll make you soft.

295
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,140
You get soft,

296
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,473
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

297
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,194
I pulled your record, Corporal.

298
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,719
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

299
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,004
Nothing like this here, though.

300
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,515
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

301
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,662
I figured it's just another hellhole.

302
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,101
I was First Recon myself.

303
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,303
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

304
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,214
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

305
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,927
I come out here?

306
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,775
Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

307
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:51,253
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if l rotated back.

308
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:56,965
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

309
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,173
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

310
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:07,715
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

311
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:14,617
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

312
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:16,998
-Clear!
-Clear!

313
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:26,884
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

314
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,043
Give me the goose bumps.

315
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,338
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

316
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,342
right on the ground.

317
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,525
Right in the hostiles’ camp.

318
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:43,251
Look, Sully. I want you
to learn these savages from the inside.

319
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,456
I want you to gain their trust.

320
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,283
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

321
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,790
or hammer them hard if they won't.

322
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,564
-Am I still with Augustine?
-On paper.

323
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,539
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

324
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,947
but you report to me.

325
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,130
Can you do that for me, son?

326
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,118
Hell, yeah, sir.

327
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,770
Well, all right, then.

328
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,553
Son, I take care of my own.

329
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:24,963
You get me what I need,

330
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:28,043
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

331
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,630
Your real legs.

332
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,322
That sounds real good, sir.

333
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,623
-Link's ready!
-Phase-lock 40%.

334
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,281
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

335
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,860
Il have five congruencies. Phase-lock 90%.

336
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:53,538
Link three ready.

337
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,830
All right, I'm going in.

338
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,118
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

339
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,187
-Norm! Your pack.
-Pack.

340
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,797
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

341
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,187
You the man, Doc.

342
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,685
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

343
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,740
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

344
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,993
So, how will they know we're here?

345
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,752
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

346
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,251
-Keep moving, Norm.
-Keep up, guys!

347
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:33,052
-And here I go.
-Scanning.

348
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,708
Wow! It's that fast?

349
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,176
-Amazing, isn't it?
-Yeah.

350
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,845
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

351
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,566
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

352
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,570
Okay. Sample.

353
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,496
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

354
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,178
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

355
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,673
Right.

356
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,329
So, here I go.

357
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,416
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

358
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,024
It's already pissed off.

359
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,975
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

360
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,768
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

361
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,456
So, what do I do, dance with it?

362
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,831
Just hold your ground.

363
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,406
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

364
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,559
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

365
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,908
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

366
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,016
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

367
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,985
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

368
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,049
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

369
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,505
Oh, shit.

370
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,631
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

371
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,145
Run! Definitely run!

372
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,033
I'm gonna have te call it, guys.

373
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,811
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

374
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,769
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to
hang on till morning.

375
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,636
He won't make it till morning.

376
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,480
I don't have all goddamn night.

377
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,393
Come on! Come on!

378
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,029
Hey, wait. Don't!

379
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:40,727
Great.

380
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,459
Look, I know you probably don't
understand this,

381
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,049
but thank you.

382
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,602
Thank you.

383
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,067
That was pretty impressive.

384
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,565
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was...

385
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,212
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

386
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,886
Wait up!

387
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,378
Just... Hey, slow down.

388
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,356
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

389
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,497
-Damn!
-Don't thank.

390
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,855
You don't thank for this.

391
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:34,172
This is sad. Very sad only.

392
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,423
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

393
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,100
Whatever I did, l am sorry.

394
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,605
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

395
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,672
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

396
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,457
Your fault!

397
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,533
-Your fault!
-Easy. Easy.

398
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:58,185
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

399
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,996
Easy.

400
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,553
Fine. Fine.

401
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,887
If you love your little forest friends,

402
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,327
why not let them just kill my ass?

403
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,104
What's the thinking?

404
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,493
-Why save you?
-Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

405
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,993
You have a strong heart.

406
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,414
No fear.

407
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,593
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

408
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,489
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

409
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,382
Look, maybe you should teach me.

410
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,681
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

411
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,663
Well, then teach me how to See.

412
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,179
-No one can teach you to See.
-Whoa.

413
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,966
Look, come on, can't we talk?

414
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,629
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

415
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,428
You're like a baby.

416
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,246
I need your help.

417
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,154
You should not be here.

418
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,811
-Okay, take me with you.
-No! Go back.

419
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:26,727
No.

420
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:29,443
Go back.

421
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,118
No!

422
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,092
What...

423
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,333
What are they?

424
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,609
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

425
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,346
Very pure spirits.

426
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,375
What was that all about?

427
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:55,676
Come.

428
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,211
Come!

429
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,075
Where are we going?

430
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:13,426
Come.

431
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,725
What's your name?

432
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:20,968
Shit!

433
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:47,560
Okay.

434
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,995
Calrn people, calm.

435
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,543
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

436
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,995
These demons are forbidden here.

437
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,079
There has been a sign.

438
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:12,505
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

439
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:18,448
Bring, him.

440
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,468
What's going on?

441
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:24,964
Wait.

442
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,506
What's happening?

443
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,478
Hey!

444
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:42,956
Father...

445
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,565
...1 see you.

446
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,758
This creature...

447
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,950
why do you bring, him here?

448
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,000
l was going to kill him...

449
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,049
..but there was a sign from Eywa.

450
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,201
have said...

451
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,820
+N dreamwalker will come here.

452
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:13,076
What's he saying?

453
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:13,567
What's he saying?

454
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,054
His alien smell fills my nose.

455
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,270
Hey, what's he saying?

456
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,941
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

457
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:24,065
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

458
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:29,392
Step back!

459
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:34,722
I will look at this alien.

460
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,313
That is Mother.

461
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,047
She is 7sahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

462
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,575
Who's Eywa?

463
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:51,134
What are you called?

464
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:53,486
Jake Sully.

465
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,024
-Why did you come to us?
-I came to learn.

466
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,345
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

467
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,731
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

468
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,660
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

469
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,520
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

470
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,206
What are you?

471
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,460
I was a Marine. A...

472
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:32,034
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

473
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:33,973
Awarrior!

474
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:35,725
t could kill him easily!

475
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:36,866
I could kl im easily!

476
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:41,125
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

477
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,342
1 WE have seen.

478
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:46,188
We need to learn more about him.

479
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,613
My Daughter. .

480
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:54,691
+-YOu will teach him our way...

481
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,303
«to speak and walk as We do.

482
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,949
Why me? That’s not fair...

483
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,754
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

484
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,488
Learn well, Jakesully.

485
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:15,072
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

486
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:35,545
Good evening.

487
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,309
Please don't get up.

488
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,566
Excuse me.

489
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,053
Sorry.

490
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,823
Hey, how you doing?

491
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,736
-Jake. Jake!
-He's in alpha.

492
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,774
-He's coming out right now.
-Jake. Jake!

493
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,647
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

494
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:50,035
There you go. There you go, there you go.

495
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,540
You're okay. You're okay.

496
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,480
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

497
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,156
-Is the avatar safe?
-Yeah, Doc.

498
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,976
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

499
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,953
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

500
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:12,953
disappearing into the brush with
this angry thanator coming after him.

501
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:16,161
-Hey, it's not something you can teach.
-That is awesome.

502
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,640
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

503
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:21,893
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

504
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,964
“Jarhead clan"?

505
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:29,394
-And it worked?
-Hey, I'm practically family.

506
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,890
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

507
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:35,775
That's called taking the initiative, son.

508
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,263
-l wish I had 10 more like you.
-Look, Sully. Sully.

509
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:41,665
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

510
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:47,917
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

511
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,299
But no, no, no, they like mud.

512
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:54,081
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're...

513
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,819
Hey, can you... Can somebody just...
Sector 12.

514
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,747
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

515
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,074
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

516
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:10,766
Their damn village happens to be resting
on the richest unobtanium deposit

517
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:16,299
within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

518
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,908
-Well, who gets them to move?
-Guess.

519
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:28,225
-What if they won't go?
-I'm betting that they will.

520
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,533
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

521
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,220
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

522
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:38,946
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

523
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,283
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

524
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,553
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

525
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,400
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

526
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:53,631
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

527
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,914
Well, we're wasting time.

528
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,084
I like this guy.

529
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,444
-Guys, right now...
-Okay, let's run through them again.

530
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:03,979
Mo'‘at. Dragon lady.

531
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,910
-Eytucan.
-Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

532
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:12,116
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

533
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:13,973
Got it.

534
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,201
-T'su'tey.
-Tsu'tey.

535
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,944
-Tsu'tey.
-He'll be the next clan leader.

536
00:51:21,345 --> 00:51:23,484
-Neytiri.
-She'll be the next 7sahik.

537
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:25,611
They become a mated pair.

538
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:28,904
-So who's this Eywa?
-Who's Eywa?

539
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,250
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

540
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:34,961
Everything they know!

541
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,065
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

542
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:38,598
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

543
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,322
-Come on. That's...
-All right, knock it off, you two.

544
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:42,821
Let's go. Village life starts early.

545
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,539
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

546
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,029
Easy, boy.

547
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,636
Pale is female.

548
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,977
Okay. Easy, girl.

549
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,345
That is tsaheylu. The bond.

550
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,081
Feel her.

551
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:58,976
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

552
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,063
Feel her strong legs.

553
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:08,804
You may tell her what to do.

554
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,206
Inside.

555
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,905
For now, say where to go.

556
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,344
Forward!

557
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,836
-You should go away.
-No, you'd miss me.

558
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,674
I knew you could speak English.

559
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,429
This alien will learn nothing...

560
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:49,592
wed rock sees more...

561
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:51,804
.look at him.

562
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:02,205
Again.

563
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,459
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

564
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:08,146
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

565
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,325
There's an outer row of columns.

566
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:13,081
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

567
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:16,676
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

568
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,421
That's how they move up and down.

569
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,212
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

570
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:23,829
Roger that.

571
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,404
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

572
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,410
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

573
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:37,224
-So where are we going?
-Getting out of Dodge.

574
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:42,672
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

575
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,120
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

576
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,317
way up in the mountains.

577
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,339
The Hallelujah Mountains?

578
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,712
-That's right.
-Are you serious?

579
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:55,790
-Yeah.
-Yes!

580
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,716
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

581
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,323
We're getting close.

582
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,959
Yeah, look at my instruments.

583
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:23,965
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

584
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,381
We're VFR from here on.

585
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:28,397
What's VFR?

586
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,775
Means you gotta see where you're going.

587
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,591
-You can't see anything.
-Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

588
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:55,864
Oh, my God.

589
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,431
You should see your faces.

590
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,906
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

591
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,116
Welcome to camp.

592
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:06,255
-So, this is my bunk.
-This stuff is nasty.

593
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,908
-Norm, go under.
-All right.

594
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,300
-Grace didn't miss a thing.
-Trudy, you'll take the top one.

595
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,940
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

596
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:19,493
But l had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,

597
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:21,437
so she's playing nice.

598
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:26,158
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

599
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:33,253
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

600
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,140
Holy shit!

601
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,875
Do not look in her eye.

602
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,169
Jkranis not horse.

603
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:40,158
Once tsaheylu is made,

604
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:48,067
Jkran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life.

605
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,935
To become ¢éaronyu, hunter,

606
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:04,501
you must choose your own skran
and he must choose you.

607
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:09,261
-When?
-When you are ready.

608
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,680
Okay. This is video log 12.

609
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,727
Time's 2132.

610
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:10,334
Do I have to do this now?
l really need to get some rack.

611
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:13,330
No, now. When it's fresh.

612
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,956
Okay, location, shack,

613
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:21,199
and the days are starting to blur together.

614
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,400
The language is a pain, but, you know,

615
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,670
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition.

616
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,560
-Navi.
-"Mari."

617
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:33,962
-Nari.
-"Narrri"!

618
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:34,074
-Nari.
-"Narrri"!

619
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,277
Narrrif

620
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,149
Txur ni'ul. Stronger.

621
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,229
Neytiri calls me skxawng. {t means moron.

622
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,272
This is a very important part of it.

623
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:52,387
-Norm's attitude has improved lately.
-l see you. I see you.

624
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,828
But it's not just,
“I'm seeing you in front of me,”

625
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,647
it's "Il see into you. I See you.”

626
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,263
It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

627
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,649
“I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

628
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,872
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

629
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:09,159
My feet are getting tougher.
f can run farther every day.

630
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,221
have to trust my body
to know what te do.

631
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,232
Yeah! Check it out!

632
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:23,359
Oh, crap!

633
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:32,067
Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,

634
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:34,685
the tiniest scents and sounds.

635
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,720
She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

636
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,442
l really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final.

637
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:52,062
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know.

638
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:54,949
You need to listen to what she says.

639
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,128
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

640
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:00,865
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

641
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,850
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

642
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,310
You gotta be kidding me.

643
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:53,511
1 talked Maat into
letting Grace into the village.

644
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:56,183
Look howbig you are.

645
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,426
It's the first time
since her schoal was closed down.

646
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:59,191
You are so pretty.

647
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,404
No, you don't. Come back here.

648
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:06,482
Bon appétit.

649
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:35,614
Come on, Marine.

650
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:03,411
I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

651
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,770
the people have to the forest.

652
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:09,003
She talks about a network of energy

653
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,430
that flows through all living things.

654
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:16,550
She says all energy is only borrowed,

655
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:20,137
and one day you have to give it back.

656
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:44,442
I see you...

657
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:45,701
...Brother

658
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,249
..and thank you.

659
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:54,276
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

660
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:56,647
Your body stays behind...

661
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,507
...to become part of The People.

662
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:04,793
A clean kill.

663
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:09,628
You are ready.

664
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:38,425
Learning to ride anikran,
we call them banshees,

665
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,185
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

666
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,640
But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are.

667
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:48,931
Oo-rah.

668
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,690
Now what?

669
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:53,567
Jakesully will go first.

670
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:30,183
Now you choose your fkran.
This you must feel inside.

671
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,188
If he also chooses you,
move quick like showed.

672
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:37,104
You will have one chance, Jake.

673
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,416
How willl know if he chooses me?

674
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,482
He will try to kill you.

675
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,118
Outstanding.

676
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:45,813
Let's dance.

677
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,830
That moron's going to die.

678
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,530
Don't be afraid, warrior.

679
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,052
Make the bond!

680
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:25,524
No!

681
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:30,589
Jake!

682
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,177
Tsaheylu, Jake.

683
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:49,858
Tsaheylu!

684
01:11:00,156 --> 01:11:01,086
Stop!

685
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:14,349
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

686
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,767
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

687
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,554
-Think, "Fly!"
-Fly?

688
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:44,546
God damn!

689
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,218
Oh, shit!

690
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:01,749
Shut up and fly straight!

691
01:12:12,295 --> 01:12:14,315
That's it. Bank left!

692
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,490
Level out! That's it.

693
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:32,354
Jakesully!

694
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,240
Hey!

695
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:05,557
Let's go!

696
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:19,834
Yeah, baby, I got this!

697
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,010
Oh, shit!

698
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:30,753
i may not be much of a horse guy,
but l was bern to de this.

699
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,004
Yeah!

700
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,833
-l came like this. This you.
-Yeah, yeah.

701
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:41,673
-I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.
-Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

702
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,110
The Tree of Souls.

703
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,684
It's their most sacred place.

704
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:55,215
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

705
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,468
Yeah, that's what messes up
my instruments.

706
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:01,807
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

707
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:05,576
I would die to get samples.

708
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,895
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

709
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,567
You lucky swine.

710
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:21,264
! was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above.

711
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,695
Only problem is, you're not the only one.

712
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:30,922
Dive!

713
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:54,869
Go, go!

714
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,365
Follow me!

715
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:53,256
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

716
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:57,137
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

717
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,001
Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.

718
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:10,302
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto.

719
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,010
Rider of Last Shadow.

720
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,890
He rode this?

721
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,103
Toruk chose him.

722
01:17:19,702 --> 01:17:23,072
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

723
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,369
-That's a long time.
-Yes.

724
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:27,982
Toruk Macto was mighty.

725
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:33,358
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

726
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:35,936
All Na'vi people know the story.

727
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:46,617
Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world

728
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:50,026
and in here is the dream.

729
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:13,193
It's hard to believe
it's only been three months.

730
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:18,735
I can barely remember my old life.

731
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:24,208
I don't know who lam anymore.

732
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,679
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

733
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,775
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

734
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:56,533
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

735
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:01,625
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

736
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,647
No, I can do this.

737
01:19:03,973 --> 01:19:05,373
You already have.

738
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,472
You give me good, usable intel.

739
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:10,744
This Tree of Souls place.

740
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,440
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

741
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,470
which it will. Yeah.

742
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:19,383
Now it's time to come in.

743
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:22,763
By the way,

744
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:25,254
you gonna get your legs back.

745
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:29,525
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

746
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,205
Gonna have you ona shuttle tonight.

747
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,151
I'm a man of my word.

748
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:38,826
I gotta finish this.

749
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:42,683
There's one more thing.

750
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:47,952
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

751
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:52,926
If I do it, I'm one of them.

752
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:56,240
And they'll trust me.

753
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:02,909
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

754
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:19,115
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

755
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:40,344
The Na'vi say
that every person is born twice.

756
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:47,621
The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever.

757
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:57,602
You are now ason of the Omaticaya.

758
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:02,168
You are part of The People.

759
01:21:48,871 --> 01:21:50,601
Come. Come.

760
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,860
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

761
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:14,468
And sometimes answered.

762
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:24,911
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

763
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,764
The Tree of Voices.

764
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,885
The voices of our ancestors.

765
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:48,566
I can hear them.

766
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:55,105
They live, Jake,

767
01:22:57,406 --> 01:22:58,606
within Eywa.

768
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,618
You are Omaticaya now.

769
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:08,303
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

770
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,133
And you may choose a woman.

771
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,260
We have many fine women.

772
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,459
Ninat is the best singer.

773
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,242
But I don't want Ninat.

774
01:23:32,808 --> 01:23:34,508
Peyral is a good hunter.

775
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:38,255
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

776
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:42,136
I've already chosen.

777
01:23:45,888 --> 01:23:48,058
But this woman must also choose me.

778
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:53,764
She already has.

779
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,260
lam with you now, Jake.

780
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:29,705
We are mated for life.

781
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:38,055
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

782
01:25:08,804 --> 01:25:09,764
Ma Jake!

783
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:11,115
Don't forget your phase integration.

784
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:12,543
-Jake!
-No, no, the middle button.

785
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:14,448
-You gotta eat something.
-Yeah, there you go.

786
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:27,491
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

787
01:25:28,757 --> 01:25:30,927
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

788
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:33,764
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

789
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:38,729
Jake!

790
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:48,773
Okay.

791
01:26:00,022 --> 01:26:01,772
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

792
01:26:02,124 --> 01:26:04,084
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

793
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:06,239
- don't need a shower.
-Jesus, Marine.

794
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:11,746
Jake!

795
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:23,047
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

796
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:28,289
Hey!

797
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,294
Stop! Stop!

798
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,117
-Jake!
-Go back, stop!

799
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:39,834
Hey, boss.

800
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,515
Hey!

801
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:45,196
-What?
-I got a native

802
01:26:45,434 --> 01:26:48,014
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

803
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,190
Well, keep going. He'll move.

804
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:54,513
These people have to learn
that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

805
01:26:57,279 --> 01:26:59,179
Stop! Hey!

806
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,571
Go! Go!

807
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,114
There, see? He moved.

808
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:18,278
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

809
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:20,017
I'm blind.

810
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:34,474
-Jake!
-Neytiri!

811
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:37,781
Here, come on!

812
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:05,164
Freeze it right there.

813
01:28:07,082 --> 01:28:09,222
Scale up. Enhance.

814
01:28:11,186 --> 01:28:12,496
Son of a bitch.

815
01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:15,482
Unbelievable.

816
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,598
-Get me a pilot.
-Yes, sir.

817
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:27,634
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

818
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:35,556
Stop please

819
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,062
This will only make it worse.

820
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:40,944
You do not speak here!

821
01:28:42,384 --> 01:28:43,874
We will strike them in the heart.

822
01:28:51,927 --> 01:28:53,797
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

823
01:28:57,232 --> 01:28:58,542
-You!
-Listen. Brother...

824
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,989
-You mated with this woman?
-Oh, shit.

825
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,376
Is this true?

826
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,960
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

827
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:17,741
Brother, please.

828
01:29:17,986 --> 01:29:21,296
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

829
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,847
You are not my brother!

830
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,882
And lam not your enemy!

831
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:33,255
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

832
01:29:35,904 --> 01:29:37,424
Go! Go! Go!

833
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:43,018
-I can talk to them.
-No more talk.

834
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:44,611
Tsu'tey!

835
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:53,569
lam Omaticaya. I am one of you.

836
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:56,686
And I have the right to speak.

837
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:03,152
have something to say...

838
01:30:05,834 --> 01:30:07,094
...to all of you.

839
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:13,149
The words are like stones in my heart.

840
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,449
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

841
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:21,741
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

842
01:30:23,218 --> 01:30:24,388
It's very dangerous!

843
01:30:27,188 --> 01:30:28,178
Grace!

844
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:30,611
Oh, no.

845
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:32,722
-Wait!
-Stay down, sir.

846
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:36,456
Okay. Look...

847
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:38,972
I was sent here to...

848
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,000
You see?

849
01:30:44,372 --> 01:30:46,512
It is a demon ina false body.

850
01:31:06,728 --> 01:31:09,688
-Are you out of your goddamn mind?
-You crossed the line.

851
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:15,438
Wheel this meat out of here.

852
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,661
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

853
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:24,794
You let me down, son.

854
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:28,095
So, what,

855
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:31,513
you find yourself some local tail

856
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:34,633
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

857
01:31:35,123 --> 01:31:37,312
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

858
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:39,915
-Parker...
-Shut your pie hole!

859
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:43,988
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

860
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:46,999
-I could do that.
-You need to muzzle your dog.

861
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:49,835
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

862
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:52,441
You say you want to
keep your people alive?

863
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:54,591
You start by listening to her.

864
01:31:54,943 --> 01:31:56,933
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

865
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:58,862
-in a way you can't imagine.
-You know what?

866
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,170
You throw a stick in the air around here,

867
01:32:01,549 --> 01:32:04,159
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

868
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:05,789
-for Christ's sake!
-I'm not talking

869
01:32:06,054 --> 01:32:09,924
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

870
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:12,868
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

871
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:14,584
Which is what, exactly?

872
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:16,970
What we think we know

873
01:32:17,232 --> 01:32:20,192
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

874
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:24,542
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

875
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:29,183
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth
connections to the trees around it.

876
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:32,624
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees
on Pandora.

877
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:35,875
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

878
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:38,331
It's more connections
than the human brain.

879
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:42,010
Get it? It's a network.

880
01:32:42,424 --> 01:32:45,054
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

881
01:32:45,527 --> 01:32:48,567
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

882
01:32:49,097 --> 01:32:51,467
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

883
01:32:52,434 --> 01:32:53,334
Yes!

884
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:58,302
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

885
01:32:59,474 --> 01:33:01,284
They're just goddamn trees!

886
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,681
-You need to wake up, Parker.
-No. You need to wake up.

887
01:33:06,114 --> 01:33:10,034
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

888
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:13,935
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

889
01:33:14,489 --> 01:33:18,239
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

890
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:22,960
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

891
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,440
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

892
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:29,766
They're not gonna give up their home.

893
01:33:31,873 --> 01:33:33,303
They're not gonna make a deal.

894
01:33:34,576 --> 01:33:36,566
For what? Lite beer?

895
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:38,789
And blue jeans?

896
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:44,770
There's nothing that we have
that they want.

897
01:33:47,055 --> 01:33:49,685
Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time.

898
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:56,669
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

899
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:04,574
So, since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

900
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:09,460
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

901
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:12,361
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

902
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:22,651
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

903
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:26,162
I'll drive them out with gas first.

904
01:34:27,729 --> 01:34:29,099
It'll be humane.

905
01:34:30,932 --> 01:34:32,192
More or less.

906
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:35,712
All right, let's pull the trigger.

907
01:34:39,574 --> 01:34:41,244
-Come on, people.
-Oh, man.

908
01:34:41,576 --> 01:34:43,066
Let's pack it up, let's go.

909
01:34:43,378 --> 01:34:44,987
This is how it's done.

910
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:51,119
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

911
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:55,159
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

912
01:34:55,757 --> 01:34:58,797
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

913
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:00,197
My God.

914
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:10,294
-Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
-Back off!

915
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:14,155
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to...

916
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:15,639
-No. No, no, no, no.
-I said back off!

917
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:18,867
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

918
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,840
All right? Look around!

919
01:35:21,149 --> 01:35:24,399
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

920
01:35:24,953 --> 01:35:26,213
-Can you guys just please...
-Yes, sir.

921
01:35:26,487 --> 01:35:28,677
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

922
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:30,200
Are you gonna kill children?

923
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:33,888
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

924
01:35:34,462 --> 01:35:36,542
Just let me try to talk them out.

925
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:38,955
They trust me.

926
01:35:42,437 --> 01:35:44,547
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

927
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:46,609
Calibrating three and four.

928
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:49,521
-Run sequence.
-Initiating. Thirty seconds.

929
01:35:54,282 --> 01:35:55,772
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

930
01:35:56,084 --> 01:35:58,334
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

931
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:01,032
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

932
01:36:07,462 --> 01:36:08,312
Father !

933
01:36:08,796 --> 01:36:09,586
Mother !

934
01:36:09,797 --> 01:36:12,607
Eytukan, t have something to say.

935
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:14,271
Listen!

936
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:16,860
Speak, Jakesully.

937
01:36:18,406 --> 01:36:20,926
A great evil is upon us...

938
01:36:21,743 --> 01:36:23,323
The Sky People are coming...

939
01:36:23,845 --> 01:36:26,015
sto destroy Hometree.

940
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:30,045
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

941
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:35,219
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

942
01:36:35,657 --> 01:36:37,357
Are you certain of this?

943
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:44,616
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

944
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:49,141
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

945
01:36:52,106 --> 01:36:55,266
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

946
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:00,236
Yes.

947
01:37:00,515 --> 01:37:02,625
Look, at first it was just orders,

948
01:37:04,452 --> 01:37:06,472
and then everything changed.

949
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:08,404
Okay? I fell in love.

950
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:13,920
I fell in love with the forest
and with the Omaticaya people.

951
01:37:15,763 --> 01:37:17,023
And with you.

952
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:19,779
-I trusted you.
-With you. With you.

953
01:37:20,101 --> 01:37:22,590
-I trusted you!
-Trust me now, please.

954
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:32,455
You will never be one of The People!

955
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,397
-I shouldn't have...
-We tried to stop them!

956
01:37:34,716 --> 01:37:36,466
Neytiri, please! Please.

957
01:37:41,622 --> 01:37:42,582
Bind them.

958
01:37:44,492 --> 01:37:45,422
Leave now!

959
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,660
You have to go. They're coming!

960
01:38:02,944 --> 01:38:04,844
Time on target, one mike.

961
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,913
Copy. We have a visual.

962
01:38:07,248 --> 01:38:09,878
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

963
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:11,521
Roger, 030.

964
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,250
-Run to the forest!
-They're coming!

965
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:32,510
-They will destroy this place.
-Neytiri, you must go now!

966
01:38:36,778 --> 01:38:38,768
Run to the forest! Run!

967
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:42,619
Run! Run!

968
01:38:42,884 --> 01:38:46,014
Have no fear.

969
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:06,554
No! God damn it, run!

970
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:08,504
Take the ikran...

971
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,116
..attack from above.

972
01:39:14,649 --> 01:39:16,549
That is one big damn tree.

973
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:28,018
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

974
01:39:30,531 --> 01:39:32,341
All right, people, let's get this done!

975
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,190
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

976
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:37,386
Roger. CS .40's going hot.

977
01:39:38,039 --> 01:39:39,059
-Fire.
-Firing.

978
01:39:50,685 --> 01:39:52,435
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

979
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,061
Sir, they've opened fire.

980
01:40:04,198 --> 01:40:05,688
You've got to be kidding me!

981
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:20,669
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

982
01:40:21,082 --> 01:40:22,542
All right, let's turn up the heat.

983
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,400
-Switch incendiaries!
-Switching incendiaries.

984
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:26,783
Fire.

985
01:40:30,258 --> 01:40:31,157
No!

986
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:45,999
Get everyone to the forest.

987
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,610
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

988
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:56,700
Neytiri!

989
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,190
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

990
01:41:08,663 --> 01:41:09,772
My God!

991
01:41:28,516 --> 01:41:31,446
-Mo'at! No!
-If you are one of us,

992
01:41:33,387 --> 01:41:34,557
help us.

993
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:44,226
All call signs, switch missiles.

994
01:41:44,665 --> 01:41:46,775
Give me HE’'s
at the base of the west columns.

995
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:50,116
This way!

996
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:53,049
Rider section, switch missiles.

997
01:41:53,374 --> 01:41:55,074
-One's goad.
-Twa's rocks up.

998
01:41:55,409 --> 01:41:57,629
-Three's up.
-Yeah, baby, get some!

999
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:00,472
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.

1000
01:42:00,848 --> 01:42:02,048
-Bring it down.
-Cleared hat.

1001
01:42:09,323 --> 01:42:10,663
Come on, Grace, move!

1002
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:14,897
Down! Head down!

1003
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:19,628
Come on, come on! Down!

1004
01:42:24,705 --> 01:42:26,434
-Solid hits.
-Solid rocks on target.

1005
01:42:26,774 --> 01:42:27,794
Screw this.

1006
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:30,940
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1007
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:32,828
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1008
01:42:42,757 --> 01:42:44,366
Repeat. Ripple fire.

1009
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:29,512
Go! Go! Go!

1010
01:44:02,837 --> 01:44:04,977
No, no, get back! Back!

1011
01:44:24,325 --> 01:44:26,545
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1012
01:45:11,906 --> 01:45:15,066
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

1013
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:17,290
Let's boogie.

1014
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:19,958
Dragon coming left, heading home.

1015
01:45:20,748 --> 01:45:22,418
Gunrunner coming left.

1016
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,940
-Thunder copies.
-Rider section copies.

1017
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:33,780
Father !

1018
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:50,894
Daughte an

1019
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:55,009
take...my...bow.

1020
01:45:59,587 --> 01:46:03,457
Protect The People.

1021
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:13,449
Neytiri!

1022
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:26,927
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Get away.

1023
01:46:28,082 --> 01:46:29,162
Get away!

1024
01:46:30,451 --> 01:46:31,941
Get away from here!

1025
01:46:33,654 --> 01:46:35,024
Never come back!

1026
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:53,900
Pull the plug.

1027
01:46:55,042 --> 01:46:57,322
-No, you can't do that!
-You can't do that!

1028
01:46:57,745 --> 01:46:59,445
-Calm down! Calm down!
-No! Please!

1029
01:47:15,896 --> 01:47:18,116
l was a warrior
whe dreamed he could bring peace.

1030
01:47:19,867 --> 01:47:23,267
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

1031
01:47:26,573 --> 01:47:27,833
Let's go!

1032
01:47:35,883 --> 01:47:37,253
Put him down!

1033
01:47:40,854 --> 01:47:43,224
You murderer!

1034
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:32,047
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

1035
01:48:32,406 --> 01:48:33,306
Hey.

1036
01:48:34,842 --> 01:48:37,182
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1037
01:48:37,611 --> 01:48:40,541
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

1038
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:44,205
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1039
01:48:44,618 --> 01:48:46,808
-Trudy!
-All the way down.

1040
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:51,607
Max!

1041
01:49:01,835 --> 01:49:04,025
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1042
01:49:04,938 --> 01:49:05,868
Here.

1043
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:20,258
-Clear. Come on.
-Here you go.

1044
01:49:36,136 --> 01:49:39,536
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1045
01:49:40,107 --> 01:49:41,187
Okay. Go.

1046
01:49:55,189 --> 01:49:56,179
Clear.

1047
01:49:58,325 --> 01:49:59,375
Come on, baby.

1048
01:49:59,626 --> 01:50:02,056
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1049
01:50:06,033 --> 01:50:08,663
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

1050
01:50:12,139 --> 01:50:13,219
Three!

1051
01:50:16,243 --> 01:50:17,293
Come on!

1052
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:20,586
Mask on!

1053
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:24,930
Gas, gas, gas!

1054
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,570
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1055
01:50:31,325 --> 01:50:34,045
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1056
01:50:35,429 --> 01:50:37,009
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1057
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:51,050
Colonel!

1058
01:50:57,985 --> 01:51:01,054
-Yeah! Yeah!
-All right! Yes!

1059
01:51:04,725 --> 01:51:07,035
-Crap.
-Everybody all right back there?

1060
01:51:07,461 --> 01:51:08,751
Oh, yeah, baby!

1061
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:10,669
-Norm, you good?
-Yeah!

1062
01:51:11,798 --> 01:51:13,818
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1063
01:51:14,401 --> 01:51:15,951
-Grace is hit!
-What?

1064
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:18,707
-Get the trauma kit.
-Trauma kit!

1065
01:51:19,006 --> 01:51:22,046
-Keep the pressure on, Grace.
-Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1066
01:51:22,576 --> 01:51:26,496
-Hang on, Grace.
-Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1067
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:32,557
-You're goad to ga.
-Take it up!

1068
01:51:34,054 --> 01:51:35,634
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

1069
01:51:40,294 --> 01:51:41,554
You're clear!

1070
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:52,070
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1071
01:51:52,506 --> 01:51:53,736
Copy that.

1072
01:52:00,914 --> 01:52:03,784
-Norm, you all good up there?
-Yep! Still here.

1073
01:52:06,086 --> 01:52:10,156
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

1074
01:52:10,824 --> 01:52:12,603
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1075
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,250
Yeah.

1076
01:52:14,528 --> 01:52:16,228
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1077
01:52:25,339 --> 01:52:26,329
Ouch.

1078
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:31,139
You big baby.

1079
01:52:32,679 --> 01:52:33,939
We're moving.

1080
01:52:34,681 --> 01:52:36,460
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1081
01:52:37,684 --> 01:52:39,554
I'm a scientist, remember?

1082
01:52:40,787 --> 01:52:42,897
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1083
01:52:44,057 --> 01:52:45,727
The People can help you.

1084
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,570
I know it.

1085
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:51,370
Why would they help us?

1086
01:53:07,648 --> 01:53:10,338
The People say Eywa will provide.

1087
01:53:12,686 --> 01:53:15,026
With ne home, ne hope,

1088
01:53:16,456 --> 01:53:18,326
there was only one place they could ga.

1089
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:34,060
Link's running.

1090
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:37,550
-What's the plan here, Jake?
-There's no plan.

1091
01:53:39,012 --> 01:53:43,081
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place.

1092
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:45,851
I gotta try.

1093
01:53:48,789 --> 01:53:49,929
Launching.

1094
01:54:11,611 --> 01:54:12,661
Outcast.

1095
01:54:13,613 --> 01:54:14,693
Betrayer.

1096
01:54:15,949 --> 01:54:16,938
Alien.

1097
01:54:18,652 --> 01:54:21,022
l was in the place the eye does not see.

1098
01:54:32,566 --> 01:54:35,936
needed their help, and they needed mine.

1099
01:54:37,337 --> 01:54:39,067
But to ever face them again,

1100
01:54:39,406 --> 01:54:41,576
i was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level.

1101
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:53,349
Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move.

1102
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:58,606
There's something we gotta do.

1103
01:54:58,992 --> 01:55:00,482
You're not gonna like it.

1104
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:14,047
The way I had it figured,
Toruk fs the baddest cat in the sky.

1105
01:55:14,608 --> 01:55:16,038
Nothing attacks him.

1106
01:55:16,777 --> 01:55:17,917
Easy, boy.

1107
01:55:18,545 --> 01:55:20,125
So why would he ever look up?

1108
01:55:21,515 --> 01:55:22,915
But that was just a theory.

1109
01:56:33,854 --> 01:56:35,224
Toruk Macto?

1110
01:57:15,262 --> 01:57:16,552
I] See you.

1111
01:57:19,866 --> 01:57:21,006
I] See you.

1112
01:57:29,476 --> 01:57:30,965
I was afraid, Jake.

1113
01:57:32,612 --> 01:57:33,902
For my people.

1114
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:38,549
I'm not anymore.

1115
01:57:48,228 --> 01:57:50,218
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

1116
01:57:51,197 --> 01:57:52,897
...l stand before you...

1117
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,950
ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1118
01:57:59,973 --> 01:58:03,693
You are Ofo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior.

1119
01:58:05,412 --> 01:58:07,252
I can't do this without you.

1120
01:58:14,621 --> 01:58:15,821
Toruk Macteo,

1121
01:58:23,863 --> 01:58:25,383
I will fly with you.

1122
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:30,425
My friend is dying.

1123
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:34,379
Grace is dying.

1124
01:58:36,576 --> 01:58:38,216
I beg the help of Eywa.

1125
01:58:50,357 --> 01:58:52,087
Look where we are, Grace.

1126
01:58:59,065 --> 01:59:01,115
I need to take some samples.

1127
01:59:24,891 --> 01:59:28,460
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1128
01:59:30,196 --> 01:59:31,456
in this body.

1129
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:35,630
Is that possible?

1130
01:59:35,935 --> 01:59:39,855
She must pass through the eye of Eywa
and return.

1131
01:59:41,708 --> 01:59:43,018
But, Jakesully,

1132
01:59:44,244 --> 01:59:45,643
she is very weak.

1133
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:49,807
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1134
01:59:53,386 --> 01:59:55,636
Hear us please, All Mother.

1135
01:59:56,556 --> 01:59:58,545
Eywa, help her.

1136
01:59:59,559 --> 02:00:01,459
Take this spirit into you...

1137
02:00:05,298 --> 02:00:07,197
..and breathe her back to us.

1138
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:12,767
Let her walk among, us...

1139
02:00:15,508 --> 02:00:17,178
..as one of The People.

1140
02:00:46,372 --> 02:00:47,302
Jake.

1141
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:50,898
Grace.

1142
02:00:53,179 --> 02:00:54,669
I'm with her, Jake.

1143
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:58,086
She's real!

1144
02:01:01,321 --> 02:01:04,071
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1145
02:01:05,658 --> 02:01:07,058
What's happening?

1146
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:09,661
What's happening?

1147
02:01:14,234 --> 02:01:15,224
Grace!

1148
02:01:16,136 --> 02:01:17,126
Grace!

1149
02:01:19,372 --> 02:01:20,772
What's happening?

1150
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,480
Did it work?

1151
02:01:34,354 --> 02:01:37,894
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

1152
02:01:40,093 --> 02:01:41,613
She is with Eywa now.

1153
02:02:15,628 --> 02:02:17,968
With your permission, I will speak now.

1154
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:22,809
You would honor me by translating.

1155
02:02:30,243 --> 02:02:32,143
The Sky People have sent us a message

1156
02:02:35,849 --> 02:02:37,929
that they can take whatever they want

1157
02:02:40,053 --> 02:02:41,603
and no one can stop them.

1158
02:02:45,425 --> 02:02:46,975
Well, we will send them a message.

1159
02:02:49,829 --> 02:02:51,879
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

1160
02:02:55,468 --> 02:02:57,548
You tell the other clans to come.

1161
02:03:00,974 --> 02:03:03,144
You tell them 7oruk Macto calls to them.

1162
02:03:05,678 --> 02:03:08,108
And you fly now with me!

1163
02:03:09,515 --> 02:03:11,685
My brothers! Sisters!

1164
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:14,929
And we will show the Sky People

1165
02:03:16,222 --> 02:03:17,831
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1166
02:03:19,592 --> 02:03:20,821
and that this,

1167
02:03:21,761 --> 02:03:22,631
this is our land!

1168
02:03:29,903 --> 02:03:31,133
Yah!

1169
02:03:46,452 --> 02:03:47,652
Yah!

1170
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:18,450
Yah!

1171
02:04:36,169 --> 02:04:37,459
We rede out to the four winds.

1172
02:04:40,406 --> 02:04:42,516
To the horse clans of the plain.

1173
02:04:45,812 --> 02:04:46,682
Back to the stars!

1174
02:04:46,913 --> 02:04:48,812
To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea.

1175
02:04:49,182 --> 02:04:50,291
For our children's children!

1176
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:52,770
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

1177
02:04:56,956 --> 02:04:58,156
Yah!

1178
02:05:34,527 --> 02:05:36,697
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1179
02:05:37,096 --> 02:05:38,675
is fighting for survival.

1180
02:05:38,998 --> 02:05:40,288
That's a fact!

1181
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:44,617
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

1182
02:05:46,205 --> 02:05:49,575
Now, these orbital images tell me

1183
02:05:50,476 --> 02:05:53,255
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1184
02:05:53,746 --> 02:05:55,966
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1185
02:05:56,883 --> 02:05:58,583
And more are pouring in.

1186
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:04,309
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

1187
02:06:04,824 --> 02:06:06,844
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

1188
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:09,156
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1189
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:14,190
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

1190
02:06:14,734 --> 02:06:16,814
We will fight terror with terror.

1191
02:06:21,441 --> 02:06:25,071
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1192
02:06:25,678 --> 02:06:27,728
is protected by their...

1193
02:06:28,114 --> 02:06:29,313
Their deity.

1194
02:06:30,817 --> 02:06:32,597
And when we destroy it,

1195
02:06:32,952 --> 02:06:35,002
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

1196
02:06:35,388 --> 02:06:38,458
that they won't come
within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1197
02:06:38,991 --> 02:06:41,331
And that, too, is a fact.

1198
02:06:42,395 --> 02:06:43,915
Yeah! Yeah.

1199
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:58,100
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

1200
02:06:58,678 --> 02:07:00,638
They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives.

1201
02:07:01,013 --> 02:07:03,563
lt's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign.

1202
02:07:04,016 --> 02:07:05,656
Fricking daisy cutters!

1203
02:07:07,453 --> 02:07:09,913
Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

1204
02:07:10,356 --> 02:07:12,166
-When?
-0600 tomorrow.

1205
02:07:12,525 --> 02:07:14,134
-Max! Max!
- gotta go.

1206
02:07:16,262 --> 02:07:17,552
We're screwed!

1207
02:07:19,232 --> 02:07:21,132
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

1208
02:07:21,501 --> 02:07:23,431
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1209
02:07:25,204 --> 02:07:28,134
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1210
02:07:31,577 --> 02:07:33,327
I have 15 clans out there.

1211
02:07:34,313 --> 02:07:36,123
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1212
02:07:37,917 --> 02:07:41,817
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1213
02:07:43,422 --> 02:07:46,962
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

1214
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:49,270
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1215
02:07:49,562 --> 02:07:53,251
If they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

1216
02:07:55,701 --> 02:07:58,721
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

1217
02:07:59,238 --> 02:08:00,258
Yeah, I know.

1218
02:08:00,506 --> 02:08:02,696
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1219
02:08:03,109 --> 02:08:05,889
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

1220
02:08:07,113 --> 02:08:08,843
It'll destroy them.

1221
02:08:09,182 --> 02:08:11,291
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1222
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:29,308
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1223
02:08:32,104 --> 02:08:36,264
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

1224
02:08:39,412 --> 02:08:43,252
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

1225
02:08:45,084 --> 02:08:46,894
See the world we come from.

1226
02:08:48,287 --> 02:08:49,927
There's no green there.

1227
02:08:51,591 --> 02:08:53,321
They killed their Mother.

1228
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:56,530
And they're gonna do the same here.

1229
02:08:58,497 --> 02:09:00,747
More Sky People are gonna come.

1230
02:09:01,167 --> 02:09:03,827
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1231
02:09:05,504 --> 02:09:07,024
Unless we stop them.

1232
02:09:09,842 --> 02:09:12,531
Look, you chose me for something.

1233
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:16,020
I will stand and fight.

1234
02:09:17,316 --> 02:09:18,686
You know I will.

1235
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:23,350
But I need a little help here.

1236
02:09:29,795 --> 02:09:32,425
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1237
02:09:34,634 --> 02:09:37,624
She protects only the balance of life.

1238
02:09:49,882 --> 02:09:51,371
It was worth a try.

1239
02:10:22,281 --> 02:10:24,010
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1240
02:10:24,350 --> 02:10:27,280
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1241
02:10:39,799 --> 02:10:42,759
This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex.

1242
02:10:43,569 --> 02:10:46,669
-Switch to manual flight mode.
-Copy. Manual flight mode.

1243
02:11:22,074 --> 02:11:23,683
This is Papa Dragon.

1244
02:11:24,009 --> 02:11:26,699
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1245
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:37,900
-Suit Team, go.
-All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

1246
02:11:48,934 --> 02:11:50,334
Move, move, move!

1247
02:11:56,175 --> 02:11:57,725
Bravo 1-1, move left.

1248
02:11:58,511 --> 02:12:01,501
Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.

1249
02:12:04,283 --> 02:12:07,383
-Watch formation. Keep moving.
-Roger that.

1250
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,000
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.

1251
02:12:10,389 --> 02:12:11,529
Copy that. Over.

1252
02:12:11,791 --> 02:12:15,891
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

1253
02:12:17,096 --> 02:12:19,965
All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target.

1254
02:12:20,466 --> 02:12:22,576
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

1255
02:12:28,007 --> 02:12:30,196
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1256
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:33,790
Gun crews, keep your head ona swivel.

1257
02:12:34,246 --> 02:12:36,796
Make no mistake, people,
they're out there.

1258
02:12:38,751 --> 02:12:41,591
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.

1259
02:12:42,087 --> 02:12:44,017
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1260
02:12:44,457 --> 02:12:46,597
-Copy. Prepare to offload.
-Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1261
02:12:47,726 --> 02:12:49,656
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1262
02:12:52,198 --> 02:12:53,128
Hold!

1263
02:13:01,273 --> 02:13:03,053
Charlie 2-1, got big movement.

1264
02:13:03,409 --> 02:13:04,638
-Hold position.
-Hold up, hold up.

1265
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:08,540
-We got movement out there, 500 meters.
-Charlie 2-1, hold position.

1266
02:13:15,187 --> 02:13:17,737
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

1267
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:20,410
-Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
-Firing line!

1268
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:23,500
Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.

1269
02:13:24,563 --> 02:13:26,933
-Can't you clean it up?
-No, sir. It's the Flux.

1270
02:13:55,594 --> 02:13:57,904
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

1271
02:14:40,005 --> 02:14:42,405
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1272
02:14:43,876 --> 02:14:44,926
Break right. Come around.

1273
02:14:48,647 --> 02:14:49,937
Light them up!

1274
02:14:57,790 --> 02:14:59,690
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1275
02:15:07,232 --> 02:15:08,872
Yeah! Get some!

1276
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:49,690
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1277
02:16:00,786 --> 02:16:02,336
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1278
02:16:03,255 --> 02:16:05,625
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1279
02:16:06,058 --> 02:16:06,908
Copy. Get out of there.

1280
02:16:12,164 --> 02:16:13,364
That's him. Get after him!

1281
02:16:30,516 --> 02:16:31,776
Take him out!

1282
02:16:40,291 --> 02:16:41,552
Light her up!

1283
02:16:50,769 --> 02:16:51,969
Right there!

1284
02:16:52,304 --> 02:16:54,263
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

1285
02:16:54,807 --> 02:16:56,237
-Keep her in your sights.
-Purging. Feeding the leak.

1286
02:16:56,541 --> 02:16:57,441
Arming all pods.

1287
02:17:03,315 --> 02:17:04,245
That's it!

1288
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:36,010
Seze!

1289
02:18:40,145 --> 02:18:42,045
Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.

1290
02:18:43,215 --> 02:18:44,415
Sorry, Jake.

1291
02:18:53,458 --> 02:18:54,388
Fire.

1292
02:19:12,644 --> 02:19:14,834
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1293
02:19:17,983 --> 02:19:19,413
Rogue One, you copy?

1294
02:19:21,653 --> 02:19:22,643
Trudy!

1295
02:19:33,732 --> 02:19:34,842
Time to target, two minutes.

1296
02:19:35,334 --> 02:19:37,444
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1297
02:19:37,835 --> 02:19:39,735
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

1298
02:19:45,843 --> 02:19:49,214
-Arm number one!
-Number one armed!

1299
02:19:51,083 --> 02:19:52,133
Ma Jake!

1300
02:19:54,253 --> 02:19:55,243
l read you.

1301
02:20:04,529 --> 02:20:06,279
-Neytirif
-Seze's dead.

1302
02:20:07,132 --> 02:20:09,302
They are very close. They are many.

1303
02:20:11,036 --> 02:20:12,326
Do not attack.

1304
02:20:13,138 --> 02:20:14,838
Do you read me, Neytiri?

1305
02:20:17,676 --> 02:20:18,786
Do not attack!

1306
02:20:19,311 --> 02:20:22,061
Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!

1307
02:20:30,555 --> 02:20:31,605
Neytirif

1308
02:20:33,859 --> 02:20:35,529
got movement, [ got movement.

1309
02:20:35,861 --> 02:20:37,821
Hold position. Something's coming.

1310
02:20:38,196 --> 02:20:39,746
Bravo 1-1, l got a big seating.
Turn screens over.

1311
02:20:40,065 --> 02:20:41,935
-We got movement 200 meters.
-Hold your formation.

1312
02:20:42,301 --> 02:20:43,791
-Be ready.
-Watch your flanks.

1313
02:20:49,174 --> 02:20:50,464
Hundred meters and closing fast.

1314
02:21:07,225 --> 02:21:08,955
We gotta get out of here!

1315
02:21:10,729 --> 02:21:12,219
-Fall back! Fall back!
-Move! Move! Move!

1316
02:21:12,531 --> 02:21:14,641
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

1317
02:21:22,074 --> 02:21:24,414
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1318
02:21:31,650 --> 02:21:33,170
Eywa has heard you!

1319
02:21:43,996 --> 02:21:45,196
Come on!

1320
02:21:57,676 --> 02:21:59,315
Fall back! Move! Move!

1321
02:22:24,069 --> 02:22:26,349
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1322
02:22:26,772 --> 02:22:30,372
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1323
02:22:30,976 --> 02:22:33,466
-Press to target.
-Copy. Pressing to target.

1324
02:22:33,912 --> 02:22:35,662
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1325
02:22:55,767 --> 02:22:57,877
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1326
02:22:58,270 --> 02:23:00,640
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1327
02:23:34,739 --> 02:23:35,729
Brace!

1328
02:23:52,924 --> 02:23:54,094
It's Sully.

1329
02:24:08,006 --> 02:24:09,965
-Mask on!
-Breach alarm!

1330
02:26:47,465 --> 02:26:49,075
Come on. Come to papa.

1331
02:27:16,795 --> 02:27:18,345
Give it up, Quaritch!

1332
02:27:21,633 --> 02:27:22,923
It's all over.

1333
02:27:24,402 --> 02:27:26,542
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1334
02:27:26,938 --> 02:27:28,928
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1335
02:28:25,363 --> 02:28:26,412
Come on!

1336
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:46,050
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

1337
02:28:51,222 --> 02:28:53,122
You think you're one of them?

1338
02:28:54,659 --> 02:28:56,059
Time to wake up.

1339
02:30:40,498 --> 02:30:41,398
Jake?

1340
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:56,210
Jake.

1341
02:31:14,365 --> 02:31:15,565
Jake.

1342
02:31:31,816 --> 02:31:33,546
Jake! Ma Jake!

1343
02:32:15,460 --> 02:32:16,599
I] See you.

1344
02:32:22,467 --> 02:32:23,607
I] See you.

1345
02:32:35,380 --> 02:32:37,839
The aliens went back to their dying world.

1346
02:32:40,385 --> 02:32:42,905
Only a few were chosen to stay.

1347
02:32:55,466 --> 02:32:57,656
The time of great sorrow was ending.

1348
02:33:00,071 --> 02:33:02,151
Toruk Macto was no longer needed.

1349
02:33:15,019 --> 02:33:18,419
Well, 1 guess this is my last video log.

1350
02:33:20,758 --> 02:33:24,068
‘Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm...

1351
02:33:25,596 --> 02:33:28,055
I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place.

1352
02:33:32,036 --> 02:33:33,876
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1353
02:33:36,741 --> 02:33:39,401
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party.

1354
02:33:43,147 --> 02:33:45,257
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1355
02:33:48,119 --> 02:33:50,109
This is Jake Sully signing off.

1356
02:41:36,987 --> 02:41:37,837
English - US
