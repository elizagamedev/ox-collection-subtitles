1
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,699
Where are you? Come out!

2
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,025
Come out!

3
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,885
Come on out.

4
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,779
I'm coming to get you.

5
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,157
Where are you, you little rascal?
I'm coming to get you.

6
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,005
Where is my little birthday girl?

7
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,149
I'm going to gobble her up
when I find her.

8
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,174
I'm going to eat you. lam.

9
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,499
Fergus, no weapons on the table.

10
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,935
Can I shoot an arrow?
Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I?

11
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,306
Please? Can I?

12
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,316
Not with that. Why not

13
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,929
use your very own?

14
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,211
Happy birthday, my wee darling!

15
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,145
Now, there's a good girl.

16
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,720
Draw all the way back now
to your cheek. That's right.

17
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,101
Keep both eyes open.

18
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,910
And, loose!

19
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,297
-l missed.
-Go and fetch it, then.

20
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,502
A bow, Fergus? She's a lady.

21
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:33,723
You!

22
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,191
A will-o'-the-wisp.

23
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,474
They are real.

24
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,874
Merida, come along, sweetheart.

25
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,283
-We're leaving now.
-l saw a wisp.

26
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,394
-l saw a wisp.
-A wisp?

27
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:44,412
You know, some say that
will-o'-the-wisps lead you to your fate.

28
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,297
Aye. Or an arrow.

29
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,323
Come on, let's be off before we see
a dancing Tatty Bogle.

30
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,978
Or a giant having a jigger
in the bluebells.

31
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,972
Your father doesn't believe in magic.

32
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,412
Well, he should. Because it's true.

33
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,234
Mor'du! Elinor, run!

34
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,533
Sire!

35
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,421
Come on, you!

36
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:15,502
Come on, you!

37
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,491
Some say our destiny
is tied to the land

38
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,158
as much a part of us as we are of it.

39
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,148
Others say fate is woven together
like a cloth.

40
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,015
So that one's destiny intertwines
with many others.

41
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,880
It's the one thing we search for
or fight to change.

42
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,777
Some never find it.

43
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,225
But there are some who are led.

44
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,120
The story of how my father lost his leg

45
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,409
to the demon bear Mor'du
became legend.

46
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,401
! became a sister
to three new brothers.

47
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,661
The princes.
Hamish, Hubert and Harris.

48
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,570
Wee devils, more like.

49
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,250
They get away with murder.

50
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,556
! can never get away with anything.

51
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,463
I'm the princess.

52
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm the example.

53
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,124
I've got duties, responsibilities,
expectations.

54
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,161
My whole life is planned out,

55
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,619
preparing for the day I become...

56
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,720
Well, my mother.

57
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,916
She's in charge
of every single day of my life.

58
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,332
"Aye, Robin, Jolly Robin,
and thou shalt know of mine."

59
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:00,883
Project!

60
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,027
"And thou shalt know of mine!"

61
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,040
Enunciate. You must be understood
from anywhere in the room,

62
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,000
or it's all for naught.

63
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,861
-This is all for naught.
-l heard that!

64
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,263
From the top.

65
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,225
A princess must be knowledgeable
about her kingdom.

66
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,827
She does not doodle.

67
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,478
That's a C, dear.

68
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,093
A princess does not chortle.

69
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,369
Does not stuff her gob!

70
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,091
Rises early.

71
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,946
.. 1S compassionate...

72
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,575
.. patient, cautious,

73
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,716
clean.

74
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:47,024
And above all, a princess
strives for... Well, perfection.

75
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,829
But every once in a while,

76
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,755
there's a day
when !I don't have to be a princess.

77
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,621
No lessons, no expectations.

78
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,107
A day where anything can happen.

79
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,635
A day! can change my fate.

80
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,020
I'm starving. You hungry too, Angus?

81
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,948
Oats it is, then.

82
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,589
Good day, Princess.

83
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,534
l cannot find the salt.
Where did you put it?

84
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,822
It was over there a minute ago,
the last time I looked at it.

85
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:30,205
And then, out of nowhere,
the biggest bear you've ever seen!

86
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,514
His hide littered with the weapons
of fallen warriors.

87
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,132
His face scarred with one dead eye.

88
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,915
I drew my sword and...

89
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,651
One swipe, his sword shattered.

90
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,804
Then "chomp"! Dad's leg was clean off.

91
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,610
Down the monster's throat it went.

92
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,539
That's my favorite part.

93
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:56,182
Mor'du has never been seen since,

94
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:01,239
and is roaming the wilds
waiting his chance of revenge.

95
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,283
Let him return.

96
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,997
I'll finish what
I guddled in the first place.

97
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:09,923
Merida, a princess does not place
her weapons on the table.

98
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,317
Mum! It's just my bow.

99
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,393
A princess should not have weapons
In my opinion.

100
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,080
Leave her be.

101
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,795
Princess or not,
learning to fight is essential.

102
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,674
Mum?
You'll never guess what I did today.

103
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,120
l climbed the Crone's Tooth,

104
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,628
and drank from the Fire Falls.

105
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,561
Fire Falls?

106
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,108
They say only the ancient kings
were brave enough to drink the fire.

107
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,364
-What did you do, dear?
-Nothing, Mum.

108
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,887
Hungry, aren't we?

109
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,219
-Mum!
-You'll get dreadful collywobbles.

110
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,218
Oh, Fergus, will you look at
your daughter's plate?

111
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,448
So what?

112
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,903
-You great...
-Don't let them lick...

113
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,575
Boys, you're naughty.

114
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,630
Don't just play with your haggis.

115
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,503
How do you know you don't like it,

116
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,635
if you won't try it?

117
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,601
That's just a wee sheep's stomach.

118
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,402
It's delicious.

119
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,519
-My lady.
-Thank you, Maudie.

120
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,018
You're getting too big, the two of you.

121
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,292
From the Lords Macintosh,
MacGuffin and Dingwall.

122
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,877
Their responses, no doubt.

123
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,452
Aye, aye!

124
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,474
Hey, hey!

125
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,923
Stay out of my food,
you greedy mongrels.

126
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,790
Chew on that, you manky dogs!

127
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,143
Fergus?

128
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,800
They've all accepted.

129
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,614
Who's accepted what, Mother?

130
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,896
Boys, you are excused.

131
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,906
Hey!

132
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,549
What did I do now?

133
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,028
Your father has something
to discuss with you.

134
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,642
Fergus?

135
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,111
Merida.

136
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,386
The lords are presenting
their sons as suitors for your betrothal.

137
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,524
-What?
-The clans have accepted.

138
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,607
-Dad!
-What? I...

139
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,065
You... She... Elinor?

140
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,608
Honestly, Merida, I don't know why
you're reacting this way.

141
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,649
This year,
each clan will present a suitor

142
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,818
to compete in the games for your hand.

143
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,660
Il suppose a princess
just does what she's told?

144
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,303
A princess does not raise her voice.

145
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,816
Merida, this is what you've been
preparing for your whole life.

146
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,746
No, it's what you've been preparing
me for my whole life.

147
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,220
l won't go through with it.
You can't make me.

148
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,435
Merida!

149
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,302
Merida!

150
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,872
Boys!

151
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,360
Mother. Suitors? Marriage?

152
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,023
Once there was an ancient kingdom...

153
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,659
Mum!

154
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,422
Ancient kingdom.

155
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,470
Its name long forgotten,

156
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,896
ruled by a wise and fair king
who was much beloved.

157
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:19,254
And when he grew old he divided
the kingdom among his four sons,

158
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,806
that they should be the pillars
on which the peace of the land rested.

159
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:30,115
But the oldest prince
wanted to rule the land for himself.

160
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,943
He followed his own path
and the kingdom fell

161
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,225
to war, and chaos and ruin.

162
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,234
That's a nice story.

163
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,073
It's not just a story, Merida.

164
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,803
Legends are lessons.
They ring with truths.

165
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,455
Mum.

166
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,564
I would advise you
to make your peace with this.

167
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,569
The clans are coming
to present their suitors.

168
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,008
-It's not fair.
-Merida.

169
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,900
It's marriage.
It's not the end of the world.

170
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,218
-You're muttering.
-[ don't mutter.

171
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,055
Aye, you do. You mutter, lass,
when something's troubling you.

172
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,332
I blame you. Stubbornness.

173
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,937
It's entirely from your side of the family.

174
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,120
I take it the talk didn't go too well, then?

175
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,853
I don't know what to do.

176
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,758
-Speak to her, dear.
-l do speak to her.

177
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,071
-She just doesn't listen.
-Come on, now.

178
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,668
Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me.

179
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:31,907
What would you say?

180
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,473
Il can't do this.

181
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,171
Sure you can.

182
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,790
There, there. That's my queen.

183
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,286
Right, here we go.

184
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:43,732
"l don't want to get married.

185
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,122
"want to stay single
and let my hair flow in the wind

186
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,419
"as l ride through the glen
firing arrows into the sunset."

187
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:00,248
Merida, all this work,
all the time spent preparing you,

188
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,333
schooling you,
giving you everything we never had.

189
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,834
l ask you, what do you expect us to do?

190
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,031
Call off the gathering.
Would that kill them?

191
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,651
You're the queen.

192
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,812
You can just tell the lords
the princess is not ready for this.

193
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,595
In fact, she might not ever be ready
for this, so that's that.

194
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,633
Good day to you. We'll expect your
declarations of war in the morning.

195
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,413
l understand this must all seem unfair.

196
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,010
Even I had reservations
when I faced betrothal.

197
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,440
But we can't just run away
from who we are.

198
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,209
I don't want my life to be over.

199
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:37,685
l want my freedom!

200
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,837
But are you willing to pay the price
your freedom will cost?

201
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,157
I'm not doing any of this to hurt you.

202
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:48,309
If you could just try to see what I do,
I do out of love.

203
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,661
But it's my life, it's...

204
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,958
I'm just not ready.

205
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,927
I think you'd see, if you could just...

206
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,975
I think l could make you understand
if you would just...

207
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,748
-... listen.
-... listen.

208
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,047
I swear, Angus,
this isn't going to happen.

209
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,048
Not if l have any say in it.

210
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,159
MacGuffin!

211
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,743
MacGuffin!

212
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,488
-Dingwall!
-Dingwall!

213
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,146
-Macintosh!
-Macintosh!

214
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,430
You look absolutely beautiful.

215
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,257
l can't breathe.

216
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,280
Shush! Give us a turn.

217
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:02,994
Il can't move.

218
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,069
It's too tight.

219
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,042
It's perfect.

220
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,763
-Merida?
-Mum?

221
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,775
Just...

222
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,610
Remember to smile.

223
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,245
Aye, they're coming.

224
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,671
Places, everyone. Places.

225
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,873
l look fine, woman! Leave me be!

226
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,726
My Lord!

227
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,801
l want to announce the arrival
of the lords...

228
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,044
Who goes there? Who goes there?

229
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,776
Boy!

230
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,774
So, here we are,

231
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,831
-the four clans.
-Aye.

232
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,428
Gathering...

233
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,737
. for...

234
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,286
-...the presentation of the suitors.
-...the presentation of the suitors.

235
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,313
Clan Macintosh.

236
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,599
Macintosh!

237
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,168
Your Majesty,
l present my heir and scion,

238
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,705
who defended our land
from the northern invaders,

239
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,849
and with his own sword, Stab Blooder,

240
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,596
vanquished 1,000 foes.

241
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,722
Macintosh!

242
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,639
Clan MacGuffin!

243
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,360
MacGuffin!

244
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,440
Good Majesty, I present my eldest son,

245
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,214
who scuttled the Viking longships

246
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:38,737
and with his bare hands
vanquished 2,000 foes.

247
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,308
MacGuffin!

248
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,516
Clan Dingwall.

249
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:46,965
Dingwall!

250
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,471
l present my only son

251
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,932
who was besieged by 10,000 Romans

252
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,340
and he took out a whole armada
singlehandedly.

253
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,271
With one arm, he was...

254
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,976
With one arm he was steering the ship

255
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,126
and with the other
he held his mighty sword

256
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,978
and struck down a whole attacking fleet.

257
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,462
-Lies!
-What? I heard that.

258
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,778
Go on. Say it to my face.

259
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,801
Or are ye scared,
simpering jackanapes,

260
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,060
afraid to muss your pretty hair?

261
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,262
-At least we have hair.
-And all our teeth.

262
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,869
If he was a wee bit closer...

263
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,437
And we don't hide under bridges,
you grumpy old troll.

264
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,047
You want to laugh, huh?

265
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,309
Wee Dingwall!

266
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,810
Get off me!

267
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,116
Nut 'em! Nut 'em! That's the way to...

268
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,248
All right.

269
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,594
Shut it!

270
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:13,355
Now, that's all done.
You've had your go at each other.

271
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,596
Show a little decorum.

272
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,559
And no more fighting.

273
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,048
You want a fresh one?

274
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,188
Crivens, you're fierce.

275
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,590
I didn't start it. It was...

276
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,165
My lady Queen, I feel terrible.
My humblest apologies.

277
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,721
-We mean no disrespect.
-I'm sorry, love, I didn't... But...

278
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,101
Yes, dear.

279
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,013
Now, where were we?

280
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,522
Yes. In accordance with our laws,

281
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,178
by the rights of our heritage,

282
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,445
only the firstborn of each
of the great leaders

283
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,632
-may be presented as champion.
-Firstborn?

284
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:30,451
And thus compete for the hand
of the Princess of Dun Broch.

285
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,373
To win the fair maiden
they must prove their worth

286
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,230
by feats of strength or arms
in the games.

287
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,801
It is customary that the challenge
be determined by the princess herself.

288
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,922
Archery! Archery.

289
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,976
I choose archery.

290
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,078
Let the games begin!

291
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,033
Pull!

292
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,510
Pull!

293
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,942
I'll just take one.

294
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,980
Now, I have told you,
you're not allowed...

295
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:10,952
It's time!

296
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,682
-Archers, to your marks!
-Aye, archers to your marks.

297
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,499
And may the lucky arrow find its target.

298
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,881
Oi! Get on with it.

299
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,322
l bet he wishes he was tossing cabers.

300
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:48,268
Or holding up bridges.

301
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,288
At least you hit the target, son.

302
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,723
That's attractive.

303
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,542
-I got it!
-Good arm.

304
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,716
And such lovely flowing locks.

305
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,381
-Fergus.
-What?

306
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,255
Wee lamb.

307
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,304
Come on! Shoot, boy!

308
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,608
Well done, lad! Well done.

309
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,243
Feast your eyes!

310
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,513
That's my boy.

311
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,688
Well, that's just grand now, isn't it?

312
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,390
-Guess who's coming to dinner?
-Fergus.

313
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,509
By the way, hope you don't mind
being called Lady...

314
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,439
lam Merida.

315
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,895
Firstborn descendant
of Clan Dun Broch.

316
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:13,186
And I'll be shooting for my own hand.

317
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:17,553
What are you doing?

318
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,513
Merida!

319
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,488
Curse this dress!

320
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,397
Merida, stop this!

321
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,296
Don't you dare loose another arrow.

322
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,878
Merida, I forbid it.

323
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,812
Michty me!
I've just about had enough of you, lass!

324
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,345
-You're the one that wants me to...
-You embarrassed them.

325
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:28,216
-You're the one that wants me to...
-You embarrassed them.

326
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,056
-You embarrassed me.
-I followed the rules.

327
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,022
You don't know what you've done!

328
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,571
-Just don't care how I...
-It'll be fire and sword if it's not set right.

329
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,237
-Just listen!
-l am the Queen!

330
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,916
You listen to me!

331
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,362
This is so unfair!

332
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,200
Unfair?

333
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,212
You're never there for me.

334
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,874
This whole marriage is what you want.

335
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,110
Do you ever bother
to ask what I want? No.

336
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,973
You walk around telling me what to do,
what not to do,

337
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,696
trying to make me be like you.

338
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,065
Well, I'm not going to be like you.

339
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,904
You're acting like a child.

340
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,673
And you're a beast.

341
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,786
-That's what you are!
-Merida.

342
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,138
-I'll never be like you.
-No, stop that!

343
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,450
I'd rather die than be like you!

344
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,341
Merida, you are a princess,

345
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,297
-and I expect you to act like one.
-Mum!

346
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,505
Merida!

347
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,235
Merida!

348
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,047
Oh, dear.

349
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,306
Oh, no. What have I done?

350
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,456
Angus!

351
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,070
Come on, Angus.

352
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,652
Angus!

353
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,800
Why would the wisps lead me here?

354
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,897
Look around.

355
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,123
You holler if you see anything you like.

356
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,601
Everything is half off.

357
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,053
-Who are you?
-Just a humble woodcarver.

358
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,783
I don't understand...

359
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,750
See anything you like?

360
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,678
Perhaps a touch of whimsy
to brighten any dank chamber?

361
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,550
But the will-o'-the-wisps, they...

362
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,716
This is one of a kind!

363
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,712
I'll make you a deal for this rare prize.

364
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,486
Your broom!

365
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,635
-It was sweeping by itself.
-That's ridiculous.

366
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,435
Wood cannot be imbued
with magical properties.

367
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,824
I should know. I'm a... Whittler.

368
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,884
Of wood.

369
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:22,306
How about this conversation starter?
It's made of yew wood.

370
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,537
How about this conversation starter?
It's made of yew wood.

371
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,649
Tough as stone.

372
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,292
That's stuffed.

373
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,487
-Staring is rude.
-The crow's talking!

374
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,063
That's not alll can do.

375
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,543
-You're a witch!
-Woodcarver.

376
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,897
That's why the wisps led me here.

377
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,577
-Woodcarver!
-You'll change my fate!

378
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,366
-Woodcarver!
-You see, it's my mother.

379
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,495
I'm not a witch!
Too many unsatisfied customers.

380
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,551
If you're not going to buy anything,
get out.

381
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,109
-No! The wisps led me here!
-l don't care!

382
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,997
-Get out! Shoo! Get! Be gone with you!
-I'll buy it all.

383
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,859
-What? What was that?
-Every carving.

384
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,118
Well...

385
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,264
And how are you going
to pay for that, sweetie?

386
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,697
With this.

387
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,556
Oh, my, that's lovely, that is.

388
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,239
That would set us up for months.

389
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:40,537
Every carving and one spell.

390
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,944
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

391
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,710
I want a spell to change my mum.

392
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:51,224
That'll change my fate.

393
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:52,863
Done!

394
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,123
Where are you going?

395
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,699
There.

396
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,020
What are you doing?

397
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,672
You never conjure where you carve.

398
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,471
Very important.

399
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,130
The last time I did this
was for a prince.

400
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,540
Easy on the eyes. Tight pants.

401
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,164
He demanded I give him
the strength of ten men.

402
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,433
And he gave me this for a spell.

403
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,360
A spell that would change his fate.

404
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,761
And did he get what he was after?

405
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:33,007
Yes. And made off with an especially
attractive mahogany cheese board.

406
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,958
Now, what do I need?

407
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,091
Just a little bit of this.

408
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:48,478
That'll do.

409
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:11,687
And now let's see. What have we here?

410
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,383
Hey!

411
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,202
A cake?

412
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,064
-You don't want it?
-Yes! I want it.

413
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:29,841
You're sure if I give this to my mum,

414
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,952
it will change my fate?

415
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,969
Trust me. It'll do the trick, dearie.

416
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:42,319
Expect delivery of your purchase
within a fortnight.

417
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,777
What was that thing about the spell?

418
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:51,367
Did you say something about

419
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,527
the spell?

420
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:01,666
Mor'du, Mor'du, now the time has
come for all of us to slaughter you

421
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,163
Hooray!

422
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,579
Mor'du, Mor'du...

423
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,613
-Merida.
-Mum!

424
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:32,317
-I've been worried sick.
-You... You were?

425
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,011
I didn't know where you'd gone
or when you'd come back.

426
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,947
I didn't know what to think.
Look at your dress.

427
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,700
Angus threw me. But I'm not hurt.

428
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:45,232
Well, you're home now,
so that's the end of it.

429
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,634
-Honestly?
-l've pacified the lords for now.

430
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,721
Your father's out there
"entertaining" them.

431
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,758
Come taste my blade, you manky bear

432
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,420
For gobbling up my leg

433
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:00,338
lil hunt you, then I'll skin you,
hang your noggin on a peg...

434
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,561
Of course, we both know
a decision still has to be made.

435
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,489
-What's this?
-It's a peace offering.

436
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,682
I made it. For you. Special.

437
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,658
You made this for me?

438
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,208
Interesting flavor.

439
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,716
How do you feel?

440
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,031
-What... What is that?
-Different?

441
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,395
Tart and gamy.

442
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:40,405
Have you changed your mind at all
about the marriage and all that?

443
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:42,923
That's better.

444
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,183
Now, why don't we go
upstairs to the lords

445
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,324
and put this whole kerfuffle to rest?

446
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,369
-Mother?
-I'm woozy suddenly.

447
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,922
My head's spinning like a top.

448
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,604
-Mum!
-Suddenly I'm not so well.

449
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,656
How do you feel
about the marriage now?

450
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,685
Merida! Just take me to my room.

451
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,489
All right, that's fine.
That's just fine.

452
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:20,168
A little to the left. That's good.
A wee bit to the left. That's good.

453
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,132
It's good enough.

454
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,983
Now, clear out of there, boys.
I don't want you to spoil my shot.

455
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,866
-What?
-My lady Queen.

456
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,785
We've been waiting patiently.

457
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:34,560
Milords, l am out of sorts
at the moment.

458
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,556
But you shall have your answer.

459
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,509
Presently.

460
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,307
Now, if you'll excuse us.

461
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:48,702
Elinor, look!

462
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,857
It's Mor'du!

463
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,334
Elinor? Are you all right, dear?

464
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,186
Fine. I'm fine.

465
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,521
Go about avenging your leg.

466
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,863
Aye. You heard her, lads.

467
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,809
I dream about the perfect way
to make this devil die.

468
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,124
Just take all the time you need
to getting yourself right, Mum.

469
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:16,077
Then maybe in a bit you might have
something new to say on the marriage.

470
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,781
What was in that cake?

471
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,587
Cake.

472
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,100
Mum?

473
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,582
So I'll just tell them
the wedding's off, then?

474
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,700
Mum?

475
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:01,895
Bear!

476
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,723
Mum?

477
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,487
You're... You're a bear!

478
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,276
Why a bear?

479
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,188
That scaffy witch
gave me a gammy spell.

480
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:53,917
It's not my fault.

481
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,855
I didn't ask her
to change you into a bear.

482
00:40:56,187 --> 00:41:00,377
I just wanted her to change you.

483
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,020
Did you hear that?

484
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,330
Something's not right.

485
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,895
There's no point in having a go at me.
The witch is to blame.

486
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,249
Goggly old hag.

487
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,586
Eyes all over the place.

488
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,399
Unbelievable.

489
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,523
I'll get her to fix this.

490
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,105
Why do l always get blamed
for everything? It's just not fair.

491
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:39,208
Everybody, follow me.

492
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,360
And keep a sharp eye.

493
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,120
Here we go.
Another hunt through the castle.

494
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,086
But we haven't had dessert yet.

495
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:54,718
Il have no idea.

496
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,040
Mum, you can't go out there.

497
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,434
Mum! Wait!

498
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:06,758
What are you doing?
Dad. The Bear King?

499
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,194
If he so much as sees you, you're dead.

500
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,981
Another one of
your entertainments to bore us to death!

501
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,791
And what exactly are we after...

502
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:15,935
Mum!

503
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,797
..my liege?

504
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,819
Best to humor him.
He is, after all, the King.

505
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,193
He's like a hound with that nose of his.

506
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,560
Mum, wait.

507
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,112
We have to...

508
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,587
Follow me.

509
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,369
Stop.

510
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:37,557
Stop!

511
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,995
You're covered with fur.

512
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,821
You're not naked.

513
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,739
It's not like anyone's gonna see you.

514
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:55,832
Now you've done it.

515
00:42:58,476 --> 00:42:59,936
Maudie!

516
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,667
Just calm down, lass. What is it?

517
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:05,044
Spit it out, Maudie!

518
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:06,906
A bear!

519
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:08,585
I knew it!

520
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,668
Would you just listen to me?

521
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,449
We can't go this way. You'll be seen.

522
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,002
Quick! This way!

523
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,466
Mum?

524
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,307
Mum?

525
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,117
A witch turned Mum into a bear.
It's not my fault.

526
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,683
We've got to get out of the castle.
I need your help.

527
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,243
All right.

528
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,315
You can have my desserts for two...
Three weeks.

529
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:11,187
Okay. Fine. A year.

530
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,011
Did you hear that?

531
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,084
There it goes!

532
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,285
Come on, lads!

533
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,278
There it goes!

534
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,046
Come on, Mum.

535
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,145
Think we should lay a trap?

536
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,860
Try shutting yours!

537
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,218
There he is!

538
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,348
I'm sure it went this way.

539
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:24,994
You can see my house from here.

540
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,959
It must have sprouted wings.

541
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,041
Was carried away by a giant birdy.

542
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:33,337
-A dragon, perhaps.
-Bear in the castle!

543
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,531
Doesn't make sense.
It cannot open doors.

544
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,506
He's got big giant paws!

545
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,098
Let's just get inside.

546
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,849
-It's locked.
-Dingwall was the last up.

547
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:46,145
I propped it open with a stick.

548
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,810
What did you see, Maudie?
Just spit it out, Maudie.

549
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,144
For goodness’ sakes, Maudie,
would you get a grip?

550
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,855
Maudie, honey, come here!
It's all right!

551
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:08,959
Come on, Mum. Quick.

552
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,904
They'll be fine. Won't you, boys?

553
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,774
Mum, we've got to hurry.

554
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,560
Now, I'll be back soon.

555
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:40,522
Go on and help yourself
to anything you want, as a reward.

556
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,209
Right!

557
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,371
Where are these wisps?

558
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:12,627
Come out, wisps. Come on out.

559
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,915
Lead me to the witch's cottage.

560
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,132
I'm here!

561
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,435
Fine. Don't come out
now that my mum's watching.

562
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:30,344
l was standing right here
and the wisp appeared right there.

563
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,411
Then a whole trail of them
led me off into the forest.

564
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,615
Does she think we're just going
to happen upon the witch's cottage?

565
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,076
Mum, I know this place.

566
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,479
The witch's cottage...

567
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,298
It's this way! Come on! Hurry!

568
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,708
I can't believe it. I found it.

569
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:27,172
No. She was here.

570
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,102
No, really, she was just here.

571
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,337
Wait.

572
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,996
No.

573
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:44,312
No, no. No! No!

574
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,254
Welcome to the Crafty Carver,

575
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,610
home of bear-themed carvings
and novelties.

576
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,900
lam completely out of stock
at this time.

577
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:23,810
But if you'd like to enquire about
portraits or wedding cake toppers,

578
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,469
pour vial one into the cauldron.

579
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,137
If you'd like the menu in Gaelic,
vial two.

580
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:32,027
If you're that red-haired lass, vial three.

581
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,520
To speak with a live homunculus...

582
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:38,875
Princess, I'm off to the Wickerman
Festival in Stornoway

583
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,180
and won't be back till spring.

584
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:44,672
There's one bit I forgot to tell you
about the spell.

585
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:48,496
By the second sunrise,
your spell will be permanent,

586
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,379
unless you remember these words.

587
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:56,305
Fate be changed,

588
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,359
look inside,

589
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,336
mend the bond

590
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,444
torn by pride.

591
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,383
"Fate be changed... Mend the bond."
What does that mean?

592
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,413
One more time.

593
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,286
Fate be changed,

594
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,441
look inside,

595
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,326
mend the bond

596
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,515
torn by pride.

597
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,451
That's it. Ta-ta.

598
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:21,496
And thank you for shopping
at the Crafty Carver.

599
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,946
No. No! Where'd you go?

600
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,559
-Welcome to the Crafty Carver...
-What?

601
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,888
...for all your...

602
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:33,891
Maybe there's a book of spells.
Look around. We'll need more vials.

603
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,990
I'm off to the Wickerman Festival
in Stornoway...

604
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,069
Thank you for visiting.
Have a lovely day.

605
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,408
We'll sort it out tomorrow.

606
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,987
My brave wee lassie, I'm here.

607
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,097
I'll always be right here.

608
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,506
Good morning.

609
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,776
So...

610
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:49,712
What's all this supposed to be?

611
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,013
What?

612
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,784
Sorry. I don't speak bear.

613
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,538
Find those by the creek, did you?

614
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:28,859
Find those by the creek, did you?

615
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,997
They're nightshade berries.

616
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,174
They're poisonous.

617
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,637
Where did you get this water?
It has worms.

618
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,725
Come on.

619
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:09,875
Breakfast.

620
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:16,085
Wait. A princess should not
have weapons, in your opinion.

621
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:19,962
There you go.

622
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,822
Goon.

623
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:28,053
How do you know you don't like it
if you won't try it?

624
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,356
Hey!

625
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,379
Where are you going?

626
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:53,686
Mum, come back.

627
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,731
Mun, is that you?

628
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,862
Mum?

629
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,356
You changed.

630
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,018
Like you were a...

631
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,398
I mean, like you were a bear
on the inside.

632
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,680
Awisp.

633
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,449
Mum!

634
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,514
Stop it!

635
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:49,281
Mum, no!

636
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,301
Mum...

637
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,996
Jings, crivens, help ma boab.

638
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:03,398
Mum, I know you're scared,

639
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,390
you're tired, you don't understand,

640
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,720
but we've got to keep our heads.

641
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,273
Just calm down.

642
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,786
Listen.

643
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:44,877
They'll show us the way.

644
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,939
Mum, look.

645
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,402
Why did the wisps
bring us here?

646
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:56,968
Whoever they were,
they've been gone for a long, long time.

647
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,857
I'm fine, Mum. Just fine.

648
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:18,643
It's

649
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:20,716
a throne room.

650
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,132
You suppose this could've
been the kingdom

651
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,944
in that story you were telling me?

652
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,767
The one with the princes.

653
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,386
One,

654
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:35,598
two,

655
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:37,286
three,

656
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,107
four.

657
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,058
The oldest.

658
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,077
Split, like the tapestry.

659
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,882
The spell. It's happened before.

660
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,126
"Strength of ten men.”

661
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,663
"Fate be changed."

662
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,641
"Changed his fate."

663
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,565
Oh, no.

664
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,620
The prince became...

665
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:22,615
Mor'du.

666
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,522
Mum, we need to get back to the castle.

667
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:35,389
If we don't hurry,
you'll become like Mor'du.

668
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,115
A bear!

669
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:39,377
A real bear. Forever!

670
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,747
"Mend the bond torn by pride."

671
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:47,534
The witch gave us the answer.
The tapestry.

672
01:02:57,474 --> 01:02:59,964
Mum, do you have a better idea?

673
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:19,828
That'll do.

674
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:35,314
No more talk.

675
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:38,415
No more traditions. We settle this now!

676
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,205
You're the King.

677
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,883
You decide which one of our sons
your daughter will marry.

678
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:47,204
None of your sons
are fit to marry my daughter.

679
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:50,441
Then our alliance is over!
This means war!

680
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:56,925
They're gonna murder each other.

681
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:58,663
You've got to stop them
before it's too late.

682
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:02,731
I know, I know!

683
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,316
But how do we get you through there
and up to the tapestry

684
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:07,492
with the lot of them
boiling over like that?

685
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,070
-What are you doing, lass?
-It's all right, Dad.

686
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:32,604


687
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:35,683
Il have...

688
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:39,477
Well, you see, I...

689
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,246
Il have been in conference
with the Queen.

690
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:45,126
-ls that so?
-Aye, itis.

691
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,537
-Well, where is she, then?
-She...

692
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,727
How do we know that
this isn't some trick?

693
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,665
-I'd never...
-This is highly irregular.

694
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,627
-What are you playing at?
-Where is the Queen?

695
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:56,176
We will not stand
for any more of this jiggery-pokery.

696
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,462
-That's right. Let's see her.
-Shut it!

697
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,466
Well, I...

698
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,598
Once there was an ancient kingdom.

699
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:19,999
What is this?

700
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:24,077
That kingdom fell into war

701
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,837
and chaos and ruin...

702
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,507
We've all heard that tale.
Lost kingdom.

703
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,236
Aye, but it's true.

704
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:34,718
I know now how one selfish act
can turn the fate of a kingdom.

705
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,495
It's just a legend.

706
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,196
Legends are lessons.

707
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,999
They ring with truths.

708
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:43,982
Our kingdom is young.

709
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,037
Our stories are not yet legend.

710
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,260
But in them, our bond was struck.

711
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,519
Our clans were once enemies.

712
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:54,835
But when invaders threatened us
from the sea,

713
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,942
you joined together to defend our lands.

714
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:01,192
You fought for each other.

715
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,321
You risked everything for each other.

716
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,834
Lord MacGuffin, my dad saved your life,

717
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,227
stopping an arrow
as you ran to Dingwall's aid.

718
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,179
Aye, and I'll never forget it.

719
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:12,985
And, Lord Macintosh,

720
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:16,193
you saved my dad
when you charged in on heavy horse

721
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:18,133
and held off the advance.

722
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:21,981
And we all know how Lord Dingwall
broke the enemy line.

723
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,359
With a mighty throw of his spear!

724
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,384
lI was aiming at you, you big tumshie.

725
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:31,368
The story of this kingdom
is a powerful one.

726
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,965
My dad rallied your forces

727
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:36,571
and you made him your king.

728
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,530
It was an alliance forged in bravery
and friendship

729
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,620
and it lives to this day.

730
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,594
But I've been selfish.

731
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,667
I tore a great rift in our kingdom.

732
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:56,691
There's no one to blame but me.

733
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:01,004
And I know now
that l need to amend my mistake

734
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:04,082
and mend our bond.

735
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:09,262
And so, there is the matter
of my betrothal.

736
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,060
I've decided to do what's right

737
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:15,553
and...

738
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:16,969
. and...

739
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:20,332
. and...

740
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,318
.. break tradition.

741
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:32,694
My mother,

742
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,467
the Queen, feels...

743
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:40,475
in her heart

744
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:42,493
that I...

745
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,770
.. that we be free to...

746
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:51,628
.. write our own story...

747
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:57,526
... follow our hearts

748
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:02,202
and find love in our own time.

749
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,259
That's beautiful.

750
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:13,002
The Queen and I put the decision
to you, my lords.

751
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:17,226
Might our young people decide
for themselves who they will love?

752
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,648
Well, since you've obviously
made up your minds about this,

753
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:24,035
Il have one thing to say.

754
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,420
-This is...
-A grand idea!

755
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,883
Give us our own say
in choosing our fate.

756
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,992
-What?
-Aye. Why shouldn't we choose?

757
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,345
But she's the princess.

758
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:37,321
I did not pick her out. It was your idea.

759
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:40,590
And you... You feel the same way?

760
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:47,125
Good?

761
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,660
Well, that settles it.

762
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:57,032
Let these lads try and win her heart
before they win her hand.

763
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,929
If they can.

764
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:01,722
I say, the wee Dingwall
has a fighting chance.

765
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:04,161
Fine, then. Seems for once we agree.

766
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,149
It was my idea in the first place.

767
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,294
Just like your mum.

768
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:20,792
You devil.

769
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,263
Everyone to the cellar!

770
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:33,501
Let's crack open the King's
private reserve to celebrate!

771
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,547
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

772
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,738
Bring the tiny glasses.

773
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:57,349
Oh, the tapestry!

774
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:02,333
Mend the bond...

775
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,706
Mend the bond.

776
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:08,469
Stitch it up. This'll change you back.

777
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:10,925
We just need needle and thread.

778
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,480
Mum?

779
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:23,024
Mum? Not now.

780
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,539
No. Please, not now.

781
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,583
Mum...

782
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:42,563
Elinor, dear, you'll never guess
who just solved our little suitor problem.

783
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,324
Elinor!

784
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,595
It can't be true!
Elinor, answer me, lass!

785
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:04,999
Elinor!

786
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:07,212
Merida.

787
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,785
-What?
-Dad, no! It's not what you think.

788
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:12,977
-Merida, get back!
-No!

789
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,084
No, Dad! Don't hurt her!

790
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,890
Get out of here!

791
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,622
Merida! No!

792
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,659
No!

793
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:41,519
Mum.

794
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:50,048
It's all right. I'm all right. It's nothing.
It's just a little scratch. Mum!

795
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,470
My liege!

796
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,115
Fergus.

797
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,841
Bear!

798
01:11:58,114 --> 01:11:59,044
Dad!

799
01:11:59,282 --> 01:12:01,502
Count your stars, lass.
It almost had you. Are you hurt?

800
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:03,407
It's your wife, Elinor.

801
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:08,730
Close the gate!

802
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,171
-You're talking nonsense!
-It's the truth!

803
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,309
There was a witch and she
gave me a spell. It's not Mor'du.

804
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,910
Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother!

805
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,873
-I'll not risk losing you, too.
-No, Dad! Just listen to me.

806
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,690
Listen! You can't!

807
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:30,889
-It's your wife Elinor!
-Maudie, keep this and don't let her out.

808
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,004
-What about the bear?
-Just stay put.

809
01:13:01,244 --> 01:13:03,554
Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots!

810
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:13,958
Mum!

811
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,593
No.

812
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,882
No. Mum.

813
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:40,829
Maudie. Maudie!

814
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:43,461
I need you!

815
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,109
Now!

816
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,045
Oh, no.

817
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:54,582
Maudie.

818
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:00,799
Get the key.

819
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:22,327
Maudie!

820
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,934
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.
Needle and thread.

821
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:50,982
There he goes!

822
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,500
Needle and thread.
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.

823
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:55,003
You beauty!

824
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:24,864
One, two...

825
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,363
Steady, Hamish.

826
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,782
There he goes.

827
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:10,697
We've got his track!

828
01:16:15,638 --> 01:16:17,508
-Back, back, back!
-Get him!

829
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,651
Angus! Easy, laddie.

830
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:29,063
Hubert, Harris, help Hamish.

831
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,572
Watch your blade! You're going
to take somebody's arm off!

832
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,016
Aye, we've got you now!

833
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,012
-Give me a hand over here!
-Put your back into it, Dingwall!

834
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,568
I'm doing all the pulling here.

835
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:41,880
Down you go, you scoundrel.

836
01:16:45,568 --> 01:16:46,738
Done!

837
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:15,404
-Get back. That's my mother.
-Are you out of your mind, lass?

838
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:17,227
Mum, are you hurt?

839
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,657
Merida!

840
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,866
I'll not let you kill my mother.

841
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,912
Boys!

842
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:36,781
Boys?

843
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:44,822
-Mor'du!
-Kill it!

844
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:50,749
You scoundrel!

845
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:57,914
Come on!
I'll take you with my bare hands!

846
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,244
Mum!

847
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:51,892
The second sunrise.

848
01:20:31,527 --> 01:20:33,107
No...

849
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:36,707
I don't understand. l...

850
01:20:48,477 --> 01:20:51,607
Oh, Mum, I'm sorry.

851
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,976
This is all my fault.

852
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,402
I did this to you.

853
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:00,097
Tous.

854
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:08,438
You've always been there for me.

855
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,815
You've never given up on me.

856
01:21:14,136 --> 01:21:15,596
I just want you back.

857
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,139
I want you back, Mummy.

858
01:21:43,165 --> 01:21:44,894
Il love you.

859
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:14,818
Mum! You're back!

860
01:22:21,837 --> 01:22:23,007
You changed!

861
01:22:23,906 --> 01:22:25,246
Oh, darling,

862
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:27,718
we both have.

863
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:30,331
Elinor!

864
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:36,994
Elinor!

865
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,019
Oh, dear.

866
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:48,425
You're back. She came back to us.

867
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,307
It's a great day for this kingdom.
The curse is broke.

868
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:54,111
Mum.

869
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:56,721
Dear?

870
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:57,902
I'm naked.

871
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,040
Naked as a wee babby.

872
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:02,249
Don't just stare at me. Do something!

873
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,092
What the... Avert your eyes, lads!

874
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,682
Show some respect!

875
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:15,298
Now that's what I call
a wee naked babby!

876
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:21,734
Merida, Elinor, hurry up.
They're leaving.

877
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,063
-Mum!
-They're off! Come on!

878
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:26,513
We've got to wave them off!
Come along!

879
01:23:55,531 --> 01:24:00,010
Goodbye! All the best!
Fair wind to your sails!

880
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:07,294
But how did this...

881
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,982
There are those who say fate
is something beyond our command,

882
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,607
that destiny is not our own.

883
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:23,019
But I know better.

884
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:27,163
Our fate lives within us.

885
01:24:29,331 --> 01:24:31,731
You only have to be brave enough
to see it.

886
01:33:35,043 --> 01:33:37,063
Delivery. Sign here, sign here.

887
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:42,175
Come on, birdbrain.
l haven't got all day.
