00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,150
What a moron.

889
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,009
Hey, genius! It's a jawbreaker.

890
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,624
You're never going to break...

891
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,111
Huh.

892
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,296
(PANTING)

893
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:00,087
Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper baby?

894
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:01,665
Leave me alone.

895
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,680
Look, you want that medal,
right? And I want to race.

896
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,779
So here's what I'm thinking.

897
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,996
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

898
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,156
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

899
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,909
You want me to help you?

900
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,377
All you got to do is
break something for me.

901
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,167
Come on. What do you say, friend?

902
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,064
We are not friends.

903
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:28,003
Oh, come on, pal. You son of a gun.

904
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,633
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

905
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,233
Ah. Come on, chumbo.

906
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,674
Ralph, my man. My main man.

907
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,507
Hey!

908
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,705
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?

909
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,366
(GRUNTS) You better win.

910
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,975
Well, I'll say this much,

911
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:51,407
they don't call your friend
"Wreck-It" for nothing.

912
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,264
There's the shuttle.

913
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,022
Is he in there?

914
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,934
Nope. Lucky for him.

915
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,556
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

916
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,360
No Cy-Bug, either.

917
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,942
Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs.

918
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:13,797
It came this way,

919
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,508
but the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

920
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,073
. .
are Jamming my sensor.

921
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,558
Can't get a read on it.

922
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,910
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

923
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,274
Why did he go AWOL?

924
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,843
I wish I knew, ma'am.

925
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,565
He was acting all squirrelly last night...

926
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,271
Going on about cake and medals...

927
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,287
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

928
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,830
"Go Turbo"?

929
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,542
That's right,
you guys just got plugged in.

930
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:40,018
Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

931
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,031
Turbo Time was by far
the most popular game.

932
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,584
-And Turbo...
-Turbo-tastic!

933
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,297
-He loved the attention.
-Turbo-tastic!

934
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,296
So, when RoadBlasters got plugged in

935
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,042
and stole Turbo's thunder...

936
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,607
New game. All right!

937
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,566
Boy, was he jealous.

938
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,889
So jealous that
he abandoned his game

939
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,765
and tried to take over the new one.

940
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,964
PLAYER 1: These are
the greatest graphics I've ever seen!

941
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:06,346
Turbo-tastic!

942
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,598
PLAYER 2: Hey. Is that...
That looks like Turbo.

943
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,210
PLAYER 2: Hey. Is that...
That looks like Turbo.

944
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,044
PLAYER 1: What's Turbo doing
in this game? Aw, come on!

945
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:14,861
PLAYER 2: Mr. Litwak!

946
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,280
FELIX: Turbo ended up
putting both games and himself

947
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,747
out of order, for good.

948
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,014
Yes, the selfish man
is like a mangy dog

949
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,124
chasing a cautionary tale.

950
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:29,986
l know, right?

951
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:30,007
l know, right?

952
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,334
That's why I have to get Ralph home

953
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,530
or the same thing's
gonna happen to my game.

-"Nesquik Sand"?
-Quicksand?

960
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:46,982
Oh, I'll hop out
and grab you one of those vines.

961
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:48,255

This is hopeless!

We're going to drown here.

966
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:58,871
Stop thrashing. Stop moving.

967
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,083
You're making us sink faster.

968
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,201
We're going to die!

969
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:02,709

FELIX: The vines. They're Laffy Taffy.

972
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,014
They're attracted to
whatever makes them laugh.

973

Come on. We'll get
a better view from the air.

You think you can fix that shuttle?

995

Where are the carts?

You gotta make one.

What? No, no.

1237
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,355
Oh, that's not blunt force trauma, ma'am.

1238
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:54,222
That's just the honey glow
in my cheeks.

1239
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:56,235
Okay.

1240
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,430
Ma'am, I just got to tell you...

1241
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,209
You are one dynamite gal.

1242
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:08,071
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.

1243
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,902
One dynamite gal.

1244
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:12,734
Dynamite gal.

1245
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,243
Dynamite gal.

1246
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:15,683
Dynamite...

1247
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,044
(SCREAMING)

1248
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,464
Get out.

1249
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,352
All l said is you're a dynamite gal.

1250
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:26,008
Il said get out!

1251
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,477
Oh. Jiminey jaminey.

1252
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,388
Yes?

1253
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:45,938
Oh.

1254
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:50,093
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr., sir,
from the game Fix-It Felix Jr.

1255
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,181
Have you seen my friend Ralph?

1256
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:53,779
Wreck-It Ralph?

1257
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,487
Yes. Yes, that's him!

1258
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,506
We should have locked him up
when we had the chance.

1259
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,042
Locked him up?

1260
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,830
I'm not making
the same mistake with you.

1261
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:05,477
(SCREAMS)

1262
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,279
VANELLOPE: Hurry, hurry!
Let's go. Time's a-wastin’.

1263
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,656
Come on, Ralph!

1264
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:12,634
This is it. This is really happening.

1265
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,073
l almost don't believe it.

1266
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,881
I mean, l have dreamt about it
for so long, and now...

1267
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,250
And now... Now I think
I'm going to puke, actually.

1268
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:20,803
I mean, I think I might puke.

1269
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,444
-You know, like a "vurp."
-A what?

1270
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:24,266
Vomit and a burp together,

1271
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:26,598
and you can taste it,
and it's just like rising up.

1272
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,150
Oh, this is so exciting!

1273
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:30,015
Yes, it is. It's exciting.

1274
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,123
Am I ready to be a real racer?

1275
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,366
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

1276
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,714
Who doesn't love a brat
with dirty hair? Come on.

1277
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,208
Those people are going
to love you. You know why?

1278
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:44,072
-Because you're a winner.
-I'm a winner.

1279
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,894
-And you're adorable!
-I'm adorable!

1280
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,770
And everyone loves
an adorable winner!

1281
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,346
Yeah!

1282
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:52,504
Okay, come on. Listen to me.

1283
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,546
If you get nervous,
just keep telling yourself,

1284
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,669
"I must win Ralph's medal
or his life will be ruined."

1285
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,374
-And have fun. Got it?
-Got it.

1286
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,029
Whoa!

1287
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,341
Oh, wait!

(BRAKES SCREECHING)

1289
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:07,973
Hold on!

1290
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:09,067
Where are you going?

1291
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,959
I forgot something! I'll be right back!

1292
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,491

1293
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,640

01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,140
Ralph! (CHUCKLES)
There you are. Hello!

1296
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,430
-You!
-l come alone, unarmed.

1297
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,069
I've had enough of you, pillow pants!

1298
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,107
Please. Calm down! Please, look. Don't!

1299
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,319
(SHUDDERING)

1300
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,000
I'm going to beat the filling out of you!

1301
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:33,044
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1302
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,423
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's... Well played.

1303
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,040
-(GASPS)
-What do you want, Candy?

1304
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:40,639
Listen, I just want to talk to you.

1305
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:43,544
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

1306
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,500
How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1307
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,798
My medal. How did you...

1308
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:53,383
It doesn't matter.
It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

1309
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,799
(CHUCKLES)

1310
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,495
Whoa.

1311
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,540
All lask is that you hear me out.

1312
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,163
About what?

1313
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,031
Ralph, do you know
what the hardest part

1314
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,847
about being a king is?

1315
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,399
Doing what's right, no matter what.

1316
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:09,627
Get to the point.

1317
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:12,134
Point being, I need your help.

1318
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:16,556
Sad as itis, Vanellope
cannot be allowed to race.

1319
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,053
Why are you people so against her?

1320
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:22,146
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

1321
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,175
If Vanellope wins that race

1322
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,265
she'll be added to the race roster.

1323
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,714
Then gamers can choose her
as their avatar.

1324
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,785
And when they see her glitching

1325
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:36,444
and twitching and just being herself,

1326
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,460
they'll think our game is broken.

1327
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,486
We'll be put out of order for good.

1328
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,423
All my subjects will be homeless.

(SHOUTING)

1330
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:51,261
But there's one who cannot
escape because she's a glitch.

1331
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,138
Help! Somebody, help! Help!

1332
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,731
KING CANDY: And when
the game's plug is pulled...

1333
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,267
(SCREAMS) No!

1334
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,613
.. she'll die with it.

1335
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,799
You don't know that will happen.

1336
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:06,185
The gamers could love her.

1337
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,332
And if they don't?

1338
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:17,625
I know it's tough,

1339
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,761
but heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

1340
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:26,311
She can't race, Ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

1341
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,069
So can I! count on you to
talk a little sense into her?

1342
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:34,232
Very good.

1343
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:37,588
I'll give you two some time alone.

1344
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,196
(SIGHS)

1345
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,327
I'm back!

1346
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:07,718
Did you miss me?

1347
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:12,167
Yeah... Uh... Can we talk for a second?

1348
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:12,218
Yeah... Uh... Can we talk for a second?

1349
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,065
Wait. First, kneel down.

1350
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,337
-What? No, we really...
-Will you just do it?

1351
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:18,337
Okay.

1352
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,339
-Now, close your eyes.
-Vanellope...

1353
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:23,919
Shush! Close them!

1354
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:25,531
(EXHALES)

1355
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:29,084
Okay. Open them up.

1356
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:34,725
"To Stinkbrain." Gee, thanks.

1357
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,091
Turn it over.

1358
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:39,925
I made it for you.

1359
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:42,087
Just in case we don't win.

1360
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,465
Not that I think
there's even a remote chance

1361
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:45,703
we're not going to win.

1362
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:48,837
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1363
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:48,858
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1364
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:53,132
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.

1365
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,466
Ralph, come on. Move your molasses.

1366
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:57,806
Um...

1367
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:00,484
-I've been thinking.
-That's dangerous.

1368
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:03,651
Who cares about
this stupid race anyway? Right?

1369
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,291
(LAUGHS) That's not very funny, Ralph.

1370
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:08,473
No, I'm serious, and it was really fun

1371
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:09,785
to build the car and everything...

1372
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:12,719
But maybe you shouldn't do it.

1373
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,439
Hello? Is Ralph in there?

1374
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:17,172
I'd like to speak to him, please.

1375
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,177
Look, what I'm saying is
you can't be a racer.

1376
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:20,586
What?

1377
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:23,292
Why would you...

1378
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,087
Wait a minute.

1379
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:27,779
No!

1380
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:28,911
Where did you get this?

1381
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,896
Look, I'm going to be
straight with you, kid.

1382
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:33,572
I've been talking to King Candy.

1383
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,190
-King Candy?
-Yeah.

1384
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:36,565
You sold me out?

1385
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,410
No, I didn't... Listen.
You don't understand.

1386
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:40,725
No, l understand plenty. Traitor!

1387
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,241
I'm not a traitor. Listen.

1388
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:43,635
You're a rat!

1389
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,923
And I don't need you, and
Il can win the race on my own.

1390
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:48,953
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid!

1391
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:50,792
Put me down! Let me go!

1392
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,127
No, you listen to me.

1393
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:53,218
Do you know what's going to happen

1394
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:54,319
when the players see you glitching?

1395
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:55,616
They'll think the game's broken.

1396
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:57,102
I don't care! You're a liar!

1397
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,550
You better care, because
if your game goes out of order,

1398
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:00,826
you go down with the ship, little sister!

1399
01:08:01,044 --> 01:08:01,944
I'm not listening to you!

1400
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,578
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!

1401
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,208
No, you're not!

1402
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:07,939
(GRUNTING)

1403
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,647
Take me down from here, Ralph,
right now!

1404
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,097
No. I'm doing this for your own good!

1405
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:16,708
Wait, wait, wait.

1406
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:18,557
No. No.

1407
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:20,549
No, no, no, no, no!

1408
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:21,819
Please, Ralph!

01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:25,329
And it's a big duty!

1763
01:30:27,622 --> 01:30:28,582
Ralph, are you coming, brother?

1764
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:32,595
See you later, President Fart Feathers.

1765
01:30:33,128 --> 01:30:35,708
Au revoir, Admiral Underpants.

1766
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:39,107
And farewell, Baroness Boogerface.

1767
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:41,594
Goodbye, Major Body Odor!

1768
01:30:42,137 --> 01:30:44,067
-Hasta la vista, you...
-Ralph!

1769
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:46,622
-All right. To be continued.
-Yeah!

01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:48,468

The gang's all here!

1776
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:13,851
So, I'm happy to report,
and you'll be happy to hear,

1777
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,899
I'm taking life one game at a time.

1778
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:18,197
All right! Yeah, Ralph!

1779
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,930
RALPH: Of course,
the job hasn't changed.

1780
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:23,143
But, news flash,
the Nicelanders are being nice to me!

1781
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,664
But, news flash,
the Nicelanders are being nice to me!

1782
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:28,891
And that got me thinking about
those poor guys left without a game.

1783
01:31:29,918 --> 01:31:31,647
-So here's what we did.
-We're gonna wreck it!

1784
01:31:32,087 --> 01:31:33,987
We asked them to help us out
on the bonus levels.

1785
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,246
We can fix it!

1786
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,008
RALPH: !'m telling you, guys,

1787
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:39,860
we haven't been this popular in years.

1788
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:40,001
we haven't been this popular in years.

1789
01:31:40,195 --> 01:31:41,245
-It's crazy.
-Wow!

1790
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:43,783
The gamers say we're "retro,"

1791
01:31:44,099 --> 01:31:46,589
which I think means "old but cool."

1792
01:31:47,102 --> 01:31:48,331
BOY: How come
we never noticed this game?

1793
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:50,504
RALPH: Oh, and ! decided
that living in the dump

1794
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:51,945
wasn't making me feel very good,

1795
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,540
so cleaned it up,
built myself a little shack

1796
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:54,651
so cleaned it up,
built myself a little shack

1797
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:56,406
and a couple for the new guys, too.

1800
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:03,223
And guess who was the best man
at his and Calhoun's wedding.

1801
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:06,472
That's right, my friends,
old Ham Hands himself.

1802
01:32:07,589 --> 01:32:09,229
Very elegant affair.
You should've seen it.

1803
01:32:09,591 --> 01:32:10,851
Lot of grandeur.

1804
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:12,386
And not a single bug.

1805
01:32:16,464 --> 01:32:19,534
Let's just say, some tears were shed.

1806
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,810
But I got to say, the best part of my day

1807
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,929
is when I get thrown off the roof.

1808
01:32:28,977 --> 01:32:30,557
Because when the Nicelanders
lift me up,

1809
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,040
! get a perfect view of Sugar Rush.

1810
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,239
And I can see Vanellope racing.

1811
01:32:39,254 --> 01:32:40,104

RALPH: The kid's a natural,

1813
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:45,495
And the players love her, glitch and all.

1814
01:32:46,461 --> 01:32:47,721
Just like l knew they would,

1815
01:32:49,831 --> 01:32:52,291
Turns out I don't need a medal
to tell me I'm a good guy.

1816
01:32:54,436 --> 01:32:56,165
