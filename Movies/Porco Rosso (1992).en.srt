00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:12,196
Tokuma Shoten. Japan Airlines,
Nippon Television Network and Studio Ghibli
Present

2
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:48,553
PORCO ROSSO

3
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,018
Yeah?

4
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,276
Porco Rosso! The Mamma Aiutos
are on the move!

5
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,083
The Mamma Aiutos?
I don't work cheap, you know.

6
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,368
They're after a boat out of Venice
earrying a mine payroll.

7
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:55,845
Is that all?

8
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,810
Uh, no...

9
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,508
There's a girls'-school tour aboard.

10
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,535
That'll cost you.

11
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,640
We'll pay Section 14-3 rates.

12
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,219
And 14-4, too.

13
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,587
Heave to!

14
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,372
Heave to or we sink you!

15
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,581
Wow! Pirates!

16
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,277
Not just “pirates”! “Air pirates”!

17
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,593
Time for an overhaul...

18
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,374
Are you bad guys?

19
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,539
Yep.

20
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,147
So we're hostages?

21
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,262
Yep.

22
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,733
Are you air pirates?

23
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,208
What a smart little girl!

24
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,436
A skull!

25
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,107
And very well-drawn!

26
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,037
Come on! We're in a hurry!

27
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,222
There's 15. Do we take them all?

28
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,872
It's not nice to break up the group!

29
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,300
Too late!

30
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,988
They took the girls and the money!
Bring them back for us!

31
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,920
They went that way!

32
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:20,236
No! They didn't go that way!

33
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,155
I know what those cheapskates
are up to.

34
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:29,024
They'll change course for the nearest
island as soon as they're out of sight.

35
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,676
They can't afford to waste gas.

36
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,312
Uh-oh...

37
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,644
Come on!

38
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,510
1 don’t have much time...

39
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,797
Gotcha!

40
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,181
Just a tour plane
going round the islands...

41
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,319
Hey, it's a pig! A pig!

42
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,105
Hey. piggy! He's so cute!
Look over here!

43
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:35,255
Hang around here and
the pirates'll gat you!

44
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,018
Cool!

45
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,341
Will you all shut up!

46
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,715
We're flying!

47
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:58,778
Let me see!

48
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,482
Hey! Cut that out!

49
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,784
Quiet! Be quiet, will you?!

50
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,337
Do something!

51
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,805
You're the one who said
to bring them all!

52
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,784
Just for a second...
I'm not supposed to let you do this...

53
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,481
It's so beautiful! Look!

54
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,390
A red plane!

55
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,350
Where? Where?

56
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,698
Did you see it?

57
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,265
That's as far as you go!

58
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,602
Here it comes!

59
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,527
- It's Porco!
- I can't see!

60
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,338
Oh, no!

61
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,540
It stopped!

62
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,698
We'll crash!

63
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,656
We've got another engine!

64
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,217
What are you doing?! Fire! Fire!

65
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,655
That red plane's tough!

66
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:02,958
You missed!

67
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,299
Move!

68
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,655
A message from the pig:
“You're beat. Do as I say.”

69
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,071
Shut up!

70
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,576
He's coming! Get down!

71
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,572
Where did he go?!

72
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,076
He's hiding!

73
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,405
We crashed! We're going to sink!

74
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,314
No, we won't! This is a seaplane!

75
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,182
We're sinking!

76
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,954
Hey! Stop that!

77
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,400
Halt! You're hostages!

78
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,969
Don't worry. We're all
on the swim team.

79
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,660
That's not what ! mean!

80
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,859
Another message!

81
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:13,629
“You can have half the money.
Give me the rast and the kids.”

82
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,133
“Or I'll kill all of you.”

83
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,534
Which means...

84
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,585
...half the money!

85
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,719
Shut up! Come on, you swine!
It's you and me!

86
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:30,646
Take that!

87
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,383
It's busted!

88
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,093
Bye-bye!

89
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,026
Goodbye!

90
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,377
Ha left us enough for repairs...

91
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,877
Don't be such a sap!

92
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,696
Be quiet, will you?

93
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,891
Don't pull on that! You'll break it!

94
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,610
Stay away from the propeller!

95
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,193
You've got to pee? Just do it there.

96
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,133
So the Mamma Aiutos
can't come tonight...

97
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,249
And that filthy pig bounty hunter
is a hero!

98
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,892
But this young kid's
an American, isn't he?

99
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,150
The air pirates of the Adriatic
can't ask an American for help!

100
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,050
His grandmother was
a quarter Italian.

101
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,887
Anyway, we've got to do something
about Porco!

102
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,596
But ten per cent is outrageous!

103
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,808
Beautiful!

104
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,059
He's here.

105
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,449
With his snout in the air,
as always!

106
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,874
Mr. Porco Rosso?
I'm from The Neptune.

107
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,861
Well done, sir! l guess
we won't see the Mamma Aiutos...

108
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,780
... for a while.

109
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,629
l hear that bounties...

110
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,564
... Might be a little bit
higher this year...

111
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,949
Hey, you! Put me down!

112
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,436
Listen quietly to the music.

113
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,367
She's quite a woman.

114
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,430
Even American pilots know
Madame Gina at the Hotel Adriano.

115
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,351
Air pirates and bounty hunters alike
leave their quarrels outside.

116
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,339
So that's the famous Curtiss
parked outside?

117
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:35,058
“The Rattlesnake”.
Bringer of fame and fortune.

118
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,435
You beat Italians two years running
for the Schneider Trophy.

119
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,823
It's not just fast.
It's good in a dogfight. too.

120
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,750
But I hear tell of a “Porco Rosso”
who's pretty famous, too.

121
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,378
Be careful of joining
with the pirates, kid.

122
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,958
They're poor, they're cheap.
and they're dirty. They don't bathe.

123
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,647
That's true.

124
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,158
Who are you calling dirty, pig?!

125
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,447
Quite a distinguished gathering!
You boys must be planning something.

126
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,153
You're right!

127
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,788
Always glad to see you.
but no war games here, OK?

128
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,658
We know, Gina. We don’t work
within 50 kilometers of here.

129
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,737
We're even polite to the pig!

130
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,615
That's my boys.

131
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,150
Be seeing you.

132
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,508
Tall me what happened!

133
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,527
Next time we're alone.

134
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,735
That American's funny.

135
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,655
He took one look and said, “Marry me!”

136
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,458
So I told him: “I've married
three pilots.”

137
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:04,599
“One died in the war, one in
the Atlantic, and the third in Asia.”

138
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,575
They found him?

139
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:16,308
I got a call today. They found
his remains in Bengal.

140
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,404
It's been three years.
I've got no more tears left.

141
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,845
The good ones all get killed.
To comrades.

142
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,361
Thanks, Marco. You're always
here for me.

143
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,401
You're the only one left
from the old days.

144
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,222
One thing ! don't like
about this place.

145
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,058
That picture.

146
00:14:55,194 --> 00:15:00,204
Don't touch it. It's the only one
of you when you were human.

147
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,446
The spell that changed you...
how can we break it?

148
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,137
That American jerk
is a good pilot.

149
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,903
Must be nice to make that much money.

150
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,351
This month's payment.

151
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,762
That pays off the loan on your plane.

152
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,725
How about making a contribution
to the people with a Patriot Bond?

153
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,014
I'm not a “person”,

154
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,156
Hello, Porco Rosso! It's done!

155
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,476
Give ma 60 bullets.

156
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,920
It's pretty crowded outside.

157
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:47,412
Yeah? Maybe the government's
going to change again.

158
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,180
They'll pass a law against you guys.

159
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,084
Laws don't apply to pigs.

160
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,184
That's for sure...or moles like me.

161
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:04,063
Just regular bullets? Not high-
explosives, or armor-piercing?

162
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,533
Listen. kid, we're not fighting
a war out there.

163
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,929
See you.

164
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:10,598
Thank you!

165
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,262
Hey. Boss...how is war
different from bounty hunting?

166
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:22,473
War profiteers are villains.
Bounty hunters are just stupid.

167
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,961
We're air pirates!
We don't take out bank loans!

168
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:29,587
What else can we do?

169
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,922
These repairs were expensive!

170
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,358
Federation planes!

171
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:45,154
Why do we have to fly with
a bunch of losers like this?!

172
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,515
It's all the pig's fault!

173
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,107
Can't those Mamma Aiutos
even afford paint?

174
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,401
That is shabby!

175
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,342
It looks like everyone's here.

176
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,673
Hey, is the American here yet?

177
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,170
He's up in the sun!

178
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,211
Right where he should be!

179
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,168
“Sighted target:
The Mediterranean Queen.”

180
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,859
We're taking a ship that big?!

181
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,945
That's why we all got together!

182
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:26,279
“Having engine trouble. Go first.
We will cover you.”

183
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,448
“That's a dirty trick!
We follow the plan!”

184
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,983
“Then we share repair costs!”

185
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:37,323
“You gutless wonder! We pay
our own repairs, just like always!”

186
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,042
“Engine trouble! Engine trouble!”

187
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,451
“We settled all this before!”

188
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,995
All of you, shut up!

189
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,668
Attention all passengers:
we are under attack...

190
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,629
... by air pirates.
There is no need for alarm.

191
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:07,977
We carry two advanced fighter aircraft.
We will now introduce our pilots.

192
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,750
Number 1: The Black Stallion,
Signor Valleta!

193
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,032
Number 2: The Wolf of the Tiber,
Flying Officer Visconti!

194
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,917
They've got muscle!

195
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,985
That wasn't in the deal!

196
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,738
Aw, what a mess!

197
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,553
Get away from me! Curtiss!!

198
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,214
Right! Let's go!

199
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,463
That's not good.

200
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,234
Guess I have to go to Milan.

201
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,910
...both pilots were shot down,
but parachuted to safety.

202
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:29,637
The Pirate Federation looted
the vessel and left this message:

203
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,256
You're next!

204
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,875
Come and get us, pig!

205
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:36,972
We repeat...

206
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,907
“You're next. Come and get us, pig!”

207
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,360
Way to go, you turkeys!

208
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,926
Sorry. I'm on vacation.

209
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:58,887
White sheets, beautiful women...

210
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,458
Just get me to Milan, engine.

211
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,349
I don't like that weather.
I'll just have to go below the clouds.

212
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,185
Come on! You can do it!

213
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,928
That's right, engine! Good boy!

214
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,429
Pig!

215
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,759
It's one against one!

216
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,861
Not right now!

217
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,326
I'll tell everyone you ran and hid!

218
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,989
Catch you later, yank!

219
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,624
Oh, damn!

220
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,591
Uh-oh...

221
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,593
Gotcha!

222
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,388
No, you didn't! My engine quit!

223
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,842
Yas! Now I'll be famous, too! Yahoo!

224
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:12,894
Il can't go back empty-handed, though.
They won't believe me without proof.

225
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,361
There!

226
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,444
That stupid red color...no mistake!

227
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,839
A souvenir for my mama in Alabama!

228
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:31,416
Hurry, please.

229
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,999
Madame Gina!

230
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,473
There's a phone call.
He's safe. He's alive.

231
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,565
Use the phone at the front desk.

232
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,701
Marco? Are you all right?
I was just leaving to look for you.

233
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,750
Oh? Good!

234
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,529
I've lost weight.
Two nights on a deserted island.

235
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:13,077
I'm taking the plane to Milan to get
it fixed. If that American comes in...

236
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,876
... tell him I'll be seeing him again.

237
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,820
Hey! I'm not a messenger!

238
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:26,976
l worry about you, and you treat me
like part of the furniture!

239
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:34,538
Someday you're going to be a pork roast.
I don't want to go to your funeral.

240
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,109
A pig's gotta fly.

241
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,334
Idiot!

242
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:37,496
I figured you'd be in tonight.

243
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,280
I'm back.

244
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,441
Messed it up again, huh?

245
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,706
Why not just get a new plane?

246
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,424
No, I like this one.

247
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,552
] know how you feel.

248
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,845
Look out...I'll back her in.

249
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,124
Who's the little cutie?

250
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,474
My grand-daughter, back from the States.

251
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,558
Keep coming...keep coming...

252
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:29,284
What a beautiful plane, Grandpa!
It's got great lines!

253
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,395
There's no one now who can do
work like that.

254
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,188
No resemblance.

255
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,318
She's really your grand-daughter?

256
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:39,966
Hands off.

257
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,332
Fio. lock up.

258
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,960
OK.

259
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,370
My opponent is Curtiss.
I need another 15 knots.

260
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,480
Curtiss? ] haven't heard
that name for a while.

261
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,007
Well?

262
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,882
Where did you get a Folgore?

263
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:04,302
Don't ask.

264
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:10,237
The Italian that Curtiss beat in 1927 for
the Schneider Trophy had this engine.

265
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,520
But it wasn't the engine's fault.
The mechanic was a fool.

266
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:17,885
This is exciting!

267
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:21,987
Don't fine-tune it too much.
It's not a race.

268
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:26,715
Tell me about it! You're explaining
Buddhism to Buddha.

269
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,113
Are you going to take all l have?

270
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:38,136
These days money's not worth
the paper it's printed on.

271
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,074
Empty your pockets...
that's for the propeller, the paint...

272
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,717
That's for my hotel and my meals!

273
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,341
Stay here. I'll give you
room and board cheap.

274
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,800
Where are your sons? Are they good?

275
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,784
They're all away working.

276
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,959
So who'll do the design?

277
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,461
Fio.

278
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,286
Fio? That little girl?

279
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,812
She's young. but she's got
something my sons don't.

280
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:17,141
We've been together a long time.
but I think I'll try somewhere alse.

281
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,454
Wait!

282
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,618
Are you worried because I'm a girl?
Or because I'm young?

283
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,926
Both, Miss.

284
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,206
l can understand that.

285
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:38,607
Tell me... what's the main thing
that goes to make a good pilot?

286
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:41,575
Experience?

287
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,612
No. Inspiration.

288
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,456
I'm glad you didn't say experience.

289
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:51,309
Grandpa says you were very young
when you first soloed...

290
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,631
...and that you were good even then.

291
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,484
It was in 1910...when I was 17.

292
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,061
177! I'm 17 now!

293
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:07,342
Let me try. l can't help being a girl,
but we've got the old drawings.

294
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,460
If it's no good. you don't have to pay.
OK, Grandpa?

295
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:17,671
She's kin. She'll do fine. ! took apart
my first engine when I was 12.

296
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:23,254
Sleep on this. We'll fix you a bed
tomorrow, Breakfast's at 7.

297
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:24,849
Good night.

298
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,500
You're still short. but we're
old friends. Pay the rest later.

299
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,077
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

300
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,745
Did you work all night?

301
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,577
This is just rough.

302
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,882
We'll leave this part as it is.
but use a different wing section.

303
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,237
That should give us five knots.

304
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:36,333
The old drawings were a surprise.
The wings were single-structure.

305
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:42,235
The old drawings were a surprise.
Whoever did this really understood wood.

306
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:44,762
I'm impressed.

307
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:49,803
They only made one of these.
It was too dangerous to fly.

308
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,410
found it in a warehouse.

309
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,675
] thought so.

310
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,837
The way the wings are set.
I'm surprised it even takes off.

311
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:04,464
Landings and take-offs are tricky.
They're better at high speed.

312
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:09,634
Tilt the wings back
half a degree for me.

313
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,122
Leave the rest the same.

314
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,707
So you'll let me do it?
Thank you! You won't be sorry.

315
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,332
But there's one condition. Miss.

316
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,354
Don't work all night.
You don't do good work on no sleep.

317
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,961
It's bad for your looks, too.

318
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,424
All right.

319
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,303
Actually. 1 was so nervous
last night I couldn't sleep.

320
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,537
To tell you the truth, 1 was afraid
you wouldn't let me do it.

321
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,231
I'm so happy! I'll make some coffee.

322
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,220
I sure hope she's not going to
build it alone, too...

323
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:01,869
My niece Monica will do the drawings,
my great-nephew's wife the finishing...

324
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:06,154
My cousin's daughters... Sophia,
Laura, Constance and Valentina.

325
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:12,155
Fio's sister Giliola. Sandra's her cousin.
Marietta, you've gotten so pretty!

326
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:17,268
My sons’ wives Maria, Tina, Anna.
and her sister Miletta.

327
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:19,418
Porcelino!

328
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:23,828
Grandma! The angels haven't
come for you yet?

329
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,494
You've grown up into a fine man!

330
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:33,482
You all work here, too?

331
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,243
To buy things for
our great-grandchildren!

332
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,261
There's not one man here!

333
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,705
They're all family?

334
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:54,034
Yeah. There's no work here.
The men are all gone away.

335
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,957
The depression...

336
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,803
Don't worry. The women are
tough and they work hard.

337
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,138
It's not pancakes we're making here...

338
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:16,783
Our Lord who art in Heaven...

339
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,955
We thank thee for giving our
struggling company work and bread.

340
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:25,895
Forgive my sin of using women's hands
to build a warplane.

341
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,218
Let's eat up and gat to work!

342
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,538
That sounds good!
This engine was a good choice.

343
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,012
How do you like them RPMs?

344
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,441
Watch out or you'll blow
the shed away!

345
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,555
Curtiss doesn’t stand a chance.

346
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,013
Yeah, it's a good idea...

347
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:38,912
So can I do it?

348
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,341
Well...this is going to cost
a lot more money.

349
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:49,199
Look how far we are over budget
alraady...and our customer...

350
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,080
Porco...

351
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,020
Don't look at me like that!
Do whatever you like.

352
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:03,221
Great! I'll tell the workshop
and we'll get to work!

353
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,662
Porco, I love you!

354
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,941
l can wait three months.

355
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,386
Maybe I'll become a pirate.

356
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,183
She's a good kid, huh?

357
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,292
Hands off.

358
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,707
That's the furthest thing from my mind.

359
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,347
So you're a Squadron Leader now?

360
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,270
What did you come back for?

361
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,493
l go where want, Ferrarin.

362
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:48,145
The authorities won't like it.
Are you being tailed?

363
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:49,693
Yeah.

364
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:56,044
There are warrants out on you for
treason, illegal entry...

365
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,505
...decadence, pornography
and being a lazy pig.

366
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,123
It's not funny!

367
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,819
They want to seize your plane. too.

368
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,919
This is a lousy film.

369
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:15,221
Come back to the Air Force, Marco.
I could still get you in.

370
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,998
Better a pig than a Fascist.

371
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,240
Freelance daredevils are finished.

372
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,395
To fly now you need a government
or an airline to pay you.

373
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:29,542
l only fly on what I earn myself.

374
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,205
Wherever you fly, you're still a pig.

375
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,576
Thanks, Ferrarin. Say hello
to the guys.

376
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,817
This is a good film.

377
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,749
Be careful. They won't bother
with a court of law.

378
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,491
See you, buddy.

379
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,599
Want a ride?

380
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,355
Thanks a lot.

381
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:26,423
l borrowed this to take the plane
to the lake for tests tomorrow.

382
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,448
No time for that. I've got to fly.

383
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:34,019
Don't be stupid! I'm not
delivering an untested plane!

384
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,832
We can take it apart and get it
to the lake in a day!

385
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,669
There's no time. Take a careful
look out the back window.

386
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,399
The Fascist Secret Police.

387
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:49,456
They followed you.

388
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,357
Me? Why?

389
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:57,807
‘Cause they're following me.
And you're fixing my plane.

390
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,913
Hey, are you really a spy?

391
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,296
Me a spy?!

392
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,540
Spies are a lot more serious
than me.

393
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:18,631
But you were a war hero.

394
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,540
Why follow you if you've
done nothing?

395
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,069
l agree!

396
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,149
Whoops! Wrong way.

397
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,727
l guess you did do something.

398
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,779
Time to get busy.

399
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:18,669
It's ready to fly.

400
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:24,036
There's two men out back and three
out front...this is so exciting!

401
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,209
Settle down, Grandma!

402
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,131
I'll sea you.

403
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,305
What are you doing?

404
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,810
Making myself a place.
Give me five minutes.

405
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,301
What are you talking about?!
Don't be stupid!

406
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,384
Shh! Don't shout!

407
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,561
Listen, Fio...

408
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,511
... you're a respectable woman.
Plus you're not married!

409
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,078
Hold this.

410
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,499
Thanks. ! had to rush to make this...

411
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,306
A perfect fit!

412
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:18,872
Hold that, will you?

413
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:26,042
Look, I'm a bounty hunter.
[don't run tourist flights!

414
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:33,062
I want to get my first job right.
l can make adjustments as we go.

415
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:39,095
I'm taking off from the canal.
I might not even get airborne!

416
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:44,801
All the more reason to take me.
You'll need a mechanic against Curtiss.

417
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:49,896
I'm a male, and we'll be all alone
on a deserted island.

418
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:52,464
Great! I love camping out.

419
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,444
That's not the point!

420
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:59,907
Take her along! If you don't
beat Curtiss, we don't get paid.

421
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,278
If you don't pay, we go broke.

422
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,231
You're her grandfather!

423
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,450
I'll give you a break on her salary.
and I'll throw in this voice tube.

424
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,938
There'll be a price on her head, too.

425
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:16,061
No. I'll be your hostage.

426
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:20,781
We'll tell the police you forced us
to help you. That'll be our excuse.

427
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,040
So please, take me with you.
I'll make myself useful.

428
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,437
Take out the right machine gun.

429
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:36,744
I don't care how small your bottom is.
it won't fit between them.

430
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:41,212
Oh. great! My hips are bigger
than they look. Wait a minute.

431
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,974
We'll leave now. before Grandma
wants to come, too.

432
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:49,365
Hey, that's an idea!

433
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,622
Grandma, quick!

434
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,901
Please don't buy me anything!

435
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:06,913
Contact!

436
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,790
Open up!

437
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,023
Let go!

438
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:50,615
Kidnapper! Pay us our money!

439
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,164
How's the rudder, Porco?

440
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:04,909
Very rough! Like you!
Harder to handle than ever!

441
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,799
Stop and I'll fix it.

442
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,735
No time! I've got to get her up!

443
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,368
This water's like glue!

444
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,580
Ship ahoy!

445
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,683
Here we go!

446
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,731
Come on, baby!

447
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,470
The flaps are in the water!
Use your tabs!

448
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:35,622
Tabs?

449
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,783
They're new!

450
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:39,266
Quick !

451
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,690
That's right! Now you're behaving!

452
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,161
Beautiful. The world is so beautiful.

453
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:38,982
Are they after us?

454
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:41,207
He's not attacking...

455
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,710
...but that's an Air Force plane.

456
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,430
Ferrarin, ! bet...

457
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:54,674
You know him?

458
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,662
The Air Force is waiting for us.
He'll show us a way through.

459
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,006
Ha says to go low and out to sea.

460
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,002
Thanks, buddy!

461
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,365
Thank you!

462
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,517
Seeing you, he's probably thinking
“pearls before swine.”

463
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:44,881
Beautiful!

464
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:49,136
A single rose blooming
in a secret garden.

465
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:56,281
Very rude. This is a private garden.

466
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:58,868
I just had to see you...

467
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,363
From Hollywood?

468
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,078
“In the matter of your starring in
the script you have sent...”

469
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,936
“Serious consideration” and
“please reply ASAP.”

470
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:18,566
l call it Flower of the Adriatic.

471
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:19,899
Nice name.

472
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,987
You like it? Then it’s settled.

473
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,673
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

474
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:30,831
Being a hired gun for air pirates
is a mere step to fame and fortune.

475
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,029
The next step is Hollywood star.

476
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:35,667
And then?

477
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:37,504
President!

478
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:49,789
I'm serious! I'll make you
the First Lady, Gina! I mean it!

479
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:51,683
Gina!

480
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,810
You're stupid. I like that in a man.

481
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,103
Really?!

482
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:01,692
But I can't. I'm gambling
right now...

483
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:10,582
... that someone will visit me here,
and I'll tell him } love him,

484
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:15,283
But the fool only comes
to the club, at night.

485
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,513
He never comes out in daylight.

486
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:03,302
That jerk's come back!

487
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:04,817
Idiot!

488
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:18,051
He just kept on going. I lost my bet.

489
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:21,239
You mean you're betting
on that jerk?

490
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:22,969
Can't I?

491
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:27,221
Life here is more complicated
than where you're from.

492
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,808
You can fall in love
again and again, but...

493
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,837
You go to Hollywood, kid.

494
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:35,558
“Kid"?!

495
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:43,054
I bumped my head
when you did that roll!

496
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,620
Just saying hello to a friend.

497
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:47,733
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?

498
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:53,593
The woman in white on the terrace?
Grandpa told me.

499
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:57,238
All the pilots in the Adriatic
are in love with her.

500
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,308
He's got a big mouth!

501
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:04,098
What's she like?
Are you in love with her, too?

502
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:07,632
I'm putting down. Shut up or
you'll bita your tongue.

503
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:09,542
Hey, wait!

504
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:37,122
A girl riding a fighter plane!

505
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:39,739
Where's Porco?

506
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,247
Talking to my dad about something.

507
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:46,486
It's not just the caretaker government.
It's the royalists, too.

508
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:50,437
They want to link up
with the Pirates’ Federation.

509
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:54,244
There's no money in
chasing pirates any more.

510
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:55,607
There.

511
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:56,616
Thanks.

512
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:59,323
All this talk about a depression!

513
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,082
You ought to sell
your services somewhere, too.

514
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:06,361
A good pilot can make good money.

515
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,880
Got any smokes?

516
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:10,855
Curtiss'Il go back to the States soon.

517
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:14,607
We're the ones who should
go to America.

518
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:19,346
“Farewell to the days of
fun and freedom in the Adriatic. ”

519
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:21,344
Is that Byron?

520
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:23,335
No, me. See you.

521
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,627
Porco, it's terrible!

522
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:33,224
Their fuel's three times
what it is back in Italy!

523
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,376
Give us a break!

524
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:41,462
We don't water our fuel here!
Man, girls are stupid!

525
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:44,123
Talk to her, will you?

526
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,252
Pay him, Fio.

527
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:50,604
Then stuff that bigger-than-it-looks
backside in with the machine gun.

528
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:52,918
Off to the hideout!

529
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,060
I'm putting the fuel on your bill!

530
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:05,202
They're fair. We help each other
when we need it.

531
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:10,487
It's pretty around here.
but no one's got much money.

532
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,114
There’s the island.

533
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,316
It's beautiful!

534
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,681
What a great hideout!

535
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,447
Agh! My leg's gone to sleep.

536
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:20,188
Look at all you silly idiots...

537
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:23,074
Hay, Boss! We got him!

538
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,290
Watch who you're stepping on!

539
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:26,956
Move!

540
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,597
We've been waiting, pig.

541
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,410
We knew you were coming.

542
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:33,465
We've got a score to settle.

543
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,388
He's got a girl with him!

544
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:38,671
She's pretty!

545
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,629
Shut up! So what?
Half the world is women!

546
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:47,473
That's not just any girl! She's
Piccolo's chief design engineer.

547
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:51,736
A cute little thing like her?

548
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:53,572
Are you sure?

549
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:58,663
My plane's a lot better than it was.
She's young but she's good.

550
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:02,158
Really, Porco?

551
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,973
[ never lie about planes.

552
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,855
She's here to make sure
l pay the bill.

553
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:13,578
You're in debt. too?
Serves you right!

554
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:18,473
Bust that plane up so bad
all he's got left is the loan on it!

555
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,474
You're going to take an axe
to the plane I built?!

556
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:26,791
A plane as beautiful as that?!

557
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:30,488
It's a long story, Miss.

558
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:31,944
So you are!

559
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:33,746
Well, you know...

560
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,301
And you call yourselves pilots?!

561
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,550
Move! Where are my shoes?

562
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:51,271
l was raised on stories about
seaplane pilots.

563
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:56,879
My grandpa always said there's
no finer people.

564
00:58:57,968 --> 00:59:01,508
Their hearts are washed clean
by both sea and sky.

565
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,459
So they're braver than sailors...

566
00:59:06,343 --> 00:59:08,653
...and prouder than regular pilots.

567
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:14,174
That's right. That's a seaplane pilot!

568
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:19,702
The most precious thing to them
isn't money or women, it's honor.

569
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,740
Yeah! That's right, Miss!

570
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,000
Hurray for seaplane pilots!

571
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,413
Oh, brother!

572
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:33,642
All right. We won't take our axes
and bust up the plane you built.

573
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,723
But honor won't let us
just walk away, either!

574
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,405
Mince the pig!

575
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,170
Yeah! Make hamburger out of him!

576
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:45,781
Don't be so pig-headed!

577
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,886
You don't understand!
Haven't you any shame?!

578
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,096
You need an American to come
and save you?

579
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:57,227
Your mothers would weep!
And tell you to take a bath!

580
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:01,698
Porco's come back to go
one-on-one with Curtiss...

581
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:05,662
...for the honor of the seaplane
pilots of the Adriatic!

582
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:09,743
A man without honor or scruples
is nothing! Fight fair!

583
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:14,627
l always said
we shouldn't hire Curtiss.

584
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,538
Stop trying to weasel out of things!

585
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,381
What do we do. Boss?

586
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:21,293
She makes sense.

587
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:25,715
We could lose face here.
Should we talk to Curtiss again?

588
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,759
Get him to fight again?

589
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:31,156
The contract's expired...

590
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:33,522
This is embarrassing!

591
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,374
It's Curtiss!

592
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:46,186
Il heard you!
I don't run, and I don't hide!

593
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:51,645
What idiot put a path up there?!

594
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,590
Hold this for me.

595
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:11,606
So you want a return match?

596
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:17,215
But already won once.
I'm no one's hired gun any more.

597
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:20,325
So what do you want?

598
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,821
Beautiful!

599
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,887
Will you marry me if ! win?

600
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,266
I'm serious.

601
01:01:41,565 --> 01:01:45,725
All right. But if Porco wins.
you pay his bills.

602
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:47,703
Wait, Fio!

603
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:49,635
You keep out of it!

604
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:56,453
Speak now or hold your peace, Miss.

605
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,336
It's up to him.

606
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,258
This is expensive!

607
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:01,547
It's cheap!

608
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,317
Yes or no?

609
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,731
I'll gladly fight for the woman I love!

610
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:08,177
Right!

611
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:12,986
Listen, all of you!
l like this girl's spunk!

612
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,853
The Mamma Aiutos will
promote this fight!

613
01:02:18,368 --> 01:02:20,238
Along with the Pirates' Federation!

614
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,575
See you later, Miss Fio!

615
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:31,447
You morons!

616
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,188
Don't forget to show up, pig!

617
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:38,081
Shut up and get out of here!

618
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:40,025
See ya!

619
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,140
Look what you've gone and
gotten me into!

620
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:52,975
Don't be angry. ! know it was stupid.

621
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:00,659
Fio...

622
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:04,128
...l've got to thank you, anyway.

623
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:06,748
You got me a chance.

624
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,950
Thanks. I guess fate meant
for us to be a team.

625
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:13,357
So we're partners?

626
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:17,322
My chances are only 50-50.

627
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,248
1 believe in you.

628
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:26,752
“Believe”...1 hate that word, but
it sounds different coming from you.

629
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:36,606
What's the matter?
You're not feeling wall?

630
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:38,417
I'm fine.

631
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,652
My heart started beating
so fast ] couldn't breathe...

632
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,030
l was really scared.

633
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:48,276
My knees are all wobbly...

634
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:53,115
Hey!

635
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,919
I'm going swimming!

636
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,364
Porco, we screwed up!

637
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,709
How?

638
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:21,405
We should have padded the bill!

639
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,989
We blew it!

640
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:29,148
You're right!

641
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,370
Porco...

642
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,301
What? Can't you sleep?

643
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,082
I could've sworn...

644
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,428
Or was I dreaming?

645
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:37,444
Go back to sleep.
Tomorrow's an early day.

646
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:40,219
Porco...

647
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,017
...why did you turn into a pig?

648
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,850
Well, you know...

649
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:51,473
My father was in the same unit
as a Flight-Lieutenant Marco Paggot.

650
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:56,695
l used to love the story of how
he jumped off a cliff in a storm...

651
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,117
...to rescue an enemy pilot.

652
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,211
Porco...shall I kiss you?

653
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:12,841
You know how the princess turned
the frog back into a prince...

654
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:17,232
Don't be stupid. Save your kisses
for when you need them.

655
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,872
Maybe I'm not the one.

656
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,310
You're a good girl.

657
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:30,125
You make me think
that all humanity's not a waste.

658
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:32,886
Now be a good girl and go to sleep.

659
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:35,656
Tell me a story, and I will.

660
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:38,537
A story?

661
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:42,074
Let me see...

662
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,477
It was the last summer of the war.

663
01:06:55,111 --> 01:07:00,350
We were on our usual patrol
over the Adriatic, heading for Istria.

664
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,976
Berlini was beside me.

665
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:13,733
An old friend, who'd gotten
married two days before.

666
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,911
l was best man at his wedding.

667
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:22,598
But we couldn't get leave.
so we'd come straight back to base.

668
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:46,613
Planes were going down like flies,
ours and theirs.

669
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:49,747
l had three on my tail.

670
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,853
I didn't have time for anyone else.

671
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,926
Then mine was the only one
of our planes left.

672
01:07:56,506 --> 01:08:00,725
The enemy kept coming.
They had blood in their eyes.

673
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:06,571
My hands and feet were numb,
I couldn't see...1 thought I was dead.

674
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:11,042
Suddenly everything all went white
in front of me.

675
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:12,703
White?

676
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:15,446
Yeah, like ! was in pure light.

677
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:21,544
But a light so strange it took a while
to realize I was in cloud..

678
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,828
l was so tired I didn't have
enough strength to fly.

679
01:08:27,537 --> 01:08:30,407
But the plane just kept flying
by itself.

680
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,465
A cloud prairie?

681
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:04,125
Yeah. and dead quiet.
The sky was so beautiful...

682
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:09,667
With that weird line of clouds
stretching up out of sight.

683
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:39,809
Berlini! You're OK?!

684
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:45,906
Berlini! Wait! Where are you going?!

685
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:02,298
Berlini! Stop! What about Gina?!

686
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:04,206
I'll go instead!

687
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:49,281
When I came to. I was flying
all alone right down on the water.

688
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:55,599
God was telling you “not yet”.

689
01:10:57,286 --> 01:11:02,006
I felt like he was telling me just to
keep on flying alone forever.

690
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,201
No, Porco! You're good!

691
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:10,644
The good ones are the dead ones.
It might have been hell l saw.

692
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:14,388
End of story. Go to sleep.

693
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,915
That junkyard sold me rusty bullets!

694
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:26,665
I'm glad you came back alive.
I like you.

695
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,187
Good night!

696
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:56,467
Place your bets here!

697
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:01,224
If you're real men, put your money
where your mouths are!

698
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:14,388
You'd think it was a carnival!

699
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,641
They're all air pirates?

700
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:21,099
The scum of the Mediterranean.
Gangsters, pirates, smugglers...

701
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:24,838
... Spies, plain-clothes cops.
a few respectable citizens...

702
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:29,196
This is going to make me
even more famous!

703
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:32,952
Ten minutes to start!

704
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:38,705
The showdown between Porco Rosso
and Donald Curtiss is about to begin!

705
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:45,146
There's no rules. The first one to
run is a coward forever!

706
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:49,389
Shut up! We came here for
a dogfight, not speeches!

707
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:56,642
Shut up! Open your mouth
and we shoot you!

708
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:08,465
A ten-ton bomb would be better.

709
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:13,197
This fight decides the fate of
our beloved Miss Fio Piccolo...

710
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,526
...who needs no introduction!

711
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:19,955
Know what I mean?
A big hand for Fio! Applaud!

712
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:23,764
Let's get this over with!

713
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:26,903
Quiet! There are formalities
to observe!

714
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,630
Both sides will place their wagers!

715
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:36,782
Miss...

716
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:37,863
Thank you.

717
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:39,995
Put it down!

718
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:47,299
No complaints? All right, shake hands
and come out flying!

719
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:50,537
Forget it. Pigs are clean animals.

720
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,495
That's not very friendly.

721
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:58,508
We'll go straight to the church!

722
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:03,491
Don't worry. My mother says
you can get used to anything.

723
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:11,118
May we have a picture?

724
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,379
We all took a bath!

725
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:14,295
Smile, everyone!

726
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:15,884
Smile!

727
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:40,967
Black wins if it's over
in three minutes!

728
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:44,417
Maybe we could get them
to do this every month!

729
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,894
15 seconds to start.

730
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:55,973
That is so cool!

731
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:58,276
Five seconds...

732
01:14:58,594 --> 01:14:59,294
Four...

733
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:00,295
Three...

734
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:01,295
Two...

735
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:02,139
One...

736
01:15:02,365 --> 01:15:03,065
Zero!

737
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:13,170
Curtiss has the height!

738
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:32,997
It's all Curtiss so far!

739
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,232
Gimme!

740
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,240
Come on, Porco! Get above him!

741
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,629
He's a better target up high.

742
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:48,142
He's harder to hit on the deck.

743
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,391
Don't worry! I've got lots of bullets!

744
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:16,089
A barrel roll! The pig's on his tail!

745
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:17,355
A barrel roll?!

746
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:20,527
That trick made him
“the Ace of the Adriatic”!

747
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:27,032
Curses!

748
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,125
Now!

749
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,178
- He didn't shoot!
- Are his guns jammed?

750
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:45,541
He's not going to shoot
until the very last.

751
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:50,909
The pig's not a killer. The American's
still got plenty of ammo!

752
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,657
Now! Shoot!

753
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,215
He didn’t! What did ! tell you?

754
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,669
If he shoots now.
he'll hit the American.

755
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:03,982
He's going to wait till he can put
two or three shots into the engine.

756
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:07,727
The damn fool thinks
this isn't war!

757
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:09,124
Porco!

758
01:17:10,226 --> 01:17:12,835
What's wrong with you?! Shoot!

759
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:18,043
Or are your guns jammed? Too bad!

760
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:25,396
They're coming this way!

761
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:30,747
Come on! Fight like a pig!

762
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:38,235
Not this way! No!

763
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:40,044
He ditched the pig!

764
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:54,382
Go fight somewhere else!

765
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,119
Look at those vapor trails!

766
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:12,141
This you only see
once in a lifetime!

767
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,918
This is so moving!

768
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,679
If she doesn’t hurry, she'll miss it!

769
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:29,516
She won't come out of her room.

770
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:33,282
Are we going or not?
l want to see it!

771
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,440
“F to Gina of my heart: warn pig...

772
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:50,743
“...to stop fooling around.
The Air Force is coming.”

773
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,530
“F"? That's Ferrarin...

774
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:57,732
Time to go!

775
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,939
They're both really tough!

776
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,232
They're just getting warmed up!

777
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:26,346
Go, Porco!

778
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,430
You stupid pig!

779
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,494
You think you're going to have Fio?!

780
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,408
Now the pig's got his tail!

781
01:19:49,051 --> 01:19:50,191
The finale!

782
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,140
Huh?

783
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,539
It's jammed!

784
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:03,611
The finish!

785
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:08,259
What the... ?!

786
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:10,408
Jammed!

787
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:14,394
What's the matter? Out of ammo?

788
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:18,221
It's bent! Fio’s big butt!

789
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,543
There aren't any ties in this game!

790
01:20:25,888 --> 01:20:28,728
This isn't a cowboy film!
What are you going to hit with that?

791
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,590
You jerk!

792
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:38,429
What good's that going to do?
Hi-ho, Silver!

793
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:48,532
You rotten pig!

794
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:52,803
Missed me!

795
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:54,969
Chicken!

796
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:56,116
You ducked!

797
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:57,552
This is for love?

798
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:58,703
Shut up, pig!

799
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:01,602
Something's wrong.

800
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,007
They're coming down!

801
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,051
They're back!

802
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,978
Wait! The prizes stay here!

803
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:19,125
Stay back! Stay back!

804
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:27,174
You eat too much!

805
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,965
Cowboy!

806
01:21:37,126 --> 01:21:38,266
Put ‘em up!

807
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,401
Go punch a cow!

808
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:48,913
Come on, Porco!

809
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,003
Get up, pig!

810
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,650
That's dirty!

811
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:25,922
Uppercut! Block!

812
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,582
Yes! Yas!

813
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:32,030
Yes! The Federation can set up
as bookmakers!

814
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:34,258
Bring a bell!

815
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:39,567
Can't you go faster?

816
01:22:39,822 --> 01:22:41,722
No. The engine’ll burn up.

817
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:44,971
Pilots are all crazy!

818
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,420
Fio! Did you see that punch?

819
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,585
I'll finish you in the next round!

820
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:03,771
Next round you go to sleep!

821
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,299
Stay in there!

822
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:08,799
You're going to be brain-dead!

823
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,733
Come on, pretty-boy!

824
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:15,755
You're the pretty-boy here!

825
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,566
Chasing every girl you see!

826
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:21,125
What about you?!

827
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:23,837
Who's it going to be, Fio or Gina?

828
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,640
What?

829
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,190
Stop hogging them!

830
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:33,981
Gina...

831
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:39,071
“Miss Gina” to you!

832
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:44,152
Gina's in love with you!

833
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:50,647
She sits in that garden...

834
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,552
...and waits...

835
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,386
...for you to come!

836
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:08,226
Porco!

837
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:09,313
The bell!

838
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:10,885
Start the count!

839
01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:13,254
Look at him!

840
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,241
The Air Force isn't here yet.

841
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,731
Try to psyche me out, will you?

842
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:42,197
I don't get you!

843
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,098
It's the truth!

844
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,599
You won't get Fio!

845
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,103
That's Gina!

846
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:56,800
There's trouble!

847
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:12,943
First one to stand wins!

848
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,892
Coming through!

849
01:25:19,181 --> 01:25:20,821
No. Gina!

850
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,470
Marco! Can you hear me?

851
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,371
Are you going to make
another woman unhappy?

852
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,099
Porco!

853
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:46,824
Porco!

854
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,632
Thank you, Porco!

855
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:51,247
It was nothing.

856
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:02,130
OK, the party's over.
The Italian Air Force is coming.

857
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,861
Get out of here, everyone.

858
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:09,104
Come to the club.
Drinks are on the house!

859
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,080
We're out of here!

860
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:25,599
It's over.

861
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,599
Boss! Hurry!

862
01:26:31,086 --> 01:26:32,896
Thera are formalities to observe!

863
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:39,123
l hate the pig. but I like you.
Build some good planes.

864
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:40,631
‘Bye!

865
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,716
Thanks. Take a bath sometime!

866
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,326
Thanks, Mr. Curtiss!

867
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:50,549
Next time it won't be a bet.
I'll court you for real.

868
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,950
Sure. But I've made up my mind.

869
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:57,023
You ride in Gina's plane.

870
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:58,769
No!

871
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:02,184
I ride in your plane!
We're partners, aren't we?

872
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:07,486
Gina, take this girl
back to the regular world.

873
01:27:10,092 --> 01:27:12,371
You always do this. It's not fair.

874
01:27:15,297 --> 01:27:17,517
Sorry. Away you go.

875
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:23,974
Take her up.

876
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,141
Here comes the Air Force.

877
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,630
Help me lead them away.

878
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,025
Hey! Your face! Wait!

879
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:07,214
Show me your face!

880
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:08,742
Your plane’s over there!

881
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,097
Just one look!

882
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:24,767
Porco never showed up again, even

good friends...

885
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:43,065
...and we still are, through all the war
and turmoil there's been since then.

summer at the Hotel Adriano.

887
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:59,216
Gina is more beautiful every year,
and there are lots of old faces.

888
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:06,734
Oh, yes... “Mr. Curtiss” still isn't
President, but he writes us...

889
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:11,719
... Saying he misses the good old days
of that Adriatic summer.

890
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:18,736
Whether Gina ever won her bet or not
is our secret.
