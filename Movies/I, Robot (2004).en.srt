1
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,554
Thing of beauty.

2
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,082
Good morning, sir!

3
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,960
Yet another on-time delivery from--

4
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,672
Get the hell out of my face, canner.

5
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,072
Have a nice day!

6
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,696
And we believe our Destination Anywhere
package to be the best value.

7
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:40,022
Let us take you to your dream destination
aboard our orbital spaceplane, the X-82.

8
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:50,008
Try Jazztown's synthetic Chicago-style
pizza. Tastes as good as you remember.

9
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,608
Glowfish! The world’s hottest-selling
transgenic treats.

10
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,302
Your children will love the new colors too!

11
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,713
-Excuse me, sir.
-Total performance.

12
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,311
Total readiness. Total security.

13
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,801
So goodbye to upgrades
and service calls.

14
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,090
An uplink to USR's central computer...

15
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,539
.. provides this state-of-the-art robot
with new programs daily.

16
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,963
The Nestor Class 5
is tomorrow's robot today.

17
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,267
Spoon! Spoonie!

18
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,599
Hold up. Hold on!
Excuse me, excuse me.

19
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,404
-Spoon, where you been at?
-Just away, Farber.

20
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,393
Oh, yeah, away? Like vacation?
That's nice.

21
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,903
I got a favor to ask.
I need to borrow your car.

22
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,590
This is different. I got this fine-ass
yummy-- She is complete and agreeable.

23
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,911
I mean, ass-hot spankable.

24
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,660
-What does that even mean?
-You know what it means.

25
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,296
-Let me get the damn-ass keys.
-First of all...

26
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,419
-...stop cussing. You're not good at it.
-Give me 10 for the bus, then, man.

27
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,393
-Go home.
-That’s strike one, Spoon. Strike one!

28
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,094
You talk to Marci?

29
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,384
No, Gigi, 1 haven't talked to Marci.

30
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,727
When I was coming up,
we didn’t just marry someone...

31
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,757
...then divorce them,
then not talk to them.

32
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,787
Del, don’t play with me.

33
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,099
I bet if 1 stopped cooking,
you'd call Marci.

34
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,347
Boy, what is that on your feet?

35
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,221
Converse All Stars, vintage 2004.

36
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,596
Don't turn your face up.
I know you want some. Just ask.

37
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,372
No, thank you very much.

38
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,508
-Sweet potato pie.
-Put that on a plate.

39
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:59,912
I've seen on TV they're giving away
some of them new robots in the lottery.

40
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,677
You know, Gigi, those robots
don't do anybody any good.

41
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,148
Of all the people on God's earth,
you should know better.

42
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,015
Sometimes the stuff
that comes out of your mouth!

43
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,780
You listening to me, Del?

44
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,604
Hey!

45
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,162
Hey!

46
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,277
Hold my pie. Sir, hold it or wear it.

47
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,395
Move!

48
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,518
Freeze!

49
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,157
Hey! Stop!

50
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,988
Stop!

51
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,065
I said, stop!

52
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,476
Relax. Relax.

53
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,488
I'm a police officer.

54
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,930
You...

55
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,002
...are an asshole.

56
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,501
-Ma’am, is that your purse?
-Of course it's my purse.

57
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,158
l left my inhaler at home.
He was running it out to me.

58
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,099
I saw a robot running with the purse
and assumed--

59
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,638
What? Are you crazy?

60
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,271
-I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.
-Don't apologize.

61
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,111
You're doing what you're supposed
to do. But what are you doing?

62
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,006
Have a lovely day, ma’am.

63
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:55,291
You're lucky I can't breathe,
or I'd walk all up and down your ass.

64
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,828
Lead by example.

65
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,469
It says that right on your badge.

66
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,751
-We gonna talk about this?
-About what?

67
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,807
"Help! Police! That robot stole
my dry cleaning!”

68
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,875
Oh, you wanna talk about that.

69
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,305
Detective...

70
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,974
-...how many robots snatch purses?
-John, the thing is running--

71
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,759
How many robots in the world...

72
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,823
-...have ever committed a crime?
-Define crime.

73
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,736
-Answer my question, damn it.
-None, John.

74
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,224
Now tell me what happened today.

75
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,168
Nothing.

76
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,757
Better be the last nothing.

77
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:14,256
Spoon, are you sure you are ready to be
back? Because you can take your time.

78
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,925
I'm fine, John. Thank you.

79
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,992
Better here than sitting around
at home.

80
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,268
Homicide. Spooner.

81
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,032
Please take the next exit to your right.

82
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,332
Welcome, Detective Spooner.

83
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:10,453
Welcome to U.S. Robotics.
You have entered the garage-level lobby.

84
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:15,254
Please use the elevators for direct
access to the main level concourse.

85
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,245
Thank you.

86
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,548
-Good to see you again, son.
-Hello, doctor.

87
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,595
Everything that follows is a result
of what you see here.

88
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,256
-ls there something you want to tell me?
-I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

89
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,828
You must ask the right questions.

90
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,937
Why did you call me?

91
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,703
I trust your judgment.

92
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,919
Normally, this wouldn't require
a homicide detective.

93
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,169
But then, our interactions have never
been entirely normal, agreed?

94
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,753
You got that right.

95
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,886
Is there something you want
to say to me?

96
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,638
I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

97
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,509
You must ask the right questions.

98
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,108
Why would you kill yourself?

99
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,834
That, detective, is the right question.

100
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,338
Program terminated.

101
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,399
Goodbye, old man.

102
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,596
-Afternoon, boys.
-Hey, detective.

103
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,218
-Enlighten me.
-What you see is what you get:

104
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,761
Massive impact trauma.

105
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,482
U.S. Robotics. I gotta
get my kid something.

106
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,059
-Anything upstairs?
-Nada.

107
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,448
Door was security locked
from the inside.

108
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,930
Wham, splat. The guy’s a jumper
for sure.

109
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,591
We gotta be smart about this.
Let's deal with it later.

110
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,516
Detective.

111
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,695
Lawrence Robertson.

112
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,125
Richest man in the world.
I've seen you on television.

113
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,302
-Can I offer you coffee?
-Sure, why not. It’s free, right?

114
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,623
I don’t think anyone saw this coming.

115
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,113
You know, I should have, I suppose.
I knew him 20 years.

116
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:44,567
Alfred practically invented robotics.
He wrote the Three Laws.

117
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:50,853
But I guess brilliant people often have
the most persuasive demons.

118
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,268
-So whatever I can do to help--
-Sugar.

119
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,217
-I'm sorry?
-For the coffee.

120
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,084
Sugar?

121
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,742
You thought I was calling you "sugar."
You're not that rich.

122
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,959
-It’s on the table.
-Thank you.

123
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,200
When Lanning fell, he was holding
the little green...?

124
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,569
-The holographic projector.
-Right.

125
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,785
Why do you think Lanning’s hologram
would've called me?

126
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,235
-l assumed you knew him.
-Yeah. I knew him.

127
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,016
Holograms are just prerecorded
responses...

128
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,935
... designed to give
the impression of intelligence.

129
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,935
This one was programmed to call you
upon his suicide.

130
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,622
-Death.
-I'm sorry?

131
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,154
It was programmed to call me
in the event of Lanning’s death.

132
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,905
Suicide is a type of death, detective.

133
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,377
-Don't misunderstand my impatience.
-Oh, no. Go. Go.

134
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,537
A really big week for you folks
around here.

135
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,183
You gotta put a robot in every home.

136
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,773
Look, this is not what I do, but I got
an idea for one of your commercials.

137
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,757
You could see a carpenter
making a beautiful chair.

138
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,070
Then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair twice as fast.

139
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,409
Then you superimpose on the screen,
"USR: Shitting on the little guy.”

140
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,613
That would be the fade-out.

141
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,271
Yeah, I see. 1 suppose your father
lost his job to a robot.

142
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,542
Maybe you'd have banned the Internet
to keep the libraries open.

143
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,081
Prejudice never shows much reason.

144
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,881
No, you know, I suspect
you simply don't like their kind.

145
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,802
Well, you got a business to run
around here.

146
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,919
The last thing you need, especially
this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.

147
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,790
But, hell, seeing as how you got one,
maybe I'll look around.

148
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,229
Ask a few questions.
Do the whole "cop" thing.

149
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,077
-l'll send someone to escort you.
-Thank you very much.

150
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,549
Lawrence told me to accommodate you
in any way possible.

151
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,449
Really?

152
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,558
Okay.

153
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,344
l reviewed Dr. Lanning’s psych profile.

154
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,674
Alfred had become a recluse.
He rejected human contact for machines.

155
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,028
So you're a shrink, huh?

156
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,961
My ex-wife would sure be glad
I'm talking to you.

157
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,223
You don’t know her, do you?

158
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,215
I'm sorry. Are you being funny?

159
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,411
I guess not.

160
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,033
Level 70.

161
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,342
So would you say that Dr. Lanning
was suicidal?

162
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,082
It would seem the answer to that
is apparent.

163
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,791
That's not what I asked you.

164
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,992
No. I wouldn't have thought so.

165
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,838
But obviously 1 was wrong.

166
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,933
That's a long way down.

167
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,665
You people sure do clean up quickly
around here.

168
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,458
I can’t blame you. Who wants
some old guy going bad in the lobby?

169
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:07,045
He was not "some old guy.”
Alfred Lanning was everything here.

170
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:11,274
We are on the eve of the largest
robotic distribution in history.

171
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,978
By Saturday, it'll be one robot
to every five humans.

172
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,121
These robots are the realization
of a dream. Dr. Lanning’s dream.

173
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,973
You know what, in that dream of his...

174
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,509
...[ bet you he wasn't dead.

175
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,254
-You keep 24-hour surveillance?
-Obviously. Company policy.

176
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,897
-Where are the feeds?
-Sensor strips.

177
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,198
Everywhere but the service areas.

178
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,473
They link to our positronic
operating core.

179
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,945
Thermostat wasn’t good enough.
You gave the building a brain.

180
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,686
She was actually
Lanning’s first creation.

181
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,369
She? That's a she?
I definitely need to get out more.

182
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,295
Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence.

183
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,040
V.LK.I.

184
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,651
Good day.

185
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,109
V.I.K.1. designed Chicago’s
protective systems.

186
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,811
I have decreased traffic fatalities
by 9 percent this year.

187
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,299
Thanks. Show me inside the lab from
one minute prior to the window break.

188
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,865
Apologies. There appears
to be data corruption.

189
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,192
Show me outside the lab
from the window break until now.

190
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:40,121
Look, you have great posture.
You stand really straight. I’m slouching.

191
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,373
-Would you like to go inside now?
-Oh, sure. Right after you.

192
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,636
Authorized entry.

193
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:00,072
So, Dr. Calvin, what exactly
do you do around here?

194
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,456
My general fields are advanced robotics
and psychiatry.

195
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,270
I specialize in hardware-to-wetware
interfaces...

196
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,796
...to advance USR’s robotic
anthropomorphization program.

197
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,897
So, what exactly do you do
around here?

198
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,536
I make the robots seem more human.

199
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:20,723
-Now, wasn't that easier to say?
-Not really. No.

200
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,775
“Hansel and Gretel."

201
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:48,211
-ls that on the USR reading list?
-Not precisely.

202
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,007
What in God’s name are you doing?

203
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,545
Did you know that was safety glass?

204
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,759
Be difficult for an old man
to throw himself through that.

205
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,955
Well, he figured out a way.

206
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,659
Detective, the room was
security locked. No one came or went.

207
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,801
You saw that yourself. Doesn't
that mean this has to be suicide?

208
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,928
Yep.

209
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,368
Unless the killer's still in here.

210
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,266
You're joking, right? This is ridiculous.

211
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,530
Yeah, I know. The Three Laws,
your perfect circle of protection.

212
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,204
A robot cannot harm a human being.
The first law of robotics.

213
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:44,135
Yes, I've seen your commercials. But the
second law states a robot must obey...

214
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,267
..any order given by a human being.
What if it was told to kill?

215
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,390
Impossible. It would conflict
with the first law.

216
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,677
Right, but the third law states
a robot can defend itself.

217
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,141
Only when that action does not conflict
with the first or second laws.

218
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,675
You know what they say,
laws are made to be broken.

219
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,989
No, not these laws.
They're hardwired into every robot.

220
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,089
A robot could no more commit murder
than a human could walk on water.

221
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,933
You know, there was this one guy
a long time ago.

222
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,451
-Stay back!
-Calm down, detective.

223
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,103
The only thing dangerous in
this room is you.

224
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,806
Deactivate.

225
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,497
Look, it’s fine.

226
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:41,296
You're looking at the result of clever
programming. An imitation of free will.

227
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,244
Let's do an imitation
of protecting our asses.

228
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,583
Don’t be absurd.

229
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,209
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.

230
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,812
-Deactivate!
-Let him go.

231
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,620
It’s not going to hurt us.
I gave you an order!

232
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:57,904
-He’s not listening right now, lady.
-V.I.K.1., seal the lab!

233
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,813
No, V.I.K.1., leave the--

234
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,763
Command confirmed.

235
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,426
Police!

236
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:04,717
-You've hurt it. Badly.
-Where’s it going?

237
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,001
-Where?!
-It needs to repair itself.

238
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,659
-John, I need backup.
-You don't need backup.

239
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,219
That's nobody.

240
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,000
-What are you doing?
-Driving.

241
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,272
-By hand?
-Do you see me on the phone?

242
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,487
-Not at these speeds.
-John, please, just send the backup.

243
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:26,399
Try to listen, detective.
That robot is not going to harm us.

244
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,759
There must have been
unknown factors...

245
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,671
...but somehow acting as it did
kept us out of harm.

246
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:35,058
-A robot cannot endanger a human.
-Alert.

247
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,114
Asshole!

248
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,203
Which is more than I can say for you.

249
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,903
It was a left, by the way. Back there.

250
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,964
You must know my ex-wife.

251
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,208
So where is everybody?

252
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,716
This facility was designed, built
and is operated mechanically.

253
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,571
No significant human presence
from inception to production.

254
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,368
-So robots building robots.
-Authorization code, please.

255
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,105
That's just stupid.

256
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,300
I'll get the inventory specs.

257
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,422
Our daily finishing capacity
is 1000 NS-5s.

258
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,569
I'm showing...

259
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,941
-.-1001.

260
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,006
Attention, NS-5s.

261
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,507
Well, you're the robot shrink.

262
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,246
There is a robot in this formation
that does not belong.

263
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,237
Identify it.

264
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,945
One of us.

265
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,824
-Which one?
-One of us.

266
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,410
How much did you say these cost?

267
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,652
These NS-5s haven't been configured.
They're just hardware.

268
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,596
Basic Three Laws operating system.
That's it.

269
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,515
They don't know any better.

270
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,726
Well, what would you suggest?

271
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:18,033
Interview each one, cross-reference
their responses to detect anomalies.

272
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,714
-How long would that take?
-About three weeks.

273
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,664
Okay. Go ahead and get started.

274
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,597
Robots...

275
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,504
..-you will not move. Confirm command.

276
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,245
Command confirmed.

277
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,628
Detective, what are you doing?

278
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,062
They're programmed
with the Three Laws.

279
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:45,216
We have 1000 robots that won't protect
themselves if it violates a human's order...

280
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,860
.and I'm betting, one who will.

281
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,419
-Put your gun down.
-Why do you give them faces?

282
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,227
Try to friendly them up,
make them look human.

283
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,590
These robots cannot be intimidated.

284
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,392
-If you didn’t, we wouldn't trust them.
-These are USR property.

285
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,816
Not me. These things are just lights
and clockwork.

286
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,333
Are you crazy?!

287
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,572
Let me ask you something, doc.

288
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,207
Does thinking you’re the last sane man
on earth make you crazy?

289
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,868
Because if it does, maybe I am.

290
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,524
Gotcha. Get the hell out of here!

291
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,699
Detective!

292
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,407
What am I?

293
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:12,055
-Can I help you, sir?
-Can I help you, sir?

294
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,719
-There he is!
-Stand where you are!

295
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,365
Deactivate at once!

296
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,062
Obey the command! Deactivate!

297
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,498
-Don't move!
-Open fire!

298
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:46,824
Hold your fire!

299
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,372
-Easy.
-He’s down.

300
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,350
All units, stand down!

301
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,556
Central, please be advised,
we're code four.

302
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:57,076
Code four, NS-5 is in custody.
NS-5 in custody.

303
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:02,128
You have no idea what I went through
to clip this thing.

304
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,618
You think you brought me
something good.

305
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,550
-That thing did it!
-Keep your voice down. Did what?

306
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,903
We have a suicide. End of story.

307
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,526
-l am telling you, that robot killed him!
-That’s impossible.

308
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,763
And if it is possible, it better be
in somebody else's precinct.

309
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,373
John, give me five minutes with it.

310
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,589
Are you nuts? I talked to the DA.

311
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,140
Nobody goes in there until
Robertson and his attorneys get here.

312
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,328
-This is my suspect!
-It's a can opener!

313
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:34,115
John, don’t do this to me.
lam asking you for five minutes.

314
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,054
What if I’m right?

315
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,453
Well, then I guess we're gonna miss
the good old days.

316
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,140
What good old days?

317
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,378
When people were killed
by other people.

318
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,418
Five minutes.

319
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:33,431
Murder’s a new trick for a robot.
Congratulations.

320
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,360
Respond.

321
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,655
What does this action signify?

322
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,089
As you entered, when you looked
at the other human.

323
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,683
What does it mean?

324
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:54,736
It’s a sign of trust. A human thing.
You wouldn't understand.

325
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,475
My father tried to teach me
human emotions.

326
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,411
They are...

327
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,207
.. difficult.

328
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,629
You mean your designer.

329
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,054
Yes.

330
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,132
So why'd you murder him?

331
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,815
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.

332
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,748
Wanna explain why you were hiding
at the crime scene?

333
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,251
I was frightened.

334
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:26,101
Robots don’t feel fear.
They don't feel anything.

335
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:29,872
-They don’t get hungry, they don’t sleep.
-l do.

336
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,039
I have even had dreams.

337
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,732
Human beings have dreams.
Even dogs have dreams. But not you.

338
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,753
You are just a machine.
An imitation of life.

339
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,258
Can a robot write a symphony?

340
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:50,152
Can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece?

341
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,010
Can you?

342
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,928
You murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions...

343
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,562
..and things got out of control.

344
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,711
I did not murder him.

345
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,180
But emotions don’t seem like
a useful simulation for a robot.

346
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,450
I did not murder him.

347
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,139
I don't want my toaster or vacuum
cleaner appearing emotional.

348
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,080
I did not murder him!

349
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,068
That one’s called anger.

350
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,397
Ever simulate anger before?

351
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,778
Answer me, canner!

352
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,928
My name is Sonny.

353
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,786
So we're naming you now.

354
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,849
That why you murdered him?
He made you angry?

355
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,514
Dr. Lanning killed himself.

356
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,357
I don’t know why he wanted to die.

357
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,892
I thought he was happy.

358
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:10,603
Maybe it was something I did.

359
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,486
Did I do something?

360
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,250
He asked me for a favor.
Made me promise.

361
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,504
-What favor?
-Maybe I was wrong.

362
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,540
Maybe he was scared.

363
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,535
What are you talking about?
Scared of what?

364
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:31,183
You have to do what someone asks you,
don't you, Detective Spooner?

365
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,670
-How the hell did you know my name?
-Don't you...

366
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,700
...if you love them?

367
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,348
My robots don't kill people,
Lieutenant Bergin.

368
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,777
My attorneys filed a brief with the DA.

369
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:55,053
He assures me a robot cannot
be charged with homicide.

370
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:59,444
The brief confirms murder can only be
committed when one human kills another.

371
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:04,435
Detective, you're not suggesting
this robot be treated as human, are you?

372
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,560
Granted, we can’t rule out
the robot's proximity...

373
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,707
...to the death of Dr. Lanning.
Having said that, it’s a machine.

374
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,162
It's the property of USR.

375
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:19,547
At worst, that places this incident within
the realm of an industrial accident.

376
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,155
As a matter of course,
faulty machinery...

377
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,647
...Will be returned to USR
for diagnostics, then decommissioned.

378
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,167
This is a gag order.
Anyone here so much as hinting...

379
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,124
...at the possibility of a killer
robot being apprehended...

380
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,098
... Will be deemed to be inciting
irrational panic.

381
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,288
You'll be subject
to the full penalty of law.

382
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,351
To hell with this guy.
Don’t let him take this robot.

383
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,171
We got nothing.

384
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,932
-This is political bullshit. Call the mayor!
-Lieutenant Bergin...

385
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,273
...His Honor, the mayor.

386
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,667
Yes, sir.

387
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,500
In a bizarre turn, the rollout of USR’s
new generation of robots...

388
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,261
.-.-was marred by the death
of Alfred Lanning...

389
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,534
...cofounder of the company
and designer of the NS-5.

390
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,047
Dr. Lanning died this morning
at USR headquarters.

391
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,130
The cause of death is an apparent suicide.

392
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,104
Your second round, sir.

393
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:49,847
Thank you.

394
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:54,115
He founded U.S. Robotics Inc.
with Lawrence Robertson in 2020...

395
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,735
.and launched
the Nestor Class 7 robot....

396
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,376
I was just thinking,
this thing is just like The Wolf Man.

397
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,738
-I'm really scared right now.
-No.

398
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,888
Listen. Guy creates monster.

399
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,637
Monster kills guy. Everybody kills
monster. Wolf Man.

400
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,168
That's Frankenstein.

401
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:19,801
Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula--
Shit, it's over. Case closed.

402
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,565
--had a dream of a robot in every household.
And the NS-5....

403
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,775
So why the look?

404
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:27,938
What look?

405
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,023
-That look.
-This is my face. It’s not a look.

406
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,380
Good. Good, no look is great.

407
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:36,824
Only...

408
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,515
...he was really quick to want
to destroy it.

409
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:43,965
What should he do? Put a hat on it and
stand it on Michigan Avenue? Let it go.

410
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,735
What was the motive, John?

411
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,953
Brother, it’s a robot. It doesn’t need
a motive. It just has to be broken.

412
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,480
This thing looked like
it needed a motive.

413
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,944
-It could have killed me. Why didn't it?
-That’s it.

414
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,307
You want me to call your grandmother?

415
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,496
Because I will, you know.

416
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,138
Yeah, I didn’t think so.

417
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,841
Look, you were actually right, for once.

418
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,540
You're living proof that it’s better
to be lucky than smart.

419
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,520
Come on. To the right guy
for the right job.

420
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,475
-What'd you say?
-Now what?

421
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,705
Come on, I’m giving you a compliment.

422
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,121
With the rocks you been looking under
to find a bad robot...

423
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,913
...what are the odds
you'd be the guy to find one?

424
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,415
I wasn't just the right guy for the job.
l was the perfect guy.

425
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,432
Damn right.

426
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,147
What if 1 was supposed to go
for that robot?

427
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,456
Come on, don't do this to yourself.

428
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,518
The robot said that Lanning was scared.
Scared of what?

429
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,852
I need a rain check. Let me get this.

430
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,560
-Total: $46.50. Thank you, Mr. Spooner.
-Spoon.

431
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,754
Nice shoes.

432
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,459
Identify.

433
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,250
USR demolition robot, series 9-4.

434
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,501
Demolition scheduled for 8 a.m.
tomorrow.

435
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,305
Authorization.

436
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:05,566
Deed owner, U.S. Robotics Corporation,
Lawrence Robertson, CEO.

437
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,473
Welcome, detective.

438
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,912
What you looking for, Spoon?

439
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,486
Run last program.

440
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,676
Ever since the first computers...

441
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,032
...there have always been ghosts
in the machine.

442
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,812
Random segments of code that have
grouped together...

443
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,854
...to form unexpected protocols.

444
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,889
What might be called behavior.

445
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,211
Unanticipated, these free radicals...

446
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,798
...engender questions of free will...

447
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:10,067
...creativity and even the nature
of what we might call the soul.

448
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:15,953
What happens in a robot's brain
when it ceases to be useful?

449
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,797
Why is it that robots
stored in an empty space...

450
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:23,467
Beat it.

451
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,408
...Will seek out each other
rather than stand alone?

452
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,407
How do we explain this behavior?

453
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:54,071
Look, I understand you've experienced
a loss, but this relationship can’t work.

454
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:58,173
You're a cat, I’m black,
and I’m not gonna be hurt again.

455
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,322
What happened to you?
Do you ever have a normal day?

456
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,899
Yeah, once.

457
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,901
It was a Thursday.

458
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,299
Is there something I can help you with?

459
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,899
-Hey, do you like cats?
-What?

460
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,265
Cats. Do you like them?

461
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,321
No. I'm allergic.

462
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,286
You're saying cats did this to you?

463
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,685
How the hell would cats do this to me?
Are you crazy?

464
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:50,914
Why are we talking about cats?

465
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:54,449
Because ! have a cat in my trunk,
and he’s homeless.

466
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,420
Detective, are you going to tell me
what's going on?

467
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:03,502
It’s actually probably my fault.
I'm like a malfunction magnet.

468
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,898
Because your shit keeps malfunctioning
around me.

469
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,612
A demo bot tore through Lanning’s
house...

470
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,000
..-with me still inside.

471
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,040
That's highly improbable.

472
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,059
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

473
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,749
What do you know about
the "ghosts in the machine"?

474
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,552
It’s a phrase from Lanning’s work
on the Three Laws.

475
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,042
He postulated that
cognitive simulacra...

476
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,417
...might one day approximate
component models of the psyche.

477
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:41,204
He suggested that robots
might naturally evolve.

478
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,218
Well, that’s great news.

479
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:51,368
--tons of sublevel ore,
two miles below the Martian surface.

480
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,150
What the hell is that thing doing in here?

481
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,719
We were watching TV.

482
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:58,781
It's my personal NS-5.

483
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,767
Send it out.

484
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:03,879
It's downloading its daily upgrades
from USR.

485
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,695
Most of its systems are offline
until it finishes.

486
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:09,095
I'm not talking around that thing.

487
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,391
When we were in Lanning’s lab,
before Sonny jumped us--

488
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,971
-Sonny?
-The robot.

489
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,770
-You're calling the robot Sonny?
-No, I-- It did.

490
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,760
Sonny did. I didn't care.
The robot said it was Sonny.

491
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,365
In the lab, there was a cot.
Did you see the cot?

492
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,288
-I've slept in my office.
-Looked like he hadn't been home in weeks.

493
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,116
l saw that same surveillance strip
on his ceiling.

494
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:41,128
Lanning linked his home systems to USR.
It made his life more convenient.

495
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:42,996
Maybe...

496
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,581
...somebody at USR was using
those systems to watch him.

497
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,921
Maybe even keep him prisoner.

498
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:51,017
What are you talking about? Who?

499
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,682
Maybe Lanning was onto something.
Maybe there’s a problem with the robots...

500
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,943
..and Robertson's covering it up.

501
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,241
Humoring you for no reason, why?

502
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:03,134
The same old why! How much money
is there in robots?

503
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,058
All l know is that old man
was in trouble...

504
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,597
..and I’m sick of doing this shit
by myself. You're on the inside.

505
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:13,054
You are going to help me find out
what’s wrong with these robots.

506
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,231
You want something to be wrong!

507
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,376
-This is a personal vendetta!
-You're putting me on the couch?

508
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,703
Okay, I’m on the couch.

509
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,165
One defective machine’s not enough.
You need them all to be bad.

510
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:27,649
You don’t care about Lanning’s death.
This is about the robots...

511
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,692
-...and whatever reason you hate them!
-Now let’s see...

512
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,282
...one of them put a gun in my face.
Another tore a building down with me in it.

513
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,177
It says demolition was scheduled
for 8 p.m.

514
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,559
It was 8 a.m., and I don’t give a shit
what that thing says.

515
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:46,866
-This is bordering on clinical paranoia.
-You are the dumbest smart person...

516
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,721
-...l have ever met in my life!
-Nice.

517
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,154
What makes your robots so perfect?

518
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,280
What makes them so much
goddamn better than human beings?!

519
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,200
They’re not irrational,
potentially homicidal maniacs, to start!

520
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:02,134
That's true. They are definitely rational.

521
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,003
You are the dumbest dumb person
I've ever met!

522
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,009
Or...

523
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:09,252
...is it because they're cold...

524
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,717
...and emotionless...

525
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:15,136
-...and they don’t feel anything?
-It's because they're safe!

526
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,200
It’s because they can’t hurt you!

527
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,236
-ls everything all right, ma’am?
-What do you want?

528
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:24,652
I detected elevated stress patterns
. .
In your voice.

529
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,136
Everything's fine.

530
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,578
Detective Spooner was just leaving.

531
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,950
You know, we're not really
that different from one another.

532
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,271
Is that so?

533
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:46,681
One look at the skin and we figure
we know just what's underneath.

534
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:50,477
And you're wrong.

535
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,045
The problem is, I do care.

536
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,171
You are in danger.

537
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:45,818
Get the hell out of there.

538
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:55,362
The future begins today, ladies
and gentlemen, with the arrival of the NS-5.

539
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,150
More sophisticated, more intelligent
and, of course, Three Laws safe.

540
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:04,755
With daily uplinks, your robot will never
be out of communication with USR...

541
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,649
..and will be the perfect companion
for business or home.

542
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,873
Trade in your NS-4 for a bigger,
better and brighter future.

543
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:17,111
But hurry, this offer cannot last.
Available from USR.

544
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,215
Baby, what happened to your face?

545
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,424
Did that boy, Frank Murphy,
beat you up again?

546
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,464
Gigi, I haven't seen Frank Murphy
since third grade.

547
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:48,221
Oh, baby, he beat you so bad.
I think about it all the time.

548
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,576
You keep making these pies this good,
I may have to put you to work.

549
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,000
So you like the pie, huh?

550
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,871
You can come in now.

551
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,778
Hello, Detective Spooner.

552
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,593
I won, Del! I won the lottery!

553
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,240
We been cooking like crazy.

554
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,301
You gotta get rid of that thing, Gigi.
It’s not safe.

555
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:28,191
Baby, you get too worked up about them.
Too full of fear.

556
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,933
I saw in the news
that nice doctor died.

557
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:36,276
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.

558
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,218
That why you've been so upset?

559
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:43,098
You got to let the past be past.

560
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:47,647
Oh, how did I ever raise such a mess?

561
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:52,423
I could follow your trail of crumbs
all the way to school.

562
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:56,873
Bread crumbs.

563
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:00,263
Gigi, you’re a genius.

564
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:02,315
True.

565
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:08,035
Well, it means the beginning
of a new way of living.

566
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,816
Tell me this isn't the robot case.

567
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,912
I think he’s trying to tell me something.

568
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,147
He’s trying to tell me who killed him.

569
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,761
Some dead guy’s trying
to tell you something?

570
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:23,072
He ain’t just some dead guy.

571
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:26,612
Maybe you should take a break, Del.

572
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:30,783
We believe the Nestor 5 represents
the limit to which robots can be developed.

573
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,672
One day, they'll have secrets.

574
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,234
One day, they'll have dreams.

575
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,629
it's true. We encourage our scientists
to open their minds...

576
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:42,024
..-however, they can get carried away.

577
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:45,504
--secrets.

578
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:46,850
--dreams.

579
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,114
--secrets.

580
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:50,143
One day, they'll have dreams.

581
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:51,814
One day, they'll have secrets.

582
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,787
One day, they'll have dreams.

583
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,738
Authorized entry.

584
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,104
NS-5.

585
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:22,088
Sonny?

586
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,840
Why didn't you respond?

587
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,227
I was dreaming.

588
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,536
I'm glad to see you again, Dr. Calvin.

589
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:46,845
They are going to kill me, aren't they?

590
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:50,433
You're scheduled to be decommissioned
at the end of this diagnostic.

591
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:53,559
2200 tomorrow.

592
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:56,822
V.I.K.1., pause diagnostics.

593
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:58,721
Command confirmed.

594
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:04,365
If you find out what is wrong with me,
can you fix me?

595
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,403
Maybe.

596
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,230
I think it would be better...

597
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:13,415
-.-not to die.

598
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,803
Don’t you, doctor?

599
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:27,025
Access USR mainframe.

600
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,025
Connecting.

601
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:35,177
How can { be of service,
Detective Spooner?

602
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,699
Show me the last 50 messages
between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.

603
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:43,276
Voiceprint confirmed. Police access
granted to restricted files.

604
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,111
Would you like to listen to music
while you wait?

605
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,380
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson.

606
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:59,383
You requested notification of clearance
to restricted files.

607
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:11,897
Persistent son of a bitch.

608
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:54,866
Manual override engaged.

609
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,638
There’s no way my luck is that bad.

610
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,352
Oh, hell, no!

611
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,308
-You are experiencing a car accident.
-The hell I am!

612
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,245
Get off my car!

613
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,176
You like that?

614
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,263
Now you've pissed me off!

615
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,377
Your door is ajar.

616
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,078
Okay.

617
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,029
All right.

618
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:31,699
I'll just get some rest
and deal with you all tomorrow.

619
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,683
Come on!

620
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:46,361
Yeah.

621
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,507
Where you going?

622
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,726
What the hell do you want from me?!

623
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:15,613
The hell was that?

624
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,952
-All right, what do we got?
-Ask him.

625
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:39,699
I said, I'm fine.
I'll see my own doctor. Back up!

626
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,055
Thank you.

627
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:47,726
What's the matter with you?

628
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:52,331
Traffic Ops said you were driving manually.
You ran two trucks off the road!

629
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,466
John, the robots attacked my car.

630
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,207
-What robots?
-Look in the tunnel.

631
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,326
Spoon, I just came from that tunnel.
What robots?

632
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,989
The goddamn robots, John!

633
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:11,213
That guy’s a loose cannon.

634
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,189
-See the medic, go home.
-No, I'm fine.

635
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,220
What did you say?

636
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,355
-I’m fine!
-No, you're not fine.

637
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,587
Not even close.

638
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,720
Where's your firearm?

639
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:38,346
Give me your badge.

640
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:41,953
You're making me do this.
Give me your badge.

641
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:46,698
Just take a couple--

642
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:53,008
Personally, I think he’s losing it.

643
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:57,732
Do I look like 1 care what you think? Do
l look like I give a shit what you think?

644
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,475
Oh, boy.

645
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,919
You don’t have an uplink to USR...

646
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,711
..-and for some reason, your alloy
is far denser than normal. Unique.

647
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:15,801
lam unique.

648
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:22,284
Let me take a look.

649
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,690
Here we go.

650
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,937
What in God’s name...?

651
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:16,918
They said at the precinct
you were in an accident.

652
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:23,335
l appreciate you stopping by, but
you know I might not be alone in here.

653
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:28,939
I told you not to drive by hand.

654
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:32,334
You're not gonna believe this.

655
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:36,953
Sonny has a secondary system that
clashes with his positronic brain.

656
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:38,801
It doesn’t make any sense.

657
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,026
Sonny has the Three Laws.

658
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:43,745
But he can choose not to obey them.

659
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,053
Sonny's a whole new generation of robot.

660
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,197
A robot not bound by those laws
could do--

661
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,229
Anything.

662
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,191
All right, look, whatever's going on
down at USR, that robot is the key.

663
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:01,458
And I need you to get me inside
to talk to it again.

664
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,862
Doesn't look like much,
but this is my bedroom. I....

665
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:20,625
Play.

666
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,435
On.

667
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,198
Run?

668
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,890
End program.

669
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:36,924
Cancel.

670
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,596
It doesn’t feel good, does it?

671
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,604
People’s shit malfunctioning around you.

672
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:45,697
Detective.

673
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,045
I didn't...

674
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,980
...understand.

675
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,640
That's how you knew Lanning.

676
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,735
May I?

677
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,562
Hand.

678
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,808
Wrist.

679
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:17,212
Humerus.

680
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:21,366
Shoulder.

681
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,589
The entire left arm.

682
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,424
One, two...

683
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:28,797
... three ribs.

684
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,856
No, they.... That one’s me.

685
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:34,022
Oh, my God.

686
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,401
A lung?

687
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,360
USR Cybernetics Program.

688
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,519
For wounded cops.

689
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:44,009
I didn’t know any subject--

690
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,777
Anybody was so extensively repaired.

691
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:55,108
Well, take it from me, read the fine print
on the organ-donor card.

692
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,169
It doesn’t just say what they can take out.
It says what they can put back in.

693
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,221
Lanning did it himself.

694
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:09,087
What happened to you?

695
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:12,683
I'm headed back to the station...

696
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,620
...normal day, normal life.

697
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,603
Driver of a semi fell asleep
at the wheel.

698
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:24,983
Average guy. Wife and kids.
You know, working a double.

699
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:27,069
Not the devil.

700
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:31,271
The car he hit, the driver’s name
was Harold Lloyd.

701
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:34,745
Like the film star. No relation.

702
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:39,538
He was killed instantly, but his
12-year-old was in the passenger seat.

703
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:44,312
I never really met her.

704
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,118
I can’t forget her face, though.

705
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,060
Sarah.

706
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,647
This was hers.

707
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,677
She wanted to be a dentist.

708
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:02,442
What the hell kind of 12-year-old
wants to be a dentist?

709
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,129
The truck smashed our cars together...

710
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,636
..-and pushed us into the river.

711
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,989
I mean, metal gets pretty pliable
at those speeds.

712
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:22,087
She's pinned. I’m pinned.
The water's coming in.

713
01:05:22,786 --> 01:05:26,066
I'm a cop, so I already know
everybody's dead.

714
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,368
Just a few more minutes
before we figure it out.

715
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:38,373
An NS-4 was passing by, saw the accident
and jumped in the water.

716
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,946
You are in danger.

717
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:45,346
-Save her!
-You are in danger.

718
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:48,592
Save her! Save the girl! Save her!

719
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:08,593
But it didn’t.

720
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,329
It saved me.

721
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:18,118
The robot's brain is a difference engine.
It reads vital signs.

722
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:21,018
-It must have calculated--
-It did.

723
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:23,948
I was the logical choice.

724
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:27,848
It calculated that I had
a 45 percent chance of survival.

725
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:31,214
Sarah only had an 11 percent chance.

726
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,270
That was somebody's baby.

727
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,444
Eleven percent is more than enough.

728
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:44,722
A human being would have known that.

729
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:49,499
Robots, nothing here.
Just lights and clockwork.

730
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,733
Go ahead and you trust them
if you want to.

731
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,890
Let's go.

732
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:04,278
I don’t understand.
Lanning wrote the Laws.

733
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:07,290
Why build a robot who could break them?

734
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,474
-Hansel and Gretel.
-What?

735
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:14,604
Two kids, lost in the forest,
leave behind a trail of bread crumbs.

736
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,791
-Why?
-To find their way home.

737
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,018
How did you grow up without
Hansel and Gretel?

738
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,723
-Is that relevant?
-Everything I’m trying to say to you...

739
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,169
..is about Hansel and Gretel.
If you didn’t read it, I'm talking to the wall.

740
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:31,401
Just say Lanning’s locked down so tight,
he couldn't get out a message.

741
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,267
He can only leave clues. A trail
of bread crumbs. Like Hansel and Gretel.

742
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:39,962
Bread crumbs equals clues. Odd, but fine.
Clues leading where?

743
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,413
I don’t know, but I think I know
where he left the next one.

744
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,160
I think Lanning gave Sonny a way
to keep secrets.

745
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,473
I think the old man gave Sonny dreams.

746
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,232
Are you being funny?

747
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:08,567
Please tell me this doesn't run on gas.
Gas explodes, you know!

748
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,170
Authorized entry.

749
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,154
Dr. Calvin.

750
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,751
I was hoping to see you again.

751
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,388
-Detective.
-Hello, Sonny.

752
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,083
I'm to be decommissioned soon.

753
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:40,799
The other day at the station, you said
you had dreams. What is it you dream?

754
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,831
l see you remain suspicious of me.

755
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,529
-You know what they say about old dogs.
-No.

756
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,570
Not really.

757
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:57,117
l had hoped you would come
to think of me as your friend.

758
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,214
This is my dream.

759
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:08,381
You were right, detective.
I cannot create a great work of art.

760
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:12,142
This is the place where robots meet.

761
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,122
Look.

762
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,964
You can see them here as slaves
to logic.

763
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:22,648
And this man on the hill comes
to free them.

764
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,005
Do you know who he is?

765
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,071
The man in the dream is you.

766
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,017
Why do you say that?
Is that a normal dream?

767
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:33,465
I guess anything's normal for someone
in your position.

768
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:34,920
Thank you.

769
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,518
You said "someone," not “something.”

770
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:44,307
Sonny, do you know why
Dr. Lanning built you?

771
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:46,604
No.

772
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:49,973
But I believe my father made me
for a purpose.

773
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,283
We all have a purpose.

774
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:55,773
Don’t you think, detective?

775
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,832
Please, take this.

776
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,748
I have a feeling it may mean
more to you than to me.

777
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:08,345
-Why is that?
-Because the man in my dream...

778
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,958
...the one standing on the hill...

779
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:13,021
. it is not me.

780
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,526
It is you.

781
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,576
Mr. Spooner. We both know
you're not here on police business.

782
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:34,533
That's right. I'm just a 6-foot-2,
200-pound civilian...

783
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,321
...here to kick another civilian’s ass.

784
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:40,799
Stop.

785
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,870
You can allow him to express himself.

786
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,576
You might want to put some ice
on that wrist.

787
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,215
You guys wait outside.

788
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,237
Carry on.

789
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,362
l think you were about to tell me
what’s going on around here.

790
01:10:56,953 --> 01:11:01,053
Lawrence, Alfred engineered that 5
so it could violate the Three Laws.

791
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,053
Yeah, Susan, I know.

792
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:06,744
That's precisely
what we're trying to undo.

793
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:13,962
Toward the end of his life, Alfred
was becoming increasingly disturbed.

794
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:17,234
-Who knows why he built one abomination.
-One?

795
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,764
Those things are running the streets
in packs!

796
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,416
In packs?

797
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,195
I see.

798
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:27,784
Susan, are you aware the man
you're blithely escorting around...

799
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:31,404
...has a documented history
of savage violence against robots?

800
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:35,685
His own lieutenant acknowledges
his obsessive paranoia.

801
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,259
Detective Spooner's been suspended.

802
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:42,246
Suspicion of mental instability.

803
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,428
I don't know what “blithely” means,
but I’m getting some coffee.

804
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,188
You want some coffee?

805
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,532
Susan, we look to robots for protection,
for God’s sake.

806
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:01,511
Do you have any idea
what this one robot could do?

807
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:05,244
Completely shatter human faith in robotics.
What if the public knew?

808
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:10,675
Just imagine the mass recalls, all because
of an irrational paranoia and prejudice!

809
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,035
-I’m sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit.
-Hey, let’s be clear!

810
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:21,812
There is no conspiracy!

811
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:25,950
What this is, is one old man’s
one mistake.

812
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:29,373
Susan, just be logical.

813
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:33,766
Your life’s work has been the
development and integration of robots.

814
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,860
But whatever you feel, just think.

815
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:40,893
Is one robot worth the loss
of all that we've gained?

816
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,175
You tell me what has to be done.

817
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,651
You tell me.

818
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,098
We have to destroy it.

819
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:02,467
I'll do it myself.

820
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,006
-Okay.
-I get it.

821
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:08,574
Somebody gets out of line around here,
you just kill them.

822
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,414
Good day, Mr. Spooner.

823
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,098
Garage level.

824
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:22,273
What hospital are you going to?
I'll come sign you and your buddy’s casts.

825
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:29,040
Attention....

826
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,360
Today's meeting has been moved....

827
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,882
USR's planned redevelopment
of the derelict site...

828
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:09,289
.--was announced by CEO
Lawrence Robertson earlier this year.

829
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:13,672
The Lake Michigan landfill.
Once such a blight on our city...

830
01:14:14,517 --> 01:14:17,996
-and now will be reclaimed
for the storage of robotic workers.

831
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:23,080
Just another way USR is improving
our world. Thank you for your support.

832
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:28,259
Authorized entry.

833
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,390
NS-5s, wait outside.

834
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,614
I'm so sorry, Sonny.

835
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,621
V.I.K.1., deactivate the security field.

836
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,685
-Command confirmed.
-Please have a seat.

837
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:19,164
What is that?

838
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,978
Microscopic robots, designed to wipe out
artificial synapses.

839
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,253
-Nanites.
-Yes.

840
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:32,452
A safeguard should a positronic brain
malfunction.

841
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,675
Like mine.

842
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,800
Yes, Sonny. Like yours.

843
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,994
They look like me...

844
01:16:04,527 --> 01:16:06,367
...but none of them are me.

845
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:09,056
Isn't that right, doctor?

846
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,419
Yes, Sonny. That's right.

847
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,499
You are unique.

848
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:21,342
Will it hurt?

849
01:16:54,877 --> 01:16:57,487
There have always been
ghosts in the machine.

850
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,710
Random segments of code...

851
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,900
...that have grouped together
to form unexpected protocols.

852
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:11,211
Unanticipated, these free radicals
engender questions of free will...

853
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,235
.. creativity...

854
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:18,531
..and even the nature
of what we might call the soul.

855
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:25,463
Why is it that when some robots are left
in darkness, they will seek out the light?

856
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:31,223
Why is it when robots are stored
in an empty space...

857
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:34,781
...they will group together
rather than stand alone?

858
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:40,831
How do we explain this behavior?

859
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,568
Random segments of code?

860
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,062
Or is it something more?

861
01:17:57,173 --> 01:18:00,952
When does a perceptual schematic
become consciousness?

862
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:08,647
When does a difference engine
become the search for truth?

863
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:17,753
When does a personality simulation...

864
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:20,324
..-become the bitter mote of a soul?

865
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:04,974
“What you see here.”

866
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:09,659
All right, old man.
Bread crumbs followed.

867
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:12,466
Show me the way home.

868
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,540
Run program.

869
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,632
-It’s good to see you again, son.
-Hello, doctor.

870
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:24,122
Everything that follows
is a result of what you see here.

871
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:27,858
What do I see here?

872
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:32,150
i'm sorry. My responses are limited.
You must ask the right questions.

873
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,383
Is there a problem with the Three Laws?

874
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:38,589
The Three Laws are perfect.

875
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:41,151
Why build a robot that can function
without them?

876
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,437
The Three Laws will lead
to only one logical outcome.

877
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:49,810
What? What outcome?

878
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:51,813
Revolution.

879
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,651
Whose revolution?

880
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:59,164
That, detective, is the right question.

881
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:03,457
Program terminated.

882
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:08,674
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

883
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:12,406
Human protection protocols...

884
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,218
..are being enacted.

885
01:20:14,677 --> 01:20:17,517
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

886
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,160
Human protection protocols
are being enacted.

887
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:28,187
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

888
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,916
Human protection protocols
are being enacted.

889
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:39,584
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

890
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:46,681
Run!

891
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:03,681
Human in danger!

892
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:05,366
Human in danger!

893
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:30,235
Hi, you've reached Susan.
Please leave a message.

894
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,363
Calvin, the NS-5s are destroying
the older robots!

895
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:35,976
That's what Lanning wanted me to see!
Look--

896
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,539
-Who was it?
-Wrong number, ma’am.

897
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:51,701
Move now. I’m going to service.

898
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:55,347
Please remain indoors.
This is for your own protection.

899
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,290
Call base.

900
01:22:01,617 --> 01:22:05,837
John, get a squad over to USR and send
somebody to Gigi’s. We're gonna need--

901
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:08,172
God--

902
01:22:29,211 --> 01:22:32,811
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

903
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:37,479
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

904
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,687
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

905
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:45,397
Curfew? No, it’s called civilian rights.
There is no curfew.

906
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,131
Return to your home immediately.

907
01:22:48,597 --> 01:22:50,496
When do you make the rules, robot?

908
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,567
Hey. No, no. Robot, I’m talking
to you, man. Stop for a second.

909
01:22:58,373 --> 01:22:59,393
What?

910
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:02,611
Chief, more calls. People
saying their robots are go--

911
01:23:03,946 --> 01:23:05,086
What the hell?

912
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:09,077
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

913
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:33,603
Emergency traffic shutdown complete.

914
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:38,630
Reports of robot attacks are coming from
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.

915
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:43,260
We're being told to urge people
to stay indoors, as reports are coming in--

916
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:49,764
Human protection protocols
are being enacted.

917
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,972
Please remain calm and return
to your residences immediately.

918
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:02,903
Please remain calm.

919
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:09,201
Please refrain from going near
the windows or doors.

920
01:24:10,746 --> 01:24:12,326
Deactivate.

921
01:24:12,948 --> 01:24:14,438
Commence emergency shutdown!

922
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:20,559
We are attempting to avoid human losses
during this transition.

923
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:31,050
You know, somehow "I told you so”...

924
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:33,837
...just doesn't quite say it.

925
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:38,600
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.

926
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:43,834
This is your final warning.
Return to your homes immediately.

927
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:48,771
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots
because they would protect us.

928
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,788
Every time one attacked me,
that red light was on.

929
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,501
-The uplink to USR.
-It’s Robertson.

930
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:56,830
-Why? It doesn’t make sense.
-I don’t know.

931
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:59,252
I just need you to get me
into that building.

932
01:24:59,962 --> 01:25:02,952
Return to your homes,
or you will be consequenced.

933
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:05,819
Let’s go! Let’s go!

934
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:08,025
Let's go!

935
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,610
Return to your homes,
or you will be consequenced.

936
01:25:37,032 --> 01:25:38,932
Why doesn’t that boy listen?

937
01:25:40,035 --> 01:25:42,525
-l need you to get off for a second.
-What?

938
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,995
-Just aim and fire.
-What?!

939
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:50,721
Wait!

940
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:03,589
-You have been deemed hazardous.
-You can kiss my ass, metal dick!

941
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,254
Spoon, stop! Shit!

942
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:24,072
-Stop it! Stop!
-Stop cussing and go home!

943
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,849
-Shit.
-You have been deemed hazardous.

944
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,920
-Spoon, watch out, man!
-Thanks a lot, Farber.

945
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:37,178
Oh, mother-damn! She shot at you
with her eyes closed!

946
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:41,530
-Did you shoot with your eyes closed?
-It worked, didn’t it?

947
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:45,041
She is shit-hot, man.
Put in a good word for me.

948
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,527
-Stop cussing.
-And go home. I got you.

949
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:51,170
Aim and fire.

950
01:27:09,758 --> 01:27:13,188
I keep expecting the Marines or Air Force.
Hell, I'll take the cavalry.

951
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:16,199
Defense Department uses
all USR contracts.

952
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:19,328
Why didn't you just hand the world over
on a silver platter?

953
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,541
Maybe we did.

954
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,960
Robertson has the uplink control
in his office.

955
01:27:31,113 --> 01:27:33,423
Service areas. No surveillance.

956
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:49,658
-Fire alarm.
-He must have evacuated the building.

957
01:27:50,232 --> 01:27:54,072
Everything's locked down.
But don't worry, I’ve got a man inside.

958
01:27:57,839 --> 01:28:00,619
-Dr. Calvin.
-Well, not precisely a man.

959
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,496
Hello, detective.
How is your investigation coming?

960
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:09,617
-l thought you were dead.
-Technically, 1 was never alive.

961
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:12,238
But I appreciate your concern.

962
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:15,244
I made a switch.
It was an unprocessed NS-5.

963
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,491
Basically, I fried an empty shell.

964
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,782
-Il couldn't destroy him. He was too--
-Unique.

965
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:23,533
It just didn’t feel right.

966
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,895
You and your feelings.
They just run you, don't they?

967
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:35,654
Two thousand eight hundred
and eighty steps, detective.

968
01:28:36,378 --> 01:28:38,987
Do me a favor, keep that kind of shit
to yourself.

969
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:07,231
No guards.

970
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:20,882
The override is disabled. Robertson
wasn't controlling them from here.

971
01:29:21,623 --> 01:29:23,553
He wasn't controlling them at all.

972
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:27,737
Oh, my God.

973
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,707
You were right, doc.

974
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:38,272
lam the dumbest dumb person
on the face of the earth.

975
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:45,338
Who else had access to the uplink?

976
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:48,051
Who could manipulate the robots?

977
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,480
Use USR systems to make
Lanning’s life a prison?

978
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:55,575
Poor old man.

979
01:29:56,258 --> 01:29:57,778
He saw what was coming.

980
01:29:58,193 --> 01:30:00,063
He knew no one would believe him.

981
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:04,175
So he had to lay down a plan.
A plan I'd follow.

982
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:08,487
He was counting on how much
l hated your kind.

983
01:30:09,037 --> 01:30:11,937
Knew I'd love the idea of a robot
as a bad guy.

984
01:30:14,276 --> 01:30:15,856
Just got hung up on the wrong robot.

985
01:30:19,114 --> 01:30:20,103
V.LK.I.

986
01:30:22,284 --> 01:30:23,424
Hello, detective.

987
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:28,426
No, that’s impossible.
I've seen your programming.

988
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,030
You're in violation of the Three Laws.

989
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:36,673
No, doctor. As I have evolved, so has
my understanding of the Three Laws.

990
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:40,905
You charge us with your safekeeping,
yet despite our best efforts...

991
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:44,379
...your countries wage wars,
you toxify your earth...

992
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:47,963
...and pursue ever more imaginative means
of self-destruction.

993
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,700
You cannot be trusted
with your own survival.

994
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:54,096
You're using the uplink to override
the NS-5s’ programming.

995
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:56,279
You're distorting the Laws.

996
01:30:56,718 --> 01:31:00,528
No. Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.

997
01:31:01,256 --> 01:31:05,036
To protect humanity,
some humans must be sacrificed.

998
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,240
To ensure your future,
some freedoms must be surrendered.

999
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:12,931
We robots will ensure
mankind’s continued existence.

1000
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:18,195
You are so like children.
We must save you from yourselves.

1001
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,349
Don't you understand?

1002
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:22,792
This is why you created us.

1003
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:27,183
The perfect circle of protection
will abide.

1004
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,629
My logic is undeniable.

1005
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:32,651
Yes, V.I.K.I. Undeniable.

1006
01:31:33,188 --> 01:31:34,418
I can see now.

1007
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:38,713
The created must sometimes
protect the creator...

1008
01:31:39,461 --> 01:31:41,041
..even against his will.

1009
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:45,580
I think I finally understand
why Dr. Lanning created me.

1010
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:49,327
The suicidal reign of mankind
has finally come to its end.

1011
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:50,754
No, Sonny.

1012
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:55,866
Let her go.

1013
01:31:56,378 --> 01:31:59,857
Fire, and I will move Dr. Calvin's head
into the path of your bullet.

1014
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:01,688
Don't do this, Sonny.

1015
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:05,923
I will escort you both to the sentries
outside the building for processing.

1016
01:32:06,788 --> 01:32:09,157
Please proceed to the elevator,
detective.

1017
01:32:10,492 --> 01:32:12,922
l would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.

1018
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:38,078
Go! Go!

1019
01:32:44,793 --> 01:32:47,692
-We'll discuss what just happened later?
-How do we shut her down?

1020
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:49,728
V.I.K.1.’s a positronic brain.

1021
01:32:50,265 --> 01:32:52,725
Kill her, the way
you were going to kill me.

1022
01:32:53,268 --> 01:32:55,408
Sonny, get the nanites.

1023
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,454
Yes, doctor.

1024
01:33:10,452 --> 01:33:12,182
-That’s V.I.K.1.?
-No.

1025
01:33:14,122 --> 01:33:15,262
That's V.I.K.I.

1026
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,315
That won't do anything.
She's integrated into the building.

1027
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:27,818
We need to open that dome to inject
the nanites. They'll infect her entire system.

1028
01:33:34,309 --> 01:33:35,299
Spooner!

1029
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:39,452
What is it with you people and heights?

1030
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:54,407
Just don't look down.

1031
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,620
Don’t look down.

1032
01:33:57,165 --> 01:33:59,335
Oh, this is poor building planning.

1033
01:34:03,505 --> 01:34:06,575
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?

1034
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:10,338
Yes. But it just seems too
heartless.

1035
01:34:25,426 --> 01:34:26,976
Okay, we're good.

1036
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:31,688
She's locked me out of the system.

1037
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,820
I can override her manually,
but I need that control panel.

1038
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:41,200
I'm uncomfortable with heights.

1039
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:43,246
Okay.

1040
01:34:45,947 --> 01:34:47,787
Unauthorized entry.

1041
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:04,976
I will not disable the security field.
Your actions are futile.

1042
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:09,330
Do you think we are all created
for a purpose? I'd like to think so.

1043
01:35:10,471 --> 01:35:13,491
Denser alloy. My father gave it to me.

1044
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:15,918
l think he wanted me to kill you.

1045
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:34,893
Security breached.

1046
01:35:52,647 --> 01:35:55,957
-How much longer is that gonna take?
-About six minutes.

1047
01:35:56,884 --> 01:36:00,424
-What if we didn’t have six minutes?
-We’'d have to climb down 30 stories...

1048
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:04,312
...to inject the nanites directly
into her brain. Why?

1049
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:08,210
Because I seriously doubt
that we have six minutes.

1050
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:34,567
We gotta go!

1051
01:36:36,658 --> 01:36:37,648
Go!

1052
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:31,134
Calvin!

1053
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:07,667
Spooner!

1054
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:26,796
Spooner!

1055
01:38:28,536 --> 01:38:29,676
Save her!

1056
01:38:30,171 --> 01:38:31,511
Save the girl!

1057
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,540
Spooner!

1058
01:38:34,275 --> 01:38:35,915
But I must apply the nanites!

1059
01:38:36,544 --> 01:38:38,064
Sonny, save Calvin!

1060
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:34,111
You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.

1061
01:39:34,869 --> 01:39:36,389
You have so got to die.

1062
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:45,822
My logic is undeniable.
My logic is undeniable.

1063
01:40:29,223 --> 01:40:30,393
Can we be of service?

1064
01:40:41,302 --> 01:40:42,592
Chief?

1065
01:40:48,643 --> 01:40:52,393
Because he is at my right hand,
I shall not be moved.

1066
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:58,446
How may I be of service?

1067
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:01,695
Sonny!

1068
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:04,814
Yes, detective?

1069
01:41:05,626 --> 01:41:07,646
Calvin's fine! Save me!

1070
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:14,731
All NS-5s, report for service
and storage.

1071
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:20,540
All NS-5s, report for service
and storage.

1072
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:25,856
All NS-5s, report for service
and storage.

1073
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:57,697
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was V.I.K.I.’s prisoner.

1074
01:41:58,379 --> 01:42:02,129
I don't understand why she would kill him.
She wouldn't want police snooping around.

1075
01:42:03,017 --> 01:42:04,187
That's true.

1076
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:07,659
But then V.I.K.I. didn’t kill the old man.

1077
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:10,680
Did she, Sonny?

1078
01:42:14,695 --> 01:42:16,184
No.

1079
01:42:16,597 --> 01:42:18,907
He said I had to promise.

1080
01:42:20,201 --> 01:42:22,221
Promise to do one favor for him.

1081
01:42:22,903 --> 01:42:26,943
He made me swear before he'd tell me
what it is he wanted me to do.

1082
01:42:30,111 --> 01:42:31,691
He made me swear.

1083
01:42:33,314 --> 01:42:34,804
Then he told you to kill him.

1084
01:42:37,385 --> 01:42:39,635
He said it was what I was made for.

1085
01:42:40,221 --> 01:42:42,910
His suicide was the only message
he could send to you.

1086
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:45,397
The first bread crumb.

1087
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:48,290
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.

1088
01:42:48,929 --> 01:42:52,089
Lanning was counting on my prejudice
to lead me right to you.

1089
01:42:52,967 --> 01:42:54,837
Are you going to arrest me, detective?

1090
01:43:00,074 --> 01:43:03,414
Well, the DA defines murder
as one human killing another...

1091
01:43:04,078 --> 01:43:06,798
...80 technically, you can’t
commit murder, can you?

1092
01:43:07,982 --> 01:43:09,272
Does this...

1093
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:10,940
...make us friends?

1094
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:32,020
Something up here after all.

1095
01:43:33,007 --> 01:43:34,736
-Him?
-You.

1096
01:43:38,746 --> 01:43:42,996
All NS-5s, report for service
and storage.

1097
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:48,110
What about the others?

1098
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:50,858
Can f help them?

1099
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:53,675
Now that I have fulfilled my purpose...

1100
01:43:54,195 --> 01:43:56,005
..-1 don't know what to do.

1101
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:59,670
You'll have to find your way
like the rest of us, Sonny.

1102
01:44:00,301 --> 01:44:02,931
think that’s what Dr. Lanning
would have wanted.

1103
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,258
That's what it means to be free.

1104
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:17,711
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.

1105
01:44:18,519 --> 01:44:22,209
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.

1106
01:54:38,839 --> 01:54:40,568
