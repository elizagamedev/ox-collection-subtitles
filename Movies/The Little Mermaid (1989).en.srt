1
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,171
lil tell you a tale
of the bottomless blue

2
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,141
And it's, hey to the starboard, heave-ho

3
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,634
Look out, lad
A mermaid be waiting for you

4
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,534
In mysterious fathoms below

5
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:14,657
Isn't this great? The salty sea air,
the wind blowing in your face.

6
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:19,595
- A perfect day to be at sea.
- Oh, yes, delightful.

7
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,834
A fine strong wind
and a following sea.

8
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,184
King Triton must be
in a friendly type mood.

9
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,904
- King Triton?
- Ruler of the Merpeople, lad.

10
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,795
Thought every good sailor
knew about him.

11
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,564
Merpeople.

12
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,958
Eric, pay no attention
to this nautical nonsense.

13
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,806
But it ain't nonsense.
It's the truth.

14
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:46,512
I'm tellin’ ya. Down in the depths
of the ocean they live.

15
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:51,364
In mysterious fathoms below

16
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,635
His Royal Highness, King Triton.

17
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,800
And presenting the distinguished
court composer,

18
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,696
Horatio Felonious Ignacious
Crustaceous Sebastian.

19
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,620
I'm really looking forward
to this performance, Sebastian.

20
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,701
Your Majesty.

21
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,898
This will be the finest concert
l have ever conducted.

22
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,949
Your daughters,
they will be spectacular.

23
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,430
Yes.

24
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,438
- And especially my little Ariel.
- Yes, yes.

25
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,752
She has the most beautiful voice.

26
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,087
If only she'd show up
for rehearsals once in a while.

27
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,662
Ah, we are the daughters of Triton

28
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,878
Great father who loves us
and named us well

29
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,148
Aquata

30
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,888
Andrina

31
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,908
Arista, Attina

32
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,977
Adella, Alana

33
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,027
And then there is the youngest
in her musical debut

34
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,943
Our seventh little sister
We're presenting her to you

35
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,876
To sing a song Sebastian wrote
Her voice is like a belf

36
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,133
She's our sister Ari...

37
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,915
Ariel.

38
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,364
Ariel, wait for me.

39
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,167
Flounder, hurry up.

40
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,132
You know I can't swim that fast.

41
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,662
There it is.

42
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,767
Isn't it fantastic?

43
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:57,246
Yeah, sure. It's great.
Now let's get outta here.

44
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,881
You're not getting cold fins now,
are you?

45
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,837
Who, me? No way.

46
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,832
It's just...
It looks damp in there. Yeah.

47
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,270
And I think l may be
coming down with something.

48
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,487
I got this cough.

49
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,683
All right. I'm going inside.

50
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,092
You can just stay here
and watch for sharks.

51
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,405
OK. Yeah, you go. I'll stay and...

52
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,512
What? Sharks? Ariel.

53
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,712
Ariel, l can't... l mean...

54
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,501
Ariel, help.

55
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,412
- Oh, Flounder.
- Ariel.

56
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,378
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

57
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,547
Flounder, don't be such a guppy.

58
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,556
I'm not a guppy.

59
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:48,311
This is great.
I mean, I really love this.

60
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:53,162
Excitement, adventure,
danger lurking around every corner.

61
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,626
Ariel.

62
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,840
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, sure. No problem. I'm OK.

63
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,496
Oh, my gosh.

64
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,027
Have you ever seen anything
so wonderful in your entire life?

65
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,787
Cool. But what is it?

66
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,058
I don't know, but! bet Scuttle will.

67
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,851
What was that?
Did you hear something?

68
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,572
- [wonder what this one is.
- Ariel?

69
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,702
Flounder, will you relax?

70
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,010
Nothing is going to happen.

71
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,961
Shark. We're gonna die.

72
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,601
Oh, no.

73
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,489
You big bully.

74
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,424
Flounder, you really are a guppy.

75
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,686
lam not.

76
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,157
Fourteen hundred and ninety-two

77
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,268
Scuttle.

78
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:54,444
Mermaid off the port bow.

79
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,428
Ariel, how you doin’, kid?

80
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,222
- What a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.

81
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,322
We were in this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy.

82
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,675
Human stuff, huh?
Hey, let me see.

83
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,025
Look at this.

84
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,531
This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

85
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,434
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

86
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,868
Humans use these little babies

87
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,084
to straighten their hair out.

88
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,593
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and violee.

89
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,701
You got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair

90
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,085
that humans go nuts over.

91
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,194
A dinglehopper.

92
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,036
What about that one?

93
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,598
This I haven't seen in years.

94
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,872
This is wonderful.

95
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:55,821
A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.

96
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,309
Now, the snarfblatt dates back
to prehistorical times

97
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,516
when humans used to sit around

98
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,675
and stare at each other all day.

99
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,868
Got very boring.

100
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,153
So, they invented this snarfblatt
to make fine music.

101
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,798
Allow me.

102
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,457
Music.

103
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,585
- It's stuck.
- Oh, the concert. Oh, my gosh.

104
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,572
- My father's gonna kill me.
- The concert was today?

105
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,948
Maybe you could make
a planter out of it.

106
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,219
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
Thank you, Scuttle.

107
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:31,034
Any time, sweetie. Any time.

108
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,855
Yes, hurry home, Princess.

109
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:54,165
We wouldn't want to miss
old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?

110
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,505
Celebration, indeed.

111
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:03,982
In my day, we had fantastical feasts,

112
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,384
when I lived in the palace.

113
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,390
And now look at me.

114
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,232
Wasted away to practically nothing.

115
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:19,212
Banished and exiled
and practically starving,

116
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:24,199
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

117
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:29,304
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

118
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,919
Flotsam. Jetsam.

119
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,538
l want you to keep an extra close watch

120
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,178
on this pretty little daughter of his.

121
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:42,014
She may be the key
to Triton's undoing.

122
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:50,042
I just don't know what we're going
to do with you, young lady.

123
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,010
I'm sorry. I just forgot.

124
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,208
As a result of your careless behavior...

125
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,157
Careless and reckless behavior.

126
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,319
..the entire celebration was...

127
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,930
Well, it was ruined. That's all.
Completely destroyed.

128
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:07,525
This concert was to be
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.

129
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,603
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom.

130
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,121
But it wasn't her fault.

131
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,097
Well, first, the shark chased us.

132
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,607
Yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...

133
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,617
And we...
And then we were safe.

134
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,395
Then this seagull came, and it was,
"This is this and that is that..."

135
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:35,136
Seagull? What? You went
up to the surface again, didn't you?

136
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,092
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

137
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,178
Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?

138
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,832
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans.

139
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,717
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

140
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,613
Do you think I want to see my daughter
snared by some fish-eater's hook?

141
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,360
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

142
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,049
Don't take that tone of voice with me,
young lady.

143
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,535
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules.

144
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,562
- But if you would just listen...
- Not another word.

145
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,205
And lam never to hear of you
going to the surface again.

146
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,472
Is that clear?

147
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,131
Teenagers.
They think they know everything.

148
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,889
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

149
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,915
Do you think I was too hard on her?

150
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,936
Definitely not.

151
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:37,071
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

152
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,977
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.

153
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,007
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

154
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,853
- You're absolutely right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

155
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,569
- Ariel needs constant supervision.
- Constant.

156
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,452
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

157
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:56,205
- All the time.
- And you are just the crab to do it.

158
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,904
How do I get myself
into these situations?

159
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,184
I should be writing symphonies,

160
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,669
not tagging along
after some headstrong teenager.

161
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,954
What is that girl up to?

162
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,032
Ariel, are you OK?

163
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,173
If only I could
make him understand.

164
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,226
I just don't see things
the way he does.

165
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:03,925
I don't see how a world
that makes such wonderful things

166
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,604
could be bad.

167
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,805
could be bad.

168
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,879
Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat

169
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:13,242
Wouldn't ya think
my collection's complete

170
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,583
Wouldn't ya think I'm the girl

171
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,834
The girl who has everything

172
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,323
Look at this trove
Treasures untold

173
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,689
How many wonders
can one cavern hold?

174
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,500
Lookin' around here you'd think

175
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:32,795
Sure, she's got everything

176
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,165
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty

177
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:40,096
I've got whozits and whaizits galore

178
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,949
You want thingamabobs

179
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:48,197

181
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,814

00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,895
wanna see
Wanna see ‘em dancin’

183
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,363
Walkin' around on those...

184
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,858
What do ya call 'em? Oh, feet.

185
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,466
Flippin’ your fins you don't get too far

186
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,012
Legs are required for jumpin’, dancin'

187
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,380
Strollin' along down a...

188
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,382
What's that word again?

189
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,021
Street

190
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:27,382
Up where they walk
Up where they run

191
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,710
Up where they stay all day in the sun

192
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,497
Wanderin' free
Wish I could be

193
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,717
Part of that world

194
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,444
What would I give if l could live

195
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,017
Out of these waters?

196
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,330
What would I pay to spend a day

197
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,677
Warm on the sand?

198
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,723
Betcha on land they understand

199
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:58,156
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters

200
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,684
Bright young women sick of swimmin'

201
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,904
Ready to stand

202
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,996
And ready to know what the people know

203
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,691
Ask ‘em my questions
and get some answers

204
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,451
What's a fire and why does it...

205
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,297
What's the word?

206
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,351
Burn?

207
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:25,013
When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love

208
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:30,675
Love to explore that shore up above?

209
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,822
Out of the sea

210
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,603
Wish I could be

211
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,561
Part of that

212
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,931
World

213
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,708
Sebastian.

214
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:19,124
Ariel, what are you...
How could you... What is all this?

215
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,769
It's just my collection.

216
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,959
Oh, I see.

217
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,595
Your collection.
If your father knew about this place...

218
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,993
You're not gonna tell him,
are you?

219
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,502
Please, Sebastian,
he would never understand.

220
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,421
Ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.

221
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:43,706
Come with me. I'll take you home
and get you something warm to drink.

222
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,840
- What do you suppose...
- Ariel?

223
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,848
Ariel?

224
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,225
Ariel, what are you...

225
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,861
Jumpin’ jellyfish.

226
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:13,405
Ariel? Ariel.
Please. Come back.

227
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,475
Max. Here, boy.

228
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,619
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin’, huh, Max?

229
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,716
Come on, Max.

230
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,188
Good boy.

231
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,174
Hey there, sweetie.
Quite a show, eh?

232
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,791
Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you.

233
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,203
I got ya.

234
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,866
We're bein’ intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover.

235
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,903
I've never seen a human
this close before.

236
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,242
He's very handsome, isn't he?

237
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,659
I don't know. He looks kind of hairy
and slobbery to me.

238
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,716
Not that one.

239
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,792
The one playing the snarfblatt.

240
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,614
Silence.

241
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,593
It is now my honor and privilege

242
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,037
to present our esteemed Prince Eric

243
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,753
with a very special, very expensive,

244
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,613
very large birthday present.

245
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,226
Grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.

246
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,366
I know.

247
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,154
Happy birthday, Eric.

248
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,936
Gee, Grim.

249
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,382
It's really somethin’.

250
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,629
Yes, I commissioned it myself.

251
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,456
Of course, I had hoped
it would be a wedding present.

252
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,128
Come on, Grim. Don't start.

253
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:32,207
You're not still sore because I didn't
fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?

254
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,692
Oh, my.
Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.

255
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,032
The entire kingdom wants to see you

256
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,404
happily settled down
with the right girl.

257
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:45,301
She's out there somewhere.
I just...

258
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,588
I just haven't found her yet.

259
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,776
Perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.

260
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,582
Believe me, Grim,
when I find her, I'll know.

261
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,109
Without a doubt, it'll just,
bam, hit me, like lightning.

262
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,973
Hurricane a-comin’.

263
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,939
Stand fast. Secure the riggin’.

264
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,576
The wind's all of a sudden
on the move here.

265
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,822
Ariel.

266
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,946
Look out.

267
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,377
Grim. Hang on.

268
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:32,784
Max.

269
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:53,111
Jump, Max. Come on, boy. Jump.
You can do it, Max.

270
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,161
Eric.

271
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,822
Is he dead?

272
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,070
It's hard to say.

273
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,877
I can't make out a heartbeat.

274
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,080
No, look. He's breathing.

275
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,752
He's so beautiful.

276
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,529
What would I give
to live where you are?

277
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,657
What would I pay
to stay here beside you?

278
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:22,254
What would I do
to see you smiling at me?

279
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:26,524
Where would we walk
Where would we run

280
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,279
If we could stay all day in the sun?

281
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:34,546
Just you and me and! could be

282
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:38,704
Part of your world

283
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,750
Eric? Eric.

284
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,254
You really delight
in these sadistic strains

285
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,638
on my blood pressure, don't you?

286
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,904
A girl rescued me.

287
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,767
She was singing.

288
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,664
She had the most beautiful voice.

289
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:06,855
Eric, I think you've swallowed
a bit too much seawater.

290
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:10,653
Off we go. Come along, Max.

291
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,750
We just gonna forget
this whole thing ever happened.

292
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,013
The sea king will never know.

293
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,531
You won't tell him. I won't tell him.
I will stay in one piece.

294
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,600
} don't know when
! don't know how

295
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:31,795
But I know something's
starting right now

296
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,494
Watch and you'll see

297
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,831
Some day I'll be

298
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,438
Part of your

299
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,050
World

300
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:01,566
Oh, no. I can't stand it. It's too easy.

301
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,374
The child is in love with a human.

302
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,784
And not just any human. A prince.

303
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,182
Her daddy will love that.

304
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,442
King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl

305
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:21,592
would make a charming addition
to my little garden.

306
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,098
Ariel dear, time to come out.

307
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,305
You've been in there all morning.

308
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:44,506
What is with her lately?

309
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,821
- Morning, Daddy.
- Well.

310
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,092
- She's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?

311
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:04,081
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.

312
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,273
Ariel? In love?

313
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,164
OK. So far, so good.

314
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:14,337
I don't think the king knows.

315
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,862
But it will not be easy keeping
something like this a secret for long.

316
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:23,396
He loves me.

317
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,881
He loves me not.

318
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,258
He loves me.

319
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,423
I knew it.

320
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,509
Ariel, stop talking crazy.

321
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,981
I gotta see him again tonight.

322
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,927
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
- Ariel, please.

323
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,570
Get your head out of the clouds
and back in the water where it belongs.

324
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,717
I'll swim up to his castle, Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.

325
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,461
Down here is your home.

326
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:48,893
Ariel, listen to me.

327
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,914
Ariel, listen to me.

328
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,963
The human world, it's a mess.

329
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:57,515
Life under the sea is better
than anything they got up there.

330
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,510
The seaweed is always greener
in somebody else's lake

331
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,165
You dream about going up there

332
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,790
But that is a big mistake

333
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,080
Just look at the world around you

334
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,524
Right here on the ocean floor

335
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,964
Such wonderful things around you

336
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,540
What more is you lookin' for?

337
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:22,053
Under the sea
Under the sea

338
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,803
Darling, it's better
down where it's wetter

339
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,973
Take it from me

340
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,408
Up on the shore they work all day

341
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,518
Out in the sun they slave away

342
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:36,087
While we devoting full time
to floating under the sea

343
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,218
Down here all the fish is happy

344
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,827
As off through the waves they roll, yeah

345
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,917
The fish on the land ain't happy

346
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,649
They sad ‘cause they in the bow!

347
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,275
But fish in the bowl is lucky

348
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,527
They in for a worser fate

349
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,030
One day when the boss get hungry

350
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,096
Guess who's gonna be on the plate

351
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,328
Oh, no.

352
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,841
Under the sea
Under the sea

353
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,999
Nobody beat us, fry us
and eat us in fricassee

354
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,680
We what the land folks loves to cook

355
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,187
Under the sea we off the hook

356
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,736
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles

357
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,895
- Under the sea
- Under the sea

358
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,947
- Under the sea
- Under the sea

359
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,592
Since life is sweet here
we got the beat here

360
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,509
- Naturally
- Naturally

361
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,445
Even the sturgeon and the ray

362
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,947
They get the urge and start to play

363
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,750
We got the spirit,
you got to hear it, under the sea

364
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,425
The newt play the fiute
The carp play the harp

365
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,850
The plaice play the bass
and they soundin' sharp

366
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,346
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub

367
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,759
The fluke is the duke of soul

368
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:48,101
The ray, he can play
The ling's on the strings

369
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,437
The trout's rocking out
The blackfish, she sings

370
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,002
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at

371
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,725
And, oh, that blowfish blow

372
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,572
- Yeah, under the sea
- Under the sea

373
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,222
- Under the sea
- Under the sea

374
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,365
When the sardine begin the beguine

375
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,357
- It's music to me
- Music it is to me

376
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,264
What do they got?
A lot of sand

377
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,622
We got a hot crustacean band

378
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:40,031
Each little clam here
know how to jam here under the sea

379
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:44,795
Each little slug here
cutting a rug here under the sea

380
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,577
Each little snail here
know how to wail here

381
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,929
That's why it's hotter
under the water

382
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,385
We are, we in luck here
down in the muck here

383
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,914
Under the sea

384
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,003
Ariel?

385
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,465
Somebody's got to nail
that girl's fins to the floor.

386
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,241
Sebastian.

387
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,184
Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

388
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,350
An urgent message from the sea king.

389
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,572
The sea king?

390
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:25,977
He wants to see you rightaway.
Something about Ariel.

391
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,969
He knows.

392
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,449
Let's see now.

393
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,944
Who could the lucky merman be?

394
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,166
Come in, Sebastian.

395
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,490
I mustn't overreact. 1 must remain calm.

396
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,537
Yes?

397
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,606
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.

398
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,822
I'm concerned about Ariel.

399
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,212
Have you noticed
she's been acting peculiar lately?

400
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,247
- Peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

401
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:16,037
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

402
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,370
You haven't noticed?

403
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,187
Oh, well, I...

404
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,350
Sebastian?

405
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:29,497
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

406
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,485
Keeping something?

407
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,155
About Ariel?

408
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,436
- Ariel?
- In love?

409
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:46,965
I tried to stop her, sir.
She wouldn't listen.

410
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,276
I told her to stay away from humans.
They are bad.

411
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:54,889
- They are trouble.
- Humans? What about humans?

412
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,284
Humans?

413
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,600
Who said anything about humans?

414
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:07,456
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

415
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,223
You'll see. It's a surprise.

416
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,960
Oh, Flounder.

417
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,068
Flounder, you're the best.

418
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,370
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

419
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,616
Why, Eric, run away with you?

420
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,460
This is all so sudden.

421
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,969
Daddy?

422
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,979
Il consider myself
a reasonable merman.

423
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,266
I set certain rules.

424
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:50,625
- l expect those rules to be obeyed.
- But, Dad, I...

425
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,125
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?

426
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,959
- [had to...
- Contact between the human world

427
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,969
and the mer world is forbidden.

428
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,794
Ariel, you know that.
Everyone knows that.

429
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,267
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

430
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,759
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

431
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,826
I don't have to know him.
They're all the same.

432
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,736
Spineless, savage, harpooning
fish-eaters incapable of any feeling.

433
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,150
Daddy, I love him.

434
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,973
No. Have you lost
your senses completely?

435
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,304
He's a human.
You're a mermaid.

436
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,933
I don't care.

437
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:29,821
So help me, Ariel,
lam going to get through to you.

438
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:33,795
And if this is the only way,
so be it.

439
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,488
Daddy. No.

440
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,184
No. Please.

441
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,824
Daddy, stop. Daddy, stop it.

442
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,944
Daddy, no.

443
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,439
Ariel, l...

444
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,791
Just go away.

445
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,179
Poor child.

446
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,777
Poor, sweet child.

447
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:47,297
She has a very serious problem.

448
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:51,002
If only there were
something we could do.

449
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:54,056
But there is something.

450
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,297
Who...

451
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,066
- Who are you?
- Don't be scared.

452
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,359
We represent someone
who can help you.

453
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:09,303
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

454
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,744
Just imagine.

455
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,843
You and your prince.

456
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,265
Together forever.

457
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,468
I don't understand.

458
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:24,901
Ursula has great powers.

459
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,348
The sea witch?

460
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,584
Why, that's... l couldn't possibly.

461
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:35,741
No. Get out of here.
Leave me alone.

462
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,967
Suit yourself.

463
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,324
That was only a suggestion.

464
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:56,404
- Wait.
- Yes?

465
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,929
- Poor Ariel.
- didn't mean to tell.

466
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,456
It was an accident.

467
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,666
Ariel? Where are you going?

468
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,295
What are you doing here
with this riffraff?

469
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,357
I'm going to see Ursula.

470
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,387
Ariel, no. No.
She's a demon. She's a monster.

471
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,047
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

472
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,314
But I...

473
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,177
Come on.

474
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,311
This way.

475
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:03,154
Come in, my child.

476
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,821
We mustn't lurk in doorways.

477
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,637
It's rude.

478
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,597
One might question your upbringing.

479
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,239
Now, then, you're here

480
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:22,015
because you have a thing
for this human, this prince fellow.

481
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:27,614
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

482
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:33,146
Well, angelfish, the solution
to your problem is simple.

483
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:41,007
The only way to get what you want
is to become a human yourself.

484
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,119
Can you do that?

485
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:49,122
My dear, sweet child.
That's what I do.

486
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,567
It's what I live for.

487
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,640
To help unfortunate merfolk,
like yourself,

488
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,446
poor souls with no one else to turn to.

489
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,537
! admit that in the past
I've been a nasty

490
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,256
They weren't kidding
when they called me, well, a witch

491
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,703
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways

492
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,317
Repented, seen the light
and made a switch

493
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,730
True? Yes.

494
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,422
And I fortunately know a little magic

495
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,703
It's a talent that
l always have possessed

496
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,226
And here lately, please don't laugh,
l use it on behalf

497
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,276
Of the miserable, lonely and depressed

498
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,656
Pathetic.

499
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,718
Poor unfortunate souls

500
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,948
In pain, in need

501
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:41,775
This one longing to be thinner

502
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,350
That one wants to get the girl

503
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,328
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed

504
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:51,937
Those poor, unfortunate souls
So sad, so true

505
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,117
They come flocking to my cauldron

506
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:55,721
Crying spells, Ursula, please

507
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,974
And I help them
Yes, I do

508
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,256
Now it's happened once or twice

509
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,395
Someone couldn't pay the price

510
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:07,388
And I'm afraid
! had to rake 'em across the coals

511
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,926
Yes, I've had the odd complaint

512
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:13,308
But on the whole I've been a saint

513
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:18,225
To those poor unfortunate souls

514
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,690
Now, here's the deal.

515
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:25,582
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

516
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,534
Got that? Three days.

517
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,350
Now, listen, this is important.

518
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,836
Before the sun sets
on the third day,

519
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:38,092
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

520
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,246
That is, he's got to kiss you.

521
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:46,466
Not just any kiss,
the kiss of true love.

522
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:50,485
If he does kiss you
before the sun sets on the third day,

523
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:54,485
you'll remain human permanently.

524
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:58,083
But if he doesn't,
you'll turn back into a mermaid

525
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:02,253
and you belong to me.

526
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:05,276
No, Ariel.

527
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,770
Have we got a deal?

528
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,116
If l become human,

529
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,890
I'll never be
with my father or sisters again.

530
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,317
That's right.

531
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,536
But you'll have your man.

532
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:23,885
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?

533
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,060
Oh, and there is one more thing.

534
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,898
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.

535
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,064
You can't get something for nothing.

536
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,556
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.

537
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:41,582
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

538
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,060
What I want from you is your voice.

539
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:50,392
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.

540
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:54,058
No more talking, singing. Zip.

541
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,322
But without my voice, how can I...

542
00:42:56,641 --> 00:43:00,041
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.

543
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:05,188
And don't underestimate
the importance of body language.

544
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,301
The men up there
don't like a lot of blabber

545
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,970
They think a girl who gossips is a bore

546
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,726
On land it's much preferred
for ladies not to say a word

547
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:17,316
And, after all, dear
What is idle prattle for?

548
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,805
Come on.

549
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,550
They're not all that impressed
with conversation

550
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,276
True gentlemen avoid it
when they can

551
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,009
But they dote and swoon and fawn

552
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,670
On a lady who's withdrawn

553
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,019
It's she who holds her tongue
who gets her man

554
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,774
Come on,
you poor unfortunate soul

555
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:36,892
Go ahead, make your choice

556
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,805
I'ma very busy woman
and I haven't got all day

557
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,877
lt won't cost much
Just your voice

558
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,341
Ya poor, unfortunate soul

559
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,240
It's sad, but true

560
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,849
If you want to cross a bridge,
my sweet, you've got to pay the toll

561
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:54,098
Take a gulp and take a breath
and go ahead and sign the scroll

562
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,492
Flotsam, Jetsam
Now I've got her, boys

563
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,111
The boss is on a roll

564
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,397
This poor, unfortunate

565
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:08,638
Soul

566
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,275
Beluga, sevruga

567
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:16,390
Come, winds of the Caspian Sea

568
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,178
Larynxis, glossitis
Et max laryngitis

569
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,761
La voce to me

570
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:26,312
Now, sing.

571
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,920
Keep singing.

572
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:39,189
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.

573
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:43,350
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?

574
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:07,087
Well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.

575
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:10,146
Look at ya.

576
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:13,368
There's somethin’ different.
Don't tell me.

577
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:16,238
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?

578
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:18,451
You've been usin' the dinglehopper.

579
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,298
No? Well, let me see.

580
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,531
New seashells?

581
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,020
No new seashells.

582
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,636
I gotta admit
I can't put my foot on it right now.

583
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,712
- If l stand here long enough...
- She's got legs, you idiot.

584
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:38,028
She traded her voice to the sea witch
and got legs. Geez, man.

585
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,939
I knew that.

586
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:41,897
Ariel's been turned into a human.

587
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,979
She'll make the prince fall in love
with her, and he's gotta kiss her.

588
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,850
And she's only got three days.

589
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,059
Just look at her.

590
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,957
On legs. On human legs.

591
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:00,417
My nerves are shot.
This is a catastrophe.

592
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:03,465
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what he'd say.

593
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:06,788
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab.
That's what he'd say.

594
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:09,808
I'm gonna march meself
straight home right now

595
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,567
and tell him like 1 should have done
the minute...

596
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,953
And don't you shake your head
at me, young lady.

597
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:18,214
Maybe there's still time.

598
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:21,056
If we could get that witch
to give you back your voice,

599
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:24,432
you could go home
with all the normal fish and just be...

600
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,110
just be...

601
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:33,112
just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

602
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,476
All right, all right.

603
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:42,462
I'll try to help ya find that prince.

604
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,540
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.

605
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:51,914
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.

606
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:56,238
If you wanna be a human, the first thing
ya gotta do is dress like one.

607
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,941
Max? What?

608
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:09,911
What? Max.

609
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,095
Ya look great, kid.
Ya look sensational.

610
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,055
Max.

611
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,582
Max.

612
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,062
Quiet, Max.

613
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,726
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.

614
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,633
Oh, I see.

615
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:44,637
Are you OK, miss?

616
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,005
I'm sorry if this knucklehead
scared you.

617
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,288
He's harmless really.

618
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:55,781
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

619
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:02,726
We have met. I knew it.
You're the one I've been looking for.

620
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,357
What's your name?

621
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,900
What's wrong? What is it?

622
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,698
You can't speak?

623
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,970
Then you couldn't be who I thought.

624
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:25,673
What is it? You're hurt?

625
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,570
No. You need help?

626
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,343
Careful. Careful, easy.

627
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,420
You must have
really been through something.

628
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,770
Don't worry. I'll help you.

629
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,808
Come on. You'll be OK.

630
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,402
Washed up from a shipwreck.

631
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:53,636
The poor thing.

632
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,828
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.

633
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,596
I'll just get this washed for you.

634
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:10,361
You must have at least
heard about this girl.

635
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,408
- No.
- Gertrude says...

636
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,750
When has Gertrude
ever gotten anything right?

637
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:17,946
- Really.
- Madam, please...

638
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:21,269
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.

639
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,592
If Eric's looking for a girl,

640
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:26,941
I know a couple of
highly available ones right here.

641
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:39,702
Eric, be reasonable.

642
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,403
Eric, be reasonable.

643
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:46,275
Nice young ladies just don't swim around
rescuing people in the ocean

644
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,727
and then flitter off into oblivion.

645
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,006
I'm tellin’ ya, Grim.
She was real.

646
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,278
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

647
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,582
Come on, honey. Don't be shy.

648
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,146
Eric, isn't she a vision?

649
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,307
You look wonderful.

650
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,540
Come, come. You must be famished.
Let me help you, my dear.

651
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:19,251
There we go. That's better.

652
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,950
Now, quite comfy? Good.

653
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,990
It's not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

654
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:44,095
Do you like it? It is rather a fine one.

655
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,903
Oh, my.

656
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,815
Sorry, Grim.

657
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:54,207
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

658
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,095
Very amusing.

659
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,441
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?

660
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:04,442
You're gonna love it. Chef's been fixing
his speciality: stuffed crab.

661
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:10,060
Nouvelle cuisine

662
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,227
,
Les Champs-Elysées

663
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,599
Maurice Chevalier

664
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:20,622
Les poissons, les poissons

665
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:22,648
How I love les poissons

666
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,870
Love to chop and to serve little fish

667
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:29,533
First l cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones

668
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:33,037
Mais oui, ¢a c'est toujours delish

669
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,267
Les poissons, les poissons

670
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,114
With the cleaver I hack them in two

671
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:43,221
! pull out what's inside
and I serve it up fried

672
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,561
‘Cause I love little fishes
Don't you?

673
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:50,191
Here's something for tempting the palate

674
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,661
Prepared in the classic technique

675
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,073
First you pound the fish flat
with the mallet

676
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,703
Then you slash through the skin,
give the belly a slice

677
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,790
Then you rub some salt in

678
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,359
‘Cause that makes it taste nice

679
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,228
l have missed one.

680
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:12,491
Sacrebleu
What is this

681
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:14,133
How on earth could! miss

682
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,231
Such a sweet, little succulent crab?

683
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,155
Quel dommage
What a loss

684
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,690
Here we go, in the sauce

685
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,511
Now some flour
I think just a dab

686
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,774
Now I'll stuff you with bread

687
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:29,853
It don't hurt ‘cause you're dead
and you're certainly lucky you are

688
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,841
‘Cause it's gonna be hot
in my big silver pot

689
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:36,283
Toodle-oo
Mon poisson, au revoir

690
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,150
What is this?

691
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:19,736
I think I'd better go see
what Louis is up to.

692
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:25,866
Come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man.

693
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,710
Louis.

694
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:33,519
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was just...

695
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,604
I'm sorry, madame.

696
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:41,089
You know, Eric,
perhaps our young guest might enjoy

697
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:43,792
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.

698
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:45,881
Something in the way of a tour.

699
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,967
I'm sorry, Grim. What was that?

700
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,006
You can't spend your time moping about.
You need to get out.

701
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,386
Do something. Have a life.

702
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:56,424
- Get your mind off...
- Easy, Grim.

703
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:59,567
It's not a bad idea,
if she's interested.

704
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,230
Well, what do ya say?

705
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,185
Would you like to join me
on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

706
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:09,175
Wonderful. Now, let's eat
before this crab wanders off my plate.

707
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,066
Come here, boy.

708
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,817
This has got to be, without a doubt,

709
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:44,220
the single most humiliating day
of my life.

710
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:49,672
l hope that you appreciate
what I go through for you, young lady.

711
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,920
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

712
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:58,931
Tomorrow when he takes you
for that ride, you gotta look your best.

713
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:03,673
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.

714
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:08,921
You gotta pucker up your lips,
like this.

715
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:24,240
You are hopeless, child.
You know that?

716
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,138
Completely hopeless.

717
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,324
Any sign of them?

718
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,281
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.

719
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,662
We've found no trace
of your daughter or Sebastian.

720
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:48,855
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned,
no coral unexplored.

721
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:53,098
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

722
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:55,427
Yes, sire.

723
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:00,032
What have I done?

724
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:29,033
- Has he kissed her yet?
- Not yet.

725
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:36,912
Judy.

726
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,317
Yo. Flounder. Any kissing?

727
00:57:56,707 --> 00:57:58,877
No, not yet.

728
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,382
Well, they'd better get crackin’.

729
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:34,037
Move over. Move your big feathers.
I can't see a thing.

730
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:37,391
Nothing is happening.

731
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:42,478
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

732
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:47,846
OK. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.

733
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,510
Stand back.

734
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:02,392
Somebody should find that poor animal
and put it out of its misery.

735
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:12,226
Geez, man.
I'm surrounded by amateurs.

736
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:18,028
You want something done
you've got to do it yourself.

737
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:23,035
First we got to create the mood.

738
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,477
Percussion.

739
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,149
Strings. Winds.

740
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,687
Words.

741
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:35,586
There you see her

742
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:38,846
Sitting there across the way

743
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,419
She don't got a lot to say

744
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:45,408
But there's something about her

745
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,971
And you don't know why
but you're dyin’ to try

746
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,183
You wanna kiss the girl

747
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:53,857
Did you hear something?

748
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,687
Yes, you want her

749
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,314
Look at her
You know you do

750
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,531
Possible she want you too

751
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:06,553
There is one way to ask her

752
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:08,977
It don't take a word

753
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:12,996
Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl

754
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:14,917
Sing with me now.

755
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,728
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
My, oh, my

756
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:21,898
Look like the boy too shy
He ain't gonna kiss the girl

757
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:24,915
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Ain't that sad?

758
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:26,662
Ain't ita shame?

759
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:30,493
Too bad he gonna miss the girl

760
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:32,991
l feel really bad not knowing your name.

761
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,840
Maybe I could guess. Is it Mildred?

762
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,735
OK, no.

763
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,761
How about Diana? Rachel?

764
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:47,747
- Ariel. Her name is Ariel.
- Ariel?

765
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,061
Ariel?

766
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,308
That's kind of pretty.
OK. Ariel.

767
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:58,986
Now's your moment

768
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,419
Floating in a blue lagoon

769
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:05,143
Boy, you better do it soon

770
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:07,579
No time will be better

771
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,022
She don't say a word

772
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:14,811
And she won't say a word
until ya kiss the girl

773
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:20,310
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't be scared

774
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:24,310
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl

775
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,071
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't stop now

776
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,520
Don't try to hide it how
you wanna kiss the girl

777
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,412
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Float along

778
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:36,428
And listen to the song

779
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:38,746
Song say kiss the girl

780
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:41,785
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Music play

781
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:45,221
Do what the music say
You gotta kiss the girl

782
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,759
Kiss the girl

783
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,059
- Why don't you
- Kiss the girl?

784
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:56,800
Go on and kiss the girl

785
01:01:57,314 --> 01:02:00,944
- Go on and...
- Kiss the girl

786
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:07,098
Hang on, I've got ya.

787
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,727
Nice work, boys.
That was a close one. Too close.

788
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,888
Nice work, boys.
That was a close one. Too close.

789
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,908
The little tramp.
She's better than I thought.

790
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:24,099
Well, at this rate, he'll be kissing her
by sunset for sure.

791
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:28,938
Well, it's time Ursula took matters
into her own tentacles.

792
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,619
Triton's daughter will be mine.
And then I'll make him writhe.

793
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:37,211
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook.

794
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:01,308
Eric? If l may say,

795
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,408
far better than any dream girl
is one of flesh and blood,

796
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:10,582
one warm and caring
and right before your eyes.

797
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,118
Ariel.

798
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,310
Ariel, wake up.
I just heard the news. Congratulations.

799
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:09,751
Kiddo, we did it.

800
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:13,377
What is this idiot babbling about?

801
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,243
Right, as if you two didn't know.

802
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:21,343
The whole town's buzzin' about the
prince gettin’ hitched this afternoon.

803
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,048
You know, he's getting married.

804
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:27,993
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.

805
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:31,085
I'll catch ya later.
I wouldn't miss it.

806
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:48,515
Well, now, Eric.

807
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:51,068
It appears that l was mistaken.

808
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:55,934
This mystery maiden of yours
does, in fact, exist.

809
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,146
And she is lovely.

810
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,702
Congratulations, my dear.

811
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:04,585
We wish to be married
as soon as possible.

812
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:08,541
Yes, of course, Eric,
but these things do take time, you know.

813
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:12,355
This afternoon, Grimsby.
The wedding ship departs at sunset.

814
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:17,477
Very well, Eric, as you wish.

815
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,725
What a lovely little bride I'll make

816
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,654
My dear, I'll look divine

817
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:27,345
Things are working out
according to my ultimate design

818
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:31,149
Soon I'll have that little mermaid

819
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:35,768
And the ocean will be mine

820
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:44,283
The sea witch. Oh, no.
She's gonna... gotta...

821
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:47,092
Ariel.

822
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:50,057
Ariel.

823
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:54,427
Ariel, was flying.
Of course, I was flying.

824
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,763
l saw the watch.

825
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:00,234
The witch was watching the mirror,

826
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,103
and she was singin’
with a stolen set of pipes.

827
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,950
Do you hear what I'm tellin’ you?

828
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:11,046
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise.

829
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:14,631
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?

830
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:16,848
I mean, when it's important?

831
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,356
What are we gonna do?

832
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:24,455
Before the sun sets on the third day.

833
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:32,914
Ariel, grab onto that.

834
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:36,238
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.

835
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,029
I'l try.

836
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:40,978
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.

837
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,234
- What about me? What about me?
- You.

838
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,520
Find a way to stall that wedding.

839
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:48,696
Stall the wedding. What am I?

840
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,428
What? That's it.

841
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:04,927
Move it. Let's go.
We got an emergency here.

842
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,160
Dearly beloved...

843
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:24,309
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.

844
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,567
We're almost there.

845
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:30,299
Yes, do you, Eric, take Vanessa...

846
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,680
to be your lawfully wedded wife

847
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,423
for as long as you both shall live?

848
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:38,743
Ido.

849
01:08:39,082 --> 01:08:40,832
It being... And do you...

850
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:02,866
- Then by the power vested in me...
- Get away from me, you slimy...

851
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:18,727
Why, you little...

852
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,760
- Ariel?
- Eric.

853
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,910
You can talk?

854
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,830
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

855
01:09:51,386 --> 01:09:54,456
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, l wanted to tell you.

856
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,707
Eric, no.

857
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,144
You're too late.

858
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,742
You're too late.

859
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,151
So long, lover boy.

860
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,440
- Ariel.
- Poor little princess.

861
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:20,494
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...

862
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:22,697
Ursula, stop.

863
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:28,947
Why, King Triton. How are you?

864
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:32,789
- Let her go.
- Not a chance. She's mine now.

865
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:36,106
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry.

866
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:39,586
I didn't mean to. I didn't know.

867
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:44,579
You see?

868
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,737
The contract's legal, binding
and completely unbreakable,

869
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:49,961
even for you.

870
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:55,079
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

871
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,808
The daughter of the great sea king

872
01:10:58,154 --> 01:11:00,814
is a very precious commodity.

873
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,946
But I might be willing
to make an exchange

874
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:08,988
for someone even better.

875
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:11,082
Eric, what are you doing?

876
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:14,617
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again.

877
01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:19,178
Now, do we have a deal?

878
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,240
It's done then.

879
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:30,221
No.

880
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:40,865
Your Majesty.

881
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:42,307
Daddy.

882
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:46,482
- At last, it's mine.
- No.

883
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:53,244
You.

884
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:54,559
You monster.

885
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:56,777
Don't fool with me, ya little brat.

886
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,659
Contract or no, I'll blast...

887
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,362
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric. Eric, look out.

888
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:04,452
After him.

889
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:12,934
Come on.

890
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:21,401
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.

891
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:30,702
Babies. My poor little poopsies.

892
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,880
- Eric, you've gotta get away from here.
- No, I won't leave you.

893
01:13:04,647 --> 01:13:08,307
You pitiful, insignificant fools.

894
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,615
Look out.

895
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,197
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean.

896
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:18,815
The waves obey my every whim.

897
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:21,138
Eric.

898
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:28,509
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power.

899
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:50,207
Eric.

900
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:27,213
So much for true love.

901
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:28,624
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

902
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:34,536
Well, it's like l always say,
Your Majesty,

903
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:39,523
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

904
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,902
You always say that?

905
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:48,952
Then I guess
there's just one problem left.

906
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:51,282
And what's that, Your Majesty?

907
01:15:51,614 --> 01:15:54,803
How much I'm going to miss her.

908
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,092
Yes.

909
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:09,994
Thank you.

910
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:21,629
Il love you, Daddy.

911
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:25,714
Now we can walk
Now we can run

912
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:31,028
Now we can stay aif day in the sun

913
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:36,781
Just you and me

914
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:41,256
And ican be

915
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:45,667
Part of your world
