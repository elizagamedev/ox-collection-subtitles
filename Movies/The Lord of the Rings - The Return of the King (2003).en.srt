1
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,012
Sméagol!

2
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,401
I've got one!

3
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,060
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,202
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,404
Déagol!

6
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,663
Déagol?

7
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,384
Déagol.

8
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,289
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,622
Why?

10
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,841
Because...

11
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,597
. it's my birthday and ! wants it.

12
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:38,971
My precious.

13
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,704
They cursed us.

14
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,453
Murderer.

15
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,962
"Murderer" they called us.

16
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:58,617
They cursed us
and drove us away.

17
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,757
Gollum.

18
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,655
Gollum.

19
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,770
Gollum.

20
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,173
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,876
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,224
--and cool
So nice for feet

23
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,530
And we only wish
To catch a fish

24
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,098
So juicy sweet

25
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,870
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,735
...the sound of trees...

27
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,889
...the softness of the wind.

28
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,896
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:09,293
My precious.

30
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,373
Wake up!

31
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,144
Wake up!

32
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,039
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,061
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,796
We must go at once.

35
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,386
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,221
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,459
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,164
No.

39
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,212
It isn't.

40
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,271
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,094
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,584
Come on!

43
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,282
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,808
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,784
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,052
Here.

47
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,960
What about you?

48
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,339
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,549
Sam.

50
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,630
All right.

51
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,182
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,211
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,279
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,062
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,198
There should be enough.

56
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,625
For what?

57
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,998
The journey home.

58
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,103
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,428
Very close now.

60
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,666
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,570
No safe places here.

62
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,966
Hurry.

63
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,117
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon...

64
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,737
... after a hard day's work.

65
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,230
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

66
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,534
Welcome, my lords...

67
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,098
...to Isengard!

68
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,023
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

69
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:19,037
...and now we find you feasting
and...and smoking!

70
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,628
We are sitting
on a field of victory...

71
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,259
... enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

72
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,130
The salted pork is particularly good.

73
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,212
Salted pork?

74
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,675
-Hobbits.
-We're under orders from Treebeard...

75
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,829
... who's taken over management
of Isengard.

76
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,321
Young Master Gandalf.

77
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,920
I'm glad you've come.

78
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,522
Wood and water, stock and stone
l can master.

79
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,382
But there is a wizard to manage here...

80
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,744
... locked in his tower.

81
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:07,003
And there Saruman must remain
under your guard, Treebeard.

82
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,600
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

83
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,815
No.

84
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,919
He has no power anymore.

85
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,835
The filth of Saruman...

86
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,849
.1S washing away.

87
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:27,463
Trees will come back to live here.

88
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,420
Young trees.

89
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,817
-Wild trees.
-Pippin!

90
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,435
Bless my bark!

91
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,574
Peregrin Took!

92
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,223
I'll take that, my lad.

93
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,411
Quickly, now.

94
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:34,271
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

95
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,401
Hail the victorious dead.

96
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,133
Hail!

97
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,603
lam happy for you.

98
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,318
He is an honorable man.

99
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,185
You are both honorable men.

100
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:41,006
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

101
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,468
Don't listen to me.

102
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,838
You are young.

103
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,840
And tonight is for you.

104
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:00,335
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

105
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,567
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

106
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:09,081
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

107
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,212
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon

108
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,632
But the only brew for the brave and true

109
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,590
Comes from The Green Dragon

110
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,468
Thank you! I win!

111
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,423
No news of Frodo?

112
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,972
No word. Nothing.

113
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,140
We have time.

114
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,814
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

115
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,790
Do we know that?

116
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,546
What does your heart tell you?

117
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,592
That Frodo is alive.

118
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,920
Yes.

119
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,114
Yes, he's alive.

120
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,403
Too risky. Too risky.

121
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,023
Thieves.

122
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,127
They stole it from us.

123
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,390
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

124
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,612
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

125
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,345
Mustn't ruin it now.

126
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,637
But they knows.

127
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,703
They knows.

128
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,409
They suspects us.

129
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,069
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

130
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,806
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

131
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,054
No. Not.

132
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:51,233
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

133
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:56,168
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

134
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,143
And we will.

135
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,135
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

136
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,276
It's ours!

137
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,109
Ours!

138
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,126
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

139
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,662
Patience! Patience, my love.

140
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:24,086
First we must lead them to her.

141
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,875
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

142
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,996
Yes, the stairs. And then?

143
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,123
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

144
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:42,312
...until we come to the tunnel.

145
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,219
And when they go in...

146
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,266
..there's no coming out.

147
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,030
She's always hungry.

148
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,836
She always needs to feed.

149
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,778
She must eat.

150
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,892
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

151
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,751
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

152
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,068
No.

153
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:11,653
Not very nice at all, my love.

154
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,858
She hungers for sweeter meats.

155
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,977
Hobbit meat.

156
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,619
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

157
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,065
.. then we will find it.

158
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:29,455
And take it for me!

159
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,977
For us.

160
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,249
Yes. We meant "for us."

161
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,861
Gollum. Gollum.

162
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,409
The precious will be ours...

163
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:49,081
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

164
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,399
You treacherous little toad!

165
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,360
No! No! Master!

166
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,178
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

167
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,591
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

168
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,711
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

169
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,000
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

170
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,859
..who hates Sméagol...

171
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,714
...and who makes up nasty lies.

172
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,507
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

173
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,370
Sam!

174
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,918
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

175
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,649
-You scare him off, we're lost!
-! don't care! 1 can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

176
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,026
-! won't wait around for him to kill us!
-I'm not sending him away.

177
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,149
You don't see it, do you?

178
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,775
He's a villain.

179
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,141
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

180
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,967
l need you on my side.

181
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,139
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

182
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,535
I know, Sam. I know.

183
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,179
Trust me.

184
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,678
Come, Sméagol.

185
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,341
The stars are veiled.

186
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,735
Something stirs in the east.

187
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,585
A sleepless malice.

188
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,437
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

189
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,577
What are you doing?

190
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,854
Pippin!

191
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,089
Pippin?

192
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,831
Pippin.

193
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,533
-What, are you mad?
-I just want to look at it.

194
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,106
Just one more time.

195
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,236
Put it back.

196
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,326
Pippin.

197
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,425
No!

198
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,768
Pippin.

199
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,272
He is here.

200
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,614
see you.

201
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,274
Pippin!

202
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,612
Help! Gandalf, help!

203
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,326
Someone help him!

204
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,008
Pippin!

205
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,377
Fool of a Took!

206
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,546
Look at me.

207
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,387
Gandalf, forgive me.

208
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,731
Look at me.

209
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,740
What did you see?

210
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,278
A tree.

211
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,148
There was a white tree...

212
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,864
...in a courtyard of stone.

213
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:26,987
It was dead.

214
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,959
The city was burning.

215
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,312
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

216
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,168
I saw...

217
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,025
l saw him.

218
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,159
could hear his voice in my head.

219
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,742
And what did you tell him?

220
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,408
Speak!

221
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,930
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

222
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,770
He hurt me.

223
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,285
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

224
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,258
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

225
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,351
A fool...

226
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,812
...but an honest fool he remains.

227
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:20,632
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

228
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,244
We've been strangely fortunate.

229
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:28,137
Pippin saw in the palantir
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

230
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,968
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

231
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,359
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

232
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,033
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

233
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,356
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

234
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,128
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

235
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,432
Sauron fears this.

236
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,637
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

237
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,443
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

238
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,922
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

239
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,999
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

240
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,341
Tell me...

241
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,120
... why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

242
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,063
What do we owe Gondor?

243
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,204
-! will go.
-No!

244
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,406
-They must be warned.
-They will be.

245
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,419
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

246
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,222
Follow the river
and look to the black ships.

247
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,471
Understand this:

248
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,096
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

249
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,888
[ ride for Minas Tirith...

250
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,726
..and ] won't be going alone.

251
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,040
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

252
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,955
Hurry! Hurry!

253
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,831
Where are we going?

254
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,245
Why did you look?

255
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,998
Why do you always have to look?

256
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,227
-I don't know. I can't help it.
-You never can.

257
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,334
I'm sorry, all right?

258
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:15,158
-! won't do it again.
-Don't you understand?

259
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,978
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

260
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:21,694
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

261
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,895
And you--? You're coming with me?

262
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:29,687
Merry?

263
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,169
Come on.

264
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,035
How far is Minas Tirith?

265
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,679
Three days' ride, as the NazgAl flies.

266
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,245
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

267
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,701
Here.

268
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,629
Something for the road.

269
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,478
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

270
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,394
I Know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

271
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,245
But-- But we'll see each other soon.

272
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,017
-Won't we?
-I don't know.

273
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,108
I don't know what's going to happen.

274
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,024
-Merry.
-Run, Shadowfax.

275
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,692
Show us the meaning of haste.

276
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,741
Merry!

277
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,419
Merry!

278
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,629
Take her by the safest road.

279
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,269
A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens.

280
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,088
it waits to carry her across the sea.

281
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,909
The last journey of Arwen Undémiel.

282
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,441
There is nothing for you here...

283
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,255
..only death.

284
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:23,941
Lady Arwen...

285
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,707
...we cannot delay.

286
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,491
My lady!

287
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,375
-Tell me what you have seen.
-Arwen.

288
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,594
You have the gift of foresight.

289
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,580
What did you see?

290
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:00,305
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

291
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,112
But there is also life.

292
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,850
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

293
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,232
That future is almost gone.

294
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:14,448
But it is not lost.

295
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,219
Nothing is certain.

296
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,596
Some things are certain.

297
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,219
If l leave him now...

298
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:33,016
...[ will regret it forever.

299
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,523
It is time.

300
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:45,387
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

301
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:49,008
A light from the shadow shall spring

302
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:52,488
Renewed Shall be blade that was broken

303
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,064
The crownless again shail be king

304
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,029
Re-forge the sword.

305
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,591
Your hands are cold.

306
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:53,045
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

307
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,555
This was my choice.

308
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,549
Whether by your will or not...

309
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,942
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

310
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,237
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

311
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:12,115
Minas Tirith.

312
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,997
City of kings.

313
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,345
Make way!

314
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,339
It's the tree.

315
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,191
Gandalf. Gandalf.

316
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,556
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

317
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,581
The tree of the king.

318
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,194
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

319
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,179
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

320
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,377
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

321
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,687
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

322
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,658
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

323
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,356
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

324
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,958
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

325
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:29,237
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

326
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,734
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

327
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,239
Perhaps you come to explain this.

328
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:54,265
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

329
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,870
Boromir died to save us...

330
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,874
...my kinsman and me.

331
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,315
-He fell defending us from many foes.
-Pippin.

332
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,294
offer you my service, such as it is...

333
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,781
..in payment of this debt.

334
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,183
Get up.

335
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:37,605
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

336
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,190
...but it is not now.

337
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,039
War is coming.

338
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:47,575
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

339
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,909
... With the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

340
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:56,894
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

341
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,556
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

342
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,761
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

343
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,055
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

344
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:16,234
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

345
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,600
l have seen more than you know.

346
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,988
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

347
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,098
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

348
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,868
know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

349
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:35,707
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

350
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,874
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

351
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:45,582
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

352
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:51,437
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

353
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,210
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

354
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,433
Come.

355
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:19,774
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

356
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:24,225
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

357
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,009
-Do they?
-You're in the service of the steward now.

358
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:35,398
You're going to have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took, guard of the Citadel.

359
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,180
It's so quiet.

360
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:45,409
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

361
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,618
I don't want to be in a battle...

362
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:55,162
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

363
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:02,474
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

364
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,965
There never was much hope.

365
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,603
Just a fool's hope.

366
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,421
Our enemy is ready.

367
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,241
His full strength's gathered.

368
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,804
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

369
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,096
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

370
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,014
... mercenaries from the coast.

371
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,794
All will answer Mordor's call.

372
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,650
Come on.

373
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,882
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

374
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,442
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

375
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,600
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

376
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:53,515
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

377
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:57,702
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

378
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,412
Gandalf?

379
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,567
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

380
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,824
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

381
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:22,025
The one they say no living man can Kill.

382
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,561
The Witch-king of Angmar.

383
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,978
You've met him before.

384
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,214
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

385
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,480
He is the lord of the Nazgfl...

386
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,450
...the greatest of the Nine.

387
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,466
Minas Morgul is his fair.

388
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,089
The Dead City.

389
00:39:55,693 --> 00:40:00,293
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

390
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,042
Quick. Quick.

391
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,988
They will see. They will see.

392
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:28,415
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

393
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:32,627
The way into Mordor.

394
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,074
The secret stair.

395
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,116
Climb.

396
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,058
-No, Mr. Frodo!
-Not that way!

397
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,512
-What's it doing?
-No.

398
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:13,962
-They're calling me.
-No.

399
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,648
Hide! Hide!

400
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:33,045
I can feel his blade.

401
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,876
We come to it at last.

402
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,553
The great battle of our time.

403
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,944
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

404
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,848
The board is set.

405
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,611
The pieces are moving.

406
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,348
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

407
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:57,904
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

408
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,614
You must not fail me.

409
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,431
Quiet.

410
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,833
-To the river. Quick. Quick.
-Go. Go.

411
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,560
Come on.

412
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,214
Faster.

413
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,622
Draw swords.

414
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,682
Hold! Hold!

415
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,989
What?

416
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:48,313
Amon Din.

417
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,667
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

418
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,970
Hope is kindled.

419
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:39,743
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

420
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,788
Gondor calls for aid.

421
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:56,174
And Rohan will answer.

422
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:59,390
Muster the Rohirrim.

423
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:16,578
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

424
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:20,851
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

425
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:26,182
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

426
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:28,961
-Forward.
-Very good, sir.

427
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:30,463
-Gamling.
-My lord.

428
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,194
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

429
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,403
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

430
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,702
I will.

431
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:43,321
-Will you ride with us?
-Just to the encampment.

432
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:47,337
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

433
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,051
The men have found their captain.

434
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,383
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

435
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:02,176
You have given us hope.

436
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,927
So it is before the walis
of Minas Tirith...

437
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,973
...the doom of our time will be decided.

438
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:31,877
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

439
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:35,853
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

440
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,086
Faramir!

441
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,891
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

442
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,605
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

443
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:45,750
NazgAl.

444
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:50,569
Take cover!

445
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,254
NazgAdl!

446
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:56,961
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

447
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,587
Fall back!

448
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,900
-Retreat! Retreat!
-Come on!

449
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:45,562
The age of Men is over.

450
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:51,176
The time of the Orc has come.

451
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,281
Take cover!

452
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:00,222
Take cover, my lord!

453
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:01,978
It's coming!

454
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,705
-It's Mithrandir.
-The White Rider!

455
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,318
Pull!

456
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:12,284
Mithrandir.

457
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:14,293
They broke through our defenses.

458
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,607
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

459
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,611
-Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
-It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

460
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:26,296
-Long has he foreseen this doom.
-Foreseen and done nothing.

461
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:32,337
Faramir?

462
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:37,935
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

463
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,499
No.

464
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,449
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

465
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:47,564
-Where? When?
-In Ithilien.

466
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:49,985
Not two days ago.

467
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:54,601
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

468
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:58,166
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

469
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:02,704
What does that mean?

470
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:07,233
-What's wrong?
-Faramir, tell me everything.

471
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:38,056
Careful, master. Careful.

472
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,462
Very far to fall.

473
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:47,564
Very dangerous are the stairs.

474
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:52,964
Come, master.

475
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,806
Come to Sméagol.

476
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:09,865
Mr. Frodo.

477
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:12,397
Get back, you!

478
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,692
Don't touch him!

479
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,591
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

480
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:25,359
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

481
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,089
Master?

482
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,219
Master carries heavy burden.

483
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:37,566
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

484
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,258
Fat one cannot know.

485
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:46,124
Sméagol look after master.

486
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,594
He wants it.

487
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:54,013
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

488
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:59,491
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

489
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:03,744
The fat one will take it from you.

490
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:15,261
Send forth all legions.

491
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:19,499
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

492
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,447
Slay them all.

493
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:30,602
-What of the wizard?
-I will break him.

494
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,788
What of Théoden's riders?

495
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,527
Will Rohan's army come?

496
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,977
Mithrandir.

497
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:46,716
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

498
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,231
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

499
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,172
.
..1M peace or war...

500
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:56,167
...in living or dying...

501
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:58,913
..from....

502
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,134
From this hour henceforth...

503
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,374
...until my lord release me...

504
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,040
...or death take me.

505
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:13,071
And I shall not forget it...

506
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,540
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

507
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:26,548
Fealty with love.

508
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,358
Valor with honor.

509
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:34,098
Disloyalty with vengeance.

510
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,750
1 do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

511
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,846
... defenses that your brother
long held intact.

512
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,543
-What would you have me do?
-I will not yield...

513
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:55,453
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

514
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,419
Osgiliath must be retaken.

515
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,604
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

516
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,960
Much must be risked in war.

517
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,416
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

518
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:19,016
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

519
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,839
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

520
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,143
Yes.

521
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,989
I wish that.

522
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,826
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

523
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:46,557
...[ will do what 1 can
in his stead.

524
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:59,005
If 1 should return,
think better of me, Father.

525
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,750
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

526
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:30,595
What are you up to?

527
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,127
Sneaking off, are we?

528
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:34,596
Sneaking?

529
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,752
Sneaking?

530
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,202
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

531
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:47,239
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

532
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:49,901
..and they say "sneak."

533
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,080
Sneak?

534
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:56,404
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

535
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,190
-Very nice, very nice.
-All right. All right!

536
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:02,674
You just startled me is all.

537
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,056
What were you doing?

538
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,786
Sneaking.

539
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:12,109
Fine. Have it your own way.

540
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:16,948
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

541
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,357
We have to be moving on.

542
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:26,138
It's dark still.

543
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:28,463
It's always dark here.

544
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,709
It's gone!

545
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,666
-The Elven bread.
-What?

546
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:40,471
That's all we have left.

547
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:46,911
He took it. He must have!

548
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:50,594
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

549
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,711
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

550
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:57,040
You're a lying wretch!
What did you do with it?!

551
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,940
He doesn't eat it.

552
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,120
-He can't have taken it.
-Look.

553
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:05,083
What's this?

554
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,906
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

555
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,475
He took it.

556
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:18,207
l seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

557
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,468
That's a filthy lie!

558
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,817
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

559
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:24,339
-Sam!
-Call me--

560
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:25,741
Stop it!

561
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:27,976
Sam!

562
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:32,589
-l'IL kill him!
-Sam! No!

563
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:38,960
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. didn't mean it
to go so far. 1 was just so-- So angry.

564
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:41,683
Here, just--
Let's just rest a bit.

565
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:43,955
-'m all right.
-No.

566
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,100
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

567
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,490
It's that Gollum.

568
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,439
It's this place.

569
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:54,071
It's that thing around your neck.

570
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,033
I could help a bit.

571
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,642
I could carry it for a while.

572
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:03,652
Carry it for a while.

573
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,143
I could carry it...1 could carry it.

574
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:10,735
Share the load...Share the load...
the load...the load.

575
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,624
Get away!

576
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:14,316
I don't want to keep it.

577
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,864
I just want to help.

578
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:24,465
See? See?

579
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:27,974
He wants it for himself.

580
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:30,048
Shut up, you!

581
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:32,433
Go away!
Get out of here!

582
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,439
No, Sam.

583
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:35,911
It's you.

584
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,759
I'm sorry, Sam.

585
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,910
But he's a liar.

586
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:47,551
He's poisoned you against me.

587
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,011
You can't help me anymore.

588
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:54,856
You don't mean that.

589
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:59,167
Go home.

590
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,915
Faramir!

591
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:23,007
Faramir!

592
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,524
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

593
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,727
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

594
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,800
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

595
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,810
Your father loves you, Faramir.

596
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:44,585
He will remember it
before the end.

597
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:55,904
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

598
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,228
Well...

599
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:02,374
yes.

600
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:06,616
At least, well enough
for my own people.

601
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,821
But we have no songs
for great halls...

602
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,258
...and evil times.

603
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,029
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

604
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:21,452
Come, sing me a song.

605
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,629
Home is behind

606
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,488
The world ahead

607
01:09:42,377 --> 01:09:47,508
And there are many paths to tread

608
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:53,149
Through shadow

609
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:57,386
To the edge of night

610
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:04,045
Until the stars are all alight

611
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,510
Mist and shadow

612
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,987
Cloud and shade

613
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,811
All shall fade

614
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:28,097
All shall

615
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,443
Fade

616
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,130
March! March!

617
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:09,117
March! March! March!

618
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,452
Make way for the king.

619
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,003
Make way.

620
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,494
The king is here.

621
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,178
My lord.

622
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,348
Hail to you, sire.

623
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,100
Grimbold, how many?

624
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,561
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

625
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:38,165
We have 300 more from Fenmarch,
Théoden King.

626
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:43,108
-Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
-None have come, my lord.

627
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,486
Six thousand spears.

628
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:05,536
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

629
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:09,048
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

630
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:13,745
More will come.

631
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,940
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

632
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,716
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

633
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,605
The horses are restless...

634
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:43,368
...and the men are quiet.

635
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,776
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

636
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:51,272
That road there...

637
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,241
... where does that lead?

638
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:58,641
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

639
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:02,392
None who venture there ever return.

640
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,620
That mountain is evil.

641
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:30,418
Aragorn.

642
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,077
Let's find some food.

643
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,052
There.

644
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:54,804
A true esquire of Rohan.

645
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,501
I'm ready.

646
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:03,451
Sorry.

647
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,766
It isn't all that dangerous.

648
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,625
It's not even sharp.

649
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,568
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

650
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:14,459
Come on.

651
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,044
To the smithy. Go!

652
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,012
You should not encourage him.

653
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,664
You should not doubt him.

654
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,030
1 do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

655
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,540
Why should Merry be left behind?

656
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,218
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

657
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,493
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

658
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:16,292
{ choose a mortal life.

659
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:22,198
l wish I could've seen him...

660
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:26,052
...one last time.

661
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:38,793
Sir?

662
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:43,053
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

663
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:05,856
I take my leave.

664
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:21,856
My lord Elrond.

665
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,631
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

666
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:30,935
Arwen is dying.

667
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:39,531
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

668
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:43,753
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

669
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:47,843
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

670
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:51,787
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

671
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:55,262
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

672
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,468
The end has come.

673
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:00,267
It will not be our end, but his.

674
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,480
You ride to war, but not to victory.

675
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:09,175
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

676
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:13,662
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

677
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,652
A fleet of Corsairs ships sails
from the south.

678
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:20,511
They'll be in the city in two days.

679
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,823
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

680
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:26,714
You need more men.

681
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:28,896
There are none.

682
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,310
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

683
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,692
Murderers...

684
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,388
... traitors.

685
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,929
You would call upon them to fight?

686
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:53,738
They believe in nothing.

687
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:55,973
They answer to no one.

688
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:59,098
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

689
01:18:06,582 --> 01:18:11,092
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

690
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:29,934
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

691
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,710
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

692
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,567
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

693
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:55,427
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

694
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:59,635
Put aside the Ranger.

695
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:02,932
Become who you were born to be.

696
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:05,289
Take the Dimholt road.

697
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,060
Why are you doing this?

698
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:36,512
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

699
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,185
You cannot abandon the men.

700
01:19:42,745 --> 01:19:44,144
.
Eowyn....

701
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,443
We need you here.

702
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,490
Why have you come?

703
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:53,116
Do you not know?

704
01:20:02,665 --> 01:20:05,295
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

705
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:11,714
I cannot give you what you seek.

706
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:34,381
Just where do you think
you're off to?

707
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,000
Not this time.

708
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,262
This time you must stay, Gimli.

709
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,726
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

710
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:47,463
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

711
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:12,098
-What's happening?
-Where is he going?

712
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,341
Where's he going?

713
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,956
I don't understand.

714
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,225
Lord Aragorn!

715
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,251
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

716
01:21:29,785 --> 01:21:31,625
He leaves because there is no hope.

717
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:34,391
He leaves because he must.

718
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,343
Too few have come.

719
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,595
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

720
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,827
No...

721
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:44,575
...we cannot.

722
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:50,943
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

723
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:07,308
I have left instruction.

724
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:13,062
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

725
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:22,025
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

726
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:26,062
Long may you defend Edoras...

727
01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:28,625
...if the battle goes ill.

728
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:33,001
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

729
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:37,351
Duty?

730
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:40,955
No.

731
01:22:49,398 --> 01:22:51,268
I would have you smile again...

732
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:59,343
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

733
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:07,846
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

734
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:15,021
...and no more despair.

735
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:24,813
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

736
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:27,044
One that is cursed.

737
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:31,460
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

738
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:34,671
...to the last king of Gondor...

739
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:36,947
...to come to his aid...

740
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:38,835
...to fight.

741
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:41,447
But when the time came...

742
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,630
... when Gondor's need was dire...

743
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,790
... they fled...

744
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:50,149
.. vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

745
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,643
And so Isildur cursed them...

746
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:58,864
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

747
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:16,482
The very warmth of my blood
seems stole away.

748
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,124
The way is shut.

749
01:24:25,127 --> 01:24:26,857
It was made by those
who are dead.

750
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,689
And the Dead keep it.

751
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:31,839
The way is shut.

752
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:44,735
Brego!

753
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,817
1 do not fear death.

754
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:05,505
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

755
01:25:05,968 --> 01:25:10,068
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

756
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:11,979
Oh.

757
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:14,831
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

758
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:32,152
We must ride light and swift.

759
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,144
It is a long road ahead.

760
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:37,219
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

761
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,768
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

762
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:48,237
All my friends have gone to battle.

763
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,314
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

764
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,552
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

765
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,090
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

766
01:25:56,385 --> 01:25:58,255
I want to fight.

767
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,717
I will say no more.

768
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:19,503
Ride with me.

769
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:22,438
My lady.

770
01:26:22,778 --> 01:26:24,858
Form up! Move out!

771
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:28,153
Form up! Move out!

772
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,700
Ride!

773
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,601
Ride now to Gondor!

774
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:28,318
Who enters my domain?

775
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,674
One who will have your allegiance.

776
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:42,606
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

777
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:45,902
You will suffer me.

778
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:12,708
The way is shut.

779
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:18,188
It was made by those who are dead.

780
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,787
And the Dead keep it.

781
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,129
The way is shut.

782
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,592
Now you must die.

783
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:46,305
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

784
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:51,328
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

785
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:59,432
That line was broken.

786
01:29:02,304 --> 01:29:04,204
It has been remade.

787
01:29:12,414 --> 01:29:13,754
Fight for us...

788
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:16,365
...and regain your honor.

789
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:22,026
What say you?

790
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:35,742
What say you?

791
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:38,258
You waste your time, Aragorn.

792
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:41,483
They had no honor in life,
they have none now in death.

793
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,547
Iam Isildur's heir.

794
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:47,142
Fight for me...

795
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:51,108
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

796
01:29:55,457 --> 01:29:57,187
What say you?

797
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:10,119
Open the gate! Quick!

798
01:30:41,503 --> 01:30:43,253
Quick! Hurry!

799
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,509
Faramir!

800
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:53,582
Say not that he has fallen.

801
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:56,490
They were outnumbered.

802
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,488
None survived.

803
01:30:59,421 --> 01:31:01,091
Fear.

804
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:04,700
The city is rank with it.

805
01:31:07,429 --> 01:31:09,599
Let us ease their pain.

806
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,681
Release the prisoners.

807
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:13,797
Catapults!

808
01:31:27,415 --> 01:31:30,435
My sons are spent.

809
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:34,466
My line has ended.

810
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:38,888
He's alive!

811
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:42,007
The House of Stewards has failed.

812
01:31:42,564 --> 01:31:43,854
He needs medicine, my lord.

813
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,410
My line has ended!

814
01:31:49,304 --> 01:31:51,034
My lord!

815
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:06,362
Rohan...

816
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:09,432
...has deserted us.

817
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,985
Théoden's betrayed me.

818
01:32:38,453 --> 01:32:40,153
Abandon your posts!

819
01:32:41,423 --> 01:32:44,883
Flee! Flee for your lives!

820
01:32:55,503 --> 01:32:56,843
Prepare for battle!

821
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:00,294
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

822
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:03,606
Over here!

823
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,688
Return to your posts!

824
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:20,069
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

825
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:31,894
Stay where you are.

826
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:50,286
We need more rubble!

827
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,265
Watch out!

828
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,910
Down to the lower level. Quick!

829
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:58,438
Double up, men!

830
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,992
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

831
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:07,939
Stand to your posts! Fight!

832
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:50,540
Not to the towers!

833
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:53,542
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

834
01:35:54,649 --> 01:35:56,259
Bring them down!

835
01:36:02,657 --> 01:36:04,437
Fight them back!

836
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:06,609
Peregrin Took!

837
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,541
-Go back to the Citadel!
-They'd called us out to fight.

838
01:36:24,012 --> 01:36:26,092
This is no place for a Hobbit.

839
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:53,430
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

840
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:57,138
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

841
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:08,471
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

842
01:37:09,457 --> 01:37:12,797
Grond! Grond! Grond!

843
01:37:13,428 --> 01:37:13,492
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

844
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:20,414
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

845
01:37:29,977 --> 01:37:31,847
In there.

846
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:35,421
What is this place?

847
01:37:39,887 --> 01:37:43,017
Master must go inside the tunnel.

848
01:37:44,826 --> 01:37:48,336
Now that I'm here, I don't think 1 want to.

849
01:37:50,932 --> 01:37:52,892
It's the only way.

850
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:57,306
Go in...

851
01:37:58,139 --> 01:37:59,979
...0F go back.

852
01:38:02,944 --> 01:38:05,404
I can't go back.

853
01:38:17,925 --> 01:38:20,145
-What's that smell?
-Orcses' filth.

854
01:38:20,628 --> 01:38:23,617
Orcses come in here sometimes.

855
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:30,706
Hurry.

856
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:37,510
This way.

857
01:38:40,415 --> 01:38:42,144
Sméagol?

858
01:38:43,184 --> 01:38:45,234
Over here.

859
01:38:53,828 --> 01:38:56,608
It's sticky. What is it?

860
01:38:57,165 --> 01:38:59,185
You'll see.

861
01:38:59,634 --> 01:39:01,414
Oh, yes.

862
01:39:01,836 --> 01:39:04,796
You will see.

863
01:39:14,148 --> 01:39:15,608
Sméagol?

864
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:18,228
Sméagol!

865
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,765
Sméagol!

866
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,000
Sam.

867
01:41:14,335 --> 01:41:16,205
And you, Frodo Baggins...

868
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:21,391
...4 give you the light of Earendil,
our most beloved star.

869
01:41:22,843 --> 01:41:25,713
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

870
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:29,679
...when all other lights go out.

871
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,059
Naughty little fly

872
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:52,440
Why does he cry?

873
01:42:53,401 --> 01:42:56,331
Caught in a web

874
01:42:56,937 --> 01:42:59,307
Soon you'll be...

875
01:43:00,041 --> 01:43:01,591
Eaten.

876
01:43:39,013 --> 01:43:41,383
Got away, did it, precious?

877
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:43,751
Not this time.

878
01:43:44,185 --> 01:43:46,905
-Not this time!
-No!

879
01:43:54,095 --> 01:43:57,055
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

880
01:43:57,898 --> 01:44:00,148
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

881
01:44:00,634 --> 01:44:02,304
We promised.

882
01:44:02,737 --> 01:44:04,907
You must believe us.

883
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:06,896
It was the precious.

884
01:44:07,308 --> 01:44:11,528
The precious made us do it.

885
01:44:29,196 --> 01:44:31,746
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

886
01:44:41,142 --> 01:44:44,102
have to destroy it for both our sakes.

887
01:44:53,988 --> 01:44:55,718
No!

888
01:45:19,213 --> 01:45:21,322
I'm so sorry, Sam.

889
01:45:26,086 --> 01:45:28,366
I'm so sorry.

890
01:45:54,448 --> 01:45:58,698
This task was appointed to you,
Frodo of the Shire.

891
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:02,464
if you do not find a way...

892
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,104
...10 one will.

893
01:46:53,274 --> 01:46:54,854
Back to the gate!

894
01:46:55,342 --> 01:46:57,272
Hurry!

895
01:47:20,701 --> 01:47:23,361
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

896
01:47:24,872 --> 01:47:30,142
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

897
01:47:31,078 --> 01:47:35,618
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

898
01:47:39,887 --> 01:47:41,286
Bring wood and oil.

899
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:45,721
Steady.

900
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:47,870
Steady.

901
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,696
You are soldiers of Gondor.

902
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:09,179
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

903
01:48:19,293 --> 01:48:20,603
Volley!

904
01:48:21,528 --> 01:48:23,198
Fire!

905
01:50:16,643 --> 01:50:18,393
Let him go, you filth.

906
01:50:20,581 --> 01:50:22,071
Let him go!

907
01:50:23,517 --> 01:50:25,416
You will not touch him again.

908
01:50:28,822 --> 01:50:30,462
Come on and finish it.

909
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,799
Back!

910
01:52:32,846 --> 01:52:33,986
Mr. Frodo.

911
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:45,440
Oh, no.

912
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:47,589
Frodo.

913
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:49,768
Mr. Frodo.

914
01:52:54,568 --> 01:52:55,768
Wake up.

915
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:01,826
Don't leave me here alone.

916
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:05,750
Don't go where I can't follow.

917
01:53:10,350 --> 01:53:11,580
Wake up.

918
01:53:18,425 --> 01:53:20,355
Not asleep.

919
01:53:22,763 --> 01:53:24,433
Dead.

920
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:55,731
What's this?

921
01:53:57,064 --> 01:53:59,494
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

922
01:54:01,735 --> 01:54:03,955
Killed another one, has she?

923
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:06,233
No.

924
01:54:09,176 --> 01:54:10,906
This fellow ain't dead.

925
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,501
Not dead?

926
01:54:13,947 --> 01:54:19,047
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

927
01:54:20,087 --> 01:54:22,517
Then she has her way with them.

928
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:24,679
That's how she likes to feed.

929
01:54:25,392 --> 01:54:27,262
Fresh blood.

930
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:29,744
Get him to the tower!

931
01:54:33,467 --> 01:54:34,987
Samwise, you fool.

932
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:37,858
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

933
01:54:38,405 --> 01:54:40,575
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

934
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:07,968
The house of his spirit crumbles.

935
01:55:09,403 --> 01:55:10,693
He is burning.

936
01:55:12,038 --> 01:55:13,178
Already burning.

937
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,469
He's not dead.

938
01:55:16,209 --> 01:55:17,669
He's not dead!

939
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,630
No! No!

940
01:55:22,015 --> 01:55:24,095
No! No!

941
01:55:24,551 --> 01:55:26,301
He's not dead!

942
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,960
-Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
-No! No! No!

943
01:55:30,557 --> 01:55:33,456
release you from my service.

944
01:55:35,195 --> 01:55:39,005
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

945
01:55:41,735 --> 01:55:43,785
Pour oil on the wood!

946
01:55:45,806 --> 01:55:47,556
Come on! Move your feet!

947
01:55:48,341 --> 01:55:50,891
-Hurry along there! Hurry along!
-Gandalf!

948
01:55:51,645 --> 01:55:52,905
Where is Gandalf?

949
01:55:54,214 --> 01:55:55,324
Gandalf!

950
01:56:00,921 --> 01:56:01,911
Retreat!

951
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:05,744
The city is breached!

952
01:56:06,126 --> 01:56:08,736
Fall back to the second level!

953
01:56:12,899 --> 01:56:14,269
Get the women and children out!

954
01:56:14,835 --> 01:56:16,385
Get them out!

955
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:18,080
Retreat!

956
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:20,022
Come on. Come on.

957
01:56:20,607 --> 01:56:24,327
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

958
01:56:32,853 --> 01:56:34,993
Take them down!

959
01:56:55,842 --> 01:56:58,362
Fight. Fight to the last man!

960
01:56:58,879 --> 01:56:59,959
Fight for your lives!

961
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:51,019
Courage, Merry.

962
01:57:51,364 --> 01:57:53,443
Courage for our friends.

963
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,930
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

964
01:58:00,507 --> 01:58:03,347
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

965
01:58:11,851 --> 01:58:14,601
Eomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

966
01:58:15,155 --> 01:58:16,264
Flank ready.

967
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:19,110
Gamling, follow the king's banner
down the center.

968
01:58:19,626 --> 01:58:22,906
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

969
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:25,929
Forth, and fear no darkness!

970
01:58:26,433 --> 01:58:29,803
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

971
01:58:30,537 --> 01:58:35,077
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

972
01:58:35,942 --> 01:58:39,192
...a sword-day, a red day...

973
01:58:39,813 --> 01:58:42,973
...ere the sun rises!

974
01:58:51,157 --> 01:58:54,967
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

975
01:59:01,768 --> 01:59:03,608
Ride now!

976
01:59:05,372 --> 01:59:07,212
Ride now!

977
01:59:08,108 --> 01:59:10,538
Ride! Ride for ruin...

978
01:59:11,044 --> 01:59:13,474
...and the world's ending!

979
01:59:15,749 --> 01:59:16,978
Death!

980
01:59:17,584 --> 01:59:20,134
Death!

981
01:59:20,654 --> 01:59:23,494
-Death!
-Death!

982
01:59:24,324 --> 01:59:25,723
-Death!
-Death!

983
01:59:26,626 --> 01:59:29,646
-Death!
-Death!

984
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,308
Forth Eorlingas!

985
02:00:20,613 --> 02:00:22,163
Fire!

986
02:00:26,186 --> 02:00:27,236
Death!

987
02:00:31,591 --> 02:00:32,731
Charge!

988
02:00:33,326 --> 02:00:34,726
Fire at will!

989
02:01:01,788 --> 02:01:02,867
Gandalf!

990
02:01:05,558 --> 02:01:08,838
Gandalf! Denethor has lost his mind!

991
02:01:09,596 --> 02:01:11,585
He's burning Faramir alive!

992
02:01:12,031 --> 02:01:13,581
Up! Quickly!

993
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:47,501
Set a fire in our flesh.

994
02:02:05,518 --> 02:02:07,068
Stay this madness!

995
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:43,174
No!

996
02:02:43,556 --> 02:02:45,896
You will not take my son from me!

997
02:02:46,392 --> 02:02:48,442
No! No!

998
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:01,076
Faramir.

999
02:03:14,854 --> 02:03:18,334
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1000
02:03:46,386 --> 02:03:47,936
Drive them to the river!

1001
02:03:50,924 --> 02:03:52,674
Make safe the city!

1002
02:04:32,899 --> 02:04:34,599
Re-form the line!

1003
02:04:35,969 --> 02:04:37,719
Re-form the line!

1004
02:04:44,978 --> 02:04:47,288
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1005
02:04:48,214 --> 02:04:50,114
Charge!

1006
02:05:56,549 --> 02:05:57,779
Cut him down!

1007
02:05:59,719 --> 02:06:01,329
Follow me!

1008
02:06:24,610 --> 02:06:26,889
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1009
02:06:29,615 --> 02:06:30,724
Left!

1010
02:06:48,301 --> 02:06:49,761
Aim for their heads!

1011
02:06:56,008 --> 02:06:58,878
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1012
02:07:13,059 --> 02:07:14,399
Merry!

1013
02:07:36,315 --> 02:07:38,094
I didn't think it would end this way.

1014
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:40,882
End?

1015
02:07:42,288 --> 02:07:44,157
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1016
02:07:46,926 --> 02:07:49,676
Death is just another path...

1017
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:52,120
...one that we all must take.

1018
02:07:53,566 --> 02:07:56,606
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1019
02:07:57,203 --> 02:08:00,333
...and all turns to silver glass.

1020
02:08:02,975 --> 02:08:04,675
And then you see it.

1021
02:08:06,846 --> 02:08:08,925
What, Gandalf?

1022
02:08:10,349 --> 02:08:11,519
See what?

1023
02:08:12,919 --> 02:08:14,849
White shores...

1024
02:08:16,822 --> 02:08:18,932
..and beyond.

1025
02:08:20,693 --> 02:08:22,243
A far green country...

1026
02:08:23,196 --> 02:08:25,746
...under a swift sunrise.

1027
02:08:30,136 --> 02:08:31,476
Well...

1028
02:08:31,871 --> 02:08:33,301
...that isn't so bad.

1029
02:08:33,706 --> 02:08:34,936
No.

1030
02:08:37,143 --> 02:08:38,603
No, it isn't.

1031
02:08:55,228 --> 02:08:58,128
Rally to me! To me!

1032
02:09:19,285 --> 02:09:23,264
Feast on his flesh.

1033
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:30,240
I will kill you if you touch him.

1034
02:09:30,696 --> 02:09:35,496
Do not come between
the NazgUl and his prey.

1035
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:47,450
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1036
02:10:48,307 --> 02:10:50,267
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1037
02:10:50,710 --> 02:10:53,550
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1038
02:11:09,362 --> 02:11:11,202
There's plenty for the both of us.

1039
02:11:11,630 --> 02:11:13,470
May the best Dwarf win.

1040
02:11:38,290 --> 02:11:40,250
You fool.

1041
02:11:40,693 --> 02:11:43,683
No man can kill me.

1042
02:11:46,465 --> 02:11:49,245
Die now.

1043
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:02,009
lam no man.

1044
02:12:18,864 --> 02:12:21,904
-Fifteen! Sixteen!
-Seventeen!

1045
02:12:38,551 --> 02:12:40,861
-Twenty-nine!
-Legolas!

1046
02:13:03,542 --> 02:13:05,652
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1047
02:13:53,058 --> 02:13:55,138
That still only counts as one!

1048
02:13:55,594 --> 02:13:57,494
All right, then. Come on!

1049
02:14:41,473 --> 02:14:43,963
I know your face...

1050
02:14:46,178 --> 02:14:47,818
.
... Eowyn.

1051
02:14:50,616 --> 02:14:52,696
My eyes darken.

1052
02:14:54,119 --> 02:14:55,318
No.

1053
02:14:56,322 --> 02:14:57,752
No.

1054
02:15:00,025 --> 02:15:02,165
lam going to save you.

1055
02:15:03,796 --> 02:15:05,876
You already did.

1056
02:15:09,802 --> 02:15:11,232
.
Eowyn...

1057
02:15:12,972 --> 02:15:15,142
...my body is broken.

1058
02:15:20,512 --> 02:15:22,682
You have to let me go.

1059
02:15:28,887 --> 02:15:31,137
go to my fathers...

1060
02:15:32,925 --> 02:15:35,415
...in whose mighty company...

1061
02:15:36,195 --> 02:15:39,125
...[ shall not now feel ashamed.

1062
02:15:56,181 --> 02:15:57,611
.
Eowyn.

1063
02:16:44,263 --> 02:16:46,433
Release us.

1064
02:16:48,666 --> 02:16:50,156
Bad idea.

1065
02:16:50,536 --> 02:16:53,906
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1066
02:16:54,573 --> 02:16:56,303
You gave us your word.

1067
02:16:58,343 --> 02:17:00,093
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1068
02:17:01,714 --> 02:17:02,884
Go.

1069
02:17:03,915 --> 02:17:05,405
Be at peace.

1070
02:17:40,285 --> 02:17:41,594
Merry.

1071
02:17:44,522 --> 02:17:45,633
Merry, it's me.

1072
02:17:48,427 --> 02:17:49,767
It's Pippin.

1073
02:17:52,464 --> 02:17:54,454
I knew you'd find me.

1074
02:17:54,900 --> 02:17:55,980
Yes.

1075
02:17:58,570 --> 02:18:00,320
Are you going to leave me?

1076
02:18:01,139 --> 02:18:02,599
No, Merry.

1077
02:18:04,143 --> 02:18:06,102
I'm going to look after you.

1078
02:18:50,422 --> 02:18:51,682
Hands off!

1079
02:18:52,023 --> 02:18:54,804
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1080
02:18:55,427 --> 02:18:59,087
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1081
02:19:01,066 --> 02:19:04,436
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul rats!

1082
02:19:05,804 --> 02:19:10,314
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1083
02:19:31,663 --> 02:19:33,213
The scum tried to knife me.

1084
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:35,148
Kill him!

1085
02:20:56,715 --> 02:20:58,465
That's for Frodo!

1086
02:20:59,117 --> 02:21:00,897
And for the Shire!

1087
02:21:04,756 --> 02:21:06,626
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1088
02:21:28,847 --> 02:21:31,747
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1089
02:21:33,285 --> 02:21:37,445
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1090
02:21:45,364 --> 02:21:46,823
Not if! stick you first.

1091
02:21:47,199 --> 02:21:48,539
Sam!

1092
02:21:53,805 --> 02:21:55,555
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1093
02:21:56,008 --> 02:21:57,788
Sorry for everything.

1094
02:21:58,577 --> 02:22:01,706
-Let's get you out of here.
-It's too late. It's over.

1095
02:22:02,314 --> 02:22:04,864
They've taken it. Sam...

1096
02:22:05,984 --> 02:22:07,294
...they took the Ring.

1097
02:22:08,253 --> 02:22:10,623
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1098
02:22:22,934 --> 02:22:24,864
I thought I'd lost you.

1099
02:22:25,570 --> 02:22:27,029
So I took it.

1100
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:30,220
Only for safekeeping.

1101
02:22:31,777 --> 02:22:33,297
Give it to me.

1102
02:22:37,082 --> 02:22:39,012
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1103
02:22:43,955 --> 02:22:45,035
Sam.

1104
02:22:46,792 --> 02:22:48,521
Give me the Ring.

1105
02:23:09,448 --> 02:23:10,558
You must understand.

1106
02:23:14,219 --> 02:23:15,829
The Ring is my burden.

1107
02:23:17,255 --> 02:23:19,125
It will destroy you, Sam.

1108
02:23:22,561 --> 02:23:24,291
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1109
02:23:25,864 --> 02:23:27,294
We best find you some clothes.

1110
02:23:27,666 --> 02:23:30,326
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1111
02:23:52,457 --> 02:23:54,417
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1112
02:23:55,193 --> 02:23:57,213
We made it to Mordor.

1113
02:23:58,830 --> 02:24:00,230
There are so many of them.

1114
02:24:01,366 --> 02:24:03,646
We'll never get through unseen.

1115
02:24:09,141 --> 02:24:12,071
It's him, the Eye.

1116
02:24:20,185 --> 02:24:22,465
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1117
02:24:23,255 --> 02:24:25,064
There's nothing for it.

1118
02:24:28,293 --> 02:24:32,193
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1119
02:24:42,107 --> 02:24:44,977
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1120
02:24:46,711 --> 02:24:49,170
The darkness is deepening.

1121
02:24:49,714 --> 02:24:51,794
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

1122
02:24:52,250 --> 02:24:54,030
It's only a matter of time.

1123
02:24:55,787 --> 02:24:57,897
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1124
02:24:59,257 --> 02:25:03,157
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
. .
our enemy is regrouping.

1125
02:25:03,862 --> 02:25:05,472
Let him stay there.

1126
02:25:05,864 --> 02:25:08,204
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1127
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:13,240
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1128
02:25:20,645 --> 02:25:22,815
I've sent him to his death.

1129
02:25:24,716 --> 02:25:25,826
No.

1130
02:25:26,484 --> 02:25:28,624
There is still hope for Frodo.

1131
02:25:29,254 --> 02:25:32,884
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1132
02:25:34,459 --> 02:25:36,739
-We can give him that.
-How?

1133
02:25:37,362 --> 02:25:39,761
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1134
02:25:40,265 --> 02:25:42,105
Empty his lands.

1135
02:25:42,601 --> 02:25:45,291
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1136
02:25:46,338 --> 02:25:48,948
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1137
02:25:49,507 --> 02:25:50,847
Not for ourselves.

1138
02:25:51,309 --> 02:25:56,198
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1139
02:25:58,683 --> 02:26:01,963
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1140
02:26:03,154 --> 02:26:04,234
A diversion.

1141
02:26:05,156 --> 02:26:07,296
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1142
02:26:08,360 --> 02:26:10,170
He will not take the bait.

1143
02:26:10,595 --> 02:26:11,994
Certainty of death...

1144
02:26:12,364 --> 02:26:14,644
... small chance of success...

1145
02:26:16,001 --> 02:26:17,401
... what are we waiting for?

1146
02:26:36,221 --> 02:26:38,881
To the Gate, you slugs!

1147
02:26:40,158 --> 02:26:43,258
Move it! To the Gate!

1148
02:26:49,768 --> 02:26:51,228
Look, the Orcs...

1149
02:26:51,903 --> 02:26:53,683
..they're moving off.

1150
02:26:55,140 --> 02:26:56,869
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1151
02:26:57,309 --> 02:26:59,208
...some luck at last.

1152
02:27:54,432 --> 02:27:55,862
Take mine.

1153
02:27:56,568 --> 02:27:58,408
There's a few drops left.

1154
02:28:13,885 --> 02:28:16,135
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1155
02:28:17,355 --> 02:28:20,164
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1156
02:29:13,445 --> 02:29:15,345
Frodo, get down!

1157
02:29:17,348 --> 02:29:19,018
Hide!

1158
02:29:29,394 --> 02:29:31,174
Frodo!

1159
02:29:37,268 --> 02:29:38,528
Where are they?

1160
02:30:14,839 --> 02:30:17,499
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1161
02:30:18,810 --> 02:30:21,300
Let justice be done upon him!

1162
02:30:54,112 --> 02:30:55,692
Fall back.

1163
02:30:56,214 --> 02:30:57,994
Fall back!

1164
02:31:10,395 --> 02:31:12,175
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1165
02:31:14,365 --> 02:31:17,465
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1166
02:31:18,102 --> 02:31:19,682
Something's drawn its gaze.

1167
02:31:37,455 --> 02:31:39,885
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1168
02:31:42,293 --> 02:31:45,803
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1169
02:31:49,167 --> 02:31:50,837
I see in your eyes...

1170
02:31:51,436 --> 02:31:54,976
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1171
02:31:57,475 --> 02:32:00,375
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1172
02:32:00,945 --> 02:32:04,315
... when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1173
02:32:04,949 --> 02:32:07,289
But it is not this day.

1174
02:32:07,919 --> 02:32:10,579
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1175
02:32:11,122 --> 02:32:13,642
... when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1176
02:32:14,158 --> 02:32:16,328
But it is not this day.

1177
02:32:16,794 --> 02:32:18,253
This day we fight!

1178
02:32:20,298 --> 02:32:24,078
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1179
02:32:24,769 --> 02:32:28,489
... bid you stand, Men of the West!

1180
02:33:57,528 --> 02:34:00,568
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1181
02:34:01,466 --> 02:34:03,516
What about side by side with a friend?

1182
02:34:07,371 --> 02:34:08,891
Aye.

1183
02:34:09,974 --> 02:34:11,524
I could do that.

1184
02:34:42,106 --> 02:34:43,886
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1185
02:34:47,145 --> 02:34:49,135
It'll be spring soon.

1186
02:34:50,214 --> 02:34:52,584
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1187
02:34:53,084 --> 02:34:56,304
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1188
02:34:58,122 --> 02:35:01,581
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1189
02:35:03,094 --> 02:35:06,934
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1190
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:11,590
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1191
02:35:13,538 --> 02:35:14,998
No, Sam.

1192
02:35:15,406 --> 02:35:17,986
I can't recall the taste of food...

1193
02:35:19,477 --> 02:35:22,377
...nor the sound of water...

1194
02:35:22,947 --> 02:35:26,107
...nor the touch of grass.

1195
02:35:27,485 --> 02:35:28,825
I'm...

1196
02:35:29,921 --> 02:35:31,121
...naked in the dark.

1197
02:35:32,957 --> 02:35:34,977
There's-- There's nothing.

1198
02:35:35,426 --> 02:35:39,555
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1199
02:35:41,365 --> 02:35:43,065
l can see him...

1200
02:35:43,734 --> 02:35:45,164
.. with my waking eyes.

1201
02:35:46,470 --> 02:35:48,640
Then let us be rid of it...

1202
02:35:49,507 --> 02:35:51,497
...once and for all.

1203
02:35:52,476 --> 02:35:54,256
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1204
02:35:54,712 --> 02:35:57,021
I can't carry it for you...

1205
02:35:57,782 --> 02:35:59,562
...but I can carry you.

1206
02:36:00,284 --> 02:36:01,833
Come on!

1207
02:36:32,483 --> 02:36:35,063
Aragorn.

1208
02:36:46,998 --> 02:36:49,278
Elessar.

1209
02:37:01,545 --> 02:37:03,685
For Frodo.

1210
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:40,260
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1211
02:37:41,152 --> 02:37:43,112
A doorway.

1212
02:37:43,955 --> 02:37:45,414
We're almost there.

1213
02:37:47,959 --> 02:37:51,439
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1214
02:38:51,555 --> 02:38:53,195
Frodo!

1215
02:39:20,484 --> 02:39:22,034
Eagles.

1216
02:39:23,654 --> 02:39:24,964
The eagles are coming!

1217
02:39:48,012 --> 02:39:49,682
Frodo!

1218
02:39:55,152 --> 02:39:56,292
I'm here, Sam.

1219
02:40:03,928 --> 02:40:05,328
Destroy it!

1220
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:19,010
Go on! Now!

1221
02:40:19,577 --> 02:40:21,796
Throw it in the fire!

1222
02:40:35,526 --> 02:40:37,866
What are you waiting for?

1223
02:40:40,064 --> 02:40:42,144
Just let it go!

1224
02:41:15,599 --> 02:41:17,589
The Ring is mine.

1225
02:41:21,438 --> 02:41:22,958
No.

1226
02:41:23,607 --> 02:41:24,747
No.

1227
02:41:33,317 --> 02:41:35,657
No!

1228
02:43:20,391 --> 02:43:22,030
Yes!

1229
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:24,949
Yes!

1230
02:43:26,297 --> 02:43:28,817
Precious! Precious!

1231
02:43:29,333 --> 02:43:32,113
Precious! Precious!

1232
02:44:25,422 --> 02:44:27,032
Give me your hand!

1233
02:44:35,599 --> 02:44:37,739
Take my hand!

1234
02:44:40,738 --> 02:44:41,848
No!

1235
02:44:49,313 --> 02:44:51,043
Don't you let go.

1236
02:44:55,853 --> 02:44:57,252
Don't let go.

1237
02:44:59,056 --> 02:45:00,286
Reach!

1238
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:32,200
Frodo!

1239
02:46:33,116 --> 02:46:35,776
Frodo!

1240
02:47:57,267 --> 02:47:59,077
It's gone.

1241
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:05,270
It's done.

1242
02:48:06,009 --> 02:48:07,739
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1243
02:48:09,413 --> 02:48:11,523
It's over now.

1244
02:48:37,274 --> 02:48:39,524
l can see the Shire.

1245
02:48:42,079 --> 02:48:44,128
The Brandywine River.

1246
02:48:46,550 --> 02:48:48,300
Bag End.

1247
02:48:50,887 --> 02:48:53,257
Gandalf's fireworks.

1248
02:48:54,024 --> 02:48:57,333
The lights in the Party Tree.

1249
02:48:59,262 --> 02:49:01,952
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1250
02:49:03,467 --> 02:49:05,837
She had ribbons in her hair.

1251
02:49:09,139 --> 02:49:11,719
If ever 1 was to marry someone...

1252
02:49:13,010 --> 02:49:14,970
...it would've been her.

1253
02:49:16,713 --> 02:49:18,493
It would've been her.

1254
02:49:30,627 --> 02:49:33,697
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1255
02:49:38,402 --> 02:49:40,982
...here at the end of all things.

1256
02:51:31,081 --> 02:51:32,861
Gandalf?

1257
02:51:52,769 --> 02:51:54,519
Frodo!

1258
02:52:14,524 --> 02:52:16,134
Gimli!

1259
02:53:59,362 --> 02:54:02,612
Now come the days of the king.

1260
02:54:08,104 --> 02:54:10,094
May they be blessed.

1261
02:54:30,694 --> 02:54:33,034
This day does not belong to one man...

1262
02:54:33,530 --> 02:54:35,170
...but to all.

1263
02:54:37,067 --> 02:54:39,646
Let us together rebuild this world...

1264
02:54:40,170 --> 02:54:43,890
..that we may share
in the days of peace.

1265
02:57:18,862 --> 02:57:20,702
My friends...

1266
02:57:26,236 --> 02:57:28,576
... you bow to no one.

1267
02:58:13,082 --> 02:58:14,952
And thus it was.

1268
02:58:15,385 --> 02:58:18,575
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1269
02:58:19,189 --> 02:58:21,409
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1270
02:58:21,891 --> 02:58:25,841
... though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

1271
02:58:26,563 --> 02:58:28,703
...was ended.

1272
02:58:34,037 --> 02:58:38,227
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

1273
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:42,695
...we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight.

1274
02:58:45,748 --> 02:58:48,118
We were home.

1275
02:58:54,991 --> 02:58:56,661
Hi.

1276
02:59:14,043 --> 02:59:15,973
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1277
03:00:04,360 --> 03:00:05,730
Rosie, Rosie.

1278
03:00:06,095 --> 03:00:07,845
Good night, lads.

1279
03:01:05,688 --> 03:01:09,198
How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

1280
03:01:10,993 --> 03:01:12,953
How do you go on...

1281
03:01:13,396 --> 03:01:17,966
...when in your heart
you begin to understand...

1282
03:01:19,869 --> 03:01:22,479
... there is no going back?

1283
03:01:23,539 --> 03:01:26,729
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1284
03:01:27,744 --> 03:01:30,294
...some hurts that go foo deep...

1285
03:01:32,415 --> 03:01:34,905
...that have taken hold.

1286
03:02:13,356 --> 03:02:15,726
Mr. Frodo?

1287
03:02:18,594 --> 03:02:19,794
What is it?

1288
03:02:21,798 --> 03:02:25,258
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1289
03:02:26,436 --> 03:02:28,806
It's never really healed.

1290
03:02:33,109 --> 03:02:37,739
"There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.

1291
03:02:39,148 --> 03:02:42,457
And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."

1292
03:02:43,419 --> 03:02:45,669
You finished it.

1293
03:02:48,458 --> 03:02:49,798
Not quite.

1294
03:02:50,793 --> 03:02:52,663
There's room for a little more.

1295
03:02:55,998 --> 03:02:59,627
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

1296
03:03:00,303 --> 03:03:03,203
... that each of us must come and go
in the telling.

1297
03:03:04,507 --> 03:03:06,997
Bilbo's story was now over.

1298
03:03:07,844 --> 03:03:10,393
There would be no more journeys
for him...

1299
03:03:10,913 --> 03:03:12,283
... Save one.

1300
03:03:13,216 --> 03:03:16,346
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

1301
03:03:16,953 --> 03:03:18,703
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1302
03:03:19,121 --> 03:03:21,520
The Elves have accorded you
a special honor...

1303
03:03:22,024 --> 03:03:24,333
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1304
03:03:26,128 --> 03:03:28,088
Frodo...

1305
03:03:29,432 --> 03:03:33,412
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1306
03:03:34,637 --> 03:03:36,947
The one I gave you.

1307
03:03:40,510 --> 03:03:42,410
Sorry, Uncle.

1308
03:03:45,248 --> 03:03:47,528
I'm afraid I lost it.

1309
03:03:48,017 --> 03:03:49,597
Oh.

1310
03:03:50,253 --> 03:03:52,153
Pity.

1311
03:03:54,657 --> 03:03:58,056
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1312
03:04:27,657 --> 03:04:32,077
Well, here's a sight
l have never seen before.

1313
03:04:46,943 --> 03:04:49,842
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1314
03:04:51,047 --> 03:04:53,507
The time has come...

1315
03:04:54,016 --> 03:04:56,916
...for the dominion of Men.

1316
03:05:09,632 --> 03:05:11,532
I think I'm...

1317
03:05:11,968 --> 03:05:15,808
... quite ready
for another adventure.

1318
03:05:47,470 --> 03:05:49,460
Farewell...

1319
03:05:49,939 --> 03:05:52,339
...my brave Hobbits.

1320
03:05:54,644 --> 03:05:57,634
My work is now finished.

1321
03:06:00,249 --> 03:06:04,759
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1322
03:06:06,055 --> 03:06:08,545
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1323
03:06:12,428 --> 03:06:14,648
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1324
03:06:15,598 --> 03:06:19,138
...for not all tears are an evil.

1325
03:06:36,986 --> 03:06:38,856
It is time, Frodo.

1326
03:06:44,427 --> 03:06:46,827
What does he mean?

1327
03:06:49,131 --> 03:06:51,651
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1328
03:06:53,602 --> 03:06:56,002
And it has been saved.

1329
03:07:00,009 --> 03:07:02,289
But not for me.

1330
03:07:03,579 --> 03:07:05,749
You don't mean that.

1331
03:07:07,249 --> 03:07:09,089
You can't leave.

1332
03:07:17,793 --> 03:07:20,193
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1333
03:10:53,709 --> 03:10:56,229
My dear Sam:

1334
03:10:58,480 --> 03:11:01,350
You cannot always be forn in two.

1335
03:11:01,917 --> 03:11:05,546
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

1336
03:11:06,822 --> 03:11:12,182
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and fo do.

1337
03:11:13,529 --> 03:11:16,809
Your part in the story will go on.

1338
03:11:17,433 --> 03:11:19,303
Well...

1339
03:11:20,803 --> 03:11:23,053
...[m back.

1340
03:13:05,407 --> 03:13:10,157
Lay down

1341
03:13:10,979 --> 03:13:16,219
Your sweet and weary head

1342
03:13:17,119 --> 03:13:20,689
Night is falling

1343
03:13:21,356 --> 03:13:26,046
You have come
To journey's end

1344
03:13:26,862 --> 03:13:30,171
Sleep now

1345
03:13:30,799 --> 03:13:36,949
And dream
Of the ones who came before

1346
03:13:38,006 --> 03:13:41,666
They are calling

1347
03:13:42,344 --> 03:13:46,944
From across
The distant shore

1348
03:13:47,749 --> 03:13:52,349
Why do you weep?

1349
03:13:53,155 --> 03:13:57,515
What are these tears
Upon your face?

1350
03:13:58,293 --> 03:14:02,683
Soon you will see

1351
03:14:03,465 --> 03:14:07,825
All of your fears
Will pass away

1352
03:14:08,637 --> 03:14:13,057
Safe in my arms

1353
03:14:13,876 --> 03:14:17,796
You're only sleeping

1354
03:14:18,547 --> 03:14:22,937
What can you see

1355
03:14:23,719 --> 03:14:28,319
On the horizon?

1356
03:14:29,124 --> 03:14:33,104
Why do the white gulls

1357
03:14:33,829 --> 03:14:37,958
Call?

1358
03:14:38,700 --> 03:14:43,620
Across the sea

1359
03:14:44,506 --> 03:14:49,135
A pale moon rises

1360
03:14:49,945 --> 03:14:52,315
The ships have come

1361
03:14:52,814 --> 03:14:59,674
To carry you home

1362
03:15:00,789 --> 03:15:04,799
And all will turn

1363
03:15:05,527 --> 03:15:10,217
To silver glass

1364
03:15:11,033 --> 03:15:14,752
A light on the water

1365
03:15:15,470 --> 03:15:20,269
All souls pass

1366
03:15:21,143 --> 03:15:25,863
Hope fades

1367
03:15:26,682 --> 03:15:31,692
Into the world of night

1368
03:15:32,554 --> 03:15:36,474
Through shadows falling

1369
03:15:37,192 --> 03:15:42,171
Out of memory and time

1370
03:15:43,031 --> 03:15:46,871
Don't say

1371
03:15:47,569 --> 03:15:52,549
We have come now fo the end

1372
03:15:53,442 --> 03:15:57,312
White shores are calling

1373
03:15:58,013 --> 03:16:00,913
You and will meet again

1374
03:16:01,483 --> 03:16:08,073
And you'll be here
in my arms

1375
03:16:09,157 --> 03:16:12,527
Just sleeping

1376
03:16:13,161 --> 03:16:17,791
What can you see

1377
03:16:18,600 --> 03:16:22,960
On the horizon?

1378
03:16:23,772 --> 03:16:27,962
Why do the white gulls

1379
03:16:28,710 --> 03:16:33,490
Call?

1380
03:16:34,316 --> 03:16:38,766
Across the sea

1381
03:16:39,554 --> 03:16:43,944
A pale moon rises

1382
03:16:44,726 --> 03:16:47,186
The ships have come

1383
03:16:47,696 --> 03:16:54,176
To carry you home

1384
03:16:55,270 --> 03:16:59,490
And all will turn

1385
03:17:00,242 --> 03:17:05,042
To silver glass

1386
03:17:05,914 --> 03:17:09,544
A light on the water

1387
03:17:10,218 --> 03:17:13,528
Grey ships pass

1388
03:17:14,156 --> 03:17:19,226
Into the West
