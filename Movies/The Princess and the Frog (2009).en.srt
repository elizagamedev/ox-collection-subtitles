1
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:56,752
The Evening Star is shining bright

2
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:02,650
So make a wish and hold on tight

3
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:08,791
There's magic in the air tonight

4
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:14,754
And anything can happen

5
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,849
"Just at that moment,

6
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,871
"the ugly little frog looked up with
his sad, round eyes and pleaded,

7
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,727
"Oh, please, dear princess,

8
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,459
“only a kiss from you
can break this terrible spell

9
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,923
“that was inflicted on me
by a wicked witch!"

10
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,297
Here comes my favorite part.

11
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:41,366
"And the beautiful princess was
so moved by his desperate plea

12
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:46,298
"that she stooped down,
picked up the slippery creature,

13
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:51,461
"leaned forward, raised him to her lips,

14
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,889
"and kissed that little frog!

15
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:01,704
"Then, the frog was transformed
into a handsome prince.

16
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:06,729
"They were married and lived
happily ever after. The end."

17
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,787
Read it again! Read it again!

18
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,559
Sorry, Charlotte.
It's time for us to be heading home.

19
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,172
Say "good night,” Tiana.

20
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,046
There is no way
in this whole wide world

21
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,646
I would ever, ever, ever...

22
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,247
I mean, never kiss a frog. Yuck!

23
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,801
Is that so?

24
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,820
Well, here's your
Prince Charming, Tia.

25
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,439
-Come on. Kiss him.
-No.

26
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,707
-Kiss him!
-Stop it!

27
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,442
-Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him!
-[ won't, ! won't, 1 won't!

28
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,168
I would do it. 1 would kiss a frog.

29
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,171
I would kiss a hundred frogs

30
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,213
if l could marry a prince
and be a princess.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,870
You girls, stop tormenting
that poor little kitty.

32
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,965
Poor little thing.

33
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,414
Evening, Eudora.

34
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,335
Daddy! Daddy!
Look at my new dress. Isn't it pretty?

35
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:03,939
Look at you.

36
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,323
Why, I'd expect nothing less

37
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,695
from the finest seamstress
in New Orleans.

38
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,358
l want that dress!

39
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,441
-Now, sugarplum...
-l want that one!

40
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,103
Please, please, please, please!

41
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,354
Eudora, you suppose you could whip
something up like that?

42
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,114
Anything for my best customer.

43
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,603
Come along, Tiana. Your daddy
should be home from work by now.

44
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,507
All right now, princess,
you're getting that dress, but that's it.

45
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,885
No more Mr. Pushover.

46
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,533
Now, who wants a puppy?

47
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,182
I do! 1 do! He's so cute!

48
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,307
Gumbo smells good, Tiana.

49
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,076
I think it's done, Daddy.

50
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,897
Yeah? Are you sure?

51
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,113
-Absolutely positive?
-Yes.

52
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,472
Okay, I'm about to put this spoon
.
In my...

53
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,945
Wait!

54
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,216
Done.

55
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,474
-What?
-Well, sweetheart,

56
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,591
this is the best gumbo I've ever tasted!

57
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:31,065
Come here.
Eudora, our little girl's got a gift.

58
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,561
I could've told you that.

59
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,056
A gift this special just got to be shared.

60
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,649
Hey, everybody, I made gumbo!

61
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,339
That smells good!

62
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,510
I got some hush puppies, Tiana.
Here I come!

63
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,933
You know the thing about good food?

64
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,248
It brings folks together
from all walks of life.

65
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,625
It warms them right up
and it puts little smiles on their faces.

66
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,400
And when I open up
my own restaurant,

67
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,546
I tell you, people are going
to line up for miles around

68
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,491
just to get a taste of my food.

69
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,231
Our food.

70
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,471
That's right, baby. Our food.

71
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,262
That's right, baby. Our food.

72
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,726
-Daddy! Look!
-Where are you going?

73
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,015
Charlotte's fairy tale book said

74
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:21,164
if you make a wish on the Evening Star,
it's sure to come true.

75
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,469
Well, you wish on that star, sweetheart.

76
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,015
Yes. You wish and you dream
with all your little heart.

77
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,342
But you remember, Tiana, that

78
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,567
that old star can only take you
part of the way.

79
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,697
You got to help it along with
some hard work of your own,

80
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,600
and then, yeah, you can do anything
you set your mind to.

81
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,717
Just promise your daddy one thing.

82
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,993
That you'll never, ever lose sight
of what's really important.

83
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,074
Okay?

84
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,532
See you in the morning, babycakes.

85
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,258
Get some sleep.

86
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,810
Please, please, please!

87
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,991
Well, Miss Tiana, rough night for tips,
but every little penny counts.

88
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,959
Don't you worry, Daddy.

89
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,284
We'll be there soon.

90
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,472
Good night, Cal's.
Good morning, Duke's.

91
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,507
In the south land, there's a city

92
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,138
Way down on the river

93
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,500
Where the women are very pretty
And all the men deliver

94
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,893
They got music, it's always playing

95
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,154
Start in the daytime
Go all through the night

96
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,762
When you hear that music playing

97
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,051
Hear what I'm sayin’
It make you feel all right

98
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,542
Grab somebody, come on down

99
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,453
Bring your paintbrush
We painting the town

100
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,908
There's some sweetness goin’ round

101
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,615
Catch it down in New Orleans

102
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,334
We got magic, good and bad

103
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:22,385
We got magic, good and bad

104
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,232
Make you happy or make you real sad

105
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,846
Get everything you want
Lose what you had

106
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,179
Down here in New Orleans

107
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,301
Hey, partner!
Don't be shy

108
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,891
Come on down, yeah, and give us a try

109
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:46,725
If you wanna do some livin’
before you die

110
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:46,746
If you wanna do some livin’
before you die

111
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,640
Do it down in New Orleans

112
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,971
Stately homes and mansions

113
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:12,257
Of the sugar barons
and the cotton kings

114
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,805
Rich people, poor people
all got dreams

115
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:22,228
Dreams do come true in New Orleans

116
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,005
Order up!

117
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,647
-Another coffee here, chére.
-Coming right up, Virgil.

118
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,747
-Hey, Tiana!
-Morning, Georgia.

119
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,508
-Hey, how you doing, Tiana?
-Hey, y'all.

120
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,154
We all going out dancing tonight.
Care to join us?

121
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,512
-Yeah, come on. Live a little.
-Come on, Tiana.

122
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,680
-You can dance with me.
-It's Mardi Gras.

123
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,619
You know I got two left feet.
Besides, I'm...

124
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,003
You need a napkin, sweetheart?

125
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,305
I'm going to work a double shift tonight.

126
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,077
Here are your hotcakes.
You know, so I can...

127
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,082
So you can save for your restaurant.
I know, I know.

128
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,702
Girl, all you ever do is work.

129
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,938
-Order up!
-Maybe next time.

130
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,849
I told y'all she wouldn't come.

131
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,881
Are you talking about
that dang restaurant again?

132
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,952
Buford, your eggs are burning.

133
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,388
You ain't never going to get enough
for the down payment.

134
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,737
-I'm getting close.
-Yeah, how close?

135
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,087
Where are my flapjacks?

136
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,498
You got about as much chance
of getting that restaurant

137
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,375
as I do of winning the Kentucky Derby!

138
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,431
Saddle me up, y'all! It's post time.

139
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,185
Giddyup, giddyup.

140
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,584
-Morning, Mr. La Bouff.
-Good morning, Tiana.

141
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,396
Congratulations on being voted
King of the Mardi Gras parade.

142
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,262
Caught me completely by surprise,

143
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,573
for the fifth year in a row!

144
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,507
Now, how about ! celebrate with...

145
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,302
Beignets?
Got a fresh batch just waiting for you.

146
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,025
Well, keep them coming till 1 pass out.

147
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,438
Oh, Tia!

148
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,983
-Tia, Tia, Tia, did you hear the news?
-Hey, Charlotte.

149
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:51,834
-Tia, Tia, Tia, did you hear the news?
-Hey, Charlotte.

150
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,691
Tell her. Oh, tell her, Big Daddy!

151
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,630
Yeah, Prince Naveen...

152
00:10:55,955 --> 00:11:00,525
Prince Naveen of Maldonia
is coming to New Orleans!

153
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,930
Isn't he the bee's knees?

154
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,363
Tell her what you did, Big Daddy.
Tell her!

155
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,829
-Well, I invited...
-Big Daddy invited the prince

156
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,536
to our masquerade ball tonight!

157
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,267
to our masquerade ball tonight!

158
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,398
Tell her what else you did, Big Daddy.
Go on.

159
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,249
-And he's staying...
-And he's staying...

160
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,448
And he's staying in our house
as my personal guest.

161
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,843
Lottie, that's swell.

162
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,200
A little word of advice.
My mama always said,

163
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,896
"The quickest way to a man's heart
is through his stomach."

164
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,712
-That's it!
-What just happened?

165
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,142
Tia! You are a bona fide genius.

166
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,588
I'm going to need about 500
of your man-catching beignets

167
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,411
for my ball tonight.

168
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,872
Excuse me, Daddy.
Will this about cover it?

169
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,540
This should cover it just fine, Lottie.

170
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,166
This is it! I'm getting my restaurant!

171
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,120
Tonight my prince is finally coming.

172
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,159
And I sure as heck ain't letting him go!

173
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,667
Everything looks peachy-keen,
Mr. Fenner and Mr. Fenner.

174
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,691
We'll have all the paperwork ready
to sign, first thing after Mardi Gras.

175
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,318
I'll do you one better.
Why don't I sign them tonight

176
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,633
when I see y'all
at the La Bouffs' masquerade ball?

177
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,773
You drive a hard bargain, Tiana!

178
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,764
You drive a hard bargain, Tiana!

179
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,490
Table for one, please?

180
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,329
Mama.

181
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,420
Here's a little something
to help you get started.

182
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,180
Daddy's gumbo pot.

183
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,463
I know.

184
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,852
I miss him, too.

185
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,589
Well, now. Hurry up and open the door!

186
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,969
Just look at it, Mama.

187
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,608
Doesn't it just make you want to cry?

188
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,599
Yes.

189
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,650
The maitre d' is going to be right
where you're standing.

190
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,259
And over here, a gourmet kitchen!

191
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,718
And hanging from the ceiling,
a big old crystal chandelier!

192
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,133
You're your daddy's daughter, all right.

193
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,475
He used to go on and on
about this old sugar mill, too.

194
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,208
Babycakes, I'm sure this place
is going to be just wonderful,

195
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,689
but it's a shame
you are working so hard.

196
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,401
But how can I let up now
when I'm so close?

197
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,320
I got to make sure all Daddy's
hard work means something.

198
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,027
Tiana.

199
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,412
Your daddy may not have gotten
the place he always wanted,

200
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,764
but he had something better.

201
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,214
He had love.

202
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,026
And that's all want for you,
sweetheart,

203
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,753
to meet your Prince Charming

204
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,568
and dance off into
your happily ever after.

205
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,647
Mama! I don't have time for dancing.

206
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,098
That's just gonna have to wait a while

207
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,800
How long we talking about here?

208
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,692
Ain't got time for messing around

209
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,726
And it's not my style

210
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:52,901
l want some grandkids!

211
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,800
This old town can slow you down

212
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,504
People taking the easy way

213
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,585
People taking the easy way

214
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,931
But I know exactly where I'm going

215
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,987
I'm getting closer and closer every day

216
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,497
And I'm almost there

217
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,660
I'm almost there

218
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,860
People down here think I'm crazy

219
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,319
But I don't care

220
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,652
Trials and tribulations

221
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,412
I've had my share

222
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,052
There ain't nothing gonna stop me now

223
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,608
‘Cause I'm almost there

224
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,452
! remember Daddy told me

225
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,499
Fairy tales can come true

226
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,122
You got to make them happen

227
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,655
It all depends on you

228
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,124
So work real hard
each and every day

229
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,907
Now things for sure are going my way

230
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,421
Just doing what I do

231
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,047
Look out, boys, I'm coming through

232
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,776
And I'm almost there

233
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,973
I'm almost there

234
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,353
People gonna come here
from everywhere

235
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,295
And I'm almost there

236
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,055
I'm almost there

237
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,299
There's been trials and tribulations

238
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,831
You know I've had my share

239
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,987
But I've climbed a mountain
I've crossed a river

240
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,100
And I'm almost there

241
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,002
I'm almost there

242
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:48,713
I'm almost there

243
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,993
Excuse me!

244
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,930
You need a hand there, buddy?

245
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,005
Yes!

246
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,988
Sire!
I've been looking for you everywhere.

247
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,159
What a coincidence, Lawrence.

248
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,191
I have been avoiding you everywhere.

249
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,636
We're going to be late
for the masquerade.

250
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,808
Listen, Lawrence, listen!

251
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,031
It's jazz. It's jazz music!

252
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,860
It was born here.

253
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,863
Is beautiful, no?

254
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,639
No.

255
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,155
Dance with me, fat man.

256
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,501
Stay loose, Lawrence!

257
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,055
We're supposed to be
at the La Bouff estate by now!

258
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,381
Yes, yes, yes,
but first 1 buy everyone here a drink!

259
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,814
With what?

260
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,871
At this point, you have two choices,

261
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,228
woo and marry a rich young lady

262
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,634
or get a job!

263
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,684
All right. Fine. But first we dance!

264
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,250
No, this is idiocy!

265
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,225
For someone who cannot see his feet,
you're very light on them!

266
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,322
Is perfect!
You finally got into the music.

267
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,295
Do you get my joke?

268
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,721
Because your head is... It's in the tuba.

269
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,199
-Get me out!
-All right.

270
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,793
Hold on. One...

271
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,469
How degrading!
I've never been so humiliated.

272
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:45,894
Hello.

273
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,067
Gentlemen!

274
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,458
A tip of the hat from Dr. Facilier.

275
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,205
How y'all doing?

276
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,445
"Tarot readings, charms, potions.
Dreams made real."

277
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,376
"Tarot readings, charms, potions.
Dreams made real."

278
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,382
Were l a betting man, and I'm not,
Il stay away from games of chance...

279
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:09,721
Sire!

280
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:14,616
I'd wager I'm in the company
of visiting royalty.

281
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:16,982
Lawrence. Lawrence!

282
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,539
This remarkable gentleman
has just read my palm.

283
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,240
Or this morning's newspaper.

284
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,856
Sire!
This chap is obviously a charlatan.

285
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,515
Il suggest we move on to a less...

286
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,129
Don't you disrespect me, little man

287
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,126
Don't you derogate or deride

288
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,750
You're in my world now, not your world

289
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,455
And ! got friends on the other side

290
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,795
And ! got friends on the other side

291
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,960
-He's got friends on the other side
-He's got friends on the other side

292
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,735
That's an echo, gentlemen.

293
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,337
Just a little something we have here
in Louisiana, little parlor trick.

294
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:54,696
Don't worry.

295
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,308
Sit down at my table

296
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,456
Put your minds at ease

297
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:05,717
If you relax, it will enable me
to do anything I please

298
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,186
! can read your future

299
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,722
! can change it round some, too

300
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,987
! look deep into your heart and soul

301
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,238
You do have a soul
don't you, Lawrence?

302
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,280
Make your wildest dreams come true

303
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,990
! got voodoo, ! got hoodoo

304
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,431
got things I ain't even tried

305
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,790
And ! got friends on the other side

306
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,669
-He's got friends on the other side
-He's got friends on the other side

307
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:36,218
The cards, the cards
The cards will tell

308
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,716
The past, the present
and the future, as well

309
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,692
The cards, the cards, just take three

310
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:49,078
Take a little trip into your future
with me

311
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,650
Now you, young man
are from across the sea

312
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,933
You come from two long lines
of royalty

313
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,158
I'm a royal myself on my mother's side.

314
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,124
Your lifestyle's high

315
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,354
But your funds are low

316
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,884
You need to marry a little honey
whose daddy got dough

317
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,752
Mom and Dad cut you off,
huh, playboy?

318
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,394
Sad but true.

319
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,435
Now y'all got to get hitched.
But hitching ties you down.

320
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,382
You just want to be free,
hop from place to place.

321
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,195
But freedom takes green.

322
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:33,672
It's the green, it's the green
It's the green you need

323
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,810
And when I! look into your future
it's the green that Il seen

324
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,094
On you, little man
! don't want to waste much time

325
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,644
You been pushed round all your life

326
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,107
You been pushed round
by your mother

327
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,700
And your sister and your brother

328
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,286
And if you was married

329
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,675
You'd be pushed round by your wife

330
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,698
But in your future, the you I see

331
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,542
ls exactly the man
you always wanted to be

332
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,566
Shake my hand

333
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,989
Come on, boys
Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?

334
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,378
Yes

335
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,444
Are you ready?

336
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,822
-Are you ready?
-Are you ready?

337
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,449
Are you ready?

You're changing, you're changing

345
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,992
You're changing, all right

-But you lost what you had

352
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,710
Hush

353
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,852
Senator Johnson. Hey, Jimmy.

354
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,412
I hope you're leaving some of them
beignets for your constituents.

355
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,101
Here you go, piping hot.

356
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,748
Stella. Excuse me. Stella, no. No.

357
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,284
Okay, but just one.

358
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:38,507
But, Miss Charlotte,
you said "later" two hours ago.

359
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:43,818
Travis, when a woman says "later,"
she really means "not ever."

360
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,493
Now run along.

361
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:49,861
There are plenty of young fillies dying
for you to waltz them into a stupor.

362
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,236
-Give me them napkins, quick!
-What on earth for?

363
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,880
l swear, I'm sweating
like a sinner in church.

364
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,147
Tia, it's getting to be so late!

365
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,649
There's still a few stragglers.

366
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:02,011
It's just not fair!
My prince is never coming!

367
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,978
-Now, Lottie...
-l never get anything I wish for!

368
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,726
Lottie, wait!

369
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,479
Just calm down. Take a deep...

370
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,457
Maybe I just got to wish harder.

371
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,949
Please, please, please,
please, please, please!

372
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,102
Lottie, you can't just wish on a star
and expect things...

373
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,293
Ladies and gentlemen!

374
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:23,142
His Royal Highness, Prince Naveen!

375
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,634
Evening, Tiana. Marvelous party.

376
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,956
Evening, Mr. Fenner and Mr. Fenner.

377
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,854
Fine-smelling beignets.

378
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,995
Going to be the house specialty
once I sign those papers y'all brought.

379
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,982
Yes. About that.

380
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,192
You were outbid.

381
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,258
-What?
-A fellow came in,

382
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,756
offered the full amount in cash.

383
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,159
Unless you can top his offer
by Wednesday...

384
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,318
You can kiss that place goodbye.

385
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,573
You know how long it took me
to save that money?

386
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,277
Exactly!

387
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:42,565
Which is why a little woman
of your background

388
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:46,072
would have had her hands full
trying to run a big business like that.

389
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,335
No, you're better off where you're at.

390
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,296
-Now, wait a minute...
-Love those beignets, though.

391
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,872
Now, hold on there! You come back...

392
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,910
Tia! Time to hit Prince Charming
with those man-catching...

393
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,037
What happened?

394
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,519
-L... [ just...
-You poor dear.

395
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:10,533
Oh, Prince Naveen,
we'll be right back, sugar!

396
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,210
I got just the dress for you.

397
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,210
Tia, honey, did you see the way
he danced with me?

398
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,414
A marriage proposal
can't be far behind.

399
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,817
Thank you, Evening Star!

400
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:29,267
You know, I was starting to think that
wishing on stars was just for babies

401
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,864
and crazy people.

402
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,936
Look at you.

403
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,145
Aren't you just as pretty
as a magnolia in May?

404
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,827
Seems like only yesterday
we were both little girls

405
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,424
dreaming our fairy tale dreams,

406
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,680
and tonight they're finally coming true.

407
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,954
Well, back into the fray.

408
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,018
Wish me luck!

409
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,809
Oh, Naveen...

410
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,847
Almost

411
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,494
Almost there

412
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:23,121
People would have come
from everywhere

413
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:28,863
! was almost there

414
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,155
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

415
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,934
Please, please, please.

416
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,253
Very funny.

417
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,879
So what now? I reckon you want a kiss?

418
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,580
Kissing would be nice, yes?

419
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,769
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

420
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,441
I did not mean to scare you.
l... Wait, no, no, no!

421
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,331
Wait. Hold on a sec...

422
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,920
You have a very strong arm, Princess.

423
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,645
Okay, please! Put the monkey down.

424
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,072
Stay back or I'll...

425
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,603
Please, please, please.

426
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:33,025
Oh, wow. Allow me to introduce myself.

427
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:36,322
lam Prince Naveen

428
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,037
of Maldonia.

429
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,639
Prince? But I didn't wish for any...

430
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,283
Hold on. If you're the prince,

431
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,249
then who was that waltzing with Lottie
on the dance floor?

432
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,126
All l know is one minute Il am a prince,

433
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,322
charming and handsome, cutting a rug,

434
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,986
and then the next thing I know,
lam tripping over these.

435
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,554
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

436
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,408
I know this story!

437
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,151
-The Frog Prince?
-Yes!

438
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:15,983
My mother had the servants
read this to me every night.

439
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,534
Yes, yes, yes!

440
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,357
This is exactly the answer!

441
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,245
You must kiss me.

442
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,602
Excuse me?

443
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:26,954
You will enjoy, 1 guarantee.

444
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,102
All women enjoy the kiss
of Prince Naveen.

445
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,039
Come. We pucker.

446
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,113
That's new.

447
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,991
Look, I'm sorry.

448
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:43,267
I'd really like to help you,
but I just do not kiss frogs.

449
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,096
Wait a sec, but on the balcony,
you asked me.

450
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,966
I didn't expect you to answer!

451
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,571
But you must kiss me.

452
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,732
Look, besides being
unbelievably handsome, okay,

453
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,812
l also happen to come from
a fabulously wealthy family.

454
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,259
Surely I could offer you
some type of reward,

455
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,072
a wish I could grant, perhaps?

456
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:01,893
a wish I could grant, perhaps?

457
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:02,976
Yes?

458
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,607
Just one kiss?

459
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,356
Just one, unless you beg for more.

460
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,632
Okay, Tiana, you can do this.
You can do this.

461
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,629
Just a little kiss. Just a little kiss. Okay.

462
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,552
You don't look that much different,
but how did you get way up there?

463
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,846
And how did I get way down here
in all this...

464
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,801
Easy, Princess. Princess, do not panic!

465
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,816
What did you do to me?
I'm green and I'm slimy!

466
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,834
-No! No, no, no, that is not slime.
-What?

467
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,410
-You are secreting mucus.
-You... You...

468
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,492
Hey, Stella!

469
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:34,662
Get them frogs!

470
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,303
-Run!
-l can't run. I'm a frog!

471
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,276
Then hop!

472
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,962
Down, boy. Down, monster dog!

473
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,200
En garde!

474
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,209
-Look out! Out of the way!
-Oh, no!

475
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,128
-Where are we going?
-Excuse me!

476
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,700
-l can't see a thing!
-Neither can I!

477
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,747
-Wait! Stella!
-Going up!

478
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,199
-Stella, it's me, Tiana!
-Tiana?

479
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,915
Stella just talked to me.
The dog just spoke to me!

480
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:12,024
You know, if you're going
to let every little thing bother you,

481
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,934
it's going to be a very long night!

482
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:25,793
Oh, dear.

483
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:27,808
You're so quiet.

484
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,196
You let him go?

485
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:33,734
The poor devil was gasping,
so I loosened the lid ever so slightly.

486
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:41,698
Now how did I ever get tangled up
in all this voodoo madness?

487
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,294
l can't go through with this!

488
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,984
You wear this ghastly thing!

489
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,931
Careful with that!

490
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,856
Anything happens to this,
I'm going to be...

491
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,414
Fun fact about voodoo, Larry.

492
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,108
Can't conjure a thing for myself.

493
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:09,944
Besides, you and I both know
the real power in this world ain't magic.

494
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,623
It's money!

495
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,802
Buckets of it.

496
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,117
-That's true.
-Aren't you tired

497
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,535
of living on the margins while
all those fat cats in their fancy cars

498
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,562
don't give you so much
as a sideways glance?

499
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,229
Yes. lam.

500
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,605
All you got to do is marry
Big Daddy's little princess,

501
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,485
and we'll be splitting that juicy
La Bouff fortune right down the middle.

502
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,601
-60-40, like I said.
-Yeah.

503
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,059
But what about Naveen?

504
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:44,089
Your little slip-up will be
a minor bump in the road,

505
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,505
so long as we've got
the prince's blood in this.

506
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,080
Yes.

507
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,735
Voodoo?

508
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,231
You mean to tell me this all happened

509
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,059
because you were messing
with the Shadow Man?

510
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,077
He was very charismatic.

511
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,897
It serves me right for wishing on stars.

512
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,939
The only way to get what you want
in this world is through hard work.

513
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,989
Hard work? Why would
a princess need to work hard?

514
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,974
I'm not a princess. I'm a waitress.

515
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,409
A waitress?

516
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,321
Well, no wonder the kiss did not work.
You lied to me!

517
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,670
No, I... lnever said l was a princess.

518
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,023
You never said that
you were a waitress!

519
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,772
You... You were wearing a crown!

520
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,380
It was a costume party,
you spoiled little rich boy!

521
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,631
Oh, yes?
Well, the egg is on your face, all right?

522
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,481
-Because I do not have any riches.
-What?

523
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:37,814
lam completely broke!

524
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,776
You said you were fabulously wealthy!

525
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,867
No. My parents are fabulously wealthy,
but they cut me off for being a...

526
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,584
Leech! Leech!

527
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,943
You're broke,
and you had the gall to call me a liar?

528
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,390
It was not a lie. I fully...

529
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,216
Run!

530
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,264
I fully intend to be rich again.

531
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,757
Once I marry Miss Charlotte La Bouff.
If she will have me.

532
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,503
-You're a prince?
-Obviously.

533
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,025
She'll have you.

534
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:32,723
All right, then.

535
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,281
Once you two are married,
you are going to keep your promise

536
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,107
and get me my restaurant, right?

537
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,839
Not so fast. l made that promise to
a beautiful princess, not a cranky...

538
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,223
Why are those logs moving?

539
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,536
Those aren't logs.

540
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,926
I got dibs on the big one.

541
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,495
Where'd they go?

542
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,301
-Where'd they go?
-l saw him first!

543
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,480
Come here, you plump, tasty morsel!

544
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,609
That's my tail, pea brain!

545
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,308
Where did they go? Come on!

546
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,477
Lower the vine.

547
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:15,646
Find your own tree.

548
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,314
-There he is!
-l see him! I see him!

549
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,423
All right. Look, look.
Help me get out of this swamp,

550
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,004
and once I marry Charlotte,
I shall get you your restaurant.

551
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,671
You're going to taste so good
basted and battered and fried!

552
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,766
-Quick, quick! Pull me up!
-You can hop, but you can't hide.

553
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,752
We got all night.

554
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,109
Well, waitress, looks like
we're going to be here for a while.

555
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,502
So we may as well get comfortable.

556
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,606
Keep your slimy self away from me!

557
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,435
I told you, it is not slime! It is mucus!

558
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,666
Rise and shine, sleeping beauty!
Gators are gone.

559
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,239
What?

560
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,804
We got to get back to New Orleans
and undo this mess you got us into.

561
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,764
Il was not the one parading around
with a phony-baloney tiara.

562
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,739
Music to paddle by.

563
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,448
I could use a little help.

564
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,641
I will play a little louder.

565
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,920
How about a little less picking and a...

566
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:30,562
I know that tune! Dippermouth Blues!

567
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,287
Play it, brother!

568
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,131
Oh, yeah!

569
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:47,881
Where you been all my life?

570
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,009
Where did you learn to play like that?

571
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,395
Why, the bayou's the best jazz school
in the world.

572
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,297
All the greats play the riverboats.

573
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:58,806
Old Louis would give anything to be
up there jamming with the big boys.

574
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,413
-Why don't you?
-l tried once.

575
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,447
It didn't end well.

576
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,962
It has been a real pleasure
meeting you, Louis.

577
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,803
And thank you kindly for not eating us,
but we best be on our way.

578
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,953
Where... Where y'all going?

579
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,115
To find somebody to break this spell.

580
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,378
What spell?

581
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,892
Brace yourself, my scaly friend.

582
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,775
We are not frogs.

583
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:33,884
We are humans.

584
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,356
Y'all serious?

585
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:44,011
lam Naveen, Prince of Maldonia.
And she is Tiana, the waitress.

586
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,653
Do not kiss her.

587
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,545
Now, just a second.

588
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,677
This goon here got himself turned into
a frog by a voodoo man, and now...

589
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,830
Voodoo? Like the kind Mama Odie do?

590
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,236
Mama who-dee?

591
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,494
Mama Odie.
She the voodoo queen of the bayou.

592
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:03,911
She got magic and spells,
all kind of hoodoo.

593
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,159
-Could you take us to her?
-Could you take us to her?

594
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,944
Through the deepest, darkest part
of the bayou?

595
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:13,227
Facing razor-sharp pricker bushes
and trappers and hunters with guns?

596
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,385
No.

597
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,419
Watch and learn.

598
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:25,096
Louis, it is too bad we cannot help you
with your dream.

599
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,570
If only you were smaller, less toothy,

600
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,748
you could play jazz to adoring crowds
without scaring them.

601
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,214
Anyway, enjoy your loneliness,
my friend.

602
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,943
Cute, but it's not going to...

603
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,116
Hey, guys, I just had me a crazy idea!

604
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,746
What if l ask Mama Odie
to turn me human?

605
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,058
Louis! You are a genius!

606
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,097
Hallelujah!

607
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:59,991
If } were a human being
I'd head straight for New Orleans

608
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,625
And I'd blow this horn
so hot and strong

609
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,737
Like no one they've ever seen

610
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,326
You heard of Louis Armstrong

611
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,555
Mr. Sidney Bechet

612
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,394
All those boys gonna step aside
when they hear this old ex-gator play

613
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,065
Listen

614
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:18,732
Oh, yeah!

615
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,034
When I'm human
as I hope to be

616
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,592
I'm gonna blow this horn
till the cows come home

617
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,578
And everyone's gonna
bow down to me

618
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,526
Thank you, thank you.

619
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,619
Oh, thank you. I love you, too, baby.

620
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,950
When I'm myself again
! want just the life l had

621
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:47,468
A great big party every night
That doesn't sound too bad

622
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,869
A redhead on my left arm
A brunette on my right

623
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,649
A blonde or two to hold the candles
Now that seems just about right

624
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,094
Eh, Louis?

625
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,938
Life is short
When you're done, you're done

626
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,224
We're on this earth to have some fun

627
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,469
-And that's the way things are
-Tell it, brother!

628
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:07,495
When I'm human, and I'm gonna be

629
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:12,146
I'm gonna tear it up like I did before
And that's a royal guarantee

630
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,680
You are getting married!

631
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,006
Oh, right.

632
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,797
I'll just have to leave
a string of broken hearts behind me!

633
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,970
Your modesty becomes you
and your sense of responsibility

634
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,728
I've worked hard for everything I've got

635
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,964
And that's the way it's supposed to be

636
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:32,016
When I'm a human being
at least I'll act like one

637
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,850
If you do your best
each and every day

638
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,016
Good things are sure
to come your way

639
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,178
What you give is what you get

640
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,406
My daddy said that and I'll never forget

641
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,853
And I commend it to you

642
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,112
-When we're human
-When we're human

643
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,027
-And we're gonna be
-And we're gonna be

644
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,016
I'm gonna blow my horn

645
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,556
I'm gonna live the high life

646
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:58,022
I'm gonna do my best
to take my place in the sun

647
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:03,157
-When we're
-When we're

648
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,045
-Human
-Human

649
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,404
Prince Naveen, dear,
lam positively mortified

650
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:24,341
you had to endure
that frog fiasco last night.

651
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:27,786
Well, when you're next in line
for the throne,

652
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,476
you're poised like a panther,

653
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,548
ready to expect the unexpected.

654
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,403
Your ear?

655
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,625
What?

656
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,404
Those pesky mosquitoes.

657
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,501
They're everywhere. Please.

658
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:59,229
Miss Charlotte, 1 can no longer ignore
the throbbing of my

659
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,206
heart.

660
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:07,725
Even though our time together
has been brief, it's been heavenly!

661
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,483
Land sakes, Prince Naveen!

662
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,221
You got me blushing like a...

663
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,110
Would you do me the honor of
becoming Princess of Maldonia?

664
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,640
Are you serious?

665
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:25,819
As the plague.

666
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,190
Yes!

667
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,845
I most definitely will marry you!

668
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,801
There's so much to plan!
I mean, the guest list,

669
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,776
the dress, the music,
the flowers, the shoes...

670
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,482
We're going to have ourselves
a Mardi Gras wedding!

671
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:44,984
No!

672
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:47,744
What do we do now?

673
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,839
Because somebody let
our froggy prince go, Larry,

674
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:55,368
I'm reduced to asking for help
from my friends on the other side.

675
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,411
Now, this restaurant of yours,
is it going to have étouffée?

676
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,424
Jambalaya, gumbo.
It's going to have it all.

677
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,630
I've always wanted to try red beans
and rice, muffulettas, po' boys.

678
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,621
Stop, Louis.

679
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,230
You two are making me so very hungry.

680
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,049
Interesting.

681
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:18,955
What are you doing?

682
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,917
You are frightening the food.

683
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,196
This is harder than it looks.

684
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:40,232
What? Oh, no. No, no, no.

685
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:45,285
There is no way lam kissing a frog
and eating a bug on the same day.

686
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,080
No! No, no.

687
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,299
-Hello.
-Hold still.

688
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,112
Stop moving!
You are making this very difficult!

689
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:10,005
Y'all find anything to eat yet? Oh, my.

690
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,828
Hang on. Old Louis got it covered.

691
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,461
-No, no...
-Don't...

692
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:18,181
How's that?

693
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,297
This could be a little better.

694
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:22,712
You know what this needs?

695
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,130
A sharp stick! Be right back.

696
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:28,768
-This is all your fault.
-My fault? My fault...

697
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,863
Let me tell you something.
l was having a wonderful time until...

698
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,243
Coo! Well, looky here!

699
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:38,322
Girl, l guess you and your boyfriend
got a little carried away. Am I right?

700
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,046
-Oh, no, no!
-Do not be ridiculous!

701
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,861
-He's not my boyfriend!
-l am the Prince of Maldonia!

702
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,894
Let me shine a little light
on the situation.

703
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,774
Excuse me. One more time now.

704
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,304
That's more better. Yeah.

705
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,593
It's okay, baby. I don't explode me.

706
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:02,515
l ain't no firecracker!

707
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,383
I just got my big butt glowing!
That's right!

708
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,415
The women like a man
with a big back porch!

709
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,962
Lord, you done this up
real good, for sure.

710
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,930
Now where this go to at?

711
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:17,674
Hang on, Cap.
I'm just going to give a little twist here.

712
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:19,769
We're getting to know each other now!

713
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:25,432
Won't you catch a fish?
Catch one, catch two

714
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:29,747
We're back in the bayou
‘round fishin' time

715
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,133
It's about time I introduce myself.

716
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,895
My name Raymond,
but everybody call me "Ray."

717
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:41,006
Pardon me, but your accent,
it's funny, no?

718
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,749
I'm a Cajun, brah.
Born and bred in the bayou.

719
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,329
Y'all must be new around here, huh?

720
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:51,662
Actually, we are from a place
far, far away from this world.

721
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,566
Go to bed! Y'all from Shreveport?

722
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,974
No. No, no, no. We are people.

723
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,502
Prince Charming here
got himself turned into a frog

724
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,091
by a voodoo witch doctor.

725
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:04,531
Well, there you go.

726
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,025
And we were on our way
to Mama Odie's.

727
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:07,557
We think maybe she can...

728
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:10,932
Mama Odie? Y'all headed
the wrong directional, chére.

729
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,959
Now what kind of chucklehead
told y'all to go this way?

730
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:16,045
l found a stick!

731
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,099
Louis.

732
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:23,478
Ray here says you've been taking us
in the wrong direction.

733
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,075
I was... Well, listen.

734
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,750
l was confused by the topography
and the geography

735
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:31,551
and the choreography and...

736
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,482
First rule of the bayou,
never take direction from a gator.

737
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:40,128
Why, me and my relationals
will help show y'all the way.

738
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,404
Hey, Cousin Randy!
You ready for a little bayou zydeco?

739
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,517
Ready when you are, Cousin Ray.

740
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,179
All right, Lulu. Let's get to it, darling.

741
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:56,584
Come on, chére!
Just follow the bouncing butt!

742
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:58,921
We're gonna take you there
We're gonna take you there

743
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,157
We're gonna take you all the way there

744
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,448
Gonna take you there
We're gonna take you there

745
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,250
We're gonna take you all the way

746
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:06,406
Oh, yeah!

747
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:10,314

Goin' down the bayou

Goin' down the bayou
Takin' you all the way

00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,432
We got the whole family.

750
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:18,634
There goes Mimi, Cousin Beaudreaux.

751
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,712
Oh, Grandmama! Your light out!

752
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:28,091
We all gonna pull together
Down here that's how we do

753
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,616
Me for them and them for me

754
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,561
We all be there for you

755
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,723
We gon’ take ya
We gon’ take ya

756
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,225

00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,477
Takin' you all the way

759
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,063
Goin' down the bayou

760
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,268
Goin' down the bayou

761
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,500
Goin' down the bayou

762
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,446
Takin’ you all...

763
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,162
Yeah, you know!

764
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:55,865
Come on, y'all!

765
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:58,887
Keep that line flowin’
and the lights a-glowin'!

766
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,547
Yeah, you're right!

767
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:08,094
Friends, I know I'm in hock
to y'all pretty deep already,

768
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,949
but seems our little froggy prince
lost his way

769
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,904
and I need your generous assistance
getting him back.

770
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,991
Il hear you! Now, what's in it for y'all?

771
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:25,182
Well, as soon as I dispose
of Big Daddy La Bouff

772
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:27,442
and I'm running this town,

773
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:34,453
I'll have the entire city of New Orleans
in the palm of my hand.

774
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,239
And you'll have all the wayward souls
your dark little hearts desire.

775
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,103
Y'all love that, don't you?

776
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,080
So, we got ourselves a deal?

777
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:08,415
Now we're cooking!
We're going to find ourselves a frog!

778
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:11,823
Search everywhere!
The bayou, the Quarter.

779
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:17,066
Bring him to me alive.
I need his heart pumping for now.

780
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,138
I'll take them the rest of the way.

781
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,049
-Nice meeting y'all!
-Bye-bye, Pookie!

782
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,106
Will do, Cousin Ray!

783
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:46,417
And don't forget to tell Angela,
Ray-Ray say, "Bonne chance!"

784
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:49,091
-That's your girl?
-Oh, no, no.

785
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:53,057
My girl? Ho, ho, ho. That's Evangeline.

786
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,737
Evangeline?

787
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,182
She the most prettiest firefly
ever did glow.

788
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:02,824
You know, I talk to Evangeline
most every night.

789
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,763
She's kind of shy. Don't say much.

790
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,813
And I know in my heart

791
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,298
someday we are
going to be together. Yeah.

792
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,274
-That's so sweet.
-Yeah, so sweet.

793
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:18,396
Just do not settle down so quickly,
my friend.

794
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:21,053
There are plenty of fireflies
in the swamp.

795
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:23,453
What?

796
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,466
Pricker bushes got me!

797
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,718
Gator down! Gator down!

798
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:34,448
The darkness is closing in! I'm so cold.

799
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:36,669
Will you hold still, you big baby?

800
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,679
l ain't touched it yet.

801
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,936
Take a look at them two jumpers.

802
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:52,184
I can taste them frog legs already.

803
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:55,543
Bet they taste real good
with the sauce piquant, right, Pa?

804
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,343
Will you keep quiet?

805
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,051
My thoughts exactly, Two Fingers.

806
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,308
It is time to catch us some frogs!

807
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,631
You know, waitress,

808
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,046
I have finally figured out
what is wrong with you.

809
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,465
Have you now?

810
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:26,283
You do not know
how to have fun. There.

811
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:28,434
-Somebody had to say it.
-Thank you,

812
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,362
because I figured out
what your problem is, too.

813
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,632
I'm too wonderful?

814
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:38,242
No, you're a no-'count, philandering,
lazy bump on a log.

815
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,023
Killjoy.

816
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,817
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

817
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,575
-Stick in the mud.
-Listen here, mister.

818
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:49,461
This stick in the mud has had to work
two jobs her whole life

819
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:51,747
while you've been
sucking on a silver spoon

820
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,719
chasing chambermaids
around your ivory tower!

821
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,209
Actually, it's polished marble.

822
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,283
I got me one, boys!
Y'all get that little one over there!

823
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,984
I got me one, boys!
Y'all get that little one over there!

824
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:16,952
That's good hunting today, yes, indeed!

825
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,178
Hunters with guns!

826
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,485
Look at them big frog legs.

827
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,096
l want me some corn bread
with this dinner!

828
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:29,976
Oh, no! A bug got to do
what a bug got to do!

829
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,146
I think I done chipped my favorite tooth.

830
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,247
Here I come, Two Fingers! I'll help...

831
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,145
Pa! We got one!

832
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,822
Shush now! Get on quiet there!

833
00:52:58,242 --> 00:52:59,442
What happened to yours?

834
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,700
Shut your trap, Darnell!

835
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:03,516
Free!

836
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,604
Pa, did you hear that suspicious thud?

837
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:25,292
Yeah. I sure did.

838
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,775
What are you two gawking at?

839
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,381
Just missed him!

840
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,331
I will make him pay for his insolence!

841
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,240
Two Fingers!
I need some help over here!

842
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,736
-Now! Go!
-Would you stop that?

843
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:46,749
Hold still.

844
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,027
No, no, no. No, you idiot, not there!

845
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,083
Watch this.

846
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,839
Missed it!

847
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,676
Get them froggies!

848
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:19,709
These two ain't like
no frogs I ever seen.

849
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,464
They smart.

850
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:22,835
And we talk, too.

851
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:36,195
You all right there, little bug?

852
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,180
I'm fine. But your breath
done near kill me to death.

853
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,573
-Would you mind?
-l got you covered, brah.

854
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,184
Much obliged, peewee.

855
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:52,953
Now how about the other side?

856
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,874
"And we talk, too." I like that.
You are secretly funny.

857
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,305
-Not a stick in the mud? Say it. Say it.
-Well, [ wouldn't go...

858
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,819
-All right. You're not exactly...
-l can't hear you. I'm sorry. What?

859
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,085
..a complete stick deep in the mud.

860
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:10,703
Easy. Easy!

861
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,114
-This one's in there, ain't it? Hold on.
-Holy...

862
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,167
Chére, I know we gots to get
to Mama Odie lickety-split,

863
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:21,424
but this particular extractification
is going to take a while.

864
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:22,902
Yeah.

865
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,313
Poor Louis.

866
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:26,194
You know what would make me
feel better?

867
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,611
Crawfish smothered in
rémoulade sauce... Mercy!

868
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,811
-Just a little more!
-With some Bananas Foster

869
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,473
sprinkled with pralines...

870
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:35,892
Oh, Mama!

871
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,383
-How about some swamp gumbo?
-That will do.

872
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,507
Sounds delicious.
I'll start with a pre-dinner cocktail

873
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,686
and something to nibble on
while I wait. Thanks.

874
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,806
No, no, no, your royal highness.

875
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,089
You are going to
mince these mushrooms.

876
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,078
-Do what?
-Mince the mushrooms!

877
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:55,991
Hop to it!

878
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:58,664
-Little ridiculous.
-Are you mincing?

879
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,769
All right! Relax.

880
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:13,636
One.

881
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,231
Step aside, mister.

882
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,940
Watch and learn.

883
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,618
All right.

884
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,346
-There you go.
-You know,

885
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:31,275
I've never done
anything like this before.

886
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,595
-Really?
-All right.

887
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,446
But when you live in a castle,
everything is done for you.

888
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:40,433
All the time. They dress you.
They feed you. Drive you.

889
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,051
Brush your teeth.

890
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:44,319
Oh, poor baby.

891
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:48,102
l admit it was a charmed life
until the day my parents cut me off,

892
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,095
and suddenly I realized

893
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,305
I don't know how to do anything.

894
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,640
Well, hey, you got the makings
of a decent mushroom mincer.

895
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:06,312
You think so?

896
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,926
Keep practicing
and I just might hire you.

897
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,409
-Really?
-No.

898
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:15,691
Come on! What was that?
That was below the frog belt.

899
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,969
.. you going to see a blind nutria.
You say, "Hello." And he say, "What?"

900
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,235
And you say, "That a ugly fish."

901
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,620
Anyone for seconds?

902
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:44,958
That was magnificent!
You truly have a gift.

903
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:48,763
Why, thank you.

904
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:52,634
There she is.

905
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:56,223
The sweetest firefly in all creation.

906
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:57,823
Evangeline?

907
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,015
l want to meet this girl. Where she at?

908
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,161
How you can miss her?

909
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,063
She glowing right up there
in front of y'all.

910
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:11,635
Look how she lights up the sky

911
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,220
Ma belle Evangeline

912
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,498
That ain't no fire...

913
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:23,863
So far above me, yet!

914
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:29,188
Know her heart belongs to only me

915
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,184
l adore you.

916
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,909
Il love you.

917
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,551
I'm just translating.

918
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,036
You're my queen of the night

919
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:41,822
So still, so bright

920
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,982
That someone as beautiful as she

921
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,981
Could love someone like me

922
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:53,245
No. I don't dance.

923
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:56,847
Love always finds a way, it's true

924
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:58,571
I've never danced.

925
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,965
And I love you, Evangeline

926
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:04,645
If lcan mince, you can dance.

927
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:29,052
Love is beautiful
Love is wonderful

928
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,950
Love is everything

929
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,692
Do you agree?

930
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:41,747
Look how she lights up the sky

931
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,110
! love you, Evangeline

932
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:00,401
Lottie's getting herself
one heck of a dance partner.

933
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,741
We best be pushing on.

934
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:14,072
-Tiana!
-Naveen!

935
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,870
No, no, no!

936
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:43,103
Not bad for a 197-year-old blind lady.

937
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:49,454
Now which one of you naughty children
been messing with the Shadow Man?

938
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:55,897
We're so glad we found you,
Mama Odie.

939
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,503
Ray and Louis here
have been telling us all about you.

940
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:00,412
We've been traveling quite a long way,

941
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:02,274
and you can't imagine
what we've been through.

942
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:03,442
And we...

943
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,613
-And we heard that you...
-Juju!

944
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,692
Come on over here, you bad boy.

945
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,259
Give us a little sugar, now.

946
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:20,825
Y'all just loves your mama, don't you?

947
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:26,206
Good to see you again, Ray.
How's your grandmama?

948
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,716
She's fine. Got in a little trouble
for flashing the neighbors again.

949
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:33,911
I like that gal's spunk!

950
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:35,981
Mama Odie.

951
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:38,671
We don't want to take up
too much of your time...

952
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,359
Y'all want some candy?

953
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:43,589
-Not really.
-No, thank you.

954
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,500
Now, that's too bad.
It's a special candy.

955
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,918
Would have turned y'all human.

956
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,410
-Wait! Don't! Please don't take it!
-No! Please!

957
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,679
I'm just messing with y'all.

958
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,705
How on Earth did you know
that we wanted to turn back...

959
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,174
-Mama Odie?
-Juju!

960
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,104
Why didn't you tell me
my gumbo was burning?

961
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,337
You sure this is the right
blind voodoo lady

962
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:11,093
who lives in a boat in a tree
in the bayou?

963
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,444
Pretty sure.

964
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,364
Can't believe this.
Got to do everything around here.

965
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,880
-Mama Odie, if you...
-Taste this!

966
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,047
Well?

967
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,964
Hit it hard with a couple of shots
of Tabasco and it's the bee's knees.

968
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:26,992
-Now, can we...
-Juju!

969
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,876
That's got some zang to it!

970
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,839
That's just what it needed.

971
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:41,814
Now, y'all figure out what you need?

972
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,055
It's just like you said, Mama Odie.
We need to be human.

973
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:48,766
Y'all ain't got the sense
you was born with!

974
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,739
Y'all want to be human
but you're blind to what you need!

975
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:57,251
What we want? What we need?
Is all the same thing, yes?

976
01:02:58,308 --> 01:03:00,478
Is the same thing? No!

977
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,481
You listen to your mama now.

978
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:09,198
Don't matter what you look like
Don't matter what you wear

979
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:11,963
How many rings you got on your finger

980
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:14,435
-We don't care, no
-We don't care

981
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:18,568
Don't matter where you come from
Don't even matter what you are

982
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,491
A dog, a pig, a cow, a goat

983
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:23,944
-Had ‘em all in here
-Had ‘em all in here

984
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:28,053
And they all knew what they wanted
What they wanted me to do

985
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:33,349
! told 'em what they needed
Just like I be telling you

986
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,380
You got to dig a little deeper

987
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,563
Find out who you are

988
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:41,255
You got to dig a little deeper

989
01:03:41,685 --> 01:03:43,145
It really ain't that far

990
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,144
When you find out who you are

991
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:48,863
You'll find out what you need

992
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,872
-Blue skies and sunshine
-Blue skies and sunshine

993
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:52,564
Guaranteed

994
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,790
-You got to dig
-Dig

995
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,169
-You got to dig
-Dig

996
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:03,035
Prince Froggy is a rich little boy
You want to be rich again

997
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,280
That ain't gonna make you happy now
Did it make you happy then? No!

998
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:12,942
Money ain't got no soul
Money ain't got no heart

999
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,540
All you need is some self-control

1000
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:17,788
Make yourself a brand-new start

1001
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,524
You got to dig a little deeper

1002
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:22,707
Don't have far to go

1003
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,199
You got to dig a little deeper

1004
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:28,132
Tell the people Mama told you so

1005
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:30,085
Can't tell you what you'll find

1006
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,980
Maybe love will grant you
peace of mind

1007
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,520
Dig a little deeper and you'll know

1008
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,547
-Miss Froggy.
-Ma'am?

1009
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:42,309
-Might I have a word?
-Yes, ma'am.

1010
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,743
You's a hard one, that's what I heard.

1011
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:52,250
Your daddy was a loving man
Family, through and through

1012
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:56,612
You your daddy's daughter
What he had in him, you got in you

1013
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,627
You got to dig a little deeper

1014
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,813
For you, it's gonna be tough

1015
01:05:02,165 --> 01:05:04,384
You got to dig a little deeper

1016
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:07,188
You ain't dug near far enough

1017
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,200
Dig down deep inside yourself
You'll find out what you need

1018
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:15,609
Blue skies and sunshine
Guaranteed

1019
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:19,392
Open up the windows!
Let in the light, children!

1020
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:24,259
Blue skies and sunshine
Blue skies and sunshine

1021
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:29,434
Blue skies and sunshine

1022
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:34,908
Guaranteed

1023
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:46,615
Well, Miss Froggy, do you understand
what you need now, child?

1024
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:49,183
Yes. 1 do, Mama Odie.

1025
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:52,326
I need to dig a little deeper
and work even harder

1026
01:05:52,816 --> 01:05:54,106
to get my restaurant.

1027
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,571
All right, y'all, one more time!

1028
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:01,388
It don't matter what you look like
It don't...

1029
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:05,044
Nobody is going to sing with Ray?
Okay.

1030
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:10,754
Well, if y'all are set on being human,
there's only one way.

1031
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:16,076
Gumbo, gumbo in the pot.

1032
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:19,946
We need a princess, whatcha got?

1033
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,933
Lottie? But she's not a princess.

1034
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:27,959
Hush up and look at the gumbo.

1035
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,098
Ta-da!

1036
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:33,833
That's right. Big Daddy's
King of the Mardi Gras parade.

1037
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,664
So that makes Lottie a princess.

1038
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,345
-Does that count?
-Yes, it does,

1039
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:44,981
but only till midnight
when Mardi Gras is over.

1040
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:50,859
Hop-along, you only got till then
to get that princess to kiss you.

1041
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:53,564
Once she does, boom!

1042
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,121
You both turn human!

1043
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,444
-Midnight?
-That doesn't give us much time at all.

1044
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:00,895
What about me, Mama?

1045
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,870
I want to be human, too,
so I can play jazz with the big boys.

1046
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,223
l want fingers and toes
and a bellybutton.

1047
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,019
Not the kind that sticks out
but the kind that goes in.

1048
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:12,424
Jabber Jaws, you dig a little deeper,
you'll find everything you need.

1049
01:07:13,096 --> 01:07:14,796
Come on, come on, come on.

1050
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,714
There's a lot of river
between here and New Orleans.

1051
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,263
Y'all best get to swimming.

1052
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,194
Wait! 1 got a better idea.

1053
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:36,625
They got guns!

1054
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:46,005
Man, that is one killer-diller costume!

1055
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:48,326
Hey, gator, can you blow that horn?

1056
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:53,224
Come on. Sit in with us!
We're playing Mardi Gras.

1057
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:05,100
We can't miss this! Little Louis
going to finally play with the big boys!

1058
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:07,805
Naveen, you coming?

1059
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,745
I'll catch up with you later.

1060
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:31,446
Oh, Evangeline. Why can't I just look
Tiana in the eye and say,

1061
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:35,800
"l will do whatever it takes to make
all your dreams come true because...

1062
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:37,872
"Because I love you"?

1063
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:41,453
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Cap!
You making goo-goo eyes at my girl?

1064
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:44,268
That's it! Put them up! I'm going to
make some shoes out of you!

1065
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,267
No, Ray!
lam not in love with Evangeline.

1066
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:47,959
lam in love with Tiana!

1067
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,909
I knew it, I knew it, 1 knew it!
You come here, you.

1068
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:53,875
And I can no longer marry
Miss Charlotte La Bouff.

1069
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:55,067
You're going to be happy together!

1070
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:56,587
I'll find another way
to get Tiana a restaurant.

1071
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,156
You're going to have
the cutest little tadpoles!

1072
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:00,514
I will get a job.
Maybe two. Maybe three.

1073
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,393
I can't wait to tell chére!

1074
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,575
No, no, no. Il must tell her. Alone.

1075
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,064
Right. You rascal!

1076
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:14,592
Where you taking me?

1077
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,993
I just wanted to show you
a little something

1078
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,527
to celebrate our last night together
as frogs.

1079
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:31,059
All my years no one's ever done
anything like this for me.

1080
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:38,358
It is too much, is it not?
Thank you, Beaux.

1081
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,458
l thought it was a nice touch.

1082
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:43,767
Pretend you did not see that.
Please, please, sit down.

1083
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:49,214
What's this?

1084
01:09:49,484 --> 01:09:50,974
-You minced.
-I did!

1085
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,390
You have had
quite an influence on me,

1086
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,976
which is amazing because I have dated
thousands of women and...

1087
01:09:57,994 --> 01:10:01,424
No, like two, three, just other women.
And anyway, listen.

1088
01:10:01,998 --> 01:10:03,308
You could not be more different,
you know?

1089
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:05,739
You are practically one of the guys.

1090
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,595
No, no, no. You are not a guy.
Let me begin again.

1091
01:10:11,174 --> 01:10:14,774
I'm not myself tonight.
Tiana! Sorry, that was loud.

1092
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:19,299
-This is a disaster.
-No. It's cute.

1093
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:24,628
-Tiana, l...
-There it is!

1094
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:29,825
Your restaurant?

1095
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,839
Can't you just picture it?
All lit up like the Fourth of July.

1096
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:36,049
-Yes. Jazz pouring out of every window!
-It should be elegant.

1097
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,202
But you got to keep it loose, though.
Got to let it swing.

1098
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:41,404
-You know a good ukulele player?
-Really? You'd let me perform?

1099
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,454
I'll talk to the owner. Owner says yes.

1100
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,518
Folks are going to be coming together
from all walks of life

1101
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,148
just to get a taste of our food.

1102
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,221
Our food?

1103
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:57,508
Oh, no. My daddy.

1104
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,671
We always wanted
to open this restaurant.

1105
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,840
He died before he could see it happen.

1106
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:08,480
But tomorrow, with your help,
our dream is finally coming true.

1107
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:11,436
-Tomorrow?
-If don't deliver that money

1108
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,398
first thing tomorrow,
l lose this place forever.

1109
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:20,068
Tiana, I love

1110
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:28,527
the way you light up
when you talk about your dream.

1111
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,669
A dream that... It is so beautiful, I...

1112
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:37,316
I promise I will do whatever it takes
to make it come true.

1113
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,259
Port of New Orleans, all ashore!

1114
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,682
I'll go round up the boys.

1115
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:01,806
Evangeline,

1116
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:05,909
I've always been so sure about
what I wanted, but now I...

1117
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:09,631
What do I do?

1118
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:11,967
Please tell me.

1119
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,960
Prince Naveen, darling.

1120
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:24,056
You better hurry up. Don't want to be
late for our Mardi Gras wedding.

1121
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:28,718
Getting dressed! Just a few more
minutes, my dearest heart.

1122
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,408
Okay, honey lamb.
We'll be waiting in the Packard.

1123
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,759
Daddy, start the car!

1124
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,867
Oh, my heavens, I'm doomed!

1125
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:42,427
No, Larry! I'm the one who's doomed.
Unless we get that frog's blood in...

1126
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,753
We are back in business, boys!

1127
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,830
Get your filthy hands off me! Lawrence!

1128
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,703
Now hold still, Your Eminence.

1129
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:04,379
Mardi Gras! Mardi Gras!

1130
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,840
Mardi Gras! Mardi Gras!

1131
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:09,366
Ray! Have you seen Naveen?

1132
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:12,009
Look at you. Where the ring at?

1133
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:13,731
What are you talking about?

1134
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,727
Well, if Cap didn't say nothing,
l ain't going to say nothing

1135
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,876
because old Ray's sealed up
tight as a drum.

1136
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,928
-You ain't getting nothing out of me, no!
-Ray.

1137
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:22,964
Okay, Cap not going to marry Charlotte,
he going to marry you!

1138
01:13:23,299 --> 01:13:24,729
Soon as he gets himself kissed
and y'all both turn human,

1139
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:27,223
he's going to find a job,
get you that restaurant...

1140
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:28,717
l said too much, didn't I?

1141
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:32,481
You said just enough, Ray!
Thank you, Evangeline.

1142
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:45,281
He was trying to propose!
That's what all that fumbling was about!

1143
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:48,908
And here I thought all he wanted
was to marry a rich girl!

1144
01:13:50,393 --> 01:13:52,063
What are we looking for again?

1145
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:55,615
You just keep your eyes out
for the biggest, gaudiest float

1146
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:59,505
with a Mardi Gras princess
about to kiss herself a...

1147
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:02,150
A frog.

1148
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:05,304
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here tonight

1149
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,738
in this fine celebration to join together

1150
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:13,785
this prince and this young woman
in holy matrimony.

1151
01:14:14,517 --> 01:14:17,147
Oh, no. This can't be right, darling.

1152
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,870
And how you can still be a frog?
Mama Odie, she...

1153
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:42,134
I know what we seen with our eyes,

1154
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,405
but if we just go back that way,

1155
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,490
we're going to find out
your fairy tale come true.

1156
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,204
Just because you wish for something
doesn't make it true.

1157
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:53,164
It's like my Evangeline always said
to me...

1158
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,768
Evangeline is nothing but a star, Ray!

1159
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:59,412
A big ball of hot air
a million miles from here!

1160
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:03,896
Open your eyes now,
before you get hurt.

1161
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:16,792
She just speaking out a broken heart.
That's all that is.

1162
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,570
Come on, Evangeline.

1163
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,830
We're going to show chére the truth!

1164
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:28,213
If any of you objects to the union
of these two people,

1165
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:31,580
speak now or forever hold your peace.

1166
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:33,931
Me! Me! I object!

1167
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:38,166
Do you, Prince Naveen,
take Charlotte to be your wife?

1168
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:40,851
Cap, what you doing, son?

1169
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,253
..as you both shall live?

1170
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,740
What? I do! Yes, I'm for it.

1171
01:15:51,981 --> 01:15:53,791
-Do you, Charlotte La Bouff...
-ls that you, Cap?

1172
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,929
Ray! Get me out of this box!

1173
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:58,894
I can't hear you!
I'm going to get you out this box!

1174
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:03,816
.. to keep yourself only unto him,
as long as you both shall live?

1175
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,130
Ido.

1176
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:10,262
And so, by the power vested in me
by the state of Louisiana,

1177
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:14,056
I now pronounce you man and...

1178
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:15,473
Prince Naveen!

1179
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:21,695
Goodness gracious! Are you all right?

1180
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,510
I just need a moment
to compose myself.

1181
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:26,177
Cheese and crackers!

1182
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:28,486
Lawrence, why are you doing this?

1183
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:32,688
As payback for
all those years of humiliation.

1184
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:36,802
Get your royal rump back on that
wedding cake and finish this deal!

1185
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:40,094
What's he doing? Stop him!

1186
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:41,659
Give it to me!

1187
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:44,561
I've got it! It got me, too.

1188
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,834
-Let go of that!
-Stay out of sight!

1189
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:51,479
Come on. Come on.

1190
01:16:58,514 --> 01:16:59,414
Ray?

1191
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:03,534
Hey, why did you stop?

1192
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:08,208
He's a real gator!

1193
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:12,664
Ray?

1194
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:15,145
This proves what we saw
ain't what we thought we saw!

1195
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:17,734
-What is this?
-It's a voodoo hayacall.

1196
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,094
The Shadow Man,
he been using it for the...

1197
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,188
You can't let Shadow Man get this,
no matter what!

1198
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:26,623
Now run, girl! Run!

1199
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,999
Don't make me light my butt!

1200
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,995
I'm going to get you!
I got a lot more of me! Come here, you!

1201
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:38,482
Who's next?

1202
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:53,531
Ray!

1203
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:57,852
Ray?

1204
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:11,046
Back off, or I'm going to break this thing
into a million pieces!

1205
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:33,481
Naveen?

1206
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,050
Now, isn't this a whole lot better

1207
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:42,966
than hopping around the bayou
for the rest of your life?

1208
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,526
Shadow Man.

1209
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,009
Got to hand it to you, Tiana.

1210
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:51,724
When you dream, you dream big.

1211
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:53,651
Just look at this place.

1212
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,532
Going to be the crown jewel
of the Crescent City!

1213
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:02,348
And all you got to do
to make this a reality

1214
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:05,155
is hand over
that little old talisman of mine.

1215
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:10,242
No. This is not right.

1216
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:14,939
Come on now, darling.
Think of everything you've sacrificed.

1217
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:18,638
-Girl, all you ever do is work.
-I told y'all she wouldn't come.

1218
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:22,432
Think of all those naysayers
who doubted you.

1219
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,851
You ain't never going to get enough
for the down payment.

1220
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:29,387
...little woman of your background,
you're better off where you're at.

1221
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,282
And don't forget your poor daddy.

1222
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:38,137
-Now that was one hard-working man.
-See you in the morning, James.

1223
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:41,107
Double, sometime triple shifts.

1224
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:46,324
Never letting on how bone tired
and beat down he really was.

1225
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:49,412
-Daddy!
-Hey, babycakes!

1226
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:52,126
Shame all that hard work

1227
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:55,358
didn't amount to much more
than a busted-up old gumbo pot

1228
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:59,505
and a dream that
never got off the back porch.

1229
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:01,795
But you?

1230
01:20:02,665 --> 01:20:07,025
You can give your poor daddy
everything he ever wanted.

1231
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:13,031
Come on, Tiana. You're almost there.

1232
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,980
My daddy never did get
what he wanted.

1233
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:26,847
But he had what he needed.

1234
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:31,112
He had love. He never lost sight of
what was really important.

1235
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,680
-Easy with that. Careful.
-And neither will I!

1236
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:45,027
Y'all should have taken my deal.

1237
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,491
Now you're going to spend
the rest of your life

1238
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:50,096
being a slimy, little frog.

1239
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:55,963
I've got news for you, Shadow Man.
It's not slime. It's mucus!

1240
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,161
No! No!

1241
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,799
How am I ever going to pay back
my debt?

1242
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:10,193
Friends.

1243
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:12,016
Are you ready?

1244
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:15,494
No! I'm not ready at all!
In fact, 1 got lots more plans.

1245
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,327
Are you ready?

1246
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:20,156
This is just a minor setback
in a major operation.

1247
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:24,133
As soon as I whip up another spell,
we'll be back in business!

1248
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:26,923
I still got that froggy prince
locked away!

1249
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,289
I just need a little more time.

1250
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:32,186
No, please!

1251
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:35,980
Just a little more time!

1252
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,644
I promise I'll pay y'all back! I promise!

1253
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:49,402
Hush

1254
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:59,275
Prince! Prince Naveen!

1255
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:03,147
Your shy and retiring bride-to-be
is getting antsy!

1256
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,244
Hello, darling.

1257
01:22:11,193 --> 01:22:13,473
Miss La Bouff! Please, down here!

1258
01:22:14,797 --> 01:22:19,017
Allow me to introduce myself.
lam the real Prince Naveen!

1259
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,760
Of Maldonia.

1260
01:22:23,839 --> 01:22:25,329
Did you say "Prince"?

1261
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:30,326
Boys, drag this maggot
down to the parish prison.

1262
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:33,213
I'm completely innocent!
Now, the Shadow Man bamboozled me!

1263
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:36,876
Goodness gracious.
This is so much to absorb.

1264
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,026
Let me see if I got this right.

1265
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:43,134
If l kiss you before midnight,
you and Tiana will turn human again?

1266
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:45,539
And then we're gonna
get ourselves married

1267
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:48,474
and live happily ever after, the end!

1268
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:50,830
Yeah, more or less. But remember,

1269
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,010
you must give Tiana all the money
she requires for her restaurant.

1270
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:56,103
Because Tiana,

1271
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,238
she is my Evangeline.

1272
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:04,471
Anything you want, sugar.

1273
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,534
Pucker up, buttercup.

1274
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:12,749
-Wait!
-Tiana?

1275
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:14,958
-Tiana?
-Don't do this.

1276
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,994
l have to do this.
And we are running out of time.

1277
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,256
I won't let you!

1278
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,483
It's the only way to get you your dream!

1279
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:22,413
My dream?

1280
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,601
My dream wouldn't be complete

1281
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:26,924
without you in it.

1282
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:32,516
Il love you, Naveen.

1283
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:40,143
-Warts and all?
-Warts and all.

1284
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:50,008
All my life, l read about
true love in fairy tales

1285
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:54,227
and, Tia, you found it!

1286
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:59,107
I'll kiss him. For you, honey.

1287
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:01,238
No marriage required.

1288
01:24:04,907 --> 01:24:08,127
Oh, my word!
Maybe that old clock's a little fast!

1289
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,820
I'm so sorry.

1290
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:24,151
Tiana! Naveen!

1291
01:24:27,763 --> 01:24:31,133
-Louis, what is it?
-Shadow Man done laid poor Ray low.

1292
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,870
-Ray.
-He's hurting awful bad.

1293
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:50,368
Hey, chére,

1294
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:56,040
-how come you're still...
-We're staying frogs, Ray.

1295
01:24:56,692 --> 01:24:58,092
And we're staying together.

1296
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:04,781
I like that very much.

1297
01:25:07,002 --> 01:25:09,812
Evangeline likes that, too.

1298
01:27:10,092 --> 01:27:12,902
And so by the power vested in me,

1299
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:19,173
l now pronounce y'all frog and wife.

1300
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:23,055
Get to it, Hop-along!
Give your lovely bride some sugar!

1301
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:24,565
Congratulations.

1302
01:27:38,687 --> 01:27:40,997
This going to be good!

1303
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:12,901
Like I told y'all,
kissing a princess breaks the spell.

1304
01:28:13,522 --> 01:28:16,512
Once you became my wife,
that made you...

1305
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:20,945
A princess.
You just kissed yourself a princess.

1306
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,816
And I'm about to do it again.

1307
01:29:21,323 --> 01:29:24,133
In the south land, there's a city

1308
01:29:24,626 --> 01:29:26,527
Way down on the river

1309
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,048
Way down on the river

1310
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:32,702
Where the women are very pretty
And all the men deliver

1311
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,370
They got music, it's always playing

1312
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:37,041
They got music, it's always playing

1313
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:39,818
Start in the daytime
Go all through the night

1314
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:43,425
And when you hear that music playing

1315
01:29:43,912 --> 01:29:46,982
Hear what I'm saying
make you feel all right

1316
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:50,885
Who would have thought the prince
would've had a younger brother!

1317
01:29:51,453 --> 01:29:53,293
How old did you say you were?

1318
01:29:53,655 --> 01:29:55,355
I'm six and a half.

1319
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,704
Well, I've waited this long.

1320
01:30:00,128 --> 01:30:03,230
Grab somebody, come on down

1321
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:06,400
Bring your paintbrush
We're painting the town

1322
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:06,421
Bring your paintbrush
We're painting the town

1323
01:30:06,534 --> 01:30:10,103
There's some sweetness going around

1324
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:13,907
Dreams do come true

1325
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:14,199
Dreams do come true

1326
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:20,352
In New Orleans
