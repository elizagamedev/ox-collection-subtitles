1
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:31,694
The Grid.

2
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,307
A digital frontier.

3
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,367
! tried to picture clusters of information

4
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,633
as they moved through the computer.

5
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,130
What did they look like?

6
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,405
Ships? Motorcycles?

7
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,705
Were the circuits like freeways?

8
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,211
! kept dreaming of a world
! thought I'd never see.

9
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,609
And then, one day...

10
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:02,971
-You got in.
-That's right, man. I got in.

11
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,622
And the world was more beautiful
than I ever dreamed

12
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,472
and also more dangerous
than I ever imagined.

13
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,420
Hop in bed, now, kiddo.

14
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,565
-Now, I met a brave warrior.
-Tron.

15
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,080
Tron!

16
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,009
-He fights for the users.
-He sure does.

17
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:02,105
Oh, man, he showed me things
that no one had ever imagined.

18
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,786
There were these disk battles
fought in spectacular arenas.

19
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,749
Cycles that raced on ribbons of light.

20
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,319
It was so radical.

21
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,595
-And together...
-You built the Grid.

22
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,210
We built a new grid
for programs and users.

23
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,870
Now, I couldn't be in there all the time,

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,649
so I created a program in my own image
that could think.

25
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,182
Like you, and me.

26
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,911
And I called him Clu.

27
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,855
-Codified Likeness Utility.
-That's right.

28
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,886
And Clu, Tron and I,
we built the system,

29
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,956
where all information was free
and open.

30
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,393
Beautiful.

31
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,087
And then, one day,

32
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,073
something happened.

33
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,105
Something extraordinary.

34
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,791
A miracle.

35
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:07,987
What was it?

36
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,879
That'll have to wait till next time.

37
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,089
I gotta get to work.

38
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,701
l wanna go with you, Dad.

39
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:20,182
Yeah, well, one day you will.

40
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,141
I promise.

41
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,029
-To the Grid?
-Good night, Sam.

42
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,244
Hey, what do you say tomorrow
you and I hit the arcade?

43
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,208
You can have a crack
at the old man's high score.

44
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,861
First game's on me.

45
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,172
Can we play doubles?
On the same team?

46
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,263
We're always on the same team.

47
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,888
Good evening. Our lead story.

48
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:14,403
ENCOM CEO and video game icon
Kevin Flynn has disappeared.

49
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,741
He was best known for designing Tron
and Space Paranoids,

50
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,618
the two bestselling video games
in history.

51
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,806
Flynn took ownership of ENCOM
in 1982

52
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,251
as the company skyrocketed
to the top of the tech industry.

53
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,541
But things changed in 1985
with the untimely death of Flynn's wife,

54
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,355
the mother of his young son, Sam.

55
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,488
Recently, ENCOM board members

56
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,917
have been troubled by reports

57
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,771
of Flynn's erratic,
even obsessive, behavior.

58
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,491
With Flynn missing,
the company is now in chaos.

59
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,975
This afternoon, ENCOM's board

60
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,126
moved to seize control
from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley,

61
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,217
vowing to return the company
to profitability.

62
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:58,287
Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing

63
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,272
and is instead pursuing his dream of

64
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,705
"a digital frontier
to reshape the human condition."

65
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,943
In there is a new world,

66
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,236
In there is our future.

67
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,388
In there is our destiny.

68
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,554
Even Flynn's most ardent supporters
are now acknowledging a difficult truth.

69
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,616
Kevin Flynn may have simply
run away.

70
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,726
And while Flynn's loyalists
hope for his imminent return,

71
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,498
there is perhaps no one who wishes it
to happen more than young Sam Flynn,

72
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,696
now in the care of his grandparents,
and heir to an empire in turmoil.

73
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,537
He's coming. He promised.

74
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,690
-Sam, you have to eat.
-Let go of me!

75
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,182
Sam?

76
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,280
What will become of Flynn's legacy
and the future of ENCOM

77
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,796
will most likely depend

78
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,975
on what becomes of this
now orphaned little boy.

79
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,327
Sam! Come back!

80
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,667
All cycle units, stand by.

81
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,191
All units, stand by.

82
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,824
Now that is a big door.

83
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,246
Welcome, everybody.

84
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,644
Please settle. I know it's late,
so I'll skip the pleasantries

85
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,391
and hand things over to our chairman,
Richard Mackey.

86
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,443
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Claire.

87
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,208
Tonight l am pleased to announce

88
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,760
that ENCOM's last fiscal year
was our most profitable ever.

89
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,293
Yes.

90
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,186
At midnight the 12th version
of our flagship operating system

91
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,766
will hit the shelves around the world.

92
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,617
I'm sure it comes as no surprise
whom we have to thank.

93
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,843
The head of our software design team,

94
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:56,551
a man whose father's
own notable history with ENCOM

95
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,663
helped make this company
what it is today.

96
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,699
Edward Dillinger. Well done.

97
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,718
Well done.

98
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,390
And this year, simultaneous
to the release of ENCOM OS-12,

99
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:20,305
we will be making our debut
on Tokyo's Nikkei Index.

100
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:25,367
ENCOM's stock will now trade
around the world 247.

101
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,403
Oh, yes.

102
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,852
-Excuse me.
-Yes, Alan?

103
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,598
Given the prices

104
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,080
that we charge to students and schools,

105
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,897
what sort of improvements
have been made in Flynn...

106
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,571
I mean, ENCOM OS-12?

107
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,327
This year we put a "12" on the box.

108
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,454
OS-12 is the most secure
operating system ever released.

109
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,185
The idea of sharing our software
or giving it away for free

110
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,267
disappeared with Kevin Flynn.

111
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,016
I know you're here.

112
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,505
Let's make this easy.

113
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,600
Come on, come on.

114
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,327
Freeze!

115
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,182
Okay.

116
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,967
If there are no more questions,

117
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,382
l would like you to meet
our next blockbuster.

118
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,288
ENCOM OS-12.

119
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,078
Still a few bugs.

120
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,830
What's that? What is that?

121
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,915
Just bear with us one sec.

122
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,202
Make this go away now.

123
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,147
Stop what you're doing.
Stop. Stop for one second.

124
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:31,184
...where ENCOM's chairman,
Richard Mackey, will be launching...

125
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,714
-We go live in 30 seconds.
-He's on the roof!

126
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,680
-Anyone know where the master file is?
-l do.

127
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,605
It's on the Web.

128
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,489
We've got to stop this.

129
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,757
I've got to ring that opening bell.

130
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,464
-Make this stop now.
-It's locked.

131
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,390
Just shut it down. Shut it down! Now!

132
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,473
Relax, Mackey. Relax.

133
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,103
It's under control.

134
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,127
Relax? Our most valuable

135
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:06,583
and most secure operating system
is out there for free!

136
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,579
How am I supposed to explain that?

137
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,458
I don't know.
Say it was all part of the plan.

138
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,732
A little gift from ENCOM.

139
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,694
Apparently, ENCOM Technology
is having some technical difficulties.

140
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,310
Why don't we give them a chance
to sort things out?

141
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,516
Hey, Dad.

142
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,449
How you doing?

143
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,897
-Where you gonna run to now?
-Hey, you don't wanna do that.

144
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,464
Didn't anyone tell you?
Stealing is wrong.

145
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,126
You can't steal
what was designed to be free.

146
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,299
-Now I got you.
-Your boss is okay with this.

147
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,895
The hell he is.

148
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,070
Your boss works for the CEO

149
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,789
and the CEO
works for the shareholders.

150
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,111
Do you know
who the biggest shareholder is?

151
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,794
I don't know. Some kid.

152
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,723
You're Mr. Flynn?

153
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,113
Why?

154
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,019
This is your father's company.

155
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,507
-Not anymore.
-What? Hey. Hey, kid.

156
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,355
No!

157
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,676
Yeah.

158
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,218
You kidding me?

159
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,619
-That's him! Get the team down here!
-There he is! Get him!

160
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,052
What the...

161
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,414
Hey! No free ride!

162
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:16,722
No free taxi!

163
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,633
You pay!

164
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,858
No free ride!

165
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,299
Hold it right there. Freeze!

166
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,564
Okay, boys. You got me.

167
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:43,769
Hey.

168
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,568
-Hey, Karl.
-Hey, how you doing?

169
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,889
Enjoy it, Marv. You earned it.

170
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,829
Why are you in my apartment, Alan?

171
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,763
You don't answer your phone.

172
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,214
-How you been, Sam?
-Oh, you know,

173
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,779
when I was 12, l appreciated
the surrogate-father thing. But come on.

174
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,637
I got it all under control now.

175
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,240
Clearly!

176
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,548
You want to help me
with my homework?

177
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,106
Like old times? Have a catch?

178
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,713
You know,
you got a pretty nice view here.

179
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,693
Heard you did a triple axel off of her
a few hours ago.

180
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,644
-Rough landing, huh?
-Could have been worse.

181
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,547
l also thought your message
to the board

182
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,979
was very clever.

183
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,384
Did you like that? That was Marv's idea.

184
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,796
Alan, are we really
going to do this again?

185
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,723
Do I really look like I'm ready
to run a Fortune 500 company?

186
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,686
No.

187
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,678
And truthfully, the company
is pretty happy with where you are, too.

188
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,449
I bet.

189
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,463
That way they can keep doing
whatever they want.

190
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,411
You know, I guess what I find curious
is the crazy charities,

191
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,243
the annual prank on the company.

192
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,175
You have an interesting way
of being disinterested, Sam.

193
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,175
Why are you here, Alan?

194
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,257
l was paged last night.

195
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,532
Oh, man, still rocking the pager?

196
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,284
Good for you.

197
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:57,433
Yeah, your dad once told me
I had to sleep with it, and I still do.

198
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,198
Page came from your dad's office
at the arcade.

199
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,331
-So?
-So?

200
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,100
That number's been disconnected
for 20 years.

201
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,958
Sam, two nights before he disappeared,
he came to my house.

202
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,846
"I've cracked it," he kept saying.

203
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,574
He was talking about genetic
algorithms, quantum teleportation.

204
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,892
He said he was about to change
everything. Science, medicine, religion.

205
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,731
He wouldn't have left that, Sam.

206
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,250
He wouldn't have left you.

207
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,715
Oh, Alan. You're the only one
who still believes that.

208
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,975
He's either dead
or chilling in Costa Rica.

209
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,759
Probably both.

210
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,971
Look, I'm sorry.

211
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,449
I'm tired, and I smell like jail.

212
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,275
Let's just reconvene in another couple
of years, huh? What do you say?

213
00:17:58,778 --> 00:17:59,858
Here.

214
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,320
These are the keys to the arcade.

215
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,867
I haven't gone over there yet.
I thought you should be the one.

216
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,542
Alan, you're acting like I'm gonna
find him sitting there working.

217
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,428
Just, "Hey, kiddo. Lost track of time."

218
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,268
Wouldn't that be something?

219
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,171
What?

220
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,761
You son of a gun.

221
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,154
Flynn.

222
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,444
Let's try the back door.

223
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,960
What were you working on?

224
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,435
LaserControl.

225
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,670
Okay.

226
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,255
This isn't happening.

227
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,970
Oh, man, this is happening.

228
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,545
Wait.

229
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,137
This program has no disk.
Another stray.

230
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,383
Hey, wait.

231
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,031
Wait. I'm not a program!

232
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,059
He actually did it.

233
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,225
I'm on the Grid.

234
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,993
Does the name Kevin Flynn
mean anything to you?

235
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,169
Be quiet if you want to live!

236
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,461
Not the games, not the games,

237
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,947
not the games, not the games...

238
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,509
What's his problem?

239
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,264
Not the games, not the...

240
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,213
Rectify.

241
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,164
Rectify.

242
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,326
-Games,
-No. Please!

243
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:21,806
Rectify.

244
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,674
You probably get this a lot,
but there's been a big mistake.

245
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,814
Games.

246
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,016
-Please, no, no.
-Hey.

247
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,795
No! Erase me!

248
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,970
No! Wait! Wait!

249
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,174
Can somebody tell me what the...

250
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,001
Hey, hey. It's got a zipper.

251
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,174
He is different.

252
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,198
This can't be good.

253
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:14,482
Attention, program.
You will receive an identity disk.

254
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:20,117
Everything you do or learn
will be imprinted on this disk.

255
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,307
If you lose your disk
or fail to follow commands,

256
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,237
you will be subject
to immediate de-resolution.

257
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,777
Mirroring complete.
Disk activated and synchronized.

258
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,551
Proceed to games.

259
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,921
Games?

260
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,480
Where are you going?

261
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,828
What am I supposed to do?

262
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,613
Survive.

263
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,204
All combatants, prepare for disk wars.

264
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:59,825
Disk wars! Disk wars!

265
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,333
Disk wars!

266
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,935
Disk wars!

267
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,118
Disk wars!

268
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,443
Platform 8.

269
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,758
l have a three-inch version of you
on my shelf.

270
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,620
Combatants 3 and 11.

271
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,620
Disk wars.

272
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,935
You definitely didn't do that.

273
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,809
Damn it!

274
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,166
So that's how it is.

275
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,037
Combatant 11, de-resolution.

276
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,915
I won. Now let me out!

277
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:06,785
Combatant 3, round one, victory.

278
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,829
No unusual activity on the Grid.

279
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,497
Security sweeps and patrols

280
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,010
have been intensified.
Rectifier on schedule.

281
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,826
Your initiative should be
fully operational within 12 cycles.

282
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:22,155
Perhaps if you were to include me

283
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:26,607
in this initiative,
I could be of even greater service.

284
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:30,992
Combatants 3 and 7, disk wars.

285
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,679
Initiate.

286
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,010
Yeah. I'm out.

287
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:51,131
Combatant 3, victory.

288
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,454
Combatant 3, violation.

289
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,964
Combatant 6, de-resolution.

290
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,288
What is that program?

291
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:07,895
Combatant 3,

292
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,933
violation.

293
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,296
Initiate final round.

294
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,720
Combatant 3 versus Rinzler.

295
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,416
Rinzler!

296
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,172
Rinzler!

297
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,894
You gotta be kidding me.

298
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:35,606
Rinzler!

299
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,861
Rinzler!

300
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,014
Rinzler!

301
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,477
Rinzler!

302
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:45,856
Rinzler!

303
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,774
Come on. Is that even legal?

304
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:32,081
Why do I feel like I just got dumped on?

305
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,776
Come on. Come on.

306
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,111
De-rez!

307
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,118
De-rez!

308
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,394
De-rez!

309
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,766
User.

310
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,509
Identify yourself, program.

311
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,103
I'm not a program.

312
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,288
Identify.

313
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,251
My name is Sam Flynn.

314
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,794
Bring him to me.

315
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:15,566
Let me go.

316
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:20,841
Freaks.

317
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:24,078
Where am I?

318
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:29,332
Am lon the Grid?

319
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,384
Who are you?

320
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,118
Dad.

321
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,377
Sam.

322
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,442
Look at you, man.
Look at the size of you.

323
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:50,051
-How did you get in here?
-I got your message.

324
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,323
So it's just you?

325
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:55,375
Yeah.

326
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,007
Just you.

327
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,944
Isn't this something?

328
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,460
You look the same.

329
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:06,465
A lot's happened, Sam.
More than you can imagine. Disk.

330
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,587
Let's have a look.

331
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,021
Got it.

332
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:33,734
l expected more.

333
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,949
So, you were trapped in here.

334
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,694
That's right.

335
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,749
-And you're in charge.
-Right again. You're two for two.

336
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,180
So can we just go home now?

337
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,574
Not in the cards.

338
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,104
Not for you.

339
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,456
That's a hell of a way to treat your son.

340
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,317
Oh, that.

341
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,407
I'm not your father, Sam.

342
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:19,457
But I'm very, very happy to see you.

343
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,831
Clu.

344
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:28,882
Where is he?

345
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,977
What did you do to him?

346
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,349
Same thing I'm going to do to you, user.

347
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,369
Greetings, programs.

348
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,560
What an occasion
we have here before us.

349
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:11,005
Because your rumors are true.

350
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:15,796
We do indeed have in our midst

351
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,321
a user!

352
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,154
A user.

353
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,817
So, what to do?

354
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:32,903
What does this user deserve?

355
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,614
Might I suggest perhaps
the challenge of the Grid?

356
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:47,404
And who best to battle
this singular opponent?

357
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,980
Perhaps one who has some
experience in these matters.

358
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,401
Oh, yes, indeed, programs.

359
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,714
Your liberator!

360
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,526
Your luminary!

361
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,749
Your leader and maker!

362
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,832
The one who vanquished
the tyranny of the user

363
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:15,374
those many cycles before!

364
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,961
I've been waiting a long time for this.

365
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:22,507
Clu!

366
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,831
You wanna play? I'll play.

367
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:33,727
Excellent words, sir.

368
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,122
Were you pleased with my execution?

369
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,995
The crowd seemed quite energized.

370
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,736
It wasn't meant for them.

371
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,620
What's this?

372
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,529
What do I do with this?

373
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,662
I'll give you a hint.

374
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,005
Not that.

375
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,375
Grid is live.

376
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,677
Initiate light cycle battle.

377
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,189
You got no chance, user.

378
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:39,263
Their bikes are faster than ours.
Use the levels.

379
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,802
Now this I can do.

380
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,714
Here we go.

381
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,148
Come on. Come on!

382
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,281
Hey! We gotta work together.

383
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,502
It's the only way.

384
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,048
That's it. You got me.

385
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:09,506
Boo!

386
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:13,910
Yeah!

387
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,015
Now that's what I'm talking about.

388
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,771
Another customer. Let's go!

389
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:37,884
Hang on, buddy, I'm coming.

390
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,201
Come on.

391
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,153
This is it. Come on.

392
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,715
Illegal combatant on the Grid.

393
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,290
Get in.

394
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,901
Illegal combatant on the Grid.

395
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,216
Get in!

396
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,377
System failure. Release Rinzler.

397
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:51,594
Game on, old friend.

398
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,958
-Who are you?
-Hang on.

399
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,690
Pull up, man, you can't make that!

400
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,574
Made it.

401
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:55,989
I'm Quorra.

402
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:02,695
They're turning around.

403
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,147
Not by choice.

404
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,545
Their vehicles can't go off Grid.
They'll malfunction on this terrain.

405
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:11,045
-What about us?
-Obviously not.

406
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,613
-Where are you taking me?
-Patience, Sam Flynn.

407
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,290
All your questions
will be answered soon.

408
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,452
Wait here.

409
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:45,298
Quorra.

410
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,270
I dreamed of Tron.

411
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,403
First time in years.

412
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,556
It's a sign.

413
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,022
A sign, my dear apprentice,
of a weary soul.

414
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,403
-I'm afraid something's happened.
-Something has happened.

415
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,504
We have a guest.

416
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,361
There are no guests, kiddo.

417
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:35,077
Sam...

418
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,450
Long time.

419
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,727
You have no idea.

420
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:51,096
You're... You're here.

421
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,769
You're here.

422
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,965
I'm here.

423
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:09,205
You're big.

424
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,413
You're...

425
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,540
Old.

426
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,399
How did you get here?

427
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,937
Alan came over.

428
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:25,500
Bradley.

429
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,276
Yeah. He got your page.

430
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:31,589
l found your office under the arcade.

431
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,670
Page...

432
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:37,103
Oh, the page.

433
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,996
Of course.

434
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,108
Clu had him on the light cycle grid.

435
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,339
l intervened.

436
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,312
Dinner soon.

437
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,521
We'll talk then.

438
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,604
He never thought he'd see you again.

439
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,692
Yeah.

440
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:28,884
Vintage. Flynn built it
many cycles ago for the games.

441
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,000
It doesn't get out as much as it used to,

442
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,049
but it's still the fastest thing on the Grid.

443
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,786
Do you know it?

444
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:06,429
His patience usually beats out
my more aggressive strategy.

445
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,408
Flynn shared them with me.

446
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,371
I've read them all.

447
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,346
Light reading.

448
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:20,792
Tolstoy.

449
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:23,028
Dostoyevsky.

450
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,620
I-Ching. Journey Without Goal.

451
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,920
Must have a killer ending.

452
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,206
Flynn is teaching me
about the art of the selfless,

453
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:35,705
about removing oneself
from the equation.

454
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,600
But between you and me,
Jules Verne is my favorite.

455
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,576
-Do you know Jules Verne?
-Sure.

456
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:48,143
What's he like?

457
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,981
Your move, Flynn, come on.

458
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,395
Come on!

459
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:29,175
-How old are you now, Sam?
-You should be 27.

460
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,488
Yes, 27.

461
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:35,816
-Do you attend a college?
-Caltech.

462
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,917
Caltech. My alma mater.

463
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:42,618
Yeah.

464
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,310
Till l dropped out.

465
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,977
Work?

466
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:58,253
-Job? ENCOM? Are you...
-No.

467
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,978
I check in once a year.

468
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,538
-Wife, girlfriend?
-Dog.

469
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,354
Marvin.

470
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,580
-A rescue.
-Well, dogs...

471
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,462
Dogs are cool.

472
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:26,169
I'm sure you must have
a few questions of your own, Sam.

473
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,772
Actually, just one.

474
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:36,148
Why I never came home.

475
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,670
Those nights when I went to the office,

476
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:46,006
I'm sure you've figured it out by now,
l was coming here.

477
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,004
Human form into digital space.

478
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,227
Heavy stuff.

479
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,413
But I also had you.

480
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:59,797
l had ENCOM.
I couldn't be in here all the time.

481
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:02,694
I needed partners to help out.

482
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,586
Tron and Clu?

483
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:06,619
That's right.

484
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,476
Tron was created by Alan
for the old system.

485
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:14,873
! brought him here to protect this one.

486
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:17,199
Clu was my creation.

487
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,914
A program designed
to create a perfect world.

488
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,818
We were jamming, man,
building utopia.

489
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,572
Hours in here
were just minutes back home.

490
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,415
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any more profound,

491
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,754
something unexpected happened.

492
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,770
The miracle.

493
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,362
The miracle.

494
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,124
You remember.

495
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:43,444
ISOs. Isomorphic algorithms.

496
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:47,918
-A whole new life form.
-And you created them?

497
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,259
No. No.

498
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,674
They manifested, like a flame.

499
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:00,765
They weren't really from anywhere.

500
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:03,738
The conditions were right
and they came into being.

501
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:08,524
For centuries we've dreamed
of gods, spirits, aliens,

502
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:10,875
an intelligence beyond our own.

503
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:12,368
You seeing this?

504
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:16,699
! found them in here.
Like flowers in a wasteland.

505
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,423
Profoundly naive.

506
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,874
Unimaginably wise.

507
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,841
They were spectacular.

508
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,674
Everything I'd hoped to find
in the system,

509
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,307
control, order, perfection,

510
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,920
none of it meant a thing.

511
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,298
I'd been living in a hall of mirrors.

512
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,830
The ISOs shattered it.

513
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,390
The possibilities of their root code,
their digital DNA.

514
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,040
Disease? History.

515
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,562
Science, philosophy,

516
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:55,558
every idea man has ever had
about the universe up for grabs.

517
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:58,633
Bio-digital jazz, man.

518
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:02,875
The ISOs, they were going
to be my gift to the world.

519
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,463
So what happened?

520
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,859
Clu. Clu happened.

521
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,919
Your transport to the portal
is waiting for you.

522
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:17,229
I don't like it when you cut it this close.

523
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:21,134
Will you stop worrying, Tron?
Everything's just fine.

524
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,602
-Everything's under control.
-Flynn!

525
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,922
Am I still to create the perfect system?

526
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,178
Yeah.

527
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:38,741
It was a coup.

528
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,221
Go.

529
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:58,277
You've been corrupted.

530
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,035
Why? Why?

531
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,077
Flynn, go!

532
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:25,096
Tron, he fought for me.

533
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,920
! never saw him again.

534
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,493
So why didn't you fight?

535
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:34,053
He did.

536
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,854
Clu fed on my resistance.

537
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:38,542
The more I fought,
the more powerful he became.

538
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:41,403
It was impressive, really.

539
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:46,559
And my miracle...
Clu saw the ISOs as an imperfection.

540
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,474
So he destroyed them.

541
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,446
The Purge.

542
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,668
-He killed them all?
-It was genocide.

543
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,923
! tried to get back
but I couldn't get to the portal.

544
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:07,823
It uses massive power
and it can't stay open forever.

545
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,192
And like a safe, it..

546
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:14,004
It can only be opened from the outside.

547
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:18,773
It closed on me, Sam.

548
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,796
That's why I never came home.

549
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,992
So the portal, it activated

550
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,790
when I came in. So it's open now.

551
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:35,100
Not for long.

552
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,612
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.

553
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:40,994
So we go now. Go home.
We make a run for it.

554
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,375
-We get you out of here.
-Don't rush.

555
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,640
What do you mean?
The portal's gonna close.

556
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,511
What? What is it?

557
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:53,383
The moment Flynn is on the Grid, Clu
will stop at nothing to obtain his disk.

558
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,794
My disk is everything, Sam.

559
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:59,163
It's the master key. The golden ticket.
The way out.

560
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:03,794
-And not just for me.
-What do you mean?

561
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,696
Our worlds are more connected
than anyone knows.

562
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,060
Clu figures if 1 can be in...

563
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:10,892
He can be out?

564
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:14,331
-With my disk, it's possible.
-And then what?

565
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:16,924
Game over.

566
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,434
The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

567
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,471
What's more imperfect than our world?

568
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,249
I can't let that happen. I won't.

569
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,900
So what do we do? Nothing?

570
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,960
It's amazing how productive
doing nothing can be.

571
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:39,586
Clu's planning something.
We've known that for a while.

572
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,633
Programs have been disappearing.

573
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:44,208
There's unrest out there,
even revolution.

574
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:48,324
If we sit tight, Clu might
be brought down from the inside.

575
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,839
If the portal is closing, we can't
sit around. We have to move now.

576
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:56,562
Tell me, what brought you here,
to the Grid?

577
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:59,321
Alan got your page.

578
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:02,049
I didn't send any page.

579
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:03,966
It was Clu.

580
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,741
Clu sent that page.
That's why you're here.

581
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,790
This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece

582
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,390
on the board to change the game!

583
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:14,606
With you, he got more
than he ever dreamed.

584
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:19,475
This is precisely what he wants.
Us together heading for the portal.

585
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,833
It's his game now.
The only way to win is not to play.

586
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,046
Well, that's a hell of a way to live.

587
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:29,748
But it is a way.

588
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,361
We can go home.

589
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,178
Don't you want that?

590
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:45,921
Sometimes life has a way of moving you
past things like wants and hopes.

591
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:51,460
That's great, Dad.
Keep telling yourself that.

592
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:58,727
Good night, Sam.

593
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,152
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

594
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:27,314
I mean, he built Clu.
Why doesn't he just end him?

595
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,815
He could,
but it would require reintegration.

596
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:32,454
Yeah, all right.

597
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:35,962
Flynn would never survive the event.
It would mean the end of them both.

598
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,837
If he refuses to save himself, then I will.

599
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:45,814
How?

600
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:48,281
I'm going through the portal.

601
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:50,212
Clu wants Flynn's disk, not mine.

602
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:54,567
I'm going to find Alan and we'll figure
this thing out from the other side.

603
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:58,241
This may be Clu's game here, but
in my world, he's gone in one keystroke.

604
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,638
But I can't do anything
unless I get to the portal.

605
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,370
And my guts tell me

606
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:08,147
that you don't want to be stuck
in this place for eternity either.

607
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,156
I really think you should consider
your father's wisdom.

608
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,068
Il have.

609
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,620
There's someone I once knew,

610
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,672
a program named Zuse
who fought alongside the ISOs.

611
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:29,026
They say he can get anyone anywhere.

612
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:32,881
How do I find him?

613
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,709
This is his sector.

614
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,901
Make it there alive, and he'll find you.

615
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,414
Sam?

616
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,330
Sam?

617
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:07,073
All programs are required
to present identity disks

618
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,940
at city checkpoints.

619
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:15,683
Hey, man. It's your lucky day.

620
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:25,659
-Any program without their disk...
-Stop him!

621
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:28,221
...Will be taken into custody.

622
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:34,513
Any program in violation of their
function is subject to termination.

623
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,695
Sam Flynn? You remember me?

624
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:42,939
-Yeah. You gave me some advice.
-And you followed it.

625
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,203
It's unfortunate we met the way we did.

626
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:50,035
You have a good night.

627
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,490
You're looking for someone.

628
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,158
What makes you say that?

629
01:06:58,248 --> 01:07:00,028
Intuition.

630
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:06,032
Sir, the sentries downtown
have recovered Flynn's light cycle.

631
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:10,784
We've traced it to its point of origin.

632
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,695
Prepare the light runner, Quorra.

633
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:41,969
We're going downtown.

634
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:06,194
Thank you for bringing my son to me.

635
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:07,589
Flynn!

636
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:10,414
You don't need to go.
I've sent him to someone we can trust.

637
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,720
Quorra, there is no choice.

638
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,786
I won't lose him again.

639
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:20,863
Chaos. Good news.

640
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:04,894
Relax. They're occupied.

641
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:15,191
His name is Castor. If you want to speak
to Zuse, you need to go through him.

642
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:18,055
Where's your sense of humor,
my friend?

643
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:21,381
Programs are disappearing.
Soon none of us will be left.

644
01:09:21,823 --> 01:09:24,254
Zuse can unite the factions,
foment revolution.

645
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,697
-Of course Zuse can do these things.
-Grant me an audience.

646
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:31,033
Your enthusiasm is intoxicating,
my dear Bartik,

647
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:33,897
but Zuse's time is precious.

648
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,350
We shall see.

649
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,107
l brought your boy Flynn.

650
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:44,889
If you'll excuse me for a moment,
l have to attend to something.

651
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,447
But have a drink,
courtesy of the End of Line Club!

652
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:50,659
It is happening.

653
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,693
Come, away from
these primitive functions.

654
01:09:55,258 --> 01:09:57,338
The son of Flynn.

655
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:02,050
Of all the innumerable possibilities,
he has to walk into mine.

656
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,873
Libations

657
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:07,651
for everybody!

658
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:13,703
I'm Castor, your host.

659
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:16,456
Provider of any and all entertainments

660
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:19,123
and diversions.

661
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:20,682
At your service.

662
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:25,489
I'm looking for Zuse.

663
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:28,402
Indeed. Many are.

664
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,541
Where can I find him?

665
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:34,367
This, pretty miss, is a conversation
best had behind closed doors.

666
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,997
Perhaps we should retire
to my private lounge.

667
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,059
I designed it myself, you know. It's true.

668
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:48,427
I'm stepping away for a moment, boys.
Change the scheme, alter the mood.

669
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:53,261
Electrify the boys and girls
if you'd be so kind.

670
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:57,642
Thank you.

671
01:10:57,854 --> 01:11:00,374
Gem. My name is Gem.

672
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:43,715
Cozy.

673
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:07,003
-You are Clu.
-lam Clu.

674
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:11,633
-You will create the perfect system.
-I will create the perfect system.

675
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,411
Together we're gonna
change the world, man.

676
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,148
Let's move.

677
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:50,722
Zuse has been around

678
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,710
since the earliest days
of the gaming grid.

679
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:57,022
By necessity,
he has to mind all the percentages.

680
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,295
All the angles.

681
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,238
So when do I meet him?

682
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:07,060
You just did.

683
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:14,273
After the Purge,
I needed to reinvent myself.

684
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,804
Self-preservation, you understand.

685
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:26,161
Now, what can I do for you?

686
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:31,242
I need to get to the portal.

687
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:32,874
Well, it's closing quickly,

688
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,472
as I'm sure you're aware.

689
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,208
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

690
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,460
And it's quite the journey.

691
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:42,264
Beyond the far reaches of the Outlands.

692
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:46,655
Your father didn't want any programs
slipping out accidentally, did he?

693
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:52,591
-Can you help me?
-Of course.

694
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:56,499
But first, as a man who prides himself
on staying well informed,

695
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,243
I must ask who sent you my way.

696
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,425
Her name's Quorra.

697
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,604
Said she met you a long time ago.

698
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:09,743
Indeed she did.

699
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:11,652
Many cycles ago.

700
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,302
It was a different time.

701
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:19,138
But we're not here to relive the past.
Let's see about your future, shall we?

702
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,988
We'll have to change your attire

703
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:25,281
and you'll need a forged disk.
Not easy these days.

704
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,300
And of course you'll need transport

705
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,214
to cross the Sea of Simulation.

706
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,045
This is going to be quite the ride.

707
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:59,463
I believed in users once before.

708
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,070
Playing all the angles.

709
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:08,933
Resist!

710
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,150
The game has changed, son of Flynn!

711
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:40,083
I met your friend. He's fantastic!

712
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,469
Behold! The son of our maker!

713
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:58,906
Yeah!

714
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:10,154
Yeah, yeah!

715
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:13,301
Yeah, yeah!

716
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:51,258
Go, go!

717
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:58,675
Let's split, man.

718
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,657
A little help here maybe?

719
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,374
Your disk.

720
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,463
Dad, it's gone.

721
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:07,751
It is.

722
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:12,135
I'm sorry. I know I messed up.

723
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:15,413
We can go back.

724
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,014
-l can go back.
-No, we stay together.

725
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:21,076
-Dad, I can do this.
-You've done enough already!

726
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:28,539
Sam, you're really...

727
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:33,487
You're messing with my Zen thing, man.

728
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:37,535
She's stable.

729
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:41,737
-So what do we do now?
- don't know. Nothing.

730
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,828
We do nothing.

731
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,983
Be still.

732
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:51,212
Wait.

733
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:01,678
You ever jump a freight train?

734
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:07,106
We do it your way.
Full-on sprint to the portal.

735
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:09,236
If we beat Clu there, we have a chance.

736
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:10,705
Let's get her out of here.

737
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,338
This'll take us there.

738
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,640
-ls she gonna make it?
-I don't know.

739
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:03,358
I've got to identify the damaged code.

740
01:21:03,726 --> 01:21:06,885
The sequencing
is just enormously complex.

741
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:12,557
-But didn't you write it?
-Some of it. The rest of it is just

742
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:18,218
beyond me.

743
01:21:19,742 --> 01:21:21,852
She's an ISO.

744
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,347
Yeah. The last ISO.

745
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,175
All this time,

746
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:30,494
you were just protecting her.

747
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:34,389
She's the miracle, man.
Everything I ever worked for.

748
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:40,005
"A digital frontier
to reshape the human condition."

749
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,432
l always thought
that was just a plug line.

750
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:47,616
In our world,
she could change everything.

751
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:51,405
Yeah.

752
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:55,683
Check that out.

753
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:05,885
She risked herself for me.

754
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:10,135
Some things are worth the risk.

755
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:25,701
Look at this.

756
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,967
Now, that is impressive
if ldo say so myself.

757
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:36,656
Come on, it's gonna take a while
for her system to reboot.

758
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,925
Now it's time for you to tell me a story.

759
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,490
The boy and Flynn are gone.

760
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:04,209
I presume, Your Excellency,
they perished in the elevator.

761
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:09,516
You presume?

762
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,780
Find them.

763
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:21,317
Icecaps are melting,
war in the Middle East,

764
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:23,693
Lakers‘Celtics back at it.

765
01:23:25,067 --> 01:23:27,907
I don't know. Rich are getting richer,
poor are getting poorer.

766
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,767
Cell phones, online dating, Wi-Fi.

767
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,889
-What's Wi-Fi?
-Wireless interlinking.

768
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,859
-Of digital devices?
-Yeah.

769
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:40,617
l thought of that in '85.

770
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,219
Mom and Dad are...

771
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,181
-l assume that...
-Yeah.

772
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,806
Mac when I was 12

773
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:59,741
and Gram five years later.

774
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:06,268
You remember that night
when you didn't come home?

775
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:07,884
-Well...
-You said...

776
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:09,946
I said I'd show you the Grid.

777
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,294
You should have seen this place
back then.

778
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:20,204
I couldn't wait to show it to you.
Could not wait.

779
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,139
Must have been something
before Clu screwed it up.

780
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:25,042
No, no, he...

781
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:29,394
He's me. I screwed it up.

782
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:33,066
Chasing after perfection.

783
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,650
Chasing after
what was right in front of me.

784
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:41,370
Right in front of me.

785
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,554
Look what you've accomplished.

786
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,790
It's incredible.

787
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,310
Sam,

788
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:53,315
I'd have given it all up
for one more day with you.

789
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:07,732
Hey.

790
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,397
Remember your old Ducati?

791
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:13,646
You kidding? Not a day goes by
I don't think about that bike.

792
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,619
-Yeah, well, I'm fixing her up.
-You busted my bike?

793
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:23,186
Twenty years in the shed, no tarp.
I mean, she needed a little love.

794
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:26,853
How does she run?

795
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:30,629
Well, when I'm done, better than ever.

796
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,577
Well, man, I'd like to see that.

797
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:37,867
You will.

798
01:25:41,403 --> 01:25:42,363
Here.

799
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:44,960
She's rebooting. Give her this.

800
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:48,706
The old man's gonna knock on the sky,
listen to the sound.

801
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:16,840
When Flynn entered the space,

802
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:20,373
everything changed.

803
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:23,453
I've never seen anything quite like it.

804
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,532
The awe was

805
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:28,973
palpable.

806
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,706
-Was it?
-l presume

807
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:36,428
our understanding is still valid?

808
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:40,226
Control of the city?

809
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,689
A sizeable request, I know.

810
01:26:44,099 --> 01:26:46,649
But seemingly fitting compensation.

811
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:48,862
Don't you think?

812
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:53,535
How long have you been
searching for this, Clu?

813
01:26:55,077 --> 01:26:57,387
About 1,000 cycles. No?

814
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,230
Just imagine the secrets it holds.

815
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:07,129
The master key to any and all riddles

816
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:10,343
of the Grid, Grid, Grid, Grid...

817
01:27:13,495 --> 01:27:15,105
But there's something else, too.

818
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:16,914
Isn't there?

819
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:18,799
I've heard the chatter

820
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:22,087
about this private initiative.

821
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:34,700
l realize that our alliance is,

822
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,407
at times,

823
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:37,958
uneasy.

824
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:39,965
But always necessary.

825
01:27:41,957 --> 01:27:43,447
You know you need me

826
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,505
right where I am.

827
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:47,104
Clu?

828
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:49,818
Of course you're right.

829
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:52,409
Enjoy the drink.

830
01:28:00,242 --> 01:28:02,142
End of line, man.

831
01:28:12,354 --> 01:28:12,753
Hey. It's okay. We're safe for now.

832
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:14,834
Hey. It's okay. We're safe for now.

833
01:28:15,157 --> 01:28:17,497
We're heading east towards the portal.

834
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:22,195
Clu has the disk.

835
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,611
Once I get out, ! can shut him down.

836
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:31,196
I should never have sent you to Zuse.
It was a mistake.

837
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:33,893
It's okay. I've made a few myself.

838
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:41,108
Where is he?

839
01:28:42,217 --> 01:28:44,767
I think he's knocking on the sky.

840
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,120
And listening to the sound.

841
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:49,850
Yeah.

842
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:52,371
How did you find him?

843
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,090
It's okay.

844
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:07,264
I know.

845
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:14,727
It was during the Purge.

846
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:17,867
Clu was relentless.

847
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:21,443
The Black Guard were executing ISOs
in the streets.

848
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:25,418
Everyone I knew disappeared.

849
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,203
Then they came for me.

850
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:34,897
Sol ran.

851
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:39,101
A sympathetic program
smuggled me out of the city.

852
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,791
But soon they had me surrounded.

853
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:43,953
I prepared for the end.

854
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:46,455
And just as everything was going dark,

855
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:49,945
I felt a hand on my shoulder.

856
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:54,828
And when I opened my eyes,

857
01:29:56,491 --> 01:30:00,391
standing above me was the Creator.

858
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:05,111
Your father.

859
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,392
He saved me.

860
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:15,937
I guess you could say I'm a rescue.

861
01:30:35,397 --> 01:30:37,007
Hell of a view.

862
01:30:37,332 --> 01:30:39,852
It used to let us know
that Flynn was here.

863
01:30:40,235 --> 01:30:42,344
It became the symbol
of something bigger,

864
01:30:42,704 --> 01:30:45,634
something better than this world.

865
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:48,964
I've never been this close before.

866
01:30:50,412 --> 01:30:52,692
It's how Il imagine a sunrise to be.

867
01:30:53,048 --> 01:30:55,128
Trust me. There's no comparison.

868
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:00,549
What's it like?

869
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:04,981
-The sun?
-Yeah.

870
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,907
Man...

871
01:31:09,698 --> 01:31:12,038
I've never had to describe it before.

872
01:31:14,336 --> 01:31:15,416
Warm.

873
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:19,004
Radiant.

874
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:23,553
Beautiful.

875
01:31:49,371 --> 01:31:51,831
Get below! Move!

876
01:31:53,942 --> 01:31:56,022
This isn't supposed to be here.

877
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,505
-What happened?
-A new course.

878
01:32:14,763 --> 01:32:16,053
What is this?

879
01:32:17,165 --> 01:32:18,625
Clu can't create programs.

880
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,440
He can only destroy or repurpose them.

881
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,950
Repurpose them for what?

882
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:32,040
Battalion 6,
report to Staging Area Alpha.

883
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,049
He's building an army.

884
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:39,419
Let's go.

885
01:32:39,621 --> 01:32:44,221
All high-level functions,
report immediately to combat stations.

886
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:12,034
-Goodbye.
-Quorra!

887
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:15,443
-What's she doing?
-Removing herself from the equation.

888
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:35,185
Tron.

889
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:38,982
He's alive.

890
01:33:39,814 --> 01:33:42,034
Throne ship is approaching.

891
01:33:45,186 --> 01:33:48,465
-We can't just let her go.
-No, Sam, there's another way.

892
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:51,727
Throne ship is approaching.

893
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:05,103
Well done, sir.

894
01:34:19,554 --> 01:34:21,804
I've never seen anything like it.

895
01:34:22,524 --> 01:34:25,774
Humbly, sir, l know
you have greater designs

896
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:28,571
than any of us understand.

897
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,341
What does it do?

898
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:59,058
She's gonna wind up like one of them.

899
01:34:59,761 --> 01:35:00,871
Keep moving, Sam.

900
01:35:11,606 --> 01:35:15,005
You are a very rare bird,
aren't you, now?

901
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:25,231
Where's your disk?

902
01:35:27,989 --> 01:35:29,629
Where is he?

903
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:34,156
It must have been so lonely out there.

904
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:38,040
How tragic to be the only one.

905
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:42,815
I've seen what users
are capable of, Clu.

906
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:45,958
You don't belong with them.

907
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:53,896
I have something very special
in mind for you.

908
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,182
Take her upstairs.

909
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,334
And find them.

910
01:36:02,223 --> 01:36:06,473
You'll have to excuse me. You arrived
just as I was preparing a little toast.

911
01:36:22,076 --> 01:36:23,826
Greetings, programs!

912
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:31,462
Together we have achieved
a great many things.

913
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:35,693
We have created a vast, complex
system. We've maintained it.

914
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,647
We've improved it.

915
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:43,473
We have rid it of its imperfection.

916
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,840
Not to mention

917
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:50,000
rid it of the false deity
who sought to enslave us.

918
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,700
Kevin Flynn!

919
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:57,706
Where are you now?

920
01:37:01,516 --> 01:37:04,356
My fellow programs,
let there be no doubt

921
01:37:04,786 --> 01:37:07,066
that our world is a cage no more.

922
01:37:07,789 --> 01:37:11,889
For at this moment,
the key to the next frontier is finally

923
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,330
in our possession!

924
01:37:19,734 --> 01:37:21,484
Your disk.

925
01:37:21,769 --> 01:37:23,319
And unlike our selfish Creator,

926
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:26,881
who reserved the privilege of our world
only for himself,

927
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:30,625
I will make their world open

928
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:33,545
and available to all of us!

929
01:37:36,651 --> 01:37:37,851
Yes!

930
01:37:38,486 --> 01:37:39,976
To all of us!

931
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:52,122
He's taking all of this with him.

932
01:37:52,834 --> 01:37:54,504
He's figured out how to do it.

933
01:37:54,769 --> 01:37:56,499
And whatever we find there,

934
01:37:56,804 --> 01:37:58,734
there our system will grow!

935
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,230
There our system will blossom!

936
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:05,248
Do this.

937
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:07,849
Prove yourselves.
Prove yourselves to me!

938
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:09,646
Be loyal to me!

939
01:38:10,318 --> 01:38:12,868
And I will never betray you!

940
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,193
Dad, we have to get your disk.

941
01:38:27,502 --> 01:38:29,962
We gotta get to the portal.
You shut them down outside.

942
01:38:30,338 --> 01:38:32,737
Even if make it, you won't
last in here, nor will Quorra.

943
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:36,007
-We'll be all right. Come on.
-I'm not going home without you.

944
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:38,648
Sam...

945
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:40,923
The same team.

946
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:43,276
Remember?

947
01:38:45,553 --> 01:38:47,363
l was afraid you were gonna say that.

948
01:38:48,623 --> 01:38:50,522
Meet me on the flight deck in five
and get us some wheels.

949
01:38:50,825 --> 01:38:52,785
Wheels? What's your plan?

950
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:56,031
I'm a user. I'll improvise.

951
01:38:57,865 --> 01:38:59,615
Maximize efficiency.

952
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:03,815
Rid the new system of its imperfection!

953
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:09,867
My vision is clear, fellow programs.

954
01:39:11,212 --> 01:39:14,902
Out there is a new world!

955
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:18,517
Out there is our victory!

956
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:21,624
Out there

957
01:39:23,858 --> 01:39:26,108
is our destiny.

958
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:12,404
Identify yourself, program.

959
01:40:15,877 --> 01:40:18,627
I'm not a program.
My name is Sam Flynn.

960
01:40:42,937 --> 01:40:45,126
-Identify yourself.
-I'm taking this vehicle.

961
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:47,206
You are not authorized.

962
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,880
Right away, sir.

963
01:40:53,114 --> 01:40:56,134
Watch your step, please,
as you board the aircraft.

964
01:41:07,762 --> 01:41:09,751
Long live the users.

965
01:41:16,771 --> 01:41:19,291
Master key disengaged.

966
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,980
Master key disengaged.

967
01:41:22,476 --> 01:41:26,135
l came with a girl, a program.
Where is she?

968
01:41:29,116 --> 01:41:30,636
Sam! Go!

969
01:41:57,044 --> 01:41:59,154
-Why are you here?
-We gotta get to the flight deck.

970
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:00,650
Clu will be here any minute.

971
01:42:00,848 --> 01:42:02,518
-We'll never make it.
-Come on.

972
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,320
Come on, kiddo.

973
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:16,491
Radical, man.

974
01:42:24,572 --> 01:42:25,912
Hurry!

975
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,660
Made it.

976
01:42:46,594 --> 01:42:49,314
Try and hold on to this.
You're gonna need it.

977
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:57,919
You got this, Quorra. It's all in the wrist.

978
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:13,987
Light fighter 5. Unauthorized launch.

979
01:43:13,988 --> 01:43:16,478
Light fighter 5. Unauthorized launch.

980
01:43:37,845 --> 01:43:39,685
Death to the user!

981
01:44:04,305 --> 01:44:05,445
Head towards the light, Quorra.

982
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:10,082
Where did you learn that move?

983
01:44:10,377 --> 01:44:12,717
ENCOM Tower. Couple of nights ago.

984
01:44:15,483 --> 01:44:17,293
ENCOM Tower.

985
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,030
Light jets.

986
01:44:21,722 --> 01:44:22,982
Here they come.

987
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:25,894
Sam, take the turret.

988
01:44:34,668 --> 01:44:36,748
Man, I'm all over this.

989
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:40,990
Yeah!

990
01:44:50,985 --> 01:44:53,915
Yeah! One down, five to go!

991
01:44:59,994 --> 01:45:00,924
Nice.

992
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:12,200
We gotta split them up!

993
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,419
Come on.

994
01:45:37,731 --> 01:45:38,840
Have a nice swim!

995
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:47,780
We gotta get behind them!

996
01:45:55,816 --> 01:45:58,656
-I don't think this is a good idea.
-You're probably right.

997
01:46:04,792 --> 01:46:06,102
He's gaining on us!

998
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:38,317
Yes!

999
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:50,930
It's jammed.

1000
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:59,540
Tron. What have you become?

1001
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:06,119
Come on.

1002
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,702
Flynn, go!

1003
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:17,419
Rinzler! Take the shot!

1004
01:47:20,534 --> 01:47:22,084
Finish the game!

1005
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:31,860
Roll!

1006
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:46,888
fight for the users.

1007
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:59,357
That's it. It's over.

1008
01:48:00,574 --> 01:48:01,534
It's over!

1009
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:15,863
Quorra, there's something
I need you to do.

1010
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:06,634
Let's get you home, Dad.

1011
01:49:10,878 --> 01:49:12,077
There it is.

1012
01:49:12,813 --> 01:49:16,593
-Take her down.
-Hang on. This could be rough.

1013
01:50:09,236 --> 01:50:11,226
This is mine.

1014
01:50:16,643 --> 01:50:18,543
l had a feeling you'd be here!

1015
01:50:19,713 --> 01:50:22,373
The cycles haven't been kind,
have they?

1016
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:25,667
You don't look so bad.

1017
01:50:27,187 --> 01:50:30,376
I did everything.
Everything you ever asked.

1018
01:50:31,358 --> 01:50:32,938
I know you did.

1019
01:50:33,193 --> 01:50:36,153
-l executed the plan!
-As you saw it.

1020
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:41,230
You... You promised that we
would change the world together.

1021
01:50:42,202 --> 01:50:44,132
-You broke your promise.
-l know.

1022
01:50:44,605 --> 01:50:45,865
l understand that now.

1023
01:50:46,073 --> 01:50:49,143
I took this system
to its maximum potential.

1024
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:51,540
l created the perfect system!

1025
01:50:51,845 --> 01:50:55,185
The thing about perfection
is that it's unknowable.

1026
01:50:56,750 --> 01:51:00,850
It's impossible but it's also
right in front of us all the time.

1027
01:51:01,488 --> 01:51:04,738
You wouldn't know that
because I didn't when I created you.

1028
01:51:06,927 --> 01:51:08,507
I'm sorry, Clu.

1029
01:51:10,797 --> 01:51:12,967
I'm sorry.

1030
01:51:34,922 --> 01:51:36,031
Go.

1031
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:50,590
Clu!

1032
01:51:51,638 --> 01:51:53,688
Remember what you came for.

1033
01:52:07,921 --> 01:52:08,851
Dad!

1034
01:52:09,056 --> 01:52:10,396
You knew I'd beat you.

1035
01:52:10,691 --> 01:52:13,411
And still you did all this? For him.

1036
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,040
No.

1037
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,910
No!

1038
01:52:28,108 --> 01:52:29,338
Why?

1039
01:52:31,144 --> 01:52:32,404
He's my son.

1040
01:52:38,885 --> 01:52:39,815
Go!

1041
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:46,749
Dad!

1042
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,330
Sam! It's time!

1043
01:52:55,802 --> 01:52:56,852
No!

1044
01:52:57,337 --> 01:52:59,797
Sam, it's what he wants.

1045
01:53:02,142 --> 01:53:03,871
I'm not leaving you!

1046
01:53:04,478 --> 01:53:05,818
Take her!

1047
01:53:17,424 --> 01:53:18,854
Yes!

1048
01:53:46,687 --> 01:53:48,207
Goodbye, kiddo.

1049
01:54:19,686 --> 01:54:21,385
No!

1050
01:55:32,492 --> 01:55:34,132
Al?

1051
01:55:38,732 --> 01:55:40,372
You paged me?

1052
01:55:41,067 --> 01:55:42,557
Yeah.

1053
01:55:43,503 --> 01:55:45,553
I need you at ENCOM at 8:00 a.m.

1054
01:55:47,741 --> 01:55:49,111
What about the board?

1055
01:55:50,911 --> 01:55:52,641
You're chairman now.

1056
01:55:55,148 --> 01:55:57,338
I'm taking the company back, Alan.

1057
01:56:01,688 --> 01:56:02,798
And...

1058
01:56:04,191 --> 01:56:05,681
You were right.

1059
01:56:07,527 --> 01:56:08,817
About what?

1060
01:56:10,597 --> 01:56:12,027
About everything.

1061
01:56:37,057 --> 01:56:38,227
What's next, Sam?

1062
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:47,150
I guess we're supposed
to change the world.

1063
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:54,001
Come on. I wanna show you something.

1064
02:05:05,631 --> 02:05:06,531
English - US
