1
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,934
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

2
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,226
l can break through walls,
I just can't...

3
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,742
- That's fine.
- [can't get this on.

4
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,687
So, Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

5
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,950
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn''t.

6
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,359
Who wants the pressure
of being super all the time?

7
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,457
Of course I have a secret identity.

8
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,656
Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on.

9
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,616
Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl,
know what I mean?

10
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,157
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

11
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,598
Think it'll strengthen
the relationship or something.

12
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,791
Il said, "Girl, 1 don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego."

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,520
I mean, you tell me you're
a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

14
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,688
that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

15
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,301
No matter how many times
you save the world,

16
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,554
it always manages to get back
in jeopardy again.

17
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,064
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know?

18
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,521
For a little bit. feel like the maid.
"] just cleaned up this mess.

19
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,218
Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

20
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,741
- [could get to that point.
- "Please?"

21
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,092
Don't get up. We're not finished.

22
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,398
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

23
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,065
Relax a little and raise a family.

24
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,285
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game!

25
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,028
I'm up there with the big dogs!
Girls, come on.

26
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,407
Leave the saving of the world
to the men? I don't think so.

27
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,181
I don't think so.

28
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,536
We interrupt for an important bulletin.

29
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,003
A deadly high-speed pursuit between
police and armed gunmen is underway,

30
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,653
traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave.

31
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,934
Yeah, I've got time.

32
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,555
Mr. Incredible.

33
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,331
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

34
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,957
Certainly. l suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.

35
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,801
No, he's quite tame.

36
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,882
Let go now.

37
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,773
Thank you, Mr. Incredible.
You've done it again.

38
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,065
- You're the best.
- No, I'm just here to help.

39
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,591
Attention all units.
We have a tour bus robbery...

40
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,190
Tour bus robbery. I've still got time.

41
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,533
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

42
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,329
- Cool! Ready for take-off!
- What the...?

43
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,018
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

44
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,754
What? No.

45
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,975
You're that kid from the fan club.

46
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,898
Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy!

47
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,960
My name is IncrediBoy.

48
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,095
I've been nice, I've stood for photos,

49
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,704
signed every scrap of paper
you pushed at me...

50
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,404
No, don't worry about training me.
I know your moves,

51
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,407
crimefighting style,
favorite catchphrases, everything!

52
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,353
I'm your number one fan!

53
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,448
Hey! Hey, wait!

54
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,819
You know...

55
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,560
.-you can tell a lot about a woman
by the contents of her purse,

56
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,551
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

57
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,097
Hey, look...

58
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,908
Elastigirl.

59
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,942
Mr. Incredible.

60
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,592
- It's all right. I've got him.
- Sure, you've got him.

61
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,935
- [took him out for you.
- Sure, you did.

62
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,934
- His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

63
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,367
- My job.
- Asimple thank you will suffice.

64
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,611
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

65
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,758
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?

66
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,953
Whatever happened
to equal treatment?

67
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,566
Look, the lady got me first.

68
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,765
- Well, we could share, you know.
- L work alone.

69
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,415
Well, I think you need to be more...

70
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,718
.. flexible.

71
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,980
Are you doing anything later?

72
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,442
Il have a previous engagement.

73
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,942
Now, you just stay here.

74
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,831
They usually pick up
the garbage in an hour.

75
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,561
- Hey, Incredible!
- Hey, Frozone!

76
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,974
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- [still got time.

77
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,739
He's gonna jump!

78
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,988
I think you broke something.

79
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,800
With counseling,
I think you'll come to forgive me.

80
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,793
Wait a minute.

81
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:53,936
Bomb Voyage.

82
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,824
Mr. Incredible...!

83
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,102
And IncrediBoy!

84
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,924
IncrediBoy?

85
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,647
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

86
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,590
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

87
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,797
Little oaf...!

88
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,104
Can we talk?

89
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,199
You always say be true to yourself,

90
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,021
but you never say
which part to be true to.

91
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,654
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
lam your ward... IncrediBoy!

92
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,996
And now, you have officially
carried it too far, Buddy.

93
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,612
This is because I don't have powers,
isn't it?

94
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,378
Not every superhero has powers,
you know. You can be super without them.

95
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,985
l invented these.
I can fly. Can you fly?

96
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,475
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

97
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,401
And your outfit is totally ridiculous!

98
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,590
Just give me one chance!
I'll show you. I'll go get the police.

99
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,250
- Buddy, don't!
- It'll only take a second.

100
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,269
No, stop!
There's a bomb!

101
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,443
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

102
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,322
- L can do this if you let go!
- Will you just...?

103
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,585
- I'm trying to help! Stop!
- Let go of my cape!

104
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,361
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

105
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,592
I can help you. You're making a...

106
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,731
The injured jumper.
You sent paramedics?

107
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,930
They picked him up.

108
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,558
The blast in that building
was caused by Bomb Voyage

109
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,334
who I caught robbing the vault.

110
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,559
We might nab him
if we set up a perimeter.

111
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,631
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

112
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,156
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

113
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,379
You're not affiliated with me!
Holy smokes, I'm late.

114
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,771
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

115
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,952
- What about Bomb Voyage?
- Any other night, I'd go after him,

116
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,016
but I really gotta go. Don't worry.
We'll get him! Eventually!

117
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,585
- ls the night still young?
- You're very late.

118
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,985
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

119
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,574
Showtime.

120
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,733
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

121
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,997
You're late. When you asked
if l was doing anything later,

122
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,377
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was playful banter.

123
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,960
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

124
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,539
You need to be more... flexible.

125
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,032
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

126
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,320
you've gotta be more
than Mr. Incredible.

127
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,469
You know that. Don't you?

128
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,985
- ..80 long as you both shall live?
- ldo.

129
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,024
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

130
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,133
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

131
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,300
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

132
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,403
In a stunning turn of events,
a superhero is being sued

133
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,974
for saving someone
who didn't want to be saved.

134
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,196
The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,

135
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:26,303
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,

136
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,299
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.

137
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,824
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

138
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,930
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions",

139
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,420
- causes him daily pain.
- saved your life!

140
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,882
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

141
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,641
My client has no further comment.

142
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,719
Five days later, another suit was filed
by the victims of the el train accident.

143
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,334
Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.

144
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,658
And opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.

145
00:10:56,256 --> 00:11:00,616
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

146
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,904
Time for them to join us, or go away.

147
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,910
Under tremendous pressure,
and the crushing financial burden

148
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,502
of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,

149
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,299
the government quietly initiated
the Superhero Relocation Program.

150
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,030
The supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions,

151
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:21,384
in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work.

152
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,471
Where are they now?

153
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,530
They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.

154
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:32,781
Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.

155
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,010
Denied? You're denying my claim?

156
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,688
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

157
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,360
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

158
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,411
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

159
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,421
- It states clearly...
- l can't pay for this.

160
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,421
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

161
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,990
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

162
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,399
We're now officially moved in.

163
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,328
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

164
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,697
The last three years
don't count because...

165
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,563
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official.

166
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,813
- Why do we have so much junk?
- Listen, I've got a client.

167
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,920
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

168
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,473
I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

169
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,612
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

170
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,579
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

171
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,159
I don't know what I'll do.

172
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,130
Listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

173
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,806
I'd like to say take a copy of
your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

174
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,983
Norma Wilcox. W-I-L-C-O-X.
On the third floor. But I can't.

175
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,915
l also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

176
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,512
with our legal department
on the second floor.

177
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,058
l wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

178
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,762
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

179
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,331
- Oh, thank you, young man.
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I know you're upset!

180
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,685
Pretend to be upset.

181
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,990
Parr!

182
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,455
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

183
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,811
Someone broke
into their house, Mr. Huph.

184
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,737
- Their policy covers...
- [don't wanna know about it.

185
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,530
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

186
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,314
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

187
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,240
to every Harry Hardluck and
Sally Sobstory that calls you.

188
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,536
Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.

189
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,217
l appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

190
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,500
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

191
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,680
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

192
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,368
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

193
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,417
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

194
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,323
Well... not really. No.

195
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:54,723
Actually, not.

196
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,743
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

197
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,320
l hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

198
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,385
See? You see?

199
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,210
You don't see it?

200
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,438
He moves! Right there!

201
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,947
Wait, wait! Right there!

202
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,948
Right as I'm sitting down!

203
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,776
don't know how he does it,

204
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,081
but there's no tack before he moves

205
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,060
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

206
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,907
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

207
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,147
This little rat is guilty!

208
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:40,396
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

209
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,623
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

210
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,240
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

211
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:55,607
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

212
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,242
We need to find a better outlet.
A more... constructive outlet.

213
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,497
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

214
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,806
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

215
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,209
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

216
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,833
Dashiell Robert Parr,

217
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,959
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

218
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,286
The last thing you need is temptation.

219
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:21,608
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

220
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,048
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

221
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,900
Right now, the world wants us to fit in,
so we gotta be like everybody else.

222
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,965
Dad said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

223
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:35,825
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

224
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,679
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

225
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,795
Hey, Rydinger, where you headed?

226
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,376
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

227
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,471
- Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?
- That's kind of funny.

228
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,899
Hey, Tony, do you play football?

229
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,944
Tony, I thought we were
. .
gonna go swimming.

230
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,731
He looked at me.

231
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,911
Come on, Violet!

232
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,811
Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway...

233
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,338
Oh, great.

234
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,386
Mom.

235
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,933
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

236
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:29,586
You make weird faces, honey.

237
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,079
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Yeah.

238
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,136
Smaller bites, Dash.

239
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,106
Bob, could you help
the carnivore cut his meat?

240
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,463
Dash, you have something you
wanna tell your father about school?

241
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,437
- Well, we dissected a frog.
- Dash got sent to the office again.

242
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,218
- Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

243
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,384
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

244
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,480
- What?! What for?
- Nothing.

245
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,356
He put a tack on the teacher's chair...
during class.

246
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,119
Nobody saw me.
You could barely see it on the tape.

247
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,325
They caught you on tape
and you still got away with it?

248
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,975
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

249
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,754
We are not encouraging this.

250
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,861
I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

251
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,481
Honey!

252
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,772
Great. First the car,
now I gotta pay to fix the table...

253
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,688
What happened to the car?

254
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,594
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

255
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,018
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

256
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,801
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

257
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,430
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

258
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,556
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

259
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,384
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

260
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,416
- Well, you are.
- l said, shut up, you little insect.

261
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,076
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

262
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,449
- Honey!
- Kids! Listen to your mother.

263
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,260
She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.

264
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,039
That's it!

265
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,351
Stop it!

266
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,616
- You're gonna be toast!
- Stop running in the house.

267
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,821
Sit down!

268
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,279
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

269
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,959
You sit down! You sit down!

270
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,548
Violet!

271
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,367
Simon J. Paladino,

272
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,259
longtime advocate of superhero rights,
is missing?

273
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,164
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

274
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,305
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

275
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,747
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

276
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,383
- [need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

277
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,703
Okay. I'm intervening!

278
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,470
Violet, let go of your brother.

279
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,181
Hello?

280
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,768
Get the door.

281
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,707
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

282
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,410
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Never heard that one before.

283
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,444
Lucius!

284
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,979
- [like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

285
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,588
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

286
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,810
Bowling night.
Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

287
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,643
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

288
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,593
Don't think you've avoided
talking about the principal's office.

289
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,077
Your father and I
are still gonna discuss it.

290
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,999
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

291
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,122
Other kids don't have superpowers.

292
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,524
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

293
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,398
What does anyone
in this family know about normal?

294
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,277
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. l wanna be normal.

295
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:39,375
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

296
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,790
Lucky.

297
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,265
l meant about being normal.

298
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,730
So now I'm in deep trouble.

299
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,769
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

300
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,059
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

301
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,152
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

302
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,022
He starts this prepared speech
about how feeble l am compared to him.

303
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,341
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

304
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,193
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

305
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,215
I mean, the guy has me on a platter,
and he won't shut up.

306
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,831
- Three Municiberg, we have a 23-56...
- 23-56, what is that?

307
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,332
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

308
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,377
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

309
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,899
Tell you the truth,
I'd rather go bowling.

310
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,232
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

311
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,223
Just to shake things up.

312
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,588
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

313
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,306
They're just talking.

314
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,412
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

315
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,885
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

316
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,394
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

317
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,975
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

318
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,284
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

319
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,875
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

320
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,342
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

321
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,144
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

322
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,544
- We have a report on a fire...
- Afire. We're close!

323
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,603
- Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

324
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,786
Fire! Yeah!

325
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,103
- ls that everybody?
- Yeah, that's everyone.

326
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:27,777
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

327
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,149
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

328
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,486
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

329
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,869
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

330
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,331
You can't run out.
You can use water in the air.

331
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,031
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

332
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,140
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

333
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,314
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- lL wanted to go bowling!

334
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,660
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

335
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,660
Oh, good.

336
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,434
That ain't right.

337
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,934
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

338
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,746
Freeze!

339
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:32,737
Freeze!

340
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,435
- I'm thirsty.
- l said freeze!

341
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,368
I'm just getting a drink.

342
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:47,101
- You've had your drink. Now...
- [ know. I know. Freeze.

343
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,099
Police officers!

344
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,896
That was way too close.

345
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,548
We are not doing that again.

346
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,260
Verify you want to switch targets? Over.

347
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,850
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

348
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:47,113
- [thought you'd be back by 11.
- [said I'd be back later.

349
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,926
l assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all...

350
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,831
- .. you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

351
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,835
Is this rubble?

352
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,237
It was just a little workout.
Just to stay loose.

353
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,839
You know how I feel about that.
Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

354
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,062
- The building was coming down anyway.
- What?

355
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,972
You knocked down a building?

356
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,797
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

357
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,407
Have you been listening
to the police scanner again?

358
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,566
I performed a public service.
You act like that's bad.

359
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,283
Itis a bad thing, Bob!

360
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,154
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

361
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,308
It's better than acting like
they didn't happen!

362
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,841
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

363
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,390
is what's happening now, Bob.
You are missing this!

364
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,684
I can't believe you don't want to go to
your own son's graduation.

365
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,271
It's not a graduation.
He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

366
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,448
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

367
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,146
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

368
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,249
but if someone is exceptional...

369
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,541
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

370
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,377
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

371
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,250
- Let him go out for sports!
- [ will not be the enemy!

372
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,179
- You know why we can't.
- Because he'd be great.

373
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,375
This is not about you!

374
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,363
All right, Dash.
I know you're listening. Come on out.

375
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,823
Vi? You, too, young lady.

376
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,252
Come on. Come on out.

377
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,977
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

378
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,928
Pretty loud discussion.

379
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:24,403
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

380
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:30,077
- We're united against the forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

381
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,106
- lwas gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

382
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,542
Everything's okay.
Go back to bed. It's late.

383
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,764
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

384
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,137
In fact, we should all be in bed.

385
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:54,612
Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

386
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,683
Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

387
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,658
Haven't you got him yet?
Where is he?

388
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,334
Mr. Huph would like to talk
to you in his office.

389
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,562
- Now?
- Now.

390
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,450
Sit down, Bob.

391
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,767
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

392
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,485
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

393
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,622
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

394
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,387
Why are you unhappy?

395
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,272
Your customers make me unhappy.

396
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,084
What, you've gotten complaints?

397
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,676
Complaints I can handle.

398
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:52,124
What I can't handle is your customers’
inexplicable knowledge

399
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:56,118
of Insuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

400
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,425
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

401
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,048
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!

402
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,814
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

403
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:09,027
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that l answer no.

404
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,461
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people!

405
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,565
Starting with our stockholders.

406
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,969
Who's helping them out, huh?

407
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:23,024
You know, Bob, a company...

408
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,032
Is like an enormous clock.

409
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,844
..1S like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

410
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:33,507
It only works if all
the little cogs mesh together.

411
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:38,896
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

412
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:44,628
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

413
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,230
I'm being metaphorical, Bob.
Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

414
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,318
Bob?

415
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,410
Bob? Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Parr.

416
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,586
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

417
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,726
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He's getting mugged!

418
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,363
- Let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

419
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,872
Stop right now or you're fired!

420
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,717
Close the door.

421
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,809
Get over here, now.

422
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,951
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

423
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,832
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

424
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,677
You were this close to losing your...

425
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,104
Please report to
operating room 722 immediately.

426
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,752
- How is he?
- He'll live.

427
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,453
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

428
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,158
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

429
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,314
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

430
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,943
- [had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

431
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,236
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

432
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,620
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

433
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,254
- l know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

434
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,393
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

435
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,096
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

436
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,022
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate
what you did in the old days,

437
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,516
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

438
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:32,106
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you,
you know, for old times' sake.

439
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,481
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

440
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,894
I'll make it work. Thanks.

441
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,986
Take care of yourself.

442
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,381
What are you waiting for?

443
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,260
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

444
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,458
Me, too, kid.

445
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:40,027
"Hold still"?

446
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,345
Match: Mr. Incredible.

447
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,684
Room is secure. Commence message.

448
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:55,984
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Yes, we know who you are.

449
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,190
Rest assured,
your secret is safe with us.

450
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:02,638
My name is Mirage.
We have something in common.

451
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,601
According to the government,
neither of us exist.

452
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,879
Please pay attention, as this message

Something happened
at our testing facility.

457

- Honey!
- What?

458
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,754
- Dinner's ready.
- Okay.

damage to itself and our facilities,

00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,144
jeopardizing hundreds
of millions of dollars...

462
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:36,954
Is someone in there?

463
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:40,091
- It's the TV, trying to watch.
- Because of its sensitive nature...

464
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,489
- Stop trying. It's time for dinner.
- One minute!

465
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,392
If you accept, your payment will be
triple your current annual salary.

466
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:51,333
Call the number on the card.
Voice-matching will ensure security.

467

The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible.
You're still here.

468
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,287
You can still do great things. Or...

469
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,685
..you can listen to police scanners.
Your choice.

470
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,788
You have 24 hours to respond.

471
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,483
Think about it

472
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,442
This message will self-destruct.

473
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,949
You are one distracted guy.

474
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,156
Am I? I don't mean to be.

475
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:15,522
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

476
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:20,418
I want you to know how much it means
to me that you stay at it anyway.

477
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,369
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

478
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,722
- Something's happened.
- What?

479
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,524
- The...
- What?

480
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,109
The company is sending me
to a conference.

481
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,692
- Aconference?
- Out of town.

482
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,411
I'm gonna be gone for a few days.

483
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:38,332
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

484
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:39,779
Yes.

485
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,938
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

486
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,675
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

487
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,666
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

488
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,231
Hello?

489
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,186
This is Mr. Incredible.

490
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,272
I'm in.

491
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,079
The Omnidroid 9000
is a top secret prototype battle robot.

492
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,800
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

493
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,857
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

494
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,437
Let me guess. It got smart enough
to wonder why it had to take orders.

495
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,137
We lost control. Now it's loose
in the jungle, threatening our facility.

496
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,781
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

497
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,158
How am I going in?

498
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:27,816
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5000 feet.

499
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,460
Its cloaking devices
make it difficult to track.

500
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,863
We're pretty sure it's on
the southern half of the island.

501
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,643
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

502
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,220
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

503
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,792
You are Mr. Incredible.

504
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,548
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

505
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:09,154
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

506
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,658
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

507
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,133
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

508
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,923
Showtime.

509
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,106
My back!

510
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,485
Surprising. We must bring him back.

511
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:11,375
Sound the all clear,
and invite him to dinner.

512
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,185
Most important, keep things light.

513
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,961
Praise him. Make him feel
like we appreciate his abilities.

514
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:39,892
Am I overdressed?

515
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,451
Actually, you look rather dashing.

516
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,544
- [ take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

517
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,874
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

518
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:52,507
Of course. I do usually make it a point
to know who I'm working for.

519
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,567
He prefers a certain amount
of anonymity.

520
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,237
Surely, you of all people
understand that.

521
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:02,753
Il was just wondering, of all the places
to settle down, why live...

522
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:07,174
With a volcano? He's attracted to power.
Soaml.

523
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:11,105
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

524
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,446
I prefer to think of it
as misunderstood.

525
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,306
Aren't we all?

526
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,974
Volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on Earth.

527
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:22,127
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

528
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,330
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

529
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,754
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

530
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,913
Or you'll be late for work.

531
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,516
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

532
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:00,392
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

533
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,182
All that jazz.

534
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:11,718
You have an appointment?

535
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,916
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

536
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,298
- All visitors are required...
- Go check the electric fence.

537
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,635
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?

538
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:24,692
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in.
Come, come.

539
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:36,536
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

540
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:41,051
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

541
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,112
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prague?

542
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,362
Milan, darling. Milan.

543
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:50,171
Supermodels. Nothing super about them.

544
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,868
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

545
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:55,481
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

546
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,327
l used to design for gods.

547
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:05,028
But perhaps you come with a challenge?
Il was surprised to get your call.

548
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,263
E, I just need a patch job.

549
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,519
This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

550
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,793
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

551
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,467
Moonlighting hero work?

552
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,603
Must have happened a long time ago.

553
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:23,675
Il see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

554
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,528
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

555
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:30,471
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

556
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,815
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

557
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:36,642
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

558
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,231
Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

559
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,780
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

560
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,076
So ask me now,
before l again become sane.

561
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,965
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

562
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:50,315
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

563
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,558
- It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

564
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:58,588
- Heroic!
- Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

565
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:02,197
He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

566
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:03,567
No capes!

567
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:08,446
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

568
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,462
Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

569
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,396
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

570
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:20,906
Alf was well, another day saved
when his cape snagged on a missile fin.

571
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,669
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

572
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:24,921
Stratogale!

573
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:29,781
April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.

574
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,484
You can't generalize
about these things.

575
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,759
Meta-Man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

576
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,014
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

577
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,069
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

578
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,421
You know I'm retired from hero work.

579
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,083
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

580
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:52,984
E, l only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

581
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:57,214
Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

582
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:01,638
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

583
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:17,286
Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

584
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:20,131
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

585
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,037
- How soon can you get here?
- I'll leave tomorrow morning.

586
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,971
- See you there.
- Goodbye.

587
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:34,453
Who was that, honey? The office?

588
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,379
Another conference.
Short notice, but you know...

589
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,405
..duty calls.

590
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,338
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

591
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,899
- Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

592
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,384
- I'll call you when I get there.
- [love you.

593
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:00,557
- So much.
- [love you too.

594
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,974
This is your automated Captain.

595
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,174
Would you care for more mimosa?

596
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:22,417
- Don't mind if do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

597
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:28,341
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

598
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:38,232
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

599
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:07,094
- Hello, Mr. Incredible. Nice suit.
- Thanks.

600
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:10,725
Nice to be back, Mirage.

601
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:39,764
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at two.

602
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,304
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

603
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:45,218
See you there.

604
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,355
Edna.

605
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,053
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- This is Edna.

606
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,860
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

607
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,132
Helen Parr? You know...

608
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,370
Elastigirl?

609
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:34,288
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

610
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,332
Yes, it's been a while. Listen.

611
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:39,827
There's only one person Bob would trust
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

612
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,184
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

613
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:44,942
Much better than those horrible pajamas
he used to wear.

614
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,869
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

615
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,274
- I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

616
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:54,051
- L won't do it, you know.
- Beg, no, I'm calling about suit.

617
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:57,142
About Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

618
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,931
You come in one hour, darling.
linsist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

619
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,185
It's bigger!

620
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,043
It's badder!

621
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:42,999
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

622
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,126
It's finally ready.

623
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:52,052
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

624
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,306
but man, it wasn't good enough!

625
00:50:55,753 --> 00:50:59,323
After you trashed the last one,
l had to make some major modifications.

626
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,759
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

627
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:06,886
l mean, after all,
lam your biggest fan.

628
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,595
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

629
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,072
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

630
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,595
That ship has sailed.
All l wanted was to help you.

631
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:21,268
l only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

632
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,089
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

633
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:27,581
It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

634
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,075
You can't count on anyone.

635
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,120
Especially your heroes.

636
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,142
l was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

637
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,522
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

638
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:40,426
That's the way it works.

639
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:43,098
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

640
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,990
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

641
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,772
How do you think I got rich?
l invented weapons.

642
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:52,863
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

643
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,669
You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

644
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,812
I can't believe it.

645
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,158
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.

646
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,375
I save the best inventions for myself.

647
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:09,375
Am I good enough now?

648
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,461
Who's super now?

649
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,310
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

650
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,094
Oh, brilliant!

651
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,560
All right, try this one on
for size, big boy.

652
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,007
Gazerbeam.

653
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,377
"Kronos?"

654
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:58,779
Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

655
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:06,843
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

656
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:11,228
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

657
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:15,245
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

658
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,626
- E, I just...
- 1 did Robert's suit,

659
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:21,115
and it turned out so beautiful,
l had to continue.

660
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:25,105
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

661
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,122
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

662
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,649
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

663
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,808
That is why I show you my work.

664
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:34,717
That is why you are here.

665
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,438
Edna Mode.

666
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,955
And guest.

667
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,689
Come. Sit.

668
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,682
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

669
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,482
- [ started with the baby.
- Started?

670
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,388
Darling! I cut it a little roomy
for the free movement.

671
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,669
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

672
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:26,288
and can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

673
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,685
Completely bulletproof.

674
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,503
And machine washable.
That's a new feature.

675
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,419
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

676
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:42,645
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

677
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,109
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

678
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,627
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

679
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,788
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

680
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:56,219
Your boy's suit l designed
to withstand enormous friction

681
00:55:56,787 --> 00:56:00,596
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

682
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,441
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

683
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:08,717
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

684
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:16,549
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

685
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:19,754
and still retain its shape.

686
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:22,137
Virtually indestructible...

687
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:26,047
..yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

688
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:29,490
As an extra feature, each suit contains
a homing device,

689
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:33,737
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

690
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,645
Well, darling? What do you think?

691
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:42,401
What do I think?
Bob is retired! I'm retired!

692
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,555
Our family is underground.

693
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:47,825
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

694
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:50,234
Well, l assumed you knew, darling.

695
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:53,124
Why would he keep secrets from you?

696
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,173
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

697
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,772
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

698
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:02,334
Prone to weakness.

699
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:05,676
- What are you saying?
- Do you know where he is?

700
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:09,496
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

701
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:43,741
- Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- Come on, let's go.

702
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,001
Are you okay? What happened?

703
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:55,302
Break surveillance and engage. Over.
Continuing sweep...

704
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:39,757
- Insuricare.
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

705
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,923
Bob Parr is my husband.
l was wondering if you could give me

706
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:47,033
the number of the hotel he's staying at?
The number I have is no good.

707
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:50,131
- Mr. Parr no longer works here.
- What do you mean?

708
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:52,827
He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

709
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,796
My records say he was terminated
almost two months ago.

710
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,663
So, you don't know where he is.

711
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,982
Would you like to find out?

712
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:54,478
lam such an idiot.

713
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,988
I let this happen, you know.

714
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:00,850
The new sports car, the getting
in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

715
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:04,191
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

716
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:08,018
Now I'm losing him! What'll 1 do?
What'll 1 do?

717
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,981
What are you talking about?

718
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:16,308
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

719
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:18,733
What will you do?
Is this a question?

720
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:21,312
Show him you remember
that he is Mr. Incredible,

721
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:24,278
and you will remind him who you are!

722
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:28,361
Well, you know where he is.
Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

723
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,709
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

724
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,523
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

725
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:39,452
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

726
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,656
I should be back tonight. Late.

727
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:43,791
You can be in charge that long,
can't you?

728
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,520
Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

729
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,093
Nothing.
Just a little trouble with Daddy.

730
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:53,328
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

731
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:57,359
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

732
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,317
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

733
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,670
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

734
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,352
We all get cool outfits?

735
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,944
Dash! You come back here this moment!

736
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:17,862
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

737
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,351
I know this is short notice,
but I was hoping that I could...

738
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,468
What are these?
Look, I'm The Dash!

739
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,323
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

740
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:31,101
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

741
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,264
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

742
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,604
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

743
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,900
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

744
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:44,229
What makes you think it's special?

745
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,127
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

746
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:58,999
Snug, I'm calling
in a solid you owe me.

747
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:02,566
- What do you need?
- Ajet. What do you got that's fast?

748
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,256
Let me think.

749
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,423
Island approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.

750
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:19,096
VFR on top. Over.

751
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:24,048
Island tower,
this is India Golf niner-niner

752
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,147
requesting vectors to the initial. Over.

753
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,747
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

754
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:44,176
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

755
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:49,345
At the same time. Yeah.

756
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:06,089
You sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible".

757
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,239
I was right to idolize you.

758
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,841
l always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

759
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:14,604
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

760
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,357
I'm still geeking out about it!

761
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,098
And then you had
to just go and ruin the ride.

762
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:26,969
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

763
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,760
Lame, lame, lame.

764
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:34,249
- All right, who did you contact?
- Contact? What are you talking about?

765
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,986
lam referring to last night
at 2307 hours

766
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:45,058
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

767
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,312
I didn't know about the homing device.

768
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:57,016
And now a government plane is
requesting permission to land here.

769
01:06:57,614 --> 01:07:00,274
- Who did you contact?
- didn't send for a plane.

770
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,417
Play the transmission.

771
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:06,893
- India golf niner-niner checking in.
- Helen!

772
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:10,232
So you do know these people.

773
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,213
Well, then, I'll send them
a little greeting.

774
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,189
- Violet!
- It's not my fault.

775
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,616
Dash ran away,
I knew I'd get blamed for it.

776
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,341
That's not true!

777
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:26,216
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what.

778
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:29,803
- ..and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!

779
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:32,863
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

780
01:07:33,283 --> 01:07:35,833
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

781
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,332
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

782
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:41,348
All right, well, who'd you get?

783
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,961
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

784
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:47,317
I've got babysitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

785
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:50,637
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

786
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,089
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

787
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,016
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

788
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:57,399
Kari...

789
01:07:57,607 --> 01:08:00,157
The beauty is they don't have to listen
‘cause they're asleep!

790
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,307
I wish my parents played Mozart

791
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:05,332
because half the time I don't know
what anyone's talking about.

792
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:08,852
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

793
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:12,042
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

794
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,187
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.

795
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,859
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

796
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,600
Can't I, little baby? I can handle it.

797
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:21,395
Who can handle it?

798
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:32,118
India Golf niner-niner transmitting
in the blind guard.

799
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:34,212
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

800
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,427
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

801
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,639
- Friendlies...
- No! Call off the missiles.

802
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,377
- I'll do anything.
- Too late. Fifteen years too late.

803
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:17,126
Friendlies two-zero miles
south-southwest of your position.

804
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,832
Angels ten. Track east. Disengage.

805
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:22,502
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

806
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,381
You said not to use our powers.

807
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,711
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!

808
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:29,053
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

809
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:36,343
- Mom?
- Violet!

810
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:39,518
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

811
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,205
There are children aboard.

812
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:43,524
- There are children aboard!
- No!

813
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:48,125
- Put a field around us now!
- I've never done one that big.

814
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,511
Do it now!

815
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,237
Abort, abort, abort!

816
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,131
Abort, abort, abort!

817
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,197
Brace yourselves!

818
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:38,321
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.

819
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,518
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

820
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:43,007
We're not gonna panic,
we're not... Look out!

821
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:54,683
- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

822
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,024
- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

823
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,350
We're dead! We're dead!

824
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:02,059
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

825
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,857
Stop it!

826
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,557
We are not gonna die!

827
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:08,473
Both of you will get a grip.

828
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,905
Or so help me
I will ground you for a month!

829
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,876
Understand?

830
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:17,103
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

831
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,420
You'll get over it.

832
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:23,022
l seem to recall
you prefer to "work alone".

833
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,429
Release me. Now!

834
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,512
- Or what?
- I'll crush her.

835
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,331
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

836
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:44,311
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.

837
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,314
Show me.

838
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,911
I knew you couldn't do it.

839
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,060
Even when you have nothing to lose.

840
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,980
You're weak.

841
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:08,155
And I've outgrown you.

842
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,917
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

843
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:23,995
That way is our best bet.

844
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,763
You want to go toward
the people that tried to kill us?

845
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:30,776
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

846
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,277
l expect you to trust me.

847
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,284
What a trooper.

848
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:39,483
I'm so proud of you.

849
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,655
Thanks, Mom.

850
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:50,253
I think your father is in trouble.

851
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:53,183
If you haven't noticed,
we're not doing so hot either.

852
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:54,766
I'm going to look for him.

853
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,427
And that means you're in charge
until l get back, Violet.

854
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,793
- What?
- You heard her.

855
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:05,605
Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.

856
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:06,978
Protect it.

857
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:09,756
And if anything goes wrong,
use your powers.

858
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:12,519
- But you said never to use...
- [know what I said!

859
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:20,098
Remember the bad guys on those shows
you used to watch on Saturday mornings?

860
01:14:20,723 --> 01:14:23,713
Well, these guys
are not like those guys.

861
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,293
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

862
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:30,607
They will kill you
if they get the chance.

863
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:33,027
Do not give them that chance.

864
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:35,268
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

865
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,824
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

866
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:43,318
Dash, if anything goes wrong,
I want you to run as fast as you can.

867
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:46,223
- As fast as l can?
- As fast as you can.

868
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:50,485
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

869
01:14:54,357 --> 01:14:55,787
Mom!

870
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:59,385
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

871
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,728
l wanted to help. When you
asked me to... I'm sorry.

872
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,839
It isn't your fault.

873
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:08,534
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly
ask so much of you.

874
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,151
But things are different now.

875
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,166
And doubt is a luxury
we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

876
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,799
You have more power than you realize.

877
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,399
Don't think. And don't worry.

878
01:15:19,782 --> 01:15:22,032
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

879
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:24,607
It's in your blood.

880
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,334
He's not weak, you know.

881
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:05,597
What?

882
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:07,815
Valuing life is not weakness.

883
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:11,443
Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

884
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,637
l had everything under control.

885
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,335
And disregarding it is not strength.

886
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,228
I called his bluff, sweetheart,
that's all.

887
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:21,751
I knew he wouldn't have it in him
to actually...

888
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,800
Next time you gamble,
bet your own life!

889
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,214
A rocket?

890
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:34,112
Hey!

891
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:36,027
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

892
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:40,105
What do you think is going on here?
You think we're on vacation?

893
01:19:40,643 --> 01:19:43,253
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

894
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,789
Or worse, their marriage.

895
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,898
Their marriage?

896
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:52,227
So, the bad guys are trying to wreck
Mom and Dad's marriage.

897
01:19:52,855 --> 01:19:54,844
Forget it. You're so immature.

898
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,879
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

899
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:00,877
I'm not gonna leave the cave.

900
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:42,306
Cool!

901
01:20:42,805 --> 01:20:44,355
Cool!

902
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:48,248
Roger. We are ready for launch.

903
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:01,894
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?

904
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:17,633
ETA two-niner. Over.

905
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:23,209
TCl clear. Condition yellow.
Status norm.

906
01:21:25,781 --> 01:21:27,331
Not responding to IFF.

907
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,636
IRCM reads negative.

908
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,610
- Bob.
- What?

909
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,058
I didn't say anything.

910
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:05,101
Identification, please.

911
01:22:05,821 --> 01:22:08,371
- Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look.
- What?

912
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:09,841
- It talks!
- What?

913
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,228
There. That one.

914
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,860
Voice key incorrect.

915
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:17,262
- "Voice key"?
- Voice key incorrect.

916
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,293
Wait a second.

917
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:22,916
- What do we do?
- Run!

918
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:25,075
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!

919
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:32,402
Intruder alert.

920
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:57,910
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

921
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,362
In fact, there's no time at all.

922
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,579
- Please...
- Why are you here?

923
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:07,301
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

924
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,323
Family survived the crash.

925
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:14,604
- They're here on the island!
- They're alive?

926
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:30,564
- Helen?
- Hello.

927
01:23:30,906 --> 01:23:32,926
You must be Mrs...

928
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:35,822
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.

929
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,518
That's what I was doing.

930
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,009
Let go of me!

931
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:42,027
Let go, you lousy, lying,
unfaithful creep!

932
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,922
How could I betray the perfect woman?

933
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:49,128
- Oh, you're referring to me now?
- Where are the kids?

934
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:51,261
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

935
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,490
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

936
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:56,983
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?

937
01:23:57,332 --> 01:24:00,052
They stowed away.
You're not striking the proper tone.

938
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:11,490
- Think they're supers?
- Dash, remember what Mom said.

939
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:13,324
- What?
- Stop talking!

940
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:16,242
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!

941
01:24:16,685 --> 01:24:18,555
- What?
- Run!

942
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:21,948
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!

943
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:24,668
Show yourself!

944
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,550
I'm alive. Yeah!

945
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:06,654
I should've told you I was fired,
I admit it.

946
01:27:06,655 --> 01:27:08,965
I should've told you I was fired,
I admit it.

947
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:10,787
But I didn't want you to worry.

948
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,349
You didn't want me to worry?

949
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:15,144
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.

950
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,374
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

951
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:23,346
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

952
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:37,898
You can't hide from me.

953
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,439
- There you are.
- Hey!

954
01:27:50,966 --> 01:27:53,156
Don't touch my sister!

955
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:02,541
- How are you doing that?
- [don't know!

956
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:04,367
Whatever you do, don't stop!

957
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,609
Mom! Dad! Hey!

958
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:25,813
Kids.

959
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,674
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

960
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,489
- We were so worried.
- [ thought I'd never see you again.

961
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,420
- [love you.
- [love you.

962
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:07,734
Time out!

963
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,518
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

964
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:17,878
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

965
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:22,014
You married Elastigirl?

966
01:29:23,158 --> 01:29:25,238
And got busy!

967
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:27,994
It's a whole family of supers.

968
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:30,295
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

969
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,779
This is just too good!

970
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:36,228
- The ship's unique design...
- There were no fatalities...

971
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:41,236
Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.

972
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:44,640
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,

973
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:47,663
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!

974
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:52,272
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!

975
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:55,171
I'll be a bigger hero
than you ever were!

976
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:59,097
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

977
01:29:59,661 --> 01:30:02,651
I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!

978
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:06,411
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

979
01:30:06,935 --> 01:30:08,225
I'll give them heroics.

980
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:11,160
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!

981
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:14,596
And when I'm old and I've had my fun,
I'll sell my inventions

982
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:19,086
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

983
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:22,234
And when everyone's super...

984
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:26,506
..No one will be.

985
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:04,269
It's overwhelming the tanks.

986
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:05,882
I'm sorry.

987
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:09,667
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

988
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:13,571
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

989
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:16,852
- that undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

990
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,175
Don't interrupt.

991
01:31:18,373 --> 01:31:20,833
So caught up in the past that I...

992
01:31:22,744 --> 01:31:26,143
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

993
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:29,311
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

994
01:31:29,751 --> 01:31:33,121
Well, l think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

995
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:36,085
but I think it's time we wind down now.

996
01:31:39,094 --> 01:31:40,844
We need to get back to the mainland.

997
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,382
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.

998
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:55,158
Where are all the guards?

999
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:56,733
Go, go!

1000
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:03,569
Hey, every time they run,
you take a shot.

1001
01:32:20,135 --> 01:32:22,475
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

1002
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:25,531
- Ajet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

1003
01:32:25,974 --> 01:32:27,674
How about a rocket?

1004
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:34,415
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

1005
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:37,413
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

1006
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:42,807
Wait. l bet Syndrome's changed
the password by now.

1007
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:45,754
- How do I get into the computer?
- Say please.

1008
01:33:01,843 --> 01:33:03,593
- Honey?
- What?

1009
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:05,642
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?

1010
01:33:05,947 --> 01:33:09,047
Where is my supersuit?

1011
01:33:09,551 --> 01:33:12,181
- [ put it away.
- Where?

1012
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,730
Why do you need to know?

1013
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,020
I need it!

1014
01:33:16,224 --> 01:33:18,914
Don't you think about running off
to doing no derrin'-do.

1015
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,610
We've been planning
this dinner for two months!

1016
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:24,456
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!

1017
01:33:24,866 --> 01:33:28,026
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.

1018
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:30,376
"Greater good"? 1 am your wife!

1019
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:33,425
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!

1020
01:33:37,178 --> 01:33:38,077
Run!

1021
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:41,611
My baby!

1022
01:33:46,054 --> 01:33:48,134
- The supers have returned!
- ls that Fironic?

1023
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:51,620
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1024
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:56,347
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!

1025
01:33:59,901 --> 01:34:01,191
All right, stand back.

1026
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,800
Someone needs to teach
this hunk of metal a few manners.

1027
01:34:40,108 --> 01:34:43,448
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

1028
01:34:45,947 --> 01:34:47,847
How you doing, honey?

1029
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:50,733
Do I have to answer?

1030
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:55,991
Kids, strap yourselves down
like I told you.

1031
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:02,065
Here we go, honey.

1032
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:05,900
Ready, Violet? Ready?

1033
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:07,451
Now!

1034
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:11,978
This is gonna be rough.

1035
01:35:19,647 --> 01:35:21,697
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

1036
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,070
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

1037
01:35:24,419 --> 01:35:26,559
- 1 take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!

1038
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:29,261
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

1039
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:31,297
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

1040
01:35:31,593 --> 01:35:33,173
Get in the right lane! Signal!

1041
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:35,361
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

1042
01:36:02,223 --> 01:36:04,563
Is everybody okay back there?

1043
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:08,179
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.

1044
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:14,076
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1045
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:17,550
While what?
l watch helplessly from the sidelines?

1046
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:20,369
- [don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1047
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,995
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

1048
01:36:23,378 --> 01:36:24,898
I'm with you for better or worse.

1049
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:27,049
l have to do this alone.

1050
01:36:27,382 --> 01:36:29,192
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1051
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:31,097
- So you can be Mr. Incredible?
- No!

1052
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:32,756
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1053
01:36:33,021 --> 01:36:34,571
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

1054
01:36:34,856 --> 01:36:36,496
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

1055
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,631
That's what this is?
A workout?

1056
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,210
I can't lose you again!

1057
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:45,072
I can't. Not again.

1058
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,580
I'm not... strong enough.

1059
01:36:56,244 --> 01:36:58,824
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1060
01:36:59,247 --> 01:37:00,857
I don't know what'll happen.

1061
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,609
We're superheroes.
What can happen?

1062
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:09,766
Vi! Dash! No!

1063
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:20,894
Violet?

1064
01:37:24,405 --> 01:37:26,625
- Dad!
- Go, go!

1065
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:39,637
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

1066
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:51,972
Frozone!

1067
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,190
Yeah!

1068
01:37:56,437 --> 01:37:57,457
Bob!

1069
01:37:58,706 --> 01:37:59,576
Hey!

1070
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:17,073
Syndrome's remote!

1071
01:38:26,968 --> 01:38:29,018
The remote controls the robot!

1072
01:38:31,973 --> 01:38:34,143
- Throw it, throw it!
- Go long!

1073
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:46,610
Got it!

1074
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,469
Honey, take out its guns!

1075
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:02,482
Gotcha!

1076
01:39:47,882 --> 01:39:49,632
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!

1077
01:39:51,586 --> 01:39:53,666
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1078
01:39:57,358 --> 01:39:58,228
The robot?

1079
01:40:06,534 --> 01:40:07,404
It's coming back!

1080
01:40:11,072 --> 01:40:12,942
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

1081
01:40:14,075 --> 01:40:17,005
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is...

1082
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:22,058
. itself.

1083
01:40:22,283 --> 01:40:23,593
It's getting closer!

1084
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,250
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!

1085
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:28,758
It's not doing anything.

1086
01:40:28,990 --> 01:40:31,179
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1087
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:37,554
Honey!

1088
01:40:43,804 --> 01:40:45,914
Wait a minute.
Press that button again!

1089
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:51,288
- No, the other one! The first one!
- First button! Got it!

1090
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,929
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1091
01:40:54,282 --> 01:40:56,682
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1092
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:58,604
- Press the button!
- Not yet!

1093
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:01,076
- Hang on!
- What are you waiting for?

1094
01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:03,415
Acloser target! You got one shot!

1095
01:41:07,295 --> 01:41:08,555
Everybody duck!

1096
01:41:31,686 --> 01:41:32,675
Hey, Zone.

1097
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:41,097
No!

1098
01:41:41,329 --> 01:41:44,898
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1099
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:49,126
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1100
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:55,410
- Just like old times.
- Just like old times.

1101
01:41:55,876 --> 01:41:57,896
Yeah. Hurt then too.

1102
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,285
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

1103
01:42:03,651 --> 01:42:06,811
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1104
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:09,341
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1105
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:11,360
Can we come out of hiding?

1106
01:42:11,659 --> 01:42:13,469
Let the politicians figure that out.

1107
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:16,894
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.

1108
01:42:17,398 --> 01:42:18,358
You did good, Bob.

1109
01:42:18,566 --> 01:42:20,316
Hi, this is Kari.

1110
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:23,185
! have a question about Jack-Jack...

1111
01:42:23,604 --> 01:42:25,184
Come on. We're in a limo.

1112
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:27,993
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1113
01:42:28,409 --> 01:42:30,929
- Yeah, I just... yeah.
- It looks good.

1114
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:33,685
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1115
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:36,301
Not as cool as you running on water.

1116
01:42:36,684 --> 01:42:39,784
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

1117
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:42,807
and whiplashed him into the other guy.
Sweet!

1118
01:42:43,224 --> 01:42:45,714
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- Mrs. Parr, it's me.

1119
01:42:46,127 --> 01:42:49,257
Jack-Jack is fine,
but weird things are happening.

1120
01:42:49,764 --> 01:42:52,894
Jack-Jack's still fine,
but I'm getting really weirded out!

1121
01:42:53,401 --> 01:42:54,800
When are you coming back?

1122
01:42:55,069 --> 01:42:57,179
..aced those guys
that tried to kill us!

1123
01:42:57,538 --> 01:43:01,107
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1124
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:04,196
I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!

1125
01:43:04,612 --> 01:43:07,042
Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.

1126
01:43:07,448 --> 01:43:09,408
! need help, Mrs...

1127
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,210
Bob, listen to this.

1128
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:13,264
I'm gonna calf the police...

1129
01:43:13,587 --> 01:43:14,897
Hi, this is Kari.

1130
01:43:15,156 --> 01:43:18,846
Sorry for freaking out,
but your baby has special needs.

1131
01:43:19,427 --> 01:43:21,206
Thanks for sending a replacement.

1132
01:43:21,529 --> 01:43:23,929
I didn't call a replacement.

1133
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:31,760
The baby is sleeping.

1134
01:43:34,442 --> 01:43:36,432
You took away my future.

1135
01:43:36,777 --> 01:43:39,797
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1136
01:43:40,281 --> 01:43:43,181
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1137
01:43:43,651 --> 01:43:47,111
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.

1138
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:54,625
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something.

1139
01:44:10,611 --> 01:44:11,901
What's happening?

1140
01:44:17,985 --> 01:44:20,764
- Stop him! Throw something!
- [might hit Jack-Jack.

1141
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:26,649
Throw me.

1142
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:32,221
Bob, throw me!

1143
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:39,566
No!

1144
01:44:42,309 --> 01:44:45,439
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

1145
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:47,116
I'll get your son!

1146
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:50,066
Oh, no.

1147
01:45:01,529 --> 01:45:04,929
Look at Mommy, honey.
Don't look down. Mommy's got you.

1148
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:07,716
Everything is all right.

1149
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:24,380
That's my girl.

1150
01:45:25,219 --> 01:45:27,649
Does this mean we have to move again?

1151
01:45:31,058 --> 01:45:32,348
Oh, man.

1152
01:45:32,593 --> 01:45:35,053
That was totally wicked!

1153
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:54,929
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1154
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:58,039
- What is that all about?
- lalways thought it was more...

1155
01:45:58,485 --> 01:45:59,825
- Hey.
- Hey.

1156
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:02,367
- You're Violet, right?
- That's me.

1157
01:46:02,756 --> 01:46:04,426
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

1158
01:46:04,725 --> 01:46:07,655
l feel different. Is different okay?

1159
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:10,968
Different is great.

1160
