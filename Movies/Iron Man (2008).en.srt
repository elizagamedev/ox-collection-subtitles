1
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,890
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

2
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,840
This is crazy. What did I do?

3
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,390
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

4
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,670
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

5
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,050
We can talk, sir.

6
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,470
-Oh, I see. So it's personal?
-No, you intimidate them.

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,670
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... 1 couldn't have called that.

8
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,190
I mean, I'd apologise,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

9
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,910
-Il thought of you as a soldier first.
-I'm an airman.

10
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,789
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,429
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,160
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

13
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,979
-Sir, l have a question to ask.
-Yes, please.

14
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,480
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year’s Maxim cover models?

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,790
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,350
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,059
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,900
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,579
-ls it cool if l take a picture with you?
-Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,600
All right.

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,630
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,290
Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,890
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,650
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,530
Come on. Hurry up.
Just click it. Don't change any settings.

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,110
-What's going on?
-Contact left!

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,840
What have we got?

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,990
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,190
-Stay down!
-Yeah.

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,700
Son of a bitch!

31
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,829
-Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
-Stay here!

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,359
Whoa!

33
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,880
Tony Stark.

34
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,510
Visionary. Genius.

35
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,210
American patriot.

36
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,460
Even from an early age,

37
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,750
the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

38
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,140
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

39
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,519
At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,820
At age six, his first engine.

41
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,940
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,349
Then, the passing of a titan.

43
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,620
Howard Stark’s lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,920
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

45
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,330
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns

46
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,640
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark industries.

47
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,240
With the keys to the kingdom,

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,830
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

49
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,650
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

50
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,460
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,350
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,900
and her interests around the globe.

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,159
As liaison to Stark Industries,

54
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,160
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

55
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,849
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

56
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,620
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honour

57
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,580
to present this year’s Apogee Award
to Mr Tony Stark.

58
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,120
Tony?

59
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,250
-Thank you, Colonel.
-Thanks for the save.

60
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,729
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

61
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,470
This is wonderful.

62
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,120
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

63
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,480
But if l were Tony,
! would tell you how honoured I feel

64
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,370
and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.

65
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,550
Tony, you know...

66
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,100
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

67
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,800
He’s always working.

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,840
Work it! Come on!

69
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,660
-We should just stay till the morning.
-You are unbelievable.

70
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,930
-Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
-Nobody roped me into anything!

71
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,270
-I'm so sorry.
-But they told me that

72
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,830
if presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honoured.

73
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,850
Of course I'd be deeply honoured.
And it's you, that's great.

74
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
-So when do we do it?
-It's right here.

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,700
-Here you go.
-There it is. That was easy.

76
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,160
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah, it's okay.

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,359
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

78
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,050
I don't have any of those
floating around.

79
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,070
We're gonna let it ride!

80
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,150
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

81
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,420
Okay, you, too.

82
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,219
-I don't blow on a man's dice.
-Come on, honey bear.

83
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,659
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

84
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,090
Two craps. Line away.

85
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,830
-That's what happens.
-Worse things have happened.

86
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,310
I think we're gonna be fine.
Colour me up, William.

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,870
-This is where I exit.
-All right.

88
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,950
Tomorrow, don't be late.

89
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,140
-Yeah, you can count on it.
-I'm serious!

90
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,440
I know, I know.

91
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,660
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

92
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,200
Mr Stark! Excuse me, Mr Stark!

93
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,690
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

94
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,950
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

95
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,420
-She's cute.
-She's all right?

96
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,590
-Hi.
-Hi.

97
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,410
-Yeah. Okay, go.
-It's okay?

98
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,230
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

99
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,940
-What do you say to that?
-Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

100
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,690
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

101
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,940
“The Merchant of Death"?

102
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,420
That's not bad.

103
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,969
-Let me guess. Berkeley?
-Brown, actually.

104
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Well, Ms Brown,

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,090
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

106
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,679
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

107
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,940
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

108
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,150
Rehearse that much?

109
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,760
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

110
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
-I can see that.
-I'd like to show you first-hand.

111
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,289
All l want is a serious answer.

112
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,500
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

113
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,869
“Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy.”

114
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,170
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

115
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,870
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

116
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,450
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

117
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,820
would call that being a hero.

118
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,860
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

119
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,020
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

120
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,830
by advancing medical technology

121
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,080
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

122
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,180
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,700
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,610
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

125
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,960
Good morning. It’s 7:00 a.m.

126
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,330
The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

127
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,730
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,270
High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

129
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,960
Tony?

130
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,640
Hey, Tony?

131
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,569
You are not authorised
to access this area.

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,250
-Jesus.
-That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

133
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,290
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

134
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,150
and there's a car waiting for you outside

135
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,330
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

136
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,870
-You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
-Indeed I am.

137
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,099
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

138
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,480
I do anything and everything
that Mr Stark requires,

139
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,310
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

140
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,630
Will that be all?

141
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,330
Give me an exploded view.

142
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,340
The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.

143
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,160
Log that.

144
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,660
-I'm gonna try again, right now.
-Please don't turn down my music.

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,870
I'll keep you posted.

146
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,550
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

147
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,800
-How'd she take it?
-Like a champ.

148
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,470
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

149
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,160
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

150
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,230
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

151
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,859
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

152
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,590
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

153
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,790
before I get you out of the door.

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,930
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

155
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,260
if it departs before you arrive?

156
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,290
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

157
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,130
Do you want it? Yes or no.

158
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,150
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

159
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,260
No. The Springs was actually
the neighbourhood in East Hampton

160
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,689
where he lived and worked,

161
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,219
-not "spring" like the season.
-So?

162
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,130
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

163
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,650
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

164
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,849
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

165
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,630
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

166
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,930
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

167
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,650
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

168
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,079
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

169
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,000
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

170
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,350
-As a matter of fact, I do.
-I don't like it when you have plans.

171
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,470
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

172
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,060
-It's your birthday?
-Yes.

173
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,550
I knew that. Already?

174
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,780
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

175
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,250
-Get yourself something nice from me.
-l already did.

176
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,710
-And?
-It was very nice.

177
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,960
-Yeah.
-Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr Stark.

178
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,790
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

179
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,950
Okay.

180
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,700
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

181
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,050
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

182
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,920
I got you. I got you.

183
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,390
What's wrong with you?

184
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,900
-What?
-Three hours.

185
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,980
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

186
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,970
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

187
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,420
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

188
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

189
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,130
-What you reading, platypus?
-Nothing.

190
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,380
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

191
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,040
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

192
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,630
-Il said I was sorry.
-Good morning, Mr Stark.

193
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,860
You don't need to apologise to me.
I'm your man.

194
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,990
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

195
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
-I'm just indifferent right now.
-Hot towel?

196
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,569
You don't respect yourself,

197
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,920
-so I know you don't respect me.
-l respect you.

198
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,319
I'm just your babysitter.

199
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,660
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

200
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,860
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

201
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,600
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

202
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,040
-Thanks for reminding me.
-No, I'm not talking...

203
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,750
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

204
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,069
-You can't have sashimi without sake.
-You are constitutionally

205
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,670
incapable of being responsible.

206
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,170
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

207
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,469
Hot sake?

208
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,449
-Yes, two, please.
-No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

209
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,079
That's what I'm talking about.

210
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

211
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,790
you know what I recognise?

212
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,220
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

213
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,439
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

214
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,440
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

215
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,460
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

216
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,319
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

217
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,550
General.

218
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,740
Welcome, Mr Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

219
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,110
Thanks.

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,460
Is it better to be feared or respected?

221
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,520
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

222
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,250
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

223
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,189
of Stark Industries’ Freedom Line.

224
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,350
It's the first missile system

225
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,949
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

226
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,690
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

227
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,920
I respectfully disagree.

228
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,610
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

229
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,030
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

230
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,949
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

231
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,400
Find an excuse

232
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,449
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

233
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,870
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

234
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,199
For your consideration, the Jericho.

235
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,630
I'll be throwing one of these in

236
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,520
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

237
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,710
To peace!

238
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,200
-Tony.
-Obie, what are you doing up?

239
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,620
! couldn't sleep till 1 found out
how it went. How'd it go?

240
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,540
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

241
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,100
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

242
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,870
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas
I got you?

243
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,450
Good night, Tony.

244
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,030
-Hey, Tony.
-I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee.”

245
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,050
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

246
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,640
-Nice job.
-See you back at base.

247
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,020
I wouldn't do that if were you.

248
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,870
What the hell did you do to me?

249
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,180
What I did?

250
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,069
What I did is to save your life.

251
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,609
l removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

252
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,629
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

253
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,030
Here, want to see?

254
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,270
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

255
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,020
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

256
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,389
We call them the walking dead

257
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,460
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

258
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,270
-What is this?
-That is an electromagnet,

259
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,110
hooked up to a car battery,

260
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,900
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

261
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,910
That's right. Smile.

262
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,280
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

263
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,420
-I don't remember.
-No, you wouldn't.

264
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,639
If l had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

265
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,780
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

266
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,320
Where are we?

267
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,939
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

268
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,800
Just do as I do.

269
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,470
Come on, put your hands up.

270
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,590
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

271
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,870
Do you understand me? Do as ! do.

272
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,340
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

273
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,430
“in the history of America.”

274
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,220
He is honoured.

275
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,310
He wants you to build the missile.

276
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,800
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

277
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,500
This one.

278
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,389
I refuse.

279
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,629
Tony!

280
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,680
He wants to know what you think.

281
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,390
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

282
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,680
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

283
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,550
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

284
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,130
He says for you
to start working immediately,

285
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,260
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

286
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,130
-No, he won't.
-No, he won't.

287
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,650
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

288
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,639
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

289
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,679
Look, what you just saw,

290
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,670
that is your legacy, Stark.

291
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,320
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

292
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,730
Is that how you want to go out?

293
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,700
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

294
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,290
Or are you going to
do something about it?

295
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,879
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

296
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,300
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

297
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,879
Well, then,

298
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,240
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

299
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,230
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. want these up.

300
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,450
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

301
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,770
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

302
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,649
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

303
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,830
-How many languages do you speak?
-A lot.

304
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,520
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

305
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,640
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

306
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,800
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

307
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,939
-Who are these people?
-They are your loyal customers, sir.

308
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,800
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

309
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,310
You know, we might be more productive

310
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,909
if you include me
in the planning process.

311
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,330
Okay, we don't need this.

312
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,670
What is that?

313
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,240
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

314
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,040
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

315
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,610
What's he doing?

316
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,480
Working.

317
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,810
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

318
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,490
Relax. I have steady hands.

319
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,860
Why do you think you're still alive?

320
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,040
-What do I call you?
-My name is Yinsen.

321
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

322
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,620
Nice to meet you, too.

323
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,170
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

324
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,460
That's because
it's a miniaturised arc reactor.

325
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,510
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

326
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,469
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

327
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
But what could it generate?

328
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,389
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

329
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,459
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

330
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,439
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

331
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,240
-This is our ticket out of here.
-What is it?

332
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,379
Flatten them out and look.

333
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,909
Oh, wow.

334
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,290
Impressive.

335
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,090
Good.

336
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,650
Good roll. Good roll.

337
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,300
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

338
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,949
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

339
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,330
-It's actually a nice place.
-Got a family?

340
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,690
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

341
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,290
And you, Stark?

342
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,300
-No.
-No?

343
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,420
So you're a man who has everything

344
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,560
and nothing.

345
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,080
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

346
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,780
Maybe it's been modified.

347
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,980
The tail is wrong.

348
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,070
It's just backwards.

349
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,090
Relax.

350
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,820
The bow and arrow

351
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,580
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

352
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,389
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

353
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,970
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

354
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,000
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

355
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,540
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

356
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,560
But today,

357
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,400
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

358
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,379
rules these lands.

359
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,959
And soon,

360
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,440
it will be my turn.

361
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,540
Why have you failed me?

362
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,960
We're working.

363
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,610
Diligently.

364
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,470
I let you live.

365
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,500
This is how you repay me?

366
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,320
It's very complex.

367
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,930
He's trying very hard.

368
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,389
On his knees.

369
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,409
You think I'm a fool?

370
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,439
I'll get the truth.

371
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,399
We're both working.

372
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,700
Open your mouth.

373
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,030
What does he want?

374
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,149
You think I'm a fool?

375
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,379
What's going on?

376
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,139
Tell me the truth.

377
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,899
He's building your Jericho.

378
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,030
What do you want? A delivery date?

379
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,439
I need him.

380
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,940
Good assistant.

381
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,129
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

382
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,710
Okay? Can you move?

383
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,020
Okay, say it again.

384
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,419
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

385
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,710
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

386
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,560
Where is Stark?

387
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,710
He was here a moment ago.

388
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,900
Go look for him.

389
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,260
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

390
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,440
Say something.
Say something back to him.

391
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
-He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
-Then speak Hungarian.

392
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,149
-Okay. I know.
-What do you know?

393
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,590
-How'd that work?
-Oh, my goodness.

394
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,600
-It worked all right.
-That's what I do.

395
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,050
-Let me finish this.
-Initialise the power sequence.

396
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,590
Okay.

397
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,730
-Now!
-Tell me. Tell me.

398
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,980
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

399
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,850
-It should be up right now.
-Yes.

400
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,020
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

401
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,540
-I have it.
-Press Control "I".

402
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,830
-"L." Got it.
"I." "Enter." "I" and "Enter."

403
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,670
Come over here and button me up.

404
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,770
Okay. All right.

405
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,120
Every other hex bolt.

406
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,149
-They're coming!
-Nothing pretty, just get it done.

407
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,640
-Just get it done.
-They're coming.

408
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,050
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

409
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,870
We need more time.

410
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,070
Hey,

411
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,730
-I'm gonna go buy you some time.
-Stick to the plan!

412
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,960
Stick to the plan!

413
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,010
Yinsen!

414
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,830
-Yinsen!
-Watch out!

415
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,580
Stark.

416
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,750
Come on. We got to go.

417
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,140
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

418
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,170
This was always the plan, Stark.

419
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,630
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

420
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,970
My family is dead.

421
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,850
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

422
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,710
It's okay.

423
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,370
I want this. I want this.

424
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,130
Thank you for saving me.

425
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,130
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

426
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,910
My turn.

427
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,190
Not bad.

428
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,080
Hey!

429
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,530
How was the "fun-vee"?

430
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

431
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,550
Watch it, coming up here.

432
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,270
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

433
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,400
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

434
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,740
-Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
-Yeah, vacation's over.

435
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,900
Where to, sir?

436
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,490
-Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
-No.

437
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,670
No? Tony, you have to

438
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,790
-go to the hospital.
-No is a complete answer.

439
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,580
-The doctor has to look at you.
-I don't have to do anything.

440
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,110
I've been in captivity for three months.

441
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,520
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

442
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,910
-and the other...
-That's enough of that.

443
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,220
...iS not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

444
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,509
-Call for a press conference?
-Yeah.

445
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,859
-What on earth for?
-Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

446
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,589
Look at this!

447
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,580
Tony.

448
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,390
-We were going to meet at the hospital.
-No, I'm fine.

449
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,960
Look at you!

450
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
-You had to have a burger, yeah?
-Well, come on.

451
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,310
-You get me one of those?
-There's only one left. I need it.

452
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,830
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

453
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,540
-Miss Potts?
-Yes.

454
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,850
Can I speak to you for a moment?

455
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,130
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

456
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,759
I'm not a reporter.

457
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,190
I'm agent Phil Coulson,

458
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,910
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

459
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,569
and Logistics Division.

460
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,120
-That's quite a mouthful.
-I know. We're working on it.

461
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,280
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

462
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,930
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

463
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,560
We need to debrief Mr Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

464
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,819
-I'll put something in the book, shall I?
-Thank you.

465
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,980
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

466
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,240
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

467
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,590
A little less formal and...

468
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,760
-What's up with the love-in?
-Don't look at me.

469
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,879
I don't know what he's up to.

470
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,230
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

471
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,630
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

472
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,480
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

473
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,520
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

474
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,320
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

475
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,540
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

476
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,380
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

477
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,830
I saw young Americans killed

478
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,330
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

479
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,319
And I saw

480
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,710
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

481
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,970
-Mr Stark!
-Hey, Ben.

482
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,600
What happened over there?

483
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,770
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realise that I have more

484
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,970
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

485
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,509
And that is why, effective immediately,
1 am shutting down

486
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,050
the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International

487
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,970
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

488
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,820
! think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

489
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,620
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

490
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,330
and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

491
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,040
What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

492
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,000
And he’s healthier than ever.

493
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,270
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

494
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

495
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,009
-Where is he?
-He's inside.

496
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,150
Well, that... That went well.

497
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,590
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

498
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,890
Your head? What about my head?

499
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,799
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

500
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,840
-Optimistically, 40 points.
-At minimum.

501
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,430
Yep.

502
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,610
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

503
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,290
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

504
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,890
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

505
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,260
It's my name on the side of the building.

506
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,650
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

507
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,690
Not based on what I saw.

508
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,990
We're not doing a good enough job.

509
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,210
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

510
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,860
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

511
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,899
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

512
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,010
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

513
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,470
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

514
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,550
-It works.
-Yeah, as a science project.

515
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,130
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

516
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,270
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

517
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,700
Maybe.

518
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,410
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

519
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,940
-Thirty years.
-That's what they say.

520
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,650
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

521
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,700
-Never mind who told me. Show me.
-It's Rhodey or Pepper.

522
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,089
-I want to see it.
-Okay, Rhodey.

523
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,700
-Okay.
-Okay?

524
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,080
It works.

525
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,630
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

526
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,939
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

527
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,590
like your father and I.

528
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,350
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

529
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,970
-But if I had...
-Tony.

530
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,799
Tony, no more of this
“ready, fire, aim" business.

531
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,520
-You understand me?
-That was Dad's line.

532
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,220
You gotta let me handle this.

533
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,590
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

534
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,500
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

535
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,540
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

536
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,670
Stark industries!

537
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,350
I’ve got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

538
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,740
Sell, sell, sell!

539
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,720
Abandon ship!

540
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,880
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

541
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,740
Let me show you the new
Stark industries business plan!

542
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,210
Look, that’s a weapons company
that doesn’t make weapons!

543
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,549
Pepper. How big are your hands?

544
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,250
-What?
-How big are your hands?

545
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,020
-I don't understand why...
-Get down here. I need you.

546
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,350
Hey.

547
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,540
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

548
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,790
Let's see them.

549
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,959
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

550
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,220
I just need your help for a sec.

551
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,140
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

552
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,620
It was. It is now an antique.

553
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,069
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

554
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,380
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

555
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,470
-Speed bump, what does that mean?
-It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

556
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,720
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

557
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,830
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

558
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,650
It's fine.

559
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,370
-What do you want me to do?
-Put that on the table over there.

560
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,149
-That is irrelevant.
-Oh, my God!

561
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,060
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

562
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,070
-ls it safe?
-Yeah, it should be fine.

563
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,770
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

564
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,200
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

565
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,510
-What do you mean, "Operation"?
-It's just a game, never mind.

566
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,290
-Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
-Okay.

567
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,620
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

568
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,410
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

569
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,910
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

570
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,210
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
‘Cause I'm...

571
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,770
-Okay, okay.
-I really need your help here.

572
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,100
Okay.

573
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,730
Oh, there's pus!

574
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,900
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

575
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,130
-not from my body.
-It smells!

576
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,740
Yeah, it does.

577
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,520
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

578
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,860
-Okay, I got it! I got it!
-Okay, you got it?

579
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,540
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

580
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

581
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,120
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

582
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,180
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

583
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,980
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

584
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,380
-Oh, God!
-Okay, I was not expecting...

585
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,420
-Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
-Okay, what do I do?

586
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,630
What's wrong?

587
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,820
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

588
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,090
‘cause you yanked it out like a trout...

589
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,810
-What? You said it was safe!
-We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

590
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,919
-You gotta switch it out really quick.
-Okay. Okay.

591
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,980
-Tony? It's going to be okay.
-What?

592
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,150
-ls it?
-It's gonna be okay.

593
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,610
-I'm gonna make this okay.
-Let's hope.

594
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,800
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

595
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,180
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

596
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,589
Nice.

597
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,690
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I feel great.

598
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,090
You okay?

599
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,060
Don't ever, ever, ever,

600
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,010
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

601
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,230
I don't have anyone but you.

602
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,750
Anyway...

603
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,940
-What do you want me to do with this?
-That?

604
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,200
Destroy it.

605
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,140
Incinerate it.

606
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,330
You don't want to keep it?

607
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,110
Pepper, I've been called many things.
“Nostalgic” is not one of them.

608
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,240
-Will that be all, Mr Stark?
-That will be all, Miss Potts.

609
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,790
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

610
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,690
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

611
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,700
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

612
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,620
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

613
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,460
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

614
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,060
I'll tell you, in my experience,

615
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,400
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

616
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,360
his insight,

617
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,130
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

618
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,610
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgement.

619
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,650
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

620
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,759
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr Tony Stark.

621
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,690
-Hello, sir.
-Speaking of manned or unmanned,

622
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,580
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

623
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,050
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

624
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,520
-That lovely lady you woke up with.
-Don't do that!

625
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,920
-What was his name?
-Don't do that.

626
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,069
-Was it lvan?
-Don't do that.

627
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,330
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

628
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,540
-Okay.
-Don't do that.

629
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,250
-Pleasure meeting you.
-Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

630
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,800
-I'm surprised.
-Why?

631
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,360
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

632
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,340
I'm doing a little better than walking.

633
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,870
-Really?
-Yeah.

634
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,930
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

635
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,890
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

636
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,470
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

637
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,410
‘cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

638
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,170
that was a doozy.

639
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,509
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

640
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,370
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

641
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,950
-I need you to listen to me.
-No.

642
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,460
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

643
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,049
-I'm serious.
-Okay.

644
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,900
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

645
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,220
Thanks.

646
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,120
-Jarvis, you up?
-For you, sir, always.

647
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,060
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark Two.

648
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,759
Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?

649
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,510
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

650
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,270
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

651
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,960
Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

652
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,670
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

653
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,180
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

654
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,240
Next. Up.

655
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,620
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

656
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,790
Stay put. Nice.

657
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,990
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

658
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,700
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

659
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,570
Up.

660
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,060
Screw it. Don't even move.

661
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,920
You are a tragedy.

662
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,930
Okay, let's do this right.

663
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,270
Start mark, half a metre,
and back and centre.

664
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,100
Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

665
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,630
You, roll it.

666
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,020
Okay. Activate hand controls.

667
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,580
We’re gonna start off nice and easy.

668
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,470
We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

669
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,040
And three,

670
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,870
two,

671
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,740
one.

672
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,360
Up two. All right, set that.

673
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,750
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

674
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,660
Yeah, everything's... What?

675
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,940
-Obadiah's upstairs.
-Great!

676
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,839
-What would you like me to tell him?
-Great. I'll be right up.

677
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,570
Okay.

678
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,980
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

679
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,150
It is.

680
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,700
This is a flight stabiliser.
It's completely harmless.

681
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,050
I didn't expect that.

682
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,470
How'd it go?

683
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,200
It went that bad, huh?

684
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,730
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

685
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,380
-doesn't mean it went bad.
-Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

686
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,340
It would have gone better
if you were there.

687
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,220
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

688
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,310
-I lay low, and you take care of all...
-Hey, come on. In public. The press.

689
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,350
-This was a board of directors meeting.
-This was a board of directors meeting?

690
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,950
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

691
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,260
They're filing an injunction.

692
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,200
-A what?
-They want to lock you out.

693
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,530
Why, ‘cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

694
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,630
We knew that was gonna happen.

695
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,560
-Fifty-six and a half.
-It doesn't matter.

696
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,740
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

697
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,400
Tony, the board has rights, too.

698
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,820
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

699
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,250
-isn't in the company's best interest.
-I'm being responsible!

700
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,130
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

701
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,620
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

702
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,029
This is great.

703
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,149
-Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
-I'll be in the shop.

704
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,500
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

705
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,650
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

706
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,450
Something to pitch them.

707
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,669
Let me have the engineers analyse that.
You know, draw up some specs.

708
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,950
-No. No, absolutely not.
-It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

709
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,610
-in New York!
-This one stays with me.

710
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,270
-That's it, Obie. Forget it.
-All right, well, this stays with me, then.

711
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,220
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

712
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,780
-Take two.
-Thank you.

713
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,620
You mind if 1 come down there
and see what you're doing?

714
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,290
Good night, Obie.

715
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,150
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

716
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,050
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

717
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,830
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

718
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,779
All right, nice and easy.

719
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,220
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

720
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,029
And three, two, one.

721
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,470
Okay.

722
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,210
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

723
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,510
‘cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

724
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,320
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

725
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,490
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

726
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,170
Three, two, one.

727
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,450
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

728
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,960
Not the car, not the car!

729
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,270
Table!

730
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,480
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

731
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,580
No!

732
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,160
Yeah, I can fly.

733
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,410
-Jarvis, are you there?
-At your service, sir.

734
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,730
-Engage Heads Up Display.
-Check.

735
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,799
Import all preferences
from home interface.

736
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,350
Will do, sir.

737
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,029
All right, what do you say?

738
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,149
1 have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We’re online and ready.

739
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,049
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

740
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,850
Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

741
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,360
Do a check on control surfaces.

742
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,900
As you wish.

743
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,210
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

744
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,060
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

745
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,740
Start listening in on ground control.

746
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,910
Sir, there are still terabytes

747
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,290
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

748
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,980
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

749
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,140
Ready? In three, two, one.

750
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,510
Handles like a dream.

751
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,009
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

752
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,470
What's SR-71's record?

753
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,910
The altitude record for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.

754
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,010
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

755
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,410
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

756
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,830
Keep going!

757
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,279
Higher!

758
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,140
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

759
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,240
Come on, we got to break the ice!

760
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,400
Kill power.

761
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,160
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

762
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,359
Hull pressurisation is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

763
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,850
A very astute observation, sir.

764
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,669
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

765
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,190
we should improve the exosystems.

766
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,610
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

767
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,600
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

768
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,300
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

769
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,890
-Got it?
-Yes.

770
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,080
Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

771
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,560
Thrill me.

772
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,900
Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,

773
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,100
where Tony Stark’s third annual benefit
for the Firefighter’s Family Fund

774
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,009
has become the place to be
for L.A.’s high society.

775
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,330
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

776
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,660
} have no record of an invitation, sir.

777
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,270
..-hasn't been seen in public

778
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,640
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

779
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,530
Some claim he’s suffering
from posttraumatic stress

780
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,970
and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

781
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,160
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

782
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,380
The render is complete.

783
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,120
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

784
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,000
What was ! thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

785
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,130
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

786
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,940
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

787
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,930
The render is complete.

788
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,210
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

789
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,850
Commencing automated assembly.

790
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,790
Estimated completion time is five hours.

791
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,149
Don't wait up for me, honey.

792
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,680
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

793
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,359
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

794
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,460
-Hey, Tony, remember me?
-Sure don't.

795
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,460
You look great, Hef.

796
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,520
We're going to have a great quarter.

797
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,920
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

798
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,990
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

799
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,029
I'll see you inside.

800
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,530
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

801
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,470
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

802
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,780
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

803
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,500
-Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
-Mr Stark?

804
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,069
-Yeah?
-Agent Coulson.

805
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,620
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

806
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,770
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

807
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,609
God, you need a new name for that.

808
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,530
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

809
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,750
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

810
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,930
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

811
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,819
and time can be a factor
with these things.

812
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,839
Let's just put something on the books.

813
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,970
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

814
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,459
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

815
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,620
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

816
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,230
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognise you.

817
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,490
-What are you doing here?
-Just avoiding government agents.

818
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,350
-Are you by yourself?
-Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

819
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,180
-Oh, it was a birthday present.
-That's great.

820
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,270
-From you, actually.
-Well, I got great taste.

821
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,650
Yes.

822
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,460
-You want to dance?
-Oh, no.

823
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,900
-All right, come on.
-Thank you. No.

824
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,049
Am I making you uncomfortable?

825
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:42,140
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

826
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,070
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

827
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,930
-You look great and you smell great.
-Oh, God.

828
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,900
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

829
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,250
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

830
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,990
-I'd make it a week. Sure.
-Really?

831
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,339
What's your Social Security number?

832
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,430
-Five.
-Five?

833
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,560
-Right.
-Right.

834
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,760
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

835
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,790
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

836
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,839
-How about a little air?
-Yes, I need some air.

837
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,650
-That was totally weird.
-Totally harmless.

838
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,350
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

839
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,960
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

840
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,710
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

841
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,630
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

842
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,960
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

843
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,790
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

844
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,899
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

845
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,400
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

846
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,480
-and I'm dancing with you.
-I don't think it was taken that way.

847
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,150
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

848
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,240
-I just think you're overstating it.
-You know, and we're here,

849
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,650
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

850
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,480
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

851
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,620
-l would like a drink, please.
-Got it, okay.

852
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,769
-I would like a vodka martini, please.
-Okay.

853
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,130
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

854
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,080
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

855
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,340
Make one of them dirty, will you?

856
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,250
Wow. Tony Stark.

857
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,840
-Oh, hey.
-Fancy seeing you here.

858
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,830
-Carrie.
-Christine.

859
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,910
That's right.

860
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,330
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

861
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,880
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

862
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,189
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

863
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,720
‘Cause I was referring
to your company's

864
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,080
involvement in this latest atrocity.

865
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:01,670
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

866
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,870
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

867
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,200
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

868
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,490
Is this what you call accountability?

869
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,160
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

870
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,590
-When were these taken?
-Yesterday.

871
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:27,040
-I didn't approve any shipment.
-Well, your company did.

872
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,009
Well, I'm not my company.

873
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:33,019
-Please, do you mind?
-Have you seen these pictures?

874
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:34,639
-What's going on in Gulmira?
-Tony, Tony.

875
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,650
-You can't afford to be this naive.
-You know what? I was naive before,

876
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,700
when they said,
“Here's the line. We don't cross it.

877
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,160
“This is how we do business.”

878
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:44,069
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

879
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,670
Tony, your picture, please!

880
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,029
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

881
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,750
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

882
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,580
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

883
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,599
It was the only way I could protect you.

884
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,250
No. No.

885
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,730
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

886
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,410
as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

887
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,460
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

888
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,350
have been driven from their homes,

889
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,220
displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.

890
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,560
Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

891
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,320
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

892
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,980
or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

893
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,880
Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters

894
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,639
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

895
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,010
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

896
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,959
A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

897
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,810
With no political will
or international pressure,

898
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,230
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

899
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,370
Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,

900
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,350
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

901
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,780
either forced to join their militia...

902
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,250
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

903
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,810
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

904
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,250
A child’s simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?”

905
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,269
There’s very little hope
for these refugees,

906
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,870
refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

907
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,490
Hurry it up.

908
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,730
Put the women in the trucks.

909
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,830
Stack the weapons here.

910
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,910
Clear all the houses.

911
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,519
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

912
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,390
Grab that dog.

913
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,070
Put him with the others.

914
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:31,880
What the hell is this?

915
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,780
Shoot this dog.

916
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,490
You're all incompetent.

917
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,750
Turn your head.

918
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,350
He’s all yours.

919
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,590
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

920
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,170
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

921
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,030
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

922
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,230
Get those monitors up!

923
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,559
We got a bogey!

924
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,590
-Wasn't Air Force!
-We got the CIA on the line?

925
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,570
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

926
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,280
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

927
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,960
-It wasn't Navy.
-Wasn't Marines.

928
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,340
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

929
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,610
-Negative, negative.
-Cannot identify.

930
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,170
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

931
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,510
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

932
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,240
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

933
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,380
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

934
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,160
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

935
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,839
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

936
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,240
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

937
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,160
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

938
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,299
-ls it stealth?
-No, sir, it's tiny.

939
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,640
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

940
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,510
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

941
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,650
-Let me make a call.
-Sergeant, clear a hole.

942
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,940
-Hello?
-Tony?

943
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,679
-Who's this?
-It's Rhodes.

944
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,880
-Sorry, hello?
-I said it’s Rhodes.

945
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,660
-Speak up, please.
-What in the hell is that noise?

946
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,960
-Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
-Yeah, well, ! need your help right now.

947
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,629
It’s funny how that works, huh?

948
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,720
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

949
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,570
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

950
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,240
Well, that's a hot spot.

951
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,620
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

952
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,910
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

953
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,130
I’m not, ! was just jogging in the canyon.

954
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,870
-l thought you were driving.
-Right, I was driving

955
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,630
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

956
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,920
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

957
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,509
-Nope!
-Bogey spotted!

958
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,080
-Whiplash, come in hot.
-Okay, good, ‘cause I'm staring at one

959
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,360
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

960
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,870
That's my exit.

961
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,520
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.

962
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,349
Whiplash One, what is it?

963
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,720
I’ve got no idea.

964
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,920
-You have radio contact?
-Non responsive, sir.

965
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,150
Then you are clear to engage.

966
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,110
Hit it.

967
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,370
That bogey just went supersonic.
1 got a lock!

968
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,240
-Inbound missile.
-Flares!

969
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,570
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

970
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,610
Deploy flaps!

971
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:23,970
Holy!

972
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,530
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

973
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,100
The sat visual has been lost.

974
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,759
No way that’s a UAV.

975
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:29,980
What is it?

976
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,530
I can't see anything.

977
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,870
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

978
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,810
! think bogey’s been handled, sir.

979
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,559
-Hello?
-Hi, Rhodey, it’s me.

980
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,240
-It's who?
-I'm sorry, it is me.

981
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,600
You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

982
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,100
No, see, this isn't a game.

983
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,130
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

984
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,210
-You understand that?
-This is not a piece of equipment.

985
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,870
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

986
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,309
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

987
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,600
-Mark your position and return to base.
-Roger that, Ballroom.

988
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,059
On your belly!

989
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,889
It looks like a man!

990
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,530
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

991
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,540
I'm hit! I'm hit!

992
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,690
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

993
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,600
Punch out! Punch out!

994
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,470
Whiplash One down.

995
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,060
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

996
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,210
Negative! No chute, no chute!

997
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,950
My chute’s jammed!

998
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,880
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

999
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,450
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1000
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,700
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1001
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,750
-Call off the Raptors.
-That thing just took out an F-22

1002
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,240
inside a legal no fly zone!

1003
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,410
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

1004
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,790
You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive manoeuvre.

1005
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,280
Keep going!

1006
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,440
Good chute! Good chute!

1007
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,390
-Tony, you still there?
-Hey, thanks.

1008
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,970
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1009
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,269
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1010
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,220
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1011
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,000
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

1012
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,670
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1013
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,410
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1014
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,780
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

1015
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,530
It’s not that simple.

1016
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,100
An unfortunate training exercise

1017
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,860
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1018
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,760
lam pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

1019
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,540
As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,

1020
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,030
itis still unclear
who or what intervened,

1021
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,000
but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

1022
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,349
Hey!

1023
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,900
It is a tight fit, sir.

1024
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,500
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

1025
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,530
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1026
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,990
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

1027
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,680
-l really should be able to...
-Please, try not to move, sir.

1028
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,570
What's going on here?

1029
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,610
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1030
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,210
Are those bullet holes?

1031
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,810
Welcome.

1032
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,950
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1033
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,170
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1034
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,430
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1035
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,230
Show me the weapon.

1036
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,550
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1037
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,180
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1038
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,690
So this is how he did it.

1039
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,340
This is only a first, crude effort.

1040
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,770
Stark has perfected his design.

1041
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,580
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1042
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,190
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1043
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,040
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1044
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,930
We have a common enemy.

1045
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,969
If we are still in business,

1046
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,500
I will give you these designs

1047
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,070
as a gift.

1048
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,950
And in turn,

1049
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:38,000
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1050
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,610
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1051
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,000
Technology.

1052
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,940
It's always been your Achilles’ heel
in this part of the world.

1053
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,190
Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.

1054
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,750
That's the least of your problems.

1055
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,290
Crate up the armour and the rest of it.

1056
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,880
All right, let's finish up here.

1057
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,370
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1058
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,780
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1059
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,860
I want a prototype right away.

1060
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,590
Hey. You busy?
You mind if send you on an errand?

1061
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,900
I need you to go to my office.

1062
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,740
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1063
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,260
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1064
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,970
This'll get you in.

1065
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,570
It's probably under Executive Files.

1066
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,840
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1067
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,480
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1068
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,180
And what do you plan to do with
this information if 1 bring it back here?

1069
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,430
Same drill.

1070
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,390
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1071
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,320
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1072
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,389
Tony,

1073
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,300
you know that
I would help you with anything,

1074
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,970
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1075
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,540
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1076
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,900
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1077
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,960
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1078
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,639
Is that so?

1079
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,140
Well, then, I quit.

1080
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,610
You stood by my side all these years

1081
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,270
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1082
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,460
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1083
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,300
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1084
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,320
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1085
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,600
I shouldn't be alive,

1086
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,870
unless it was for a reason.

1087
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,500
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1088
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,870
I just finally know what I have to do.

1089
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,750
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1090
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,230
You're all I have, too, you know.

1091
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:36,240
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1092
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,849
You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.

1093
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,740
-As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
-Oh, my God.

1094
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,280
... your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1095
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,960
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1096
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,809
So, what are we going to do about this?

1097
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,610
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1098
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:33,490
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1099
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:58,370
Il was so happy when he came home.

1100
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,310
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1101
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,210
Now I realise,

1102
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,410
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1103
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,719
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1104
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,050
Breaks my heart.

1105
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,769
Well, he's a complicated person.

1106
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,720
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1107
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,480
You area very rare woman.

1108
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,019
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1109
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,600
Thank you. Thanks.

1110
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,480
I'd better get back there.

1111
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,680
Is that today's paper?

1112
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,349
Yes.

1113
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,400
Do you mind?

1114
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:07,700
-Not at all.
-Puzzle.

1115
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,080
Of course.

1116
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,720
Take care.

1117
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,460
Ms Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1118
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,180
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1119
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,379
-Right now?
-We're going to have it right now.

1120
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,070
-Yeah, walk with me.
-Okay.

1121
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,219
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1122
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,390
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1123
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,059
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1124
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,920
Mr Stane?
Sir, we've explored

1125
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,280
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1126
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,010
-Actually...
-A hiccup?

1127
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,469
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1128
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,790
-So it's...
-Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1129
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:14,260
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1130
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,410
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1131
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:24,510
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1132
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,960
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1133
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:46,710
Tony?

1134
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,170
Tony, are you there? Hello?

1135
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,090
Breathe.

1136
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,639
Easy, easy.

1137
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,890
You remember this one, right?

1138
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,760
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1139
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,599
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1140
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,370
Tony.

1141
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,410
When I ordered the hit on you,

1142
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,540
I worried that I was

1143
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,440
killing the golden goose.

1144
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,150
But, you see, it was just

1145
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,770
fate that you survived that.

1146
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,150
You had one last golden egg to give.

1147
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,100
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1148
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:04,759
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1149
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,019
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1150
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,519
Oh, it's beautiful.

1151
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:27,269
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1152
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,110
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1153
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,230
This is your legacy.

1154
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:42,230
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1155
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,080
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

1156
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,490
put the balance of power in our hands.

1157
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,610
The right hands.

1158
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,630
I wish you could've seen my prototype.

1159
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,780
It's not as...

1160
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,769
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1161
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,470
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

1162
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,370
I would have preferred that she lived.

1163
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,120
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1164
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,650
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1165
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,240
Okay, where's Tony now?

1166
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,919
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1167
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,019
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

1168
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,530
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1169
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,559
Good boy.

1170
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,790
Tony?

1171
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,389
Tony?

1172
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,139
Tony?

1173
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,259
Tony?

1174
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:39,870
Tony!

1175
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:44,050
Tony! You okay?

1176
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,730
-Where's Pepper?
-She's fine. She's with five agents.

1177
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,170
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1178
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,350
That's not going to be enough.

1179
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:20,500
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1180
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,120
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1181
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,310
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1182
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,830
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1183
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,400
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1184
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,660
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1185
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,390
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1186
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,120
You need me to do anything else?

1187
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,470
Keep the skies clear.

1188
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,680
Damn!

1189
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,960
Next time, baby.

1190
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,880
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1191
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,520
I thought it'd be bigger.

1192
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,840
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is going to hold up?

1193
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,120
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1194
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,730
That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.

1195
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,380
Keep me posted.

1196
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:08,150
Pepper!

1197
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,849
-Tony! Tony, are you okay?
-I'm fine. How are...

1198
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,889
-Obadiah, he's gone insane!
-1 know.

1199
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,710
-Listen, you'd better get out of there.
-He built a suit.

1200
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,230
Get out of there right now!

1201
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,720
Where do you think you're going?

1202
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,809
Your services are no longer required.

1203
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:39,589
Stane!

1204
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,360
I love this suit!

1205
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:08,340
-Put them down!
-Collateral damage, Tony.

1206
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,920
Divert power to chest RT.

1207
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,310
Power reduced to 19%.

1208
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,019
Lady!

1209
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,680
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1210
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,570
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

1211
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,269
! built this company from nothing!

1212
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,890
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1213
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,530
Least of all you!

1214
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:30,410
Impressive!
You've upgraded your armour!

1215
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,639
I’ve made some upgrades of my own!

1216
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,610
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1217
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,360
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1218
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:47,530
With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1219
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,700
I know the math! Do it!

1220
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,840
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1221
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,410
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1222
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,849
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1223
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:09,330
Yes, sir.

1224
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,730
-Thirteen percent power, sir.
-Climb!

1225
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,520
-Eleven percent.
-Keep going!

1226
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:32,990
-Seven percent power.
-Just leave it on the screen!

1227
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:34,650
Stop telling me!

1228
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:48,019
You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

1229
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,830
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1230
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,420
Icing problem?

1231
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,680
Might want to look into it.

1232
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,240
Two percent.

1233
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,900
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1234
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,309
-Potts!
-Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1235
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,280
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1236
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,030
Nice try!

1237
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:49,330
-Weapons status?
-Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1238
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:55,610
Flares!

1239
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,680
Very clever, Tony.

1240
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,100
-Potts?
-Tony!

1241
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,349
This isn't working.

1242
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,450
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1243
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,220
-Well, how are you going to do that?
-You're going to do it.

1244
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,710
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1245
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:23,269
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1246
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,690
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1247
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,240
It's going to fry everything up here.

1248
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,410
Okay. I'm going in now.

1249
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,500
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

1250
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,510
This looks important!

1251
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,110
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1252
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:12,000
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1253
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,500
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1254
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,860
You'd have made your father proud!

1255
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:33,980
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1256
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,120
Tony!

1257
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,809
How ironic, Tony!

1258
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:02,860
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1259
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:08,630
-Pepper!
-And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1260
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:15,469
-You ripped out my targeting system!
-Time to hit the button!

1261
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,370
-You told me not to!
-Hold still, you little prick!

1262
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,940
-Just do it!
-You'll die!

1263
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,500
Push it!

1264
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:25,390
Tony!

1265
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,470
You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

1266
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,730
at Stark Industries last night.

1267
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:42,110
There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1268
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:44,930
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1269
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,850
Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark’s personal security staff...

1270
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,849
“Iron Man.” That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1271
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:53,210
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1272
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:55,930
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1273
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,690
Here's your alibi.

1274
01:48:58,720 --> 01:48:59,630
Okay.

1275
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,660
-You were on your yacht.
-Yeah.

1276
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,790
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1277
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,559
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1278
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,470
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1279
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,430
alone on the island.

1280
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:12,960
-That's what happened.
-All right.

1281
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,990
Just read it, word for word.

1282
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,760
There's nothing about Stane here.

1283
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,430
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1284
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:24,670
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1285
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,140
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1286
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,980
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1287
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,330
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr Stark.

1288
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:36,050
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1289
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,490
You've got 90 seconds.

1290
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,920
Agent Coulson?

1291
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:47,550
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1292
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,620
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1293
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:54,040
-From the Strategic Homeland...
-Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1294
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:55,740
Right.

1295
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,100
-Let's get this show on the road.
-You know, it's actually not that bad.

1296
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,530
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1297
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,220
-You're not Iron Man.
-Am so.

1298
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,549
-You're not.
-All right, suit yourself.

1299
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:10,290
You know, if 1 were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1300
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:13,090
She'd be a wreck, ‘cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1301
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,370
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1302
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:18,840
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1303
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:21,830
crazy about me.

1304
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:23,440
Tell me you never think about that night.

1305
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,300
-What night?
-You know.

1306
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:33,170
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1307
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:40,150
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1308
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,620
and you left me there, by myself?

1309
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:47,300
Is that the night you're talking about?

1310
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,590
Thought so.

1311
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:56,480
-Will that be all, Mr Stark?
-Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1312
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,980
And now, Mr Stark has
prepared a statement.

1313
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:03,040
He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

1314
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:11,679
Been a while since I was in front of you.
! figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

1315
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,760
There’s been speculation that ! was
involved in the events that occurred

1316
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:18,280
on the freeway and the rooftop...

1317
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,870
I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1318
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:24,440
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1319
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,590
-despite the fact that you...
-! know that it’s confusing.

1320
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:31,060
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

1321
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:34,300
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1322
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,130
I never said you were a superhero.

1323
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:40,900
Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.

1324
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:46,179
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1325
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:49,570
With this laundry list
of character defects,

1326
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,230
all the mistakes I've made,

1327
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:54,290
-largely public.
-Just stick to the cards, man.

1328
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,160
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1329
01:51:58,360 --> 01:51:59,660
The truth is

1330
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,020
