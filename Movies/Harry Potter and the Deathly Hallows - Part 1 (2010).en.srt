too treacherous fo pass.

But being learned in the magical arts...

1183
01:50:50,811 --> 01:50:55,351
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.

1184
01:50:57,317 --> 01:50:59,157
Before they could cross, however...

1185
01:50:59,586 --> 01:51:03,186
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

1186
01:51:03,957 --> 01:51:07,357
it was Death, and he felt cheated.

1187
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:10,684
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1188
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:13,041
But Death was cunning.

1189
01:51:13,934 --> 01:51:16,564
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1190
01:51:17,104 --> 01:51:21,734
..and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1191
01:51:22,943 --> 01:51:26,953
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1192
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:31,721
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1193
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:37,467
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1194
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:42,058
..and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1195
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:46,809
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1196
01:51:48,068 --> 01:51:51,548
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1197
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,500
A humble man...

1198
01:51:54,841 --> 01:51:58,531
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1199
01:51:59,213 --> 01:52:01,992
..-without being followed by Death.

1200
01:52:03,483 --> 01:52:08,643
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

1201
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:15,306
The first brother traveled
to a distant village...

1202
01:52:15,829 --> 01:52:17,669
..-where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

1203
01:52:18,098 --> 01:52:21,408
.. he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.

that the Elder Wand had given him...

1206
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:36,920
But that night,
another wizard stole the wand...

1207
01:52:37,517 --> 01:52:40,267
.and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.

1208
01:52:40,854 --> 01:52:43,874
And so Death took the first brother
for his own.

The second brother journeyed
to his home...

and turned it thrice in hand.
