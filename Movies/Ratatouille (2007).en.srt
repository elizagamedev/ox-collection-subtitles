1
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,055
Although each of the world's countries
would like to dispute this fact,

2
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:32,825
we French know the truth:

3
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,060
The best food in the world
is made in France.

4
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,245
The best food in France
is made in Paris.

5
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:41,234
And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.

6
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,282
Gusteau's restaurant
is the toast of Paris,

7
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,077
booked five months in advance.

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,750
And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine

9
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,299
has made his competitors envious.

10
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,465
He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.

11
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,992
Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
Anyone Can Cook!

12
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,227
climbed to the top of the bestseller list.

13
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,613
But not everyone
celebrates its success.

14
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,605
Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!

15
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:04,780
Anton Ego - FOOD CRITIC
"THE GRIM EATER"

16
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,248
What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.

17
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,992
!, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.

18
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,715
And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.

19
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,197
This is me.

20
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,836
think it's apparent
! need to rethink my life a little bit.

21
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,753
What's my problem?

22
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,754
First of all, I'm a rat.

23
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,248
Which means life is hard.

24
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:13,304
And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.

25
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:18,378
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

26
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,906
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

27
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,464
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

28
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:28,032
This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.

29
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,678
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

30
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,932
This is my dad. He's never impressed.

31
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,272
He also happens to be
the leader of our clan.

32
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,792
So, what's wrong
with having highly developed senses?

33
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,924
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that!
-What's going on here?

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,170
Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison.

35
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,497
Suddenly, Dad didn't think
my talent was useless.

36
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,177
! was feeling pretty good about my gift,

37
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,686
until Dad gave me a job.

38
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,553
Clean.

39
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:01,930
Clean.

40
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,471
That's right. Poison checker.

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,680
Cleanerific.

42
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,208
Cleanerino.

43
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,373
Close to godliness.

44
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,303
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

45
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,581
Never mind. Move on.

46
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,160
Well, it made my dad proud.

47
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:22,537
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

48
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,453
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

49
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,032
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

50
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,326
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

51
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,868
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

52
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,984
Let's just say
we have different points of view.

53
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,661
This much I knew:

54
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,413
If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.

55
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,346
But to my dad...

56
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,615
Food is fuel.

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,050
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is going to die.

58
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,967
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

59
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,575
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

60
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,506
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

61
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,236
where nothing is poisoned?

62
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,787
First of all, we are not thieves.

63
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,727
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

64
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,226
It's dangerous.

65
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,878
! know I'm supposed to hate humans,
but there's something about them.

66
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,288
They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.

67
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,086
! mean,
just look at what they do with food.

68
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,765
How can! describe it?

69
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,537
Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell,

70
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,298
There is excellence all around you.

71
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,797
You need only be aware to stop
and savor it.

72
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,068
Oh, Gusteau was right.

73
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,857
Oh, yeah.

74
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,976
Oh, amazing.

75
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,659
Each flavor was totally unique.

76
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,929
But combine one flavor with another,

77
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,852
and something new was created.

78
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,088
So now I had a secret life.

79
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,491
The only one who knew about it
was Emile.

80
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,041
Hey, Emile. Emile.

81
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,397
l found a mushroom.

82
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,679
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.

83
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,239
He doesn't understand me,
but l can be myself around him.

84
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,241
Why are you walking like that?

85
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,168
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.

86
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,357
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws

87
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,836
that we handle food with?

88
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,907
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths?

89
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,196
All the time.

90
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,684
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.

91
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,093
Well, go ahead.

92
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,618
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.

93
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,785
What have you got there?

94
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,270
You found cheese?

95
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,792
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de chévre de pays!

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,710
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.

97
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:56,972
And...

98
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,136
This rosemary! This rosemary

99
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,849
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.

100
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,396
Well, throw it on the pile, l guess,
and then we'll... You know...

101
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,740
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

102
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,864
But we're supposed
to return to the colony

103
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,486
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...

104
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:18,676
Emile!

105
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,582
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

106
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,224
We got to cook this.

107
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:26,435
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real...

108
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,105
Yeah.

109
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,913
The key is to keep turning it.

110
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:36,272
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

111
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,860
That storm's getting closer.

112
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,562
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...

113
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,272
You got to taste this!

114
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,330
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

115
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:05,465
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

116
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,489
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

117
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,873
-What would you call that flavor?
-Lightning-y?

118
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,453
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

119
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,443
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

120
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,894
I know what this needs. Saffron.
A little saffron would make this.

121
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,631
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

122
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,747
-it's in the kitchen?
-It's in the kitchen.

123
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,792
-Saffron.
-Not good.

124
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,448
Saffron.

125
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,126
Don't like it. She's going to wake up.

126
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,957
I've been down here a million times.

127
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,010
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

128
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,251
You've been here a million times?

129
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:54,139
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

130
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,280
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

131
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,986
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

132
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,179
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

133
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,198
Wait. You read?

134
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,017
-Well, not excessively.
-Oh, man. Does Dad know?

135
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,157
-Well, not excessively.
-Oh, man. Does Dad know?

136
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:11,594
You could fill a book, a lot of books,
with things Dad doesn't know.

137
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,888
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

138
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,793
I don't like secrets.

139
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,434
All this cooking and reading
and TV-watching

140
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,022
while we read and cook.

141
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,124
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.

142
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,837
Why do I let you?

143
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,489
What's taking those kids so long?

144
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,476
L'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?

145
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,246
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

146
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,130
Forget mystique.
This is about your cooking.

147
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,728
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

148
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:49,528
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

149
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,399
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

150
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,074
You must be imaginative,
strong hearted.

151
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,310
You must try things that may not work.

152
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,509
And you must not let anyone
define your limits

153
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,742
because of where you come from.

154
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,097
Your only limit is your soul.

155
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:09,596
What I say is true. Anyone can cook,
But only the fearless can be great.

156
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,351
Pure poetry.

157
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,399
But it was not to last.

158
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,574
Gusteau's restaurant lost
one of its five stars

159
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,124
after a scathing review
by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.

160
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,133
It was a severe blow to Gusteau,

161
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,158
and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards,

162
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,235
which, according to tradition,
meant the loss of another star.

163
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,052
Gusteau is dead?

164
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,606
Run!

165
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,166
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

166
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,149
-Help, Remy, help!
-Emile! Start swinging the light!

167
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,380
-Help, Remy, help!
-Emile! Start swinging the light!

168
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,946
Try to grab you.

169
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,201
Emile, swing to me.

170
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,180
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

171
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,501
-Let me through!
-The book.

172
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,112
-Let me through!
-The book.

173
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,401
Excuse me. Move, move.

174
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,642
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.

175
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,536
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!

176
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,823
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

177
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,507
Push off. Come on.

178
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,720
Get hold!

179
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,155
-Take the baby. Here!
-Give me your paw.

180
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,942
Hey, wait for me!

181
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,952
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

182
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,568
-Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
-Right here. I'm coming.

183
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,623
I'm coming!

184
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,286
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

185
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,576
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

186
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,628
Come on. Reach for it.

187
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:12,878
You can do it.

188
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,512
-Remy!
-Dad!

189
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,204
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

190
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,247
Guys, wait. Stop!

191
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,391
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

192
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,971
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

193
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,137
Dad?

194
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,278
Dad?

195
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,550
Which way?

196
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,693
! waited

197
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,419
for a sound,

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,310
.
a voice,

199
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,077
.
a sign,

200
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,934
something.

201
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,271
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.

202
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,810
Why do you wait and mope?

203
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:34,253
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,

204
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,232
probably forever.

205
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,244
-How do you know?
-Well, I...

206
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,526
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

207
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:49,314
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are lonely.

208
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,919
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

209
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,221
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.

210
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,247
If you focus on what you've left behind,

211
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,643
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.

212
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,962
Now go up and look around.

213
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,391
Champagne!

214
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,201
What are you doing?

215
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,233
I'm hungry.

216
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,808
I don't know where I am,

217
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,569
and I don't know
when I'll find food again.

218
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,040
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

219
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,994
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

220
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,717
But lam hungry.

221
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,087
Food will come, Remy.

222
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:07,406
Food always comes
to those who love to cook.

223
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,916
-You think lam playing?
-You don't have the guts.

224
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:10,752
Paris?

225
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,567
All this time
I've been underneath Paris?

226
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,153
Wow.

227
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,497
It's beautiful.

228
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,190
The most beautiful.

229
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,126
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

230
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,689
You've led me to your restaurant.

231
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,621
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is. l have led you to it.

232
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,557
I got to see this.

233
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,733
-Ready to go on table seven.
-Coming around.

234
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,548
-One order of steamed pike up.
-Coming up.

235
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,383
I need more soup bowls, please.

236
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,978
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.

237
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,271
I need two salmon, three
salade composée, and three filet.

238
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,441
Three orders
of salade composée working.

239
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,263
Firing two orders, seared salmon.

240
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,943
Three filet working. l need plates.

241
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:58,084
Three filet working. l need plates.

242
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,550
-Fire seven.
-Three salade composée up.

243
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,650
Don't mess with my mise!

244
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,075
Open down low.

245
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,897
I'm getting buried here.

246
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,790
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

247
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,002
-Bonjour, chef.
-Hello, Chef Skinner.

248
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,548
-Evening, chef.
-Ordering deux filet.

249
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,601
Hey, boss, look who is here.

250
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,039
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

251
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,862
-Hi.
-All grown up, eh?

252
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,947
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?

253
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,754
-Yes. How are you...
-Linguini.

254
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,930
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

255
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,155
-My mother?
-Renata.

256
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,970
-Yes, Renata. How is she?
-Good.

257
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,607
Well, not... She's been better. 1 mean...

258
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,229
She died.

259
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,543
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,951
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.

261
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,718
You know, afterlife-wise?

262
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,560
-What's this?
-She left it for you.

263
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,106
Il think she hoped it would help me,

264
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,723
you know, get a job here.

265
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,456
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.

266
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:13,815
Any son of Renata's is more than...

267
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:17,243
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...

268
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,720
We have already hired him.

269
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,238
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...

270
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,315
We needed a garbage boy.

271
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,341
Oh, garbage. Well...

272
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,323
I'm glad it worked out.

273
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,541
I can't believe it.

274
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,760
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.

275
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,103
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

276
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,056
Which one is the chef?

277
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,741
-Oh, that guy.
-Very good.

278
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,570
Who is next in command?

279
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,321
The sous chef. There.

280
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,428
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

281
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,099
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.

282
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,305
Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,
both important.

283
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,370
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.

284
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,633
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?

285
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,587
Oh, him? He's nobody.

286
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,762
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

287
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,761
No, he's a plongeur or something.

288
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,280
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

289
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,532
-But he could.
-Uh, no.

290
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,989
How do you know?
What do I always say?

291
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,794
Anyone can cook.

292
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,560
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

293
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:41,267
Well, that is not stopping him. See?

294
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:46,544
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

295
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,104
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

296
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,422
It's your restaurant. Do something.

297
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,533
What can I do?
lam a figment of your imagination.

298
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,290
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

299
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,751
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

300
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,794
Table five coming up, right now.

301
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,091
-Coming down the line.
-Set.

302
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,231
Hot! Open oven!

303
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,541
Coming around.

304
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,350
Oui, chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.

305
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,501
Fire those soufflés for table six, ja.

306
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,723
-Five minutes, chef.
-Oh, God.

307
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,440
Tonight,
I'd like to present the foie gras.

308
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,353
It has a wonderful finish.

309
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,894
Ready to go on table seven. Come on!
Let's go!

310
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,220
Oui, chef.

311
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,769
Remy! What are you waiting for?

312
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,711
Is this going to become a regular thing
with you?

313
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,377
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

314
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:59,447
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

315
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,436
Move it, garbage boy!

316
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,652
You are cooking?

317
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,191
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

318
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,518
Where do you get the gall

319
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,067
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic?

320
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,364
I should have you drawn
and quartered!

321
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,436
I'll do it. 1 think the law is on my side.

322
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,139
Larousse, draw and quarter this man

323
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:28,095
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.

324
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,577
-What are you blathering about?
-The soup!

325
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,373
Soup?

326
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,695
Stop that soup!

327
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,181
Waiter.

328
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,944
Linguini!

329
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:02,736
You're fired!

330
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,707
F-I-R-E-D! Fired!

331
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,185
She wants to see the chef.

332
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,407
But he...

333
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,451
-What did the customer say?
-It was not a customer. It was a critic.

334
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,922
-Ego?
-Solene LeClaire.

335
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:35,860
-LeClaire? What did she say?
-She likes the soup.

336
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,997
-Wait.
-What do you mean, "Wait"?

337
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,697
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

338
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,198
Someone is asking about your soup.

339
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,757
What are you playing at?

340
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,591
Am I still fired?

341
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,719
-You can't fire him.
-What?

342
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,985
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.

343
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,629
If she write a review to that effect

344
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,620
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...

345
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,739
-He's a garbage boy.
-Who made something she liked.

346
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,219
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau

347
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,498
if we don't uphold
his most cherished belief?

348
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,387
And what belief is that,
Mademoiselle Tatou?

349
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:18,706
Anyone can cook.

350
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:28,719
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.

351
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,805
He has taken a bold risk

352
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:36,053
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.

353
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,585
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters,

354
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,458
who are we to deny him?

355
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,754
-You were escaping?
-Oh, yeah.

356
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,790
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,

357
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,151
you shall be responsible for it.

358
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,131
Anyone else?

359
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,948
Then back to work.

360
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,976
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.

361
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:07,368
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.

362
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,717
Very close attention.

363
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,256
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?

364
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,568
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...

365
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:21,745
Rat!

366
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,646
-Rat!
-Get the rat.

367
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,848
Linguini. Get something to trap it.

368
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,607
It's getting away. Get it, get it, get it.

369
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,149
-What should I do now?
-Kill it.

370
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,697
-Now?
-No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?

371
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,520
Do you know what would happen to us

372
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,985
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen?

373
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,814
They'd close us down.

374
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,228
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is.

375
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:47,252
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!

376
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,799
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.

377
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,236
They expect me to cook it again!

378
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:33,166
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
l wasn't trying to cook.

379
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,475
l was just trying to stay out of trouble.

380
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,501
You're the one who was getting fancy
with the spices!

381
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:43,287
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?

382
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,319
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?

383
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,322
You didn't throw rosemary in there?

384
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,554
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...

385
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,086
I need this job. I've lost so many.

386
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:05,736
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...

387
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,252
Did you nod?

388
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,377
Have you been nodding?

389
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,659
You understand me?

390
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,873
So I'm not crazy!

391
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,091
Wait a second, wait a second.

392
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,789
l can't cook, can I?

393
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,673
But you...

394
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,019
You can, right?

395
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,766
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.

396
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,275
Whatever you did, they liked it.

397
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,419
Yeah. This could work.

398
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,351
Hey, they liked the soup!

399
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:49,760
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?

400
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,125
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.

401
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,002
But we're together on this. Right?

402
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,404
Okay.

403
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,565
So this is it.

404
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:20,104
I mean, it's not much, but it's,
you know...

405
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:20,215
I mean, it's not much, but it's,
you know...

406
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,507
Not much.

407
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,258
It could be worse.

408
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,621
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.

409
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,155
So, you know, what's mine is yours.

410
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:34,715
Are you...

411
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,006
Is this a dream?

412
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,408
The best kind of dream.

413
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,078
One we can share.

414
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,861
But why here?

415
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:45,936
Why now?

416
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,585
Why not here?

417
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,587
Why not now?

418
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:55,143
What better place to dream
than in Paris?

419
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,153
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...

420
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,541
Oh, no.

421
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,820
Idiot! I knew this would happen!

422
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,555
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!

423
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,988
Eggs, gone!

424
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,223
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?

425
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,926
That's what I get for trusting a...

426
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,455
Hi. Is that for me?

427
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,062
That's good. What did you put in this?

428
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,768
Where'd you get that?

429
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:55,292
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

430
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:02,094
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!

431
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,716
Come on, Little Chef!

432
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,688
"Though I, like many other critic,

433
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,940
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,

434
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:13,457
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."

435
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,869
-Solene LeClaire?
-Yes!

436
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,214
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.

437
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:23,314
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."

438
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:27,668
Well...

439
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,779
You know.

440
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,641
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,

441
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,288
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?

442
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,190
So let's do this thing!

443
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,602


444
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:11,952
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.

445
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,154
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.

446
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,325
Soup.

447
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,379
You little...

448
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,052
You son ofa...

449
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,935
You got...

450
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,372
This is not going to work, Little Chef!

451
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,954
I'm going to lose it
if we do this anymore.

452
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,513
We've got to figure out something else.

453
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,869
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,

454
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,615
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.

455
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,417
The biting! No! Scampering! No!

456
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,690
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?

457
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,345
Little Chef?

458
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,152
Oh, you're hungry.

459
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,811
Okay. So let's think this out.

460
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,256
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear

461
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:51,475
human.

462
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,230
We need to work out a system
so that do what you want

463
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,339
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.

464
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,656
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!

465
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,648
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.

466
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,761
-I will never pull this off!
-Linguini?

467
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,940
We gotta communicate.

468
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:09,877
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...

469
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,940
The rat! I saw it!

470
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,055
-A rat?
-Yes, a rat. Right next to you.

471
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,930
What are you doing in here?

472
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:25,813
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.

473
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:27,681
Get out.

474
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:32,474
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!

475
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,295
That was close. Are you okay up there?

476
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,340
How did you do that?

477
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,761
That's strangely involuntary!

478
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,627
One look and I knew
we had the same crazy idea.

479
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,432
Okay.

480
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,697
Where are you taking me? Wait.

481
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,372
Wait. I'm sorry.

482
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,215
Okay.

483
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,250
Okay.

484
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:04,598
All right.

485
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:32,776
That should do it.

486
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:41,154
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success.

487
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:45,973
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.

488
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:50,593
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.

489
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,330
Listen, I just want you to know

490
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,209
how honored I am
to be studying under such...

491
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,615
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.

492
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,355
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?

493
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,827
Well, I...

494
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,205
-Only me. Why do you think that is?
-Well, I...

495
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,527
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy

496
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,210
built upon rules
written by stupid old men.

497
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,676
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.

498
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,196
But still I'm here. How did this happen?

499
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,855
Because, well, because you...

500
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:22,147
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen.

501
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,973
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here

502
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,862
and lam not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.

503
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,368
Got it?

504
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,106
Wow!

505
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:37,625
Easy to cook. Easy to eat.
Gusteau makes Chinese food

506
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,218
Chine-easy.

507
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:45,483
-Excellent work, Francois, as usual.
-It's good, isn't it?

508
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:49,823
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.

509
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,401
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.

510
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:56,787
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.

511
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,468
What are corn dogs?

512
00:41:58,716 --> 00:41:58,881
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

513
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:02,633
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

514
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,444
Whip something up.

515
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,788
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.

516
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:11,136
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.

517
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:15,169
Yes. But, please, with dignity.

518
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,206
Get my lawyer!

519
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,102
Well, the will stipulates

520
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:49,774
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death

521
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:51,473
no heir appears,

522
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:55,516
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

523
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,890
I know what the will stipulates.

524
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,872
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!

525
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,459
There's not much resemblance.

526
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,886
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

527
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,204
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

528
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,564
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!

529
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,971
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter

530
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:26,693
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

531
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:28,695
Highly suspect!

532
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,613
-This is Gusteau's?
-Yes, yes, yes.

533
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,342
-May I?
-Of course.

534
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,933
But the boy does not know.

535
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:38,022
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.

536
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:42,159
-Why you? What does she want?
-A job for the boy.

537
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,303
-Only a job?
-Well, yes.

538
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,946
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

539
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,969
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

540
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,039
Find out how much of this is real.

541
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,614
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples

542
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,553
from the boy. Hair, maybe.

543
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:01,619
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.

544
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,870
He knows something.

545
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:08,873
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
l think you can handle him.

546
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,709
What are you doing?

547
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,684
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?

548
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,543
No! You waste energy and time!

549
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,488
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?

550
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,040
Well, Mommy never had to face

551
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:26,606
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in,

552
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:28,238
and every dish is different
and none are simple,

553
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:29,643
and all of the different cooking times,

554
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:31,011
but must arrive on the customer's table

555
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,049
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!

556
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,744
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!

557
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,459
What is this? Keep your station clear!

558
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:43,435
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?

559
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:45,118
Messy stations slow things down.

560
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,436
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.

561
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,308
I'll make this easy to remember.

562
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,690
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!

563
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,183
Your sleeves look like
you threw up on them.

564
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,932
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?

565
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,354
Always return to this position.

566
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,759
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.

567
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:07,853
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.

568
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,586
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.

569
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:12,528
I know the Gusteau style cold.

570
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,743
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

571
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,797
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.

572
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,590
-Always do something unexpected.
-No. Follow the recipe.

573
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:24,444
-But you just said that...
-No, no, no.

574
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,622
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

575
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,859
-Follow his recipes.
-Follow the recipe.

576
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,244
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it?

577
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,320
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.

578
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:37,784
Listen.

579
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:42,437
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.

580
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,791
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

581
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,944
and there are only two way
to get first pick.

582
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:51,619
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.

583
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,653
Voila! The best restaurant get first pick.

584
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:58,562
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

585
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:02,556
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.

586
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,377
Got hired by circus people
as an acrobat.

587
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:09,576
And then he get fired for messing
around with the ringmaster's daughter.

588
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,754
-Horst has done time.
-What for?

589
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:16,164
No one know for sure. He changes
the story every time you ask him.

590
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:18,374
defrauded a major corporation.

591
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,779
l robbed the second largest bank
in France using only a ballpoint pen.

592
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:24,533
Il created a hole in the ozone
over Avignon.

593
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,319
I killed a man with this thumb.

594
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,618
Don't ever play cards with Pompidou.

595
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,084
He's been banned from Las Vegas
and Monte Carlo.

596
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,734
-Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
-Which resistance?

597
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,838
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.

598
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:41,648
So you see.

599
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:45,709
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.

600
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:49,327
-We?
-Oui. You are one of us now, oui?

601
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:54,057
Oui. Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.

602
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,115
-Thank you, too.
-For what?

603
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,938
For taking it.

604
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:04,904
The rat!

605
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:09,917
-But he is a...
-I just dropped my keys.

606
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,604
Have you decided this evening?

607
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,503
-Your soup is excellent. But...
-But we order it every time.

608
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,234
-What else do you have?
-Well, we have a very nice foie gras.

609
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,703
I know about the foie gras.

610
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,522
The old standby,
used to be famous for it.

611
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,714
What does the chef have that's new?

612
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:32,291
-Someone has asked what is new!
-New?

613
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,520
Yes. What do I tell them?

614
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,241
-Well, what did you tell them?
-I told them I would ask!

615
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:36,692
What are you blathering about?

616
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,794
-Customers are asking what is new.
-What should I tell them?

617
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,326
-What did you tell them?
-I told them I would ask!

618
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,397
This is simple.

619
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:46,531
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,

620
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,357
something we haven't made
in a while...

621
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,976
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.

622
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:57,574
They are asking for food from Linguini?

623
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:00,746
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.

624
00:48:01,145 --> 00:48:02,515
Were we saying that?

625
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,127
Very well. If it's Linguini they want,

626
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:10,594
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.

627
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,975
Something definitely off menu.

628
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:16,159
Oh, and don't forget to stress

629
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,630
-its Linguini-ness.
-Oui, chef.

630
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,689
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.

631
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,960
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread a la Gusteau.

632
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:30,136
-Colette will help you.
-Oui, chef.

633
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:32,961
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.

634
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:35,917
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

635
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:37,833
Gusteau himself said so.

636
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:41,109
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.

637
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,022
"Sweetbread a la Gusteau.

638
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,477
"Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

639
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,470
"with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose purée,

640
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,145
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?

641
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,991
"Anchovy licorice sauce."

642
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,415
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...

643
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:00,122
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?

644
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,288
Yes! The veal stomach, I get that.

645
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,690
Veal stomach?

646
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,413
Okay.

647
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,669
I'll be right back. Where...

648
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,032
Hey, I got to...

649
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:31,138
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.

650
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:33,676
Let's see, over here...

651
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:35,148
I'll be back.

652
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,404
Thank you.

653
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,732
Excuse me. I'm going to...

654
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,290
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...

655
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,206
I'm going to pick that up.

656
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,444
I got some of that spice.

657
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:48,668
Okay.

658
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:50,042
What are you doing? You're supposed

659
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,426
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

660
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:52,859
This is the recipe.

661
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,933
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!

662
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,511
What else have you...
You are improvising?

663
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,067
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

664
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,424
You're right. l should listen to you!

665
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:04,834
-Stop that!
-Stop what?

666
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,352
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

667
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,551
-Where is the special order?
-Coming!

668
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:11,897
-l thought we were together on this.
-We are together.

669
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,616
-Then what are you doing?
-It's very hard to explain.

670
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,065
-The special?
-Come get it!

671
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,790
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

672
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:31,024
-Don't you dare.
-I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

673
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:35,592
Sorry.

674
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,918
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

675
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,001
Ja. It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.

676
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:46,634
-Did you taste it?
-Ja, of course, before he changed it.

677
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,637
Good. What? How could he change it?

678
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,710
He changed it
as it was going out the door!

679
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,234
They love it!

680
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,851
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.

681
00:50:57,288 --> 00:50:58,838
I have seven more orders!

682
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,466
That's wonderful.

683
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,419
I'd like one of those.

684
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,477
Special order!

685
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,389
What is that?

686
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,507
Special order! Special order!
Special order!

687
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,512
To Linguini.

688
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:32,037
-Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
-Cheers, ja?

689
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,586
Drink now, there's plenty.

690
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:41,276
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.

691
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,383
We really did it tonight.

692
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:55,978
Got your toque.

693
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:58,381
Oh, seriously now.

694
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:02,819
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

695
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:05,827
-Am [ in trouble?
-Trouble? No.

696
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:09,596
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

697
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:14,732
The plongeur won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?

698
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,665
He's gotten all he needs.

699
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:23,291
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

700
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,482
Good for you.

701
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:30,287
I just took it to be polite.
don't really drink, you know.

702
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:34,481
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if l was drinking that.

703
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:38,775
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

704
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:42,930
not to appreciate
this '61 Chateau Latour.

705
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:47,197
And you, Monsieur Linguini,
are no idiot.

706
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,152
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

707
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,814
-Remy!
-Emile?

708
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,261
I can't believe it! You're alive!

709
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,906
-You made it!
-I thought I'd never see you guys again!

710
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,897
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.

711
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,133
And what are you eating?

712
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:29,822
I don't really know.

713
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,950
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.

714
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:37,574
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

715
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:41,318
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.

716
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,221
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

717
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:58,482
-And he can. It's for my brother.
-But the boy could lose his job.

718
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:01,883
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

719
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:06,653
-More wine?
-l shouldn't, but... Okay.

720
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:10,441
So, where did you train, Linguini?

721
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,968
Train? All right.

722
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:17,433
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

723
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,258
-It's not.
-I knew it!

724
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:22,803
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

725
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,760
Monday was my first time.

726
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:27,491
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

727
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,921
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.

728
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:33,144
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.

729
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:37,947
-Do you like animals?
-What? Animals? What kind?

730
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:42,683
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
. .
guinea pigs,

731
00:54:43,247 --> 00:54:44,267
rats.

732
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:48,816
l brought you something to...
No, no, no, no!

733
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:50,779
Spit that out right now!

734
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:54,672
Il have got to teach you about food.
Close your eyes.

735
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:59,429
Now take a bite of... No! No! No!

736
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:03,057
-Don't just hork it down!
-Too late.

737
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,810
Here.

738
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:09,109
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.

739
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:13,956
-See?
-Not really.

740
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,151
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.

741
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,308
-You detect that?
-Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.

742
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,504
Close your eyes. Now taste this.

743
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:28,803
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.

744
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:32,685
-Okay.
-Now, try them together.

745
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,084
Okay.

746
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,739
I think I'm getting
a little something there.

747
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,119
-It might be the nuttiness.
-See?

748
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,991
-Could be the tang.
-That's it.

749
00:55:43,307 --> 00:55:44,917
Now, imagine every great taste
in the world

750
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:46,972
being combined
into infinite combinations.

751
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:50,001
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!

752
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,680
I think...

753
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,236
-You lost me again.
-Yeah.

754
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,942
But that was interesting.

755
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:59,651
Most interesting garbage I ever...
What are we doing?

756
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,290
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!

757
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,578
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!

758
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:05,330
-Yeah! But...
-What?

759
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:08,209
Thing is, I kind of have to...

760
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,849
What do you "have to"
more than family?

761
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,341
What's more important here?

762
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,003
Well, I...

763
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,422
It wouldn't hurt to visit.

764
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,401
-Have you had a pet rat?
-No.

765
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,350
-Did you work in a lab with rats?
-No.

766
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:22,988
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?

767
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,680
Nopety nopety no.

768
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:27,322
You know something about rats!
You know you do!

769
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,681
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.

770
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:33,298
-Hey! Why do they call it that?
-What?

771
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,290
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

772
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,298
If you're going to name a food,

773
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,143
you should give ita name
that sounds delicious.

774
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:47,232
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

775
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:51,698
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.

776
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:59,211
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

777
00:56:59,583 --> 00:56:59,603
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

778
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,182
My son has returned!

779
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:33,232
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.

780
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,386
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.

781
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:41,924
-You didn't make it easy.
-l know. lam sorry, Dad.

782
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,659
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.

783
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:50,556
-Yeah, well, about that...
-You look thin. Why is that?

784
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:54,338
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?

785
00:57:57,441 --> 00:58:00,100
It's tough out there in the big world
all alone, isn't it?

786
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:03,297
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.

787
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,090
-Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
-l can take care of myself.

788
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:09,886
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.

789
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:13,574
Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you...

790
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,551
-Visit?
-I will. l promise. Often.

791
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:21,334
-You're not staying?
-No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

792
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:24,342
You didn't think
l was going to stay forever, did you?

793
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:26,728
Eventually,
a bird's got to leave the nest.

794
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:29,093
We're not birds. We're rats.

795
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:32,053
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.

796
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,139
-Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
-Maybe you're not a rat at all.

797
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:36,512
Maybe that's a good thing.

798
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:38,886
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?

799
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,242
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.

800
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,808
I'm tired of taking.
l want to make things.

801
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:46,031
I want to add something to this world.

802
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,109
-You're talking like a human.
-Who are not as bad as you say.

803
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:51,933
-Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
-Oh, man.

804
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:58,282
I've been able to observe them
at a close-ish sort of range.

805
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,192
-Yeah? How close?
-Close enough.

806
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,761
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.

807
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:09,266
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.

808
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:13,388
You know, I'm going to stay here.

809
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:17,521
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.

810
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,835
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?

811
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,994
Is that a problem?

812
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,590
-No.
-Good boy. See you tomorrow.

813
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:35,588
We're here.

814
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,119
Take a good long look, Remy.

815
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,073
Now, this is what happens

816
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,421
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans.

817
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,816
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.

818
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,299
We must live carefully.

819
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,501
We look out for our own kind, Remy.

820
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:10,497
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.

821
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:17,922
-No.
-What?

822
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:24,464
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...

823
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:28,032
Can only be more of this?

824
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:33,162
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.

825
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:38,537
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.

826
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:42,413
And it starts when we decide.

827
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:47,125
-Where you going?
-With luck, forward.

828
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:12,734
Hey! Yeah.

829
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:12,014
Stop it.

830
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:47,609
Good morning.

831
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,256
Good morning.

832
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:56,482
So, the chef,
he invited you in for a drink?

833
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,447
That's big.

834
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:01,202
That's big. What did he say?

835
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:06,932
What?

836
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,444
What, you can't tell me?

837
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:15,851
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.

838
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:17,725
Oh, I see how it is.

839
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,304
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks

840
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,130
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?

841
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:24,856
Wake up. Wake up.

842
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,799
l thought you were different.

843
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,620
l thought you thought I was different.

844
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,103
l thought...

845
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:39,721
I didn't have to help you!

846
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,946
If l looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!

847
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:44,413
But...

848
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:49,495
l wanted you to succeed. I liked you.

849
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,167
My mistake.

850
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:56,964
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!

851
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,147
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.

852
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,120
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.

853
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,604
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.

854
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:09,631
At least not without your help.

855
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,935
l hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.

856
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:17,157
-You have talent.
-No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.

857
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:19,608
When I added that extra ingredient

858
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:22,412
instead of following the recipe
like you said,

859
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,788
that wasn't me either.

860
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,711
-What do you mean?
-l mean, I wouldn't have done that.

861
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,744
I would've followed the recipe.

862
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,236
I would've followed your advice.

863
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,141
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.

864
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:37,129
-Because I love your advice.
-But...

865
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:39,201
But I...

866
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:40,915
Don't do it.

867
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:44,077
Il have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.

868
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:49,400
-l have a...
-What? You...

869
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:53,543
-l have a...
-You have a rash?

870
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:58,820
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...

871
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:00,682
Little...

872
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:05,584
-A tiny chef who tells me what to do.
-A tiny chef?

873
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,455
Yes. Yes. He's...

874
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:13,357
-He's up here.
-In your brain?

875
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:18,755
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.

876
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,779
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.

877
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:28,644
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.

878
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,254
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?

879
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:33,408
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?

880
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,163
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!

881
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,026
No! No!

882
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,636
-What is it, Ambrister?
-Gusteau's.

883
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:31,602
-Finally closing, is it?
-No.

884
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:34,774
-More financial trouble?
-No, it's...

885
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,477
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?

886
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:39,504
What? What? Spit it out.

887
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,849
It's come back. It's popular.

888
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,760
-l haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
-No, sir.

889
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:52,267
My last review condemned it

890
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:53,849
-to the tourist trade.
-Yes, sir.

891
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:57,833
l said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history

892
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:01,758
"right alongside
another equally famous chef,

893
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:03,868
"Monsieur Boyardee."

894
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,057
Touché.

895
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:08,248
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.

896
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:11,435
-The last word.
-Yes.

897
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:13,915
Then tell me, Ambrister,

898
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,591
how could it be popular?

899
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:24,013
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

900
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:27,424
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.

901
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:28,991
He is Gusteau's son.

902
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:32,674
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!

903
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,419
The boy knows!

904
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:37,314
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.

905
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:41,656
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.

906
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:44,432
-String?
-Yes! Playing dumb.

907
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:46,637
-Taunting me with that rat.
-Rat?

908
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:48,486
Yes. He's consorting with it.

909
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,017
Deliberately trying to make me think
it's important.

910
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,624
-The rat.
-Exactly!

911
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,518
Is the rat important?

912
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,914
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.

913
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,401
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.

914
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,120
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
l order him to kill it.

915
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,769
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.

916
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,930
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!

917
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:16,129
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?

918
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:17,586
But, oh, no!

919
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:21,517
l refuse to be sucked into
his little game of...

920
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:30,064
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?

921
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,330
l can't fire him. He's getting attention.

922
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,742
If fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.

923
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,301
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.

924
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,130
What are you so worried about?

925
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:00,605
Isn't it good to have the press?

926
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,304
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?

927
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,265
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?

928
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,616
Not if they're over his face!

929
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:09,310
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

930
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:09,832
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

931
01:09:10,013 --> 01:09:14,372
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!

932
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:17,013
The deadline passes in three days.

933
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,933
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable

934
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,260
and no one will ever know.

935
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:25,199
l was worried
about the hair sample you gave me.

936
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:27,735
-l had to send them back to the lab.
-Why?

937
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:32,111
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.

938
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:39,453
-No, no, no.
-What?

939
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,729
Try this. It's better.

940
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:57,962
Well, because you...

941
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:23,335
Rat!

942
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,952
Disgusting little creatures.

943
01:10:42,105 --> 01:10:44,684
! was reminded how fragile it all was.

944
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,812
How the world really saw me.

945
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:52,452
And it just kept getting better.

946
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:53,581
Remy!

947
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,402
Remy!

948
01:10:58,054 --> 01:11:00,164
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!

949
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,756
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.

950
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:07,733
-Hey, Remy! How you doing?
-You told them?

951
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,817
Emile,
that's exactly what I said not to do!

952
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,817
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.

953
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:16,036
I didn't think you meant them.
Look, I'm sorry.

954
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:18,709
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.

955
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:23,118
-ls there a problem over here?
-No, there is not.

956
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,920
Wait here.

957
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,063
It's locked?

958
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:43,392
-Remy, what are you doing in here?
-Okay. Emile shows up with...

959
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,526
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...

960
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:50,014
Yeah, it's a disaster.

961
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:53,562
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.

962
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:58,013
-They want you to steal food?
-Yes. No! It's...

963
01:11:58,014 --> 01:11:58,274
-They want you to steal food?
-Yes. No! It's...

964
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:01,754
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.

965
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,628
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,

966
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,864
you think I'd be hawking barbecue
over here?

967
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:08,276
Or microwave burritos?

968
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:10,224
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?

969
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,110
About as French as a corn dog!

970
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:13,428
Coming soon!

971
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,333
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.

972
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:17,065
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?

973
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:18,826
I cannot control
how they use my image, Remy.

974
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:21,245
-lam dead!
-Can you guys shut up?

975
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:26,174
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If l can't keep them quiet,

976
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:29,646
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...

977
01:12:30,146 --> 01:12:31,045
Here it is.

978
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,397
Hey. Your will!

979
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:39,016
-Oh, this is interesting. Mind if...
-Not at all.

980
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:39,909

-Not at all.

984
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,925

lam a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?

Well, your son is the rightful owner

-Sorry, chef.
-The rat! It's stolen my documents!

-It's getting away!
-Hey, Mr. Chef!

1005
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:18,402
-You! Get out of my office.
-He's not in your office. You are in his.

01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,191
What is the secret to your genius?

1017
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:46,626
Secret? You want the truth?

1018
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:52,536
lam Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.

1019
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:55,359
But you weren't aware of that fact
until very recently.

1020
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:56,594
No.

1021
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:59,242
And it resulted in your
taking ownership of this restaurant.

1022
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:00,992
How did you find out?

1023
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:04,153
Well, some part of me just knew.

1024
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,257
The Gusteau part?

1025
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:11,893
-Where do you get your inspiration?
-Inspiration has many names.

1026
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,971
-Mine is named Colette.
-What?

1027
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,810
Something's stuck in my teeth.

1028
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,611
Health Inspector.

1029
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:26,183
I wish to report a rat infestation.

1030
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:29,749
It's taken over my...
Gusteau's restaurant.

1031
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,309
Gusteau's, eh?

1032
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:35,240
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.

1033
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:37,691
It must happen now!
It's a gourmet restaurant!

1034
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,573
Monsieur, have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.

1035
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,863
But the rat! You must...

1036
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:46,385
It stole my documents.

1037
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:51,527
-It's past opening time.
-He should have finished an hour ago.

1038
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,989
Bonjour, ma chérie, Join us.

1039
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:58,212
We were just talking
about my inspiration.

1040
01:17:58,574 --> 01:18:01,094
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.

1041
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,604
Not that, dearest. 1 meant you.

1042
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,703
-It's him.
-Ego?

1043
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:09,948
Anton Ego!

1044
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,295
Is that Ego?

1045
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:13,481
I can't believe it.

1046
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:16,692
-You are Monsieur Linguini?
-Hello.

1047
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:21,143
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,

1048
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:25,047
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance

1049
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:27,500
as you are new to this game.

1050
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,147
-Game?
-Yes.

1051
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:33,096
And you've been playing
without an opponent.

1052
01:18:33,576 --> 01:18:38,086
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.

1053
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,724
You're Anton Ego.

1054
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,511
You're slow
for someone in the fast lane.

1055
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,665
And you're thin
for someone who likes food.

1056
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:57,169
I don't like food. I love it.

1057
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:02,110
If 1 don't love it, 1 don't swallow.

1058
01:19:03,706 --> 01:19:07,186
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.

1059
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,570
Pray you don't disappoint me.

1060
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,240
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.

1061
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,507
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."

1062
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,132
Don't give me that look.

1063
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,330
You were distracting me
in front of the press.

1064
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:34,598
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?

1065
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:36,347
And that's another thing.

1066
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:39,155
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.

1067
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,888
Colette knows how to cook, too,
you know.

1068
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:43,621
All right, that's it!

1069
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,436
You take a break, Little Chef.

1070
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:50,832
I'm not your puppet,

1071
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:54,276
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!

1072
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:55,933
The rat is the cook.

1073
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:56,824
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1074
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,815
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1075
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:01,804
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!

1076
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:06,467
You stupid...

1077
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:12,011
Wow. I have never seen that before.

1078
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:15,878
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny
or something.

1079
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,623
I'm sorry, Remy.

1080
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:19,784
I know there are too many guys.

1081
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:20,865
- tried to limit...
-You know what?

1082
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,692
It's okay. I've been selfish.

1083
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,798
-You guys hungry?
-Are you kidding?

1084
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,764
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.

1085
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:29,213
-In fact...
-Yeah.

1086
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,160
..tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

1087
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:32,181
..tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

1088
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,835
Little Chef?

1089
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:48,666
This is great, Son.
An inside job. l see the appeal.

1090
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:27,410
Little Chef?

1091
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,460
Little Chef?

1092
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:31,751
Hey, Little Chef.

1093
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,977
I thought you went back
to the apartment.

1094
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:39,187
Then when you weren't there,
I don't know...

1095
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:43,568
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...

1096
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,770
Look, I don't want to fight.

1097
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,512
I've been under a lot of, you know,
pressure.

1098
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:52,968
A lot has changed
in not very much time, you know?

1099
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:54,585
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.

1100
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:59,003
And I got to be a Gusteau
or people will be disappointed.

1101
01:21:59,982 --> 01:22:01,382
It's weird.

1102
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,263
You know, I've never
disappointed anyone before,

1103
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,180
because nobody's
ever expected anything of me.

1104
01:22:07,623 --> 01:22:10,053
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now

1105
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:12,392
is because of you.

1106
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,786
l haven't been fair to you.

1107
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:19,138
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.

1108
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:21,258
You've been a good friend.

1109
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,330
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask...

1110
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:27,782
What is this?

1111
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,900
What's going on?

1112
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:39,308
You're stealing food? How could you?

1113
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,538
l thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!

1114
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,085
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!

1115
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:46,691
Don't come back

1116
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:50,002
or I'll treat you how restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!

1117
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,410
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?

1118
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,334
We are what we are, and we're rats.

1119
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:10,556
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.

1120
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:12,717
Steal all you want.

1121
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,568
-You're not coming?
-I've lost my appetite.

1122
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,676
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1123
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:37,295
Yes,
I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.

1124
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:44,622
Come in!

1125
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,830
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.

1126
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:51,723
-Like what?
-You are the boss. Inspire them.

1127
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,601
Attention. Attention, everyone.

1128
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,028
Tonight is a big night.

1129
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:05,904
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.

1130
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:10,054
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.

1131
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:13,856
And he's going to order something.

1132
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:16,596
Something from our menu.

1133
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:21,153
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

1134
01:24:21,757 --> 01:24:23,397
Just can't leave it alone, can you?

1135
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,915
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.

1136
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:28,542
I'm hungry!

1137
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:31,107
And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.

1138
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:34,223
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

1139
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:36,780
-Observe.
-No, wait!

1140
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:42,074
-Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
-I'll go get Dad.

1141
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:50,623
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.

1142
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:54,627
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.

1143
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:57,232
Sure it probably killed... Dad.

1144
01:24:57,826 --> 01:25:01,136
-This is very bad juju right here.
-But I'll say one thing...

1145
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:04,097
-Ego is here.
-Ego? He is here?

1146
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:10,095
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!

1147
01:25:10,706 --> 01:25:12,346
Yeah! Let's...

1148
01:25:13,008 --> 01:25:14,058
Okay.

1149
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:18,197
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.

1150
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:22,317
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.

1151
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:26,228
And I, in return, will not kill you.

1152
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:33,239
Au revoir, rat!

1153
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:43,176
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1154
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:44,945
Yes, I think I do.

1155
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:49,271
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,

1156
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:51,688
you know what I'm craving?

1157
01:25:53,015 --> 01:25:55,885
A little perspective.

1158
01:25:56,485 --> 01:26:00,934
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.

1159
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,117
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that?

1160
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:08,869
-With what, sir?
-Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

1161
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:10,584
lam...

1162
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:14,297
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective

1163
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:17,696
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town,

1164
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:19,546
I'll make you a deal.

1165
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:23,441
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.

1166
01:26:24,046 --> 01:26:27,586
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.

1167
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,763
I'm afraid I...

1168
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,767
Your dinner selection?

1169
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:38,946
Tell your Chef Linguini that 1 want
whatever he dares to serve me.

1170
01:26:39,628 --> 01:26:42,668
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.

1171
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:49,385
I will have whatever he is having.

1172
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:59,648
-So, we have given up.
-Why do you say that?

1173
01:27:00,282 --> 01:27:02,942
We are in a cage inside the car trunk

1174
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:06,068
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.

1175
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:09,931
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.

1176
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:12,806
You are free.

1177
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:16,285
lam only as free
as you imagine me to be.

1178
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:17,878
As you are.

1179
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:22,202
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.

1180
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:24,981
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.

1181
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:27,772
I pretend you exist
so l have someone to talk to!

1182
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:29,940
You only tell me stuff I already know!

1183
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:32,908
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?

1184
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:35,111
Why do I need to pretend?

1185
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:38,882
But you don't, Remy.

1186
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:41,318
You never did.

1187
01:27:50,499 --> 01:27:52,228
No. My other left!

1188
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,247
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!

1189
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:56,689
I'm inside the trunk! What the...

1190
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,142
Dad!

1191
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:01,127
-Hey, little brother!
-Emile!

1192
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,790
Il love you guys!

1193
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,047
Where are you going?

1194
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,505
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.

1195
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:16,051
-Why do you care?
-Because I'm a cook!

1196
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:25,779
It's your recipe.

1197
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:27,911
How can you not know
your own recipe?

1198
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:30,850
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.

1199
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,026
Then make it come to you again.
Because we can't serve this!

1200
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:35,359
Where's my order?

1201
01:28:35,577 --> 01:28:37,657
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?

1202
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:38,976
They're ordering this.

1203
01:28:39,214 --> 01:28:41,264
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.

1204
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,139
We cannot be out. We just opened.

1205
01:28:43,451 --> 01:28:46,081
l have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!

1206
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:48,425
We'll make it. Just tell us what you did.

1207
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:49,990
I don't know what I did.

1208
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:51,778
We need to tell
the customers something.

1209
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:53,763
Then tell them... Tell them...

1210
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:02,151
-Don't do it.
-Remy. Remy.

1211
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:04,317
Don't! Stop! They'll see you. Stop.

1212
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:08,675
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...

1213
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:08,727
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...

1214
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:09,960
Rats!

1215
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:13,217
-Remy!
-Get my knife.

1216
01:29:13,882 --> 01:29:15,312
Don't touch him!

1217
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,899
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.

1218
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:23,509
I know this sounds insane, but...

1219
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:26,142
Well,
the truth sounds insane sometimes.

1220
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:30,130
But that doesn't mean it's not the truth.

1221
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:35,086
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.

1222
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:39,801
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.

1223
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:44,855
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.

1224
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:48,064
He's been controlling my actions.

1225
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:52,948
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.

1226
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:56,308
The reason Ego is outside that door.

1227
01:29:56,925 --> 01:29:59,385
You've been giving me credit
for his gift.

1228
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:01,394
I know it's hard to believe.

1229
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:04,306
But, hey, you believed I could cook,
right?

1230
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:10,061
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.

1231
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:13,209
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris,

1232
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:18,388
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.

1233
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:21,891
What do you say? You with me?

1234
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:11,008
Dad.

1235
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:17,839
Dad, I don't know what to say.

1236
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,940
Il was wrong about your friend
and about you.

1237
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:26,237
I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.

1238
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:29,338
I can't choose
between two halves of myself.

1239
01:32:29,778 --> 01:32:33,148
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.

1240
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:36,424
This really means that much to you?

1241
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:47,335
We're not cooks, but we are family.

1242
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:50,526
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.

1243
01:32:54,836 --> 01:32:55,686
City of Paris - Ministry of Public Health
Health Inspector Dist. 5

1244
01:32:58,873 --> 01:33:02,062
-Stop that health inspector.
-Delta Team, go, go, go, go!

1245
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,580
The rest of you stay and help Remy.

1246
01:33:21,496 --> 01:33:22,546
EMPLOYEES
MUST WASH HANDS!

1247
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:29,803
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1248
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:31,234
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1249
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:36,419
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!

1250
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:39,567
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.

1251
01:33:49,591 --> 01:33:51,321
We need someone to wait tables.

1252
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:09,501
I'm sorry for any delay,
but we're a little short tonight.

1253
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:11,968
Please, take all of the time you need.

1254
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,696
He came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he...

1255
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,373
Make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized.

1256
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:26,809
Work it. Stick and move.
Stick and move.

1257
01:34:27,195 --> 01:34:30,295
Easy with that sole meuniére.
Less salt. More butter.

1258
01:34:30,932 --> 01:34:32,602
Only use the mimolette cheese.

1259
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:36,156
Whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.

1260
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:39,114
Not too much vinaigrette
on that salade composée.

1261
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:42,261
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.

1262
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:46,470
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.

1263
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:49,232
Good. Too much salt. Good.

1264
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:52,267
Don't boil the consommé,
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!

1265
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:53,680
Sorry.

1266
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:59,325
Colette, wait! Colette.

1267
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:03,568
-You came back. Colette...
-Don't say a word.

1268
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:05,535
If l think about it,
I might change my mind.

1269
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:08,003
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.

1270
01:35:11,406 --> 01:35:13,596
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.

1271
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:16,652
Are you sure
you want to serve this to Ego?

1272
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:39,476
What? I am making ratatouille.
Well, how would you prepare it?

1273
01:36:13,034 --> 01:36:15,813
Ratatouille? They must be joking.

1274
01:37:07,088 --> 01:37:08,638
No, it can't be.

1275
01:37:09,457 --> 01:37:12,647
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!

1276
01:37:20,101 --> 01:37:21,531
I can't remember the last time

1277
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,736
l asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef.

1278
01:37:26,107 --> 01:37:28,567
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

1279
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:30,850
of having my waiter be the chef.

1280
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:33,892
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.

1281
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:37,486
Then who do I thank for the meal?

1282
01:37:38,653 --> 01:37:40,143
Excuse me a minute.

1283
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:52,236
You must be the chef.

1284
01:37:52,467 --> 01:37:56,246
If you wish to meet the chef, you must
wait until all other customer have gone.

1285
01:37:58,806 --> 01:37:59,826
So be it.

1286
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:23,882
At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.

1287
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:29,619
But as Linguini explains,
Ego's smile disappears.

1288
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:39,513
He doesn't react
beyond asking an occasional question.

1289
01:38:40,548 --> 01:38:44,388
And when the story is done,
Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...

1290
01:38:45,019 --> 01:38:46,479
Thank you for the meal.

1291
01:38:46,788 --> 01:38:49,308
..and leaves without another word.

1292
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:55,386
The following day his review appears.

1293
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:01,999
In many ways,
the work of a critic is easy.

1294
01:39:02,703 --> 01:39:06,423
We risk very little,
yet enjoy a position over those

1295
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:10,611
who offer up their work
and their selves to our judgment.

1296
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:16,065
We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.

1297
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:22,991
But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,

1298
01:39:23,891 --> 01:39:27,401
the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful

1299
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:30,865
than our criticism designating it so.

1300
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:35,262
But there are times
when a critic truly risks something

1301
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:39,650
and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new.

1302
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:44,314
The world is often unkind
to new talent, new creations.

1303
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:47,249
The new needs friends.

1304
01:39:47,849 --> 01:39:50,949
Last night,
! experienced something new,

1305
01:39:51,586 --> 01:39:55,946
an extraordinary meal
from a singularly unexpected source.

1306
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:59,067
To say that both the meal
and its maker

1307
01:39:59,494 --> 01:40:02,563
have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking

1308
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:05,467
is a gross understatement.

1309
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:09,010
They have rocked me to my core.

1310
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:13,177
In the past, 1 have made no secret
of my disdain

1311
01:40:13,708 --> 01:40:18,067
for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."

1312
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:24,429
But I realize only now
do truly understand what he meant.

1313
01:40:25,486 --> 01:40:28,946
Not everyone
can become a great artist,

1314
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:33,334
but a great artist
can come from anywhere.

1315
01:40:34,462 --> 01:40:37,332
It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins

1316
01:40:37,832 --> 01:40:41,232
than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteau's,

1317
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:44,291
who is, in this critic's opinion,

1318
01:40:44,739 --> 01:40:48,459
nothing less
than the finest chef in France.

1319
01:40:49,176 --> 01:40:51,044
! will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

1320
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:54,085
! will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

1321
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,751
It was a great night.
The happiest of my life.

1322
01:40:58,352 --> 01:40:59,586
But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability.

1323
01:40:59,587 --> 01:41:00,887
CLOSED

1324
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:01,708
CLOSED

1325
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:03,032
FOR VIOLATION OF FRENCH
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODES

1326
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:05,781
Well, we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose,

1327
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:08,370
and of course they ratted us out.

1328
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:10,460
The food didn't matter.

1329
01:41:10,765 --> 01:41:12,845
Once it got out
there were rats in the kitchen,

1330
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:15,044
oh, man, the restaurant was closed.

1331
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:17,803
Ego lost his job and his credibility.

1332
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:19,938
But don't feel too bad for him.

1333
01:41:20,274 --> 01:41:23,344
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.

1334
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:26,361
-He seems very happy.
-How do you know?

1335
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:36,724
Got to go. Dinner rush.

1336
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:46,025
You know how he likes it.

1337
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,005
Thanks, Little Chef.

1338
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:02,370
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1339
01:42:02,817 --> 01:42:05,567
-Don't you always?
-Which one would you like?

1340
01:42:07,088 --> 01:42:08,697
Surprise me.

1341
01:42:14,328 --> 01:42:17,348
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1342
01:42:21,235 --> 01:42:24,455
Hey, believe me, that story
gets better when I tell it, okay?

1343
01:42:26,807 --> 01:42:29,527
Come on. Bring some food over here,
we're starving!
