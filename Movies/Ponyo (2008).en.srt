Okay.

15
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,576
A goldfish...

16
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,734
It's stuck.

17
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,539
That was weird.

18
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,171
Ow!

19
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,702
Is it dead?

20
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,764
It licked me...it's alive.

21
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,939
Sosuke, we're leaving!

22
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,689
Lisa, 1 caught a goldfish!

23
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,429
This wind feels strange...
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!

24
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,089
Did you find her?

25
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,566
What, captured by a human?

26
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,332
This is bad...very bad.

27
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,401
Are you dead?

28
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,981
You're alive!

29
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,968
Sosuke! I'm going to be late!

30
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,499
Lisa! l caught a goldfish.

31
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,315
A goldfish?

32
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,734
Down by the rocks.

33
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,829
I'm sorry, but you can't
use weed killer here.

34
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:53,975
Heavens no! This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.

35
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,154
As long as
it's not weed killer.

36
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,124
Good day!

37
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,107
This is very bad.

38
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,617
What a creepy guy.

39
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,776
But don't you say that
about strangers, Sosuke.

40
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,563
I won't.

41
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,091
Are you taking
that to school?

42
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,685
Won't the teacher complain?

43
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,464
Don't worry,
I'll take care of you.

44
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,404
She's cute!

45
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,032
They're using the dry dock.

46
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,079
Here, eat this
before we get there.

47
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,330
Maybe she's hungry.

48
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,576
Want some?

49
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,125
Hey, my cut is gone!

50
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,067
I'm going to call her Ponyo.

51
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,771
She's really special!
She can do magic.

52
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,151
She fixed my cut.

53
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,391
Want some ham?

54
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,091
- Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!
- That makes two of us.

55
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,445
Oh no...

56
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,776
Disgusting!

57
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,831
Hurry, Lisa!

58
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,238
Such filth! Intolerable!

59
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,890
Good morning!

60
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,145
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.

61
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,695
- I'll drop you here.
- Okay.

62
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:55,994
Have fun.

63
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,632
See you.

64
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,488
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.

65
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,439
Could you get
Noriko's wheelchair?

66
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,711
Good morning, Sosuke.

67
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,482
I'm busy, Yoshie.
Talk to you later.

68
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,035
My!

69
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,613
Hello, Sosuke.

70
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,005
Can't talk now, Toki.

71
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,721
Maybe the teacher
will get mad.

72
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,879
I know!

73
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,421
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.

74
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,150
What if a cat comes?

75
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,275
Stay here, I'll be right back.

76
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,160
See you later.

77
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,198
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.

78
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,101
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

79
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,214
Good morning, teacher.

80
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,676
Hello Sosuke.

81
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,263
How are you?

82
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,524
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko...

83
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,799
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.

84
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,293
Oh...

85
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,087
Let's play, Sosuke!

86
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,246
Not now. I'm busy.

87
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:46,978
How come?

88
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,376
- l told you, I'm busy.
- You're no fun.

89
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,910
Yeah!

90
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,863
Ponyo!

91
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,665
Sosuke!

92
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:24,943
Kumiko...

93
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,501
What's that?

94
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,629
You're not supposed to
bring stuff.

95
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,855
But these trees
aren't on school grounds.

96
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,596
Show me.

97
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,318
Oh, a goldfish.

98
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,653
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.

99
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,049
Ponyo? I want to see!

100
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,442
Promise not to tell?

101
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,909
I promise.

102
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,837
Isn't she cute?

103
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,809
It looks fat.
My goldfish is lots cuter.

104
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:26,512
It's Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.

105
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,703
I'll give you
some more water.

106
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:55,934
Ponyo!

107
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:03,958
You scared me.

108
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:14,402
Why, how add.
That was Sosuke's voice.

109
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,605
But he's supposed
to be in school.

110
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,196
I must be hearing things.

111
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,562
Here I am, Yoshie.

112
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,708
I knew I heard your voice.

113
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,297
Do I have a secret?

114
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,495
Yes!

115
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,050
Bingo!

116
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,795
Okay, what color is my secret?

117
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,387
- Red!
- Red!

118
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,833
Good guess.

119
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,155
How'd you know?

120
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,664
Show us.

121
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,229
All right.

122
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,183
Oh, how pretty!

123
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,833
Very cute!

124
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,279
Her name is Ponyo.

125
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,584
She loves ham
and she can do magic.

126
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,015
I cut my thumb,
but she fixed it.

127
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,928
I wonder if she'd
fix our legs.

128
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,021
We could run around
just like you.

129
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,243
Well. I'd have
a
to ask Ponyo first.

130
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,716
Can I take a look?

131
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,232
Sure, Toki.

132
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,692
Heavens, it has a face!

133
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:34,373
Put it back
before it brings a tsunami!

134
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,340
You're so superstitious, Toki.

135
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,160
That's what
the old stories say.

136
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,441
Fish like that are bad luck.

137
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,175
The tsunami! It's here!

138
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,443
The tsunami is here!

139
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,250
What's wrong, Toki?

140
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,698
Just look at my clothes!

141
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,145
Sosuke!

142
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,088
Sosuke!

143
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,920
Sosuke!

144
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,692
Come back here and apologize!

145
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,647
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

146
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,178
Sosuke.

147
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,251
Sosuke.

148
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,637
Ponyo!

149
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,304
Ponyo. Sosuke.

150
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,957
Ponyo...loves...

151
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,198
... Sosuke!

152
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,233
I love you too.

153
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,168
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

154
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,438
Ponyo!

155
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,384
Ponyo!

156
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,828
Ponyo!

157
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,735
Sosuke!

158
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,888
Ponyo!

159
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:19,472
Listen, Sosuke.
Maybe it was fate.

160
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,952
It just can't be helped.

161
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,892
Ponyo was born in the sea.

162
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,043
She went back home,
a
that’s all.

163
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,210
Anyway, let's hope
that creepy guy is gone.

164
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,538
One lick?

165
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,040
Hurry, it's melting!

166
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,815
Not bad!

167
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,054
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.

168
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,246
He'll be disappointed
if you're feeling down.

169
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,905
No more ocean today, okay?

170
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,815
Sosuke?

171
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,206
Time to come inside.

172
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,839
Do you think this bucket
will help Ponyo find us?

173
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,521
There's only one way
to find out.

174
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,201
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi.

175
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,060
Hello?

176
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,868
Yes. it's me.
a

177
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,551
Yes, {'m fine.

178
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,700
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.

179
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,454
Okay. Here's Lisa.

180
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,875
Koichi? Yes...
What?!

181
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,958
Can't you get out of it?

182
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,677
Fine...leave your wife
and son up on the cliff!

183
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,741
I give up!

184
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,650
Why bother?

185
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,158
C'mon Sosuke,
let's eat out!

186
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,042
I want te eat here.

187
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,909
There he is!

188
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,610
Turn off the lights, Lisa.

189
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,400
It's Sosuke! He's a genius.
Only five years old.

190
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,620
Your wife must be upset.

191
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:08,553
He says he’s sorry.

192
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:09,814
da.

193

LOVE AND KISSES

225
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,614
Dor't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.

226
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:29,031
I promised Ponyo
I'd take care of her.

227
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,607
I hope she isn't crying.

228
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:43,111
Okay, let's cheer up!

229
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,753
“I'm happy as can be...”

230
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,149
Ow!

231
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,764
Don't worry, Sosuke.

232
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,809
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.

233
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,539
Now let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!

234
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,216
This is all my fault.

235
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,584
Bringing you along
to watch me was a mistake.

236
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,849
How often have I
warned you about humans?

237
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,480
Their very breath is polluted.

238
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:25,968
Come, you must eat.

239
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,601
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?

240
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,004
l want ham!

241
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,199
Ham?! What on earth
have you been doing?

242
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:39,383
Answer me, Brunhilde!

243
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,741
My name's not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.

244
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,938
Ponyo?

245
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,437
Ponyo loves Sosuke.

246
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,589
I want to be human!

247
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,562
Human?

248
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,437
How could you love
such disgusting creatures?

249
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,021
They rob the sea of life.

250
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,652
l was human myself...once.

251
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,415
l finally escaped
that awful heritage.

252
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,170
I want hands!

253
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,840
I don't like this!

254
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,467
I want legs like Sosuke!

255
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,507
Of all the nonsense!

256
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,947
Look at me!
Hands and feet!

257
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:44,045
No...don't tell me
you tasted human blood!

258
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:45,973
Wanna see Sosuke!

259
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,731
No! His blood has
deranged your DNA!

260
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,015
Revert...revert...

261
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,793
Go back...go back!

262
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,699
It's not working.
l need more power.

263
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,403
Let me out!

264
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:28,154
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!

265
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,506
Just like her mother...so strong.

266
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,189
She should remain
innocent and pure forever.

267
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,943
I can't hold her for long.

268
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,832
I need her mother’s help.

269
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,778
No! My elixir is
too strong for you!

270
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,274
Shoo! Go away!

271
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,440
My crab shields were weakening.

272
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,010
I nearly upset
Nature's balance.

273
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,465
I must stay calm.

274
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,560
When I think
of meeting HER again...!

275
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,360
This batch should be ready.

276
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,679
No leaks down here.

277
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,096
This door is loose.

278
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,076
I'll fix it later.

279
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,528
If even one creature
got in here...!

280
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:44,945
Superb!

281
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,199
I feel the ocean's power
in my very DNA.

282
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,168
When this well is full,
the Era of the Ocean will begin.

283
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,519
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian Era!

284
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,779
This revolting era
of Man will be over.

285
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,604
Better fix this door.

286
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,846
Teeth!

287
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,236
I'm going back to Sosuke!

288
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,445
A waterspout?

289
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,680
Captain, look there!

290
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:24,166
- Tsunami!
- Turn her into the waves!

291
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,907
What's that?

292
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,364
Captain!
Radio's out. the radar too!
a

293
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:42,464
A little girl?
She must be Sosuke's age!

294
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,787
- Bye-bye.
- See you tomorrow.

295
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,244
- Thanks.
- Take care.

296
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,417
Do you want
to wait here for Lisa?

297
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:06,715
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.

298
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:08,632
Goodbye.

299
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,680
Be careful out there.

300
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:56,311
Sorry, Sosuke.
The power's out.

301
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,573
The door wouldn't open, would it?
Was the school okay?

302
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,264
Go home. Lisa.
a
We'll be fine.

303
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:04,998
Are you sure?

304
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,643
Don't worry,
we'll be just fine.

305
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,749
We're spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.

306
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,769
Wait for me, Sosuke.

307
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,810
Yoshie.

308
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:35,112
Why, Sosuke.
It's so dark, I didn't see you.

309
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,997
This is for you.

310
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,145
My, what is it?

311
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,064
One for you, Noriko.

312
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,692
Thank you.

313
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,188
Can't see a thing.

314
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,127
This is such foolishness!

315
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,220
I don’t want
to spend the night.

316
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:03,136
- Oh good, the power's on.
- It's a goldfish!

317
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,968
Maybe Sosuke's magic
made the lights go on?

318
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,066
Extremely powerful...
Micro-typheoon...

319
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,752
Ships should exercise
extreme caution...

320
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,020
This TV is useless.

321
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,785
Those idiots couldn't forecast
their way out of a paper bag.

322
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:24,257
You should go home, Sosuke.

323
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:29,519
Your goldfish will bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.

324
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,259
Here's yours, Toki.

325
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,988
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?

326
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:48,462
Like this.

327
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,899
I know!
It's a Grasshopper.

328
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,171
No, the Koganei Maru.

329
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,696
That's your father's ship.

330
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,413
Still looks like
a Grasshopper.

331
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,475
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.

332
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,052
Goodbye, everybody.

333
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,395
Goodbye.

334
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,431
Don't let the wind
blow you away!

335
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,254
Climb over.

336
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,771
The phones are out too.

337
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,239
The sea is puffed up!

338
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,562
Will the ships sink?

339
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:01,335
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.

340
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:16,651
- l see fish, Lisa.
- Seat belt!

341
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,902
You've got to turn back!

342
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,581
People are going
to the shelters.

343
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:37,071
But there are people
at the senior center!

344
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,215
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.

345
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,746
I've Just got to get home.

346
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,489
You'd better go
around the mountain.

347
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,482
Here we go, Sosuke.

348
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:55,355
No! Stop!

349
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,390
Look out for that wave!

350
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:03,864
Here it comes!

351
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,318
Run for it, Lisa!

352
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,203
- The fish are following us.
- Seat belt. Sosuke!
a

353
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:04,761
Hold on tight!

354
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,701
That wave won't quit!

355
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:12,846
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.

356
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,542
Where?

357
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:29,913
The sea keeps rising.

358
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,398
Where did you see her?

359
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,127
Running on top of a fish.

360
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:36,653
A fish!?

361
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:42,542
Come on, Sosuke.

362
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:01,683
Hang on, Sosuke!
We're almost home.

363
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:57,617
A little girl!

364
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,754
Here, you'd better
come with us.

365
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,355
Stay there, Sosuke.

366
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,846
Sosuke, do you know her?

367
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:53,603
Ponyo?

368
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,652
Yes. it's me!
a

369
00:49:57,261 --> 00:49:58,750
It's you!

370
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,827
Ponyo’s a little girl now, Lisa!

371
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,343
I made it!

372
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,586
Now listen, children.

373
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:42,192
No matter how strange
everything seems...

374
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,500
...we have to stay calm.

375
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,350
Now be good.

376
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,388
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.

377
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:56,201
Here Ponyo, you hold the light.

378
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,975
I'll bring you a towel.

379
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,531
C'mon, Ponyo!

380
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,861
It smells just like you!

381
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:29,663
Ouch!

382
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:30,737
Ponyo!

383
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,923
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.

384
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,397
Such pretty red hair!

385
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:49,949
But your clothes are dry...

386
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:54,154
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.

387
00:51:58,382 --> 00:51:59,932
like this!

388
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,264
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?

389
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,877
Help me with the light, Ponyo.

390
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,527
Coming!

391
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,038
Think we'll have water?

392
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,247
Sure!

393
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:12,642
Sure!

394
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,299
Water!

395
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,060
Water!

396
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:21,246
We have a tank outside.

397
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,180
What about the gas?

398
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:26,729
Presto!

399
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:27,821
All right!

400
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,015
All right!

401
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,029
It's propane.

402
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,467
Okay, take your seats.

403
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,570
Okay!

404
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,525
Over here, Ponyo.

405
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,932
Sit down, like this.

406
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,940
Put your stuff down.

407
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:55,835
You need your hands.

408
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:57,633
I have feet!

409
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:01,921
Wow!

410
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,965
What are you two doing?

411
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,911
Her feet are like hands.

412
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,083
There you go.

413
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:39,982
This is the best!

414
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,265
That hit the spot.

415
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:33,915
What shall we do now?

416
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:36,045
l want ham!

417
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,403
She's crazy about ham.

418
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,953
Then let's eat.

419
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,029
But first let's start
the generator.

420
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,560
We need electricity
to talk to Keichi.

421
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:53,238
Koichi is my father.

422
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,180
Is he a bad sorcerer?

423
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:58,546
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.

424
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,330
What about your father, Ponyo?

425
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:04,562
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.

426
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,769
l ran away.

427
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:10,973
What about your mother?

428
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:14,234
I love my mother!

429
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,252
She's really scary.

430
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:18,925
Sounds like Lisa.

431
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:25,828
Can you help me, Ponyo?

432
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,472
Maybe the fuel's too old?

433
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,425
ls it clogged?

434
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:47,732
Clogged.

435
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:50,035
It's clogged there.

436
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,465
Success!

437
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,540
All bright!

438
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,140
Wow, Ponyo!

439
00:56:30,354 --> 00:56:31,874
Antenna! Antenna!

440
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,852
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?

441
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:38,587
I can't see a single light.

442
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,267
So loud!

443
00:56:58,749 --> 00:56:59,598
What's wrong?

444
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:03,054
Even the radio
is out of whack.

445
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:08,214
This is JA4LL...JA4LL.

446
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:10,636
Come in, Koichi.

447
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:14,714
It's Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.

448
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,593
We're going to have dinner.

449
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:20,569
Ham!

450
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:32,913
Ready? Careful, it's hot.

451
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:50,064
It's not ready yet.

452
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,261
It takes three minutes.

453
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:08,751
Close your eyes!

454
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,417
Not yet!

455
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,661
No peeking, Ponyo.

456
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,376
Okay, you can look now.

457
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:24,361
And...presto!

458
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:31,874
Ham!

459
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:33,571
Good for you, Ponyo.

460
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:56,945
Ponyo went to sleep.

461
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:06,461
Is her home far away?

462
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,627
I think it must be.

463
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,021
Look Sosuke.
The sea is calmer.

464
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,688
Because Ponyo's asleep?

465
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,610
Look over there!

466
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,859
It's moving.
Someone's up there.

467
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:44,226
People from
the senior center?

468
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:52,011
It's gone.

469
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:53,779
That's the peak road.

470
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,477
Sosuke, stay there
with Ponyo.

471
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:14,584
Maybe I could get through
on the mountain road.

472
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:20,171
I'm going to the senior center.

473
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,637
I'll go too.

474
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,799
Stay here with Ponyo.

475
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,218
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.

476
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,619
I'm going with you!

477
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:36,373
Sosuke, our house
is a lighthouse in the starm.

478
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:40,493
Everyone out there
is depending on us.

479
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:42,841
Someone has to stay here.

480
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,230
Lots of things are happening
that I don't understand.

481
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:52,895
But right now I'm worried about
the people at the senior center.

482
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:57,664
Just knowing you're
here will help me.

483
01:00:58,355 --> 01:01:00,965
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.

484
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:03,696
Promise?

485
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:06,465
I promise.

486
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,103
You promised!

487
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,632
I love you, Sosuke.

488
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,484
I see the lights of the town!

489
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,029
Finally...

490
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,110
Now we can navigate.

491
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:14,669
I've never seen
that town before.

492
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,197
Did the storm
blow us to America?

493
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:44,221
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor...

494
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:46,134
Those are ships!

495
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:59,063
The sea is piled up
into a mountain!

496
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:03,790
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?

497
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:10,589
We lost power!

498
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,517
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!

499
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:15,044
Aye-aye!

500
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:30,055
Something is coming!

501
01:03:58,268 --> 01:03:59,818
A sea goddess!?

502
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,513
The engine!

503
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:12,770
We're saved!

504
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,709
The engine started again.
It was Her!

505
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:19,349
Protect us from harm...

506
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,603
Come on, come on.

507
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:06,572
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?

508
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:27,317
Good heavens...she's human!

509
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,337
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?

510
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:42,106
Stop! This is unsafe!

511
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,707
Stop that at once!

512
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:57,580
I'm simply trying
to save your sister.

513
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,986
She's here.
She answered my call!

514
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:46,296
- Fujimoto...
- You came, my beloved.

515
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,240
Such a beautiful ocean.

516
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:57,665
So full of magic,
like my ancient Devonian sea.

517
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,754
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood...

518
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,967
..and plundered all of my elixir.

519
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,501
Ponyo...what a lovely name.

520
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,147
It's all my fault.

521
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,940
She's totally beyond my control.
It's complete chaos.

522
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,884
She doesn't understand
what she's done.

523
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:29,331
Now she's human, and she's
up there with her boyfriend!

524
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:33,947
If we don't stop her,
the planet is doomed!

525
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:45,693
No! The satellites are falling.

526
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:48,412
Earth's gravitational field...

527
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,526
Be still...

528
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:02,342
Sosuke...that is his name, yes?

529
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:09,618
You love your sister,
don't you?

530
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:16,836
Listen, dear...what if Ponyo
really became human?

531
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:19,621
Use the old magic.

532
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:24,219
If Sosuke's love is real,
she'll lose her powers forever.

533
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:29,018
But if it's not.
a
she'll turn to sea foam!

534
01:08:29,973 --> 01:08:33,343
That's where we all
came from, dear.
a

535
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,433
But he's only five!

536
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:45,335
Sleep well, little children.

537
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,791
Sosuke!

538
01:09:01,404 --> 01:09:02,484
Sosuke!

539
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:05,303
Ow!

540
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:09,571
Good morning, Ponyo.

541
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:12,225
Morning, Sosuke.

542
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,005
We almost got flooded.

543
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:48,287
- Where's Lisa?
- She must be stuck someplace.

544
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:51,407
I wish we had a boat.

545
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,264
There's a boat!

546
01:09:58,661 --> 01:09:59,711
We can't fit.

547
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,426
Can so.

548
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:18,373
Awesome!

549
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:23,113
The candle's bigger too.

550
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:24,759
We can fit.

551
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,134
This is cool.

552
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:27,629
Cool!

553
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:28,944
Grab that end.

554
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:33,952
Ready?

555
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,477
Ready!

556
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,205
She's seaworthy!

557
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,825
Awesome. No leaks!

558
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,391
Now we fill the boiler.

559
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:00,557
The water goes in here.

560
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:03,637
It goes in the boiler.

561
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,780
It's like a rocket!

562
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:41,456
Everything's shipshape.

563
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:43,171
Shipshape...

564
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,003
Shipshape?

565
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:45,908
Shipshape!

566
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:48,609
Shipshape! Shipshape!

567
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:13,018
Is it hot?

568
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:14,406
Hot!

569
01:12:19,302 --> 01:12:20,822
It's hot.

570
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,316
- The candle's burning.
- It's burning!

571
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:29,898
Hot hot hot!

572
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,560
It's hot.

573
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,840
Awesome!

574
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,326
We're shipshape, Sosuke!

575
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:58,519
This is great.

576
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,955
This is so much fun.

577
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,764
It's burning, Sosuke.

578
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,425
It's really hot.

579
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:18,734
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.

580
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,189
Okay, I'm the lookout.

581
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:49,797
There's a road.

582
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:51,876
That's the road Lisa took.

583
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:56,063
I don't see her.

584
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:59,652
You will.
She gave me her promise.

585
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,680
Ancient fish...
from the Devonian age!

586
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,050
There's Bothriolepis.

587
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,381
That one is...

588
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:17,636
Dipnorhynchus.

589
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,244
Dipnorhynchus!

590
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,612
That one's really huge.

591
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:23,648
That's Devonynchus.

592
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,960
Devonynchus!

593
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:34,558
Ahoy!

594
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:38,990
A boat!

595
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,642
Ahoy!

596
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,635
They're calling us.

597
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,628
Ahoy!

598
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:50,829
Ow!

599
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,330
Pretty good, huh?

600
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:04,665
Now, Ponyo.

601
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,950
Hello.

602
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,749
That's a wonderful
boat you have.

603
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:18,908
Why, you're Lisa's little boy.

604
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:21,772
He's not little. he's Sosuke.
a

605
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,624
This is Ponyo.

606
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,630
I was a fish before.

607
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,516
A fish?

608
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:31,162
Ponyo...that's a nice name.

609
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,399
Have you seen Lisa?

610
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:37,001
Lisa?

611
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:39,627
She's not with you?

612
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,109
She's at the center.

613
01:15:41,404 --> 01:15:42,604
The senior center...?

614
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:44,232
This is my baby.

615
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,623
Oh my, what happened?

616
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,342
Is that for us?

617
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:40,014
Give me the cup, dear.

618
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,151
Thank you.

619
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,289
Let's try it.

620
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:53,834
It's delicious!

621
01:16:54,677 --> 01:16:56,347
Lisa made it.

622
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,152
It's for the baby.

623
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:03,441
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.

624
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,830
But this will help me
make milk for him.

625
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:12,549
Lisa gave me her milk too.

626
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:16,269
Ponyo, may I have this soup?

627
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:18,439
Sure.

628
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:20,365
Thank you.

629
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:40,927
People from the town.
It's like a festival.

630
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:45,710
You there!
Do you need assistance?

631
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:50,919
Thanks, we're okay right now!

632
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:54,284
Then please follow us.

633
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,383
We're going to
the hotel on the peak.

634
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,557
Okay! Will do.

635
01:18:02,478 --> 01:18:03,738
The whole town's here.

636
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:06,333
l hope everyone's all right.

637
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:09,889
- Let's go, Ponyo.
- Hold on a second.

638
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:16,875
Milk!

639
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,223
Oh my...

640
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,359
Milk!

641
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,820
She ate up all the ham.

642
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:26,816
This will help me
make good milk.

643
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:31,033
Can you use another candle
for your boat, Sosuke?

644
01:18:31,674 --> 01:18:34,604
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.

645
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:36,908
Be careful!

646
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,609
Thank you both!

647
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:46,157
What is it, dear?

648
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,233
Don't cry.

649
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:12,913
Ponyo!

650
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:27,204
Sosuke!

651
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:31,885
Where's Lisa?
Isn't she with you?

652
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:35,311
I'm going to pick her up.

653
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:38,931
So she survived that wave?

654
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:42,118
Sosuke, take me with you!

655
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:45,215
Later, Kumiko.
I'm busy now.

656
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:48,804
Everyone from the center
evacuated to the park.

657
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:51,348
- Keep safe!
- You can do it!

658
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:55,307
We'll send a boat
for them later.

659
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:57,951
Good luck, captain!

660
01:20:47,276 --> 01:20:49,796
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.

661
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:56,762
We're okay.
I have another one.

662
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,530
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

663
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,334
Bye-bye.

664
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:12,425
Can you make this candle bigger?

665
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,325
All right.

666
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:22,562
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?

667
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:31,165
Ponyo!

668
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:48,729
Ponyo! Ponyo!

669
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:49,032
Good...it's shallow enough to walk.

670
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:17,114
A road!

671
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:31,081
It's shrinking!

672
01:23:32,908 --> 01:23:34,138
Ponyo!

673
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:57,911
Ponyo, wake up!

674
01:24:00,836 --> 01:24:02,386
Sosuke...

675
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,820
Don't scare me.

676
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,902
I thought you were
turning into a fish.

677
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:26,397
Lisa's car!

678
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:28,829
Ponyo, that's her car!

679
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:34,581
Lisa!

680
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:38,992
Lisa!

681
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,631
Lisa!

682
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,535
Lisa!

683
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:59,092
Lisa!

684
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:03,429
Lisa!

685
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,147
Here's your boat.

686
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:37,175
Your eyes are wet.

687
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,968
Let's find Lisa.

688
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:36,008
- You forgot your wrap!
- Who needs it?

689
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,681
Look. it's a whale!
a

690
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:44,825
- My knees don't hurt anymore!
- What were we so afraid of?

691
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:48,624
- Is this the Other Side?
- Who cares? It's wonderful.

692
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:54,096
Attention, please!
Gather round.

693
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:55,916
Coming!

694
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,671
Shall we?

695
01:27:00,115 --> 01:27:01,865
It's so nice to run.

696
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,054
Meet you there!

697
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:09,156
The winner!

698
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,450
You're so fast, Kayo.

699
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:15,986
Quiet, everyone!

700
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,054
The moment
of truth is at hand.

701
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:21,738
Sosuke and Ponyo
are almost here.

702
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:23,430
It's so romantic.

703
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:27,428
- Will love triumph?
- I'm so excited!

704
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:30,457
Quiet!

705
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:35,316
Very soon, you will bear witness
to a sacred trial of love.

706
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:41,189
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not
up to something, are you?

707
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,532
Nonsense, he's her father.

708
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:48,843
They'll be fine...
if she doesn't wake up.

709
01:27:49,531 --> 01:27:51,021
Now excuse me!

710
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:01,561
I'd like to believe him...

711
01:28:01,977 --> 01:28:04,117
Where's Lisa gone to?

712
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:08,739
She's been talking with
Ponyo's mother for ages.

713
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:19,609
l hope she's okay.

714
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,340
What are they talking about?

715
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:25,138
Let's find out. Lisa!

716
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,440
Lisa!

717
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:40,529
We're all rooting
for Sosuke and Ponyo!

718
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:55,746
Lisa!

719
01:28:56,031 --> 01:28:59,101
- You must be worried.
- Sosuke will be just fine.

720
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,978
He's a strong little boy.

721
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:06,431
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.

722
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:17,313
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.

723
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:28,217
“STOP”

724
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:35,067
I've been here before.

725
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:37,428
Ponyo?

726
01:29:37,973 --> 01:29:39,673
I don't like this place.

727
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:45,858
Don't let go of my hand.

728
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,255
Ponyo!

729
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:45,422
Ponyo!

730
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:54,765
Ponyo!

731
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:18,858
Please don't die!

732
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:21,063
Ponyo!

733
01:31:22,077 --> 01:31:24,247
Wake up, Ponyo!

734
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:26,959
Let her sleep.

735
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:30,080
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.

736
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:33,382
Lisa and the old ladies
are waiting too.

737
01:31:34,756 --> 01:31:35,656
Lisa?!

738
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:39,011
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.

739
01:31:42,197 --> 01:31:44,597
Let's not wake her.

740
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:46,965
Sosuke!

741
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:50,152
Don't listen to him!

742
01:31:51,106 --> 01:31:53,976
He tricked everyone
into going with him.

743
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,209
Toki!

744
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:57,143
But he couldn't fool me!

745
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:03,039
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?

746
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,952
If the Moon comes
any closer, we're finished!

747
01:32:07,756 --> 01:32:10,416
Is that the best
you can do?

748
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:13,369
Sosuke, come here!

749
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:16,882
Listen to me. Sosuke.
a
You're the planet's last hope.

750
01:32:17,432 --> 01:32:19,132
Don't make me use force.

751
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:21,855
Ponyo!

752
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,881
Is this how you
treat your father?

753
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:34,157
Ponyo!

754
01:32:34,449 --> 01:32:36,728
Run, Sosuke!

755
01:32:37,185 --> 01:32:39,145
You don't understand!

756
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:45,952
You can make it!

757
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:49,492
Jump!

758
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,110
Now what?

759
01:34:25,193 --> 01:34:26,013
Lisa!

760
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:27,311
Sosuke!

761
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:28,715
Ponyo!

762
01:34:33,902 --> 01:34:37,002
- Look over there.
- Where are we?

763
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:49,684
So, you are Sosuke.

764
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:53,081
Hello. Are you
Ponyo's mother?

765
01:34:53,755 --> 01:34:54,575
Yes.

766
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:59,139
I want to thank you for bringing
my daughter back to me.

767
01:35:00,328 --> 01:35:05,128
Ponyo wanted to be like you,
but she unleashed a terrible power.

768
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:10,268
To become human, she must be loved...

769
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:13,452
..for who she really is.

770
01:35:14,309 --> 01:35:17,879
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?

771
01:35:18,613 --> 01:35:19,463
Yes.

772
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:23,193
Your blood made her human...almost.

773
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:24,668
That's right!

774
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:27,959
Ponyo licked
my cut and made it better.

775
01:35:28,523 --> 01:35:30,633
So that's why she changed!

776
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:35,246
Can you accept her as she is?

777
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:37,840
I'll always love Ponyo...

778
01:35:38,266 --> 01:35:40,486
...whether she's a fish. a human...
a

779
01:35:40,935 --> 01:35:43,045
..or in between.

780
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:58,764
Come, Ponyo.

781
01:36:13,334 --> 01:36:17,554
Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

782
01:36:20,975 --> 01:36:24,195
But first, you must
.
give up your powers.

783
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:26,639
Can you do that?

784
01:36:37,058 --> 01:36:40,308
Kiss this bubble
when you return to land...

785
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:44,735
..and Ponyo
will be a little girl.

786
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:50,089
Way to go, Ponyo!

787
01:36:51,072 --> 01:36:53,412
Thank you, Ponyo’s mother!

788
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:02,740
Now the planet is safe again.

789
01:37:06,354 --> 01:37:08,194
Splendid, Sosuke!

790
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,152
Sosuke!

791
01:37:40,288 --> 01:37:41,897
I'm grateful, Lisa.

792
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:44,863
Thank you, Gran Mamare.

793
01:37:56,604 --> 01:37:59,474
There you are!
Are you all right?

794
01:38:04,846 --> 01:38:06,575
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.

795
01:38:06,948 --> 01:38:08,848
Don't bother, we'll walk.

796
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,390
It's all so exciting.

797
01:38:14,956 --> 01:38:16,476
I believe this is yours.

798
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:20,077
Thanks.

799
01:38:20,762 --> 01:38:24,222
I hope you'll
forgive me...may I?

800
01:38:30,438 --> 01:38:32,248
Take good care of her.

801
01:38:34,809 --> 01:38:36,479
It's Koichi!

802
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:42,725
Koichi!

803
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:49,447
It's Lisa!
And there's Sosuke!

804
01:38:52,193 --> 01:38:54,943
Look, Ponyo.
It's Koichi!

805
01:39:14,182 --> 01:39:16,148
We made this movie

806
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:19,250
We made this movie
Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, tiny little fish

807
01:39:19,821 --> 01:39:23,300
She's a little fish from the deep blue sea

Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, she’s a little girl

809

She's a little girl with a round tummy

810
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:43,414
Pitter-patter, hop-hop and jump

811
01:39:44,045 --> 01:39:47,325
Look, have legs! I'm gonna run!

812
01:39:48,216 --> 01:39:51,376
Squishy-squeeze, wave them around

813
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:55,516
Look, have hands! Let's hold them now!

814
01:39:56,257 --> 01:39:59,536
When I'm skipping with him

815
01:40:00,261 --> 01:40:03,221
My heart does this dance

816
01:40:04,098 --> 01:40:07,608
Munch, munch! Kiss, hug!

817
01:40:08,536 --> 01:40:13,196
Oh he's my favorite little boy

Studio Ghibli

The End
