1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:03,783
Stop

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:25,957
"May 2002. Six months before Yan's death”

3
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,491
Know what "screwed up" means?

4
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,780
The first masseuse came in

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,670
She looked like Sam's dog

6
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,595
So I asked for a replacement

7
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,521
The new one was worse

8
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,024
She's the dead ringer of Sam

9
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,452
Just imagine

10
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,827
I simply couldn't swallow that

11
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,591
She dared to ask if she's pretty

12
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,773
Of course I said no

13
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,842
And she clawed me. So I called you

14
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,475
That's what's screwed up

15
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,006
And you wrecked the whole place

16
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,014
That's gonna cost me a fortune

17
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,417
So if a masseuse is ugly

18
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,039
you're screwed

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,277
How dare you swear at your boss?

20
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,948
Ouch

21
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:22,675
Yan

22
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,277
It's a small gig. Don't give me shit

23
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,964
You bitch that I give you no work

24
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,661
But crooks don't need to work

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,880
If you want work, why not be a cop?

26
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,188
Know why I only

27
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,436
take you under my wing?

28
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,002
It's because you're focused

29
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,059
It pays to be focused. Look at Sam

30
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,692
He's so focused, no?

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,390
As for what happened today

32
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,479
Don't let Sam know

33
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,516
After his wife died

34
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,426
he hates us horsing around

35
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,649
Gimme a break, would ya?

36
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,738
Are you done talking? Go inside

37
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,227
Hey, stop pushing me, officer

38
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,882
One shouldn't be like that. You're a cop

39
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,124
So are you gonna tell on me?

40
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,503
Enough

41
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:17,953
So are you gonna tell on me?

42
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,255
Go to hell

43
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,409
Cut it out

44
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,834
How dare you beat up your boss?

45
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,840
"October 2003. Ten months after Yan's death"

46
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,722
File number 10143

47
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,138
Regarding the deaths of officer Yan

48
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,455
and officer Billy

49
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,523
IA has made the following report

50
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,663
On November 26, 2002

51
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,363
Sr. Inspector Ming of IA

52
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,466
contacted undercover officer Yan

53
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,484
Tipped off by Yan

54
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,539
Ming toppled Sam's drug operation

55
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,173
together with the OCTB unit in West Kowloon

56
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:32,102
$60 million worth of cocaine was seized

57
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,956
On November 27, 2002

58
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,439
Ming met with Yan again

59
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,378
on the rooftop of FSC Center

60
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,654
Yan supplied intel on triad moles

61
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,009
You can't get away

62
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,677
Just wait and see

63
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,141
So you're planning to whack a cop?

64
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,597
know all about you and Sam

65
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,474
You've no choice. Come back with me

66
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:03,796
Drop your gun

67
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,049
What are you planning to do?

68
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,460
I just wanna get away

69
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,121
The foregoing testimony

70
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,392
was provided by Sr. Inspector Ming

71
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,365
The independent investigation

72
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,322
committee

73
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,323
unanimously believed the testimony

74
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,270
Ming's killings of Billy and Yan

75
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:43,686
have been ruled legal

76
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,351
It has been confirmed that

77
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,806
Billy was a mole sent by Sam

78
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,104
It's over at last

79
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,755
You guys believe me?

80
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,496
Anyway it's all over

81
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:02,112
Stay in Admin for now. OK?

82
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,007
Wait

83
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,276
Got it. Your parking space

84
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,072
Wait 3 more weeks. Yes

85
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,271
Bye

86
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:13,959
Sergeant Chan

87
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,371
Your uniform is ready

88
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,733
Drop by when you're free

89
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,421
If not, 1 can send it to you

90
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,395
Sure, no problem

91
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,364
Good. OK

92
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,433
Too bad Billy destroyed the CCTV

93
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,499
Or it wouldn't have dragged so long

94
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,371
Our bosses harp on accountability.

95
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,034
Lucky that we work together. So no red tapes

96
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,244
You can come back to IA next month

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,760
Exhausted?

98
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,725
Take a vacation with Mary

99
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,940
Hello

100
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,887
I'll sign the documents tomorrow

101
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,431
Sure

102
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,764
Yes

103
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,969
Everything can be separated

104
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,001
Everything except the baby

105
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,484
Sergeant Chan, your uniform's ready

106
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,292
If you're not free, I can send it

107
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,522
I can do that too

108
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,116
OK, wait for me. Bye

109
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,782
Have I done something wrong?

110
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,402
I feel like beating people up today

111
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:38,344
Why make such a scene, SP Yeung?

112
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,112
These Taiwanese are arms dealers

113
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,955
My appointment didn't show up

114
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,156
They're bored so I kept them company

115
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,737
Nothing wrong, huh?

116
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,538
Sure

117
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,639
work in the Security Wing

118
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,945
l hate guys coming here all spiffed out

119
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,526
You got so many men. Lend me a hand

120
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:11,987
Don't give me a hard time

121
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,133
That should make it easier

122
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,439
You wanna set me up?

123
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,562
Is it better now?

124
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,757
We've already written the report

125
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,634
Half a kilo. Minimum 8 to 10 years

126
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,937
Ask two kids to come back with me

127
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,547
That's what they're gonna say

128
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,631
They saw them take out some drugs

129
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,339
As good guys do, they beat them up

130
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,253
l'l give them

131
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,785
Good Citizen Awards

132
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,100
How about that?

133
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,483
Sounds good

134
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:18,811
Take them in

135
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:21,991
Be gentle

136
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,575
Sir. Sir, you can't go in

137
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,072
Yeung, don't go too far

138
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,884
All these years, you and me

139
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,492
You want me dead?

140
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,531
If I fall, you'll go down with me

141
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,200
Give me a chance, would you?

142
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,830
"One Month Later"

143
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,202
Delivery from OCTB?

144
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,232
I was transferred to IA yesterday

145
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,566
together with the coffee

146
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:35,871
Sit down

147
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,487
I've stopped drinking

148
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,082
I need pills to sleep lately

149
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,472
If take coffee, 1 can't sleep

150
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,728
Life is so unpredictable

151
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,454
l used to hate IA the most

152
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,516
And now I have to work here

153
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,461
You don't seem to like it here

154
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,420
I can transfer you elsewhere

155
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,157
Are you kidding?

156
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,366
I moved here because of you

157
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,065
The files are on your desk

158
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,188
The first file

159
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,309
This sarge killed himself in front of his ex-boss, Yeun:

160
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,778
IA is working on several big cases

161
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,318
Security deals with politics

162
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,398
Everything is classified there

163
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,120
They won't answer any questions

164
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,224
We found an envelope on the sarge's desk

165
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,324
There's a tape inside

166
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,646
It's a chat between him and Sam

167
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,556
It turns out he was Sam's mole too

168
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,555
Besides Chun

169
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,750
several officers also committed suicide or vanished

170
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,268
They are proved to be Sam's moles

171
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,565
After Sam's death

172
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,294
SP Leung suspects one of the moles
wants to clear his ass off

173
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,569
and kill everybody else

174
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,977
SP Leung ordered to dig out this guy ASAP

175
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,079
It's a close shave this morning

176
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,513
A package was delivered to SP Leung

177
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,638
Guess what's inside

178
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,455
Tapes of us supplying intel to Sam

179
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,283
Lucky that the sarge is one of us

180
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,929
How many more of us are there?

181
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,717
Including you, there are five

182
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,915
Ronald, this is Inspector Ming

183
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,669
I've left something at Admin

184
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,549
I've dug up something about Chun

185
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,575
He was in the Police Bowling Team

186
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,061
Wait

187
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,523
Inspector Ming, that's what you need

188
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:45,201
Good

189
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:45,604
I'm off to lunch now

190
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:46,675
Thanks

191
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,810
Go on

192
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,612
He used to go to SCAA for practice

193
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,327
He rented his place from JJ Investment Co

194
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,393
This company owns 3 big units

195
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,565
The owner is Shen, a Mainlander

196
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,370
I'l email you the info later

197
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,490
No, send them to me now

198
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:18,574
Inspector Ming

199
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,785
I'm Yeung from Security Wing

200
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,524
I applied for a parking space

201
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,459
Let me check

202
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,680
I waited a whole month

203
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,432
I don't wanna push you

204
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,814
But how much longer will it take?

205
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,442
Sorry, but I've moved back to IA

206
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,689
l know

207
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,254
But Admin asked me to contact you

208
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,921
It's approved last month

209
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,395
Your parking space is at B3A6

210
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,631
We couldn't reach you

211
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,584
I've taken a month off

212
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,986
IA was investigating me. You should know

213
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,472
I do

214
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,416
Well, investigating Admin today?

215
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,463
No. Just picking up a uniform

216
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,322
It's a sarge's uniform, Inspector

217
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,402
belonged to the sarge who killed himself in front of y«

218
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,326
I'll take it back for investigation

219
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,345
Wasn't the case closed already?

220
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,093
True, or your break isn't over yet

221
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,290
Thanks

222
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,191
You're welcome

223
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,885
B3A6

224
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,226
Have we met before?

225
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:32,994
I dunno

226
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,257
D'you know Shen?

227
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:42,298
Mind your own business

228
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,940
Inside Chun's locker

229
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,137
we found these photos

230
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,053
This guy is Shen

231
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,662
He used to be Sam's business partner

232
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,298
This other guy is SP Yeung

233
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,858
I think he is responsible for sarge's death

234
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,794
SP Leung could be Sam's man we're searching for

235
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:15,554
OK

236
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,065
OK. See you in an hour

237
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,831
You're so nice

238
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,704
You see him as soon as you're back

239
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,641
You're a nice guy too

240
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,492
Thanks to you

241
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,909
he could die as a cop

242
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,779
That's my duty.

243
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,530
I don't know why I helped him

244
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,910
I only knew him for 5 months or so

245
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,235
I've seen him 21 times in total

246
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,294
He's a good cop

247
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,759
Everyone would've helped him

248
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,658
Where're you going? I'll take you

249
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,205
I'm back

250
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,066
Let's start

251
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,023
There're no triads in China

252
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,706
What China needs is wealth

253
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,363
Triads are all life-and-death

254
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,363
Today, we're here to talk business

255
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,570
But I'm a real triad

256
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,485
No

257
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,960
To me, you're the best businessman

258
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,113
My brother said so too

259
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,043
We have a hundred mill to spend

260
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,449
We wanna invest in your business

261
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,953
We'll ask no questions

262
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,762
It's one country, two systems

263
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,248
As long as money breeds money

264
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,557
we'll let you run the show

265
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,890
You still believe in that?

266
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,862
We believe in our Mainland ties

267
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,162
You think a Hong Kong triad

268
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,300
can outlive a Mainland businessman?

269
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,013
Without my brother's connection

270
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,805
your business in China won't last

271
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,187
Sam, you're a Buddhist, right?

272
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,406
Glory to Amitabha

273
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,344
Is the feng shui good here?

274
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,736
The best in Hong Kong

275
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,224
I want a longevity tablet here

276
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,949
For which member of your family?

277
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,216
For my wife

278
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:00,145
She died half a year ago

279
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,553
And also for myself

280
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,789
Such a small gig, I'll handle it

281
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:12,778
A small gig?

282
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:13,595
A small gig

283
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,563
A small gig

284
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,151
If it's so small, let my men do it

285
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,014
We'll see how they'll handle it

286
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,324
Goodbye

287
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,097
Bye

288
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:38,813
Keung

289
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,346
You'll deal with his men

290
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,629
Are you kidding, Boss?

291
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:48,091
I'm an idiot. 1 will mess it up

292
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,508
What does this smile mean?

293
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,381
Excuse me

294
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,770
So loaded?

295
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,545
Jealous or what?

296
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,107
Is it legit? Be careful

297
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,630
Don't worry, Boss

298
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,592
You should know how much cash I have

299
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:59,312
Want a loan?

300
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,537
What's this?

301
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,615
Your daughter's pocket money

302
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:09,925
You're a dad. Spend more time home

303
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,175
You sure look thinner lately

304
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,005
None of your business. Thanks

305
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:21,953
Who're these two guys?

306
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,335
Only know they're Mainlanders

307
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,727
Anything else?

308
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,538
Shen was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi

309
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,485
An entrepreneur who was drafted

310
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,571
Dealt in antiques and transport

311
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,507
Started from scratch, he's loaded

312
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,379
He came to Hong Kong a year ago

313
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,456
His bro Liang joined him recently

314
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,456
and involved in shady businesses

315
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,588
Sam's been eyeing the Chinese market

316
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,460
He wants you to talk about what?

317
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:50,648
Co-operation

318
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:52,851
Liang

319
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:53,767
Yan

320
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,356
Sit down.

321
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:56,557
By yourself?

322
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,489
You too, Liang?

323
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,376
We have lots of nightclubs in China

324
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,223
All protected by local big shots

325
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,908
Big shots

326
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,425
Your goods can ride on our network easily

327
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,521
We have businesses in eleven cities

328
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,175
I'm sorry

329
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,589
Well, how's the talk so far?

330
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,095
Not bad

331
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,675
See an ashtray in front of you?

332
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,741
Pick it up and smash it in his head

333
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,645
Smash him

334
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,113
Smash him

335
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,716
I'm screwed

336
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:50,958
What happened?

337
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,336
Mary is pregnant

338
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,581
Congratulations, Boss

339
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,140
But we're not married yet

340
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,128
Get married then

341
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,516
Huh, is it necessary?

342
00:26:58,817 --> 00:26:59,717
Or she can have an abortion

343
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,425
We're already engaged

344
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,522
Got it

345
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,720
We can go now

346
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,043
OK, let's go

347
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,230
Long time no see

348
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:16,069
But I saw you last week in China with a broad

349
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:17,872
You don't have to shout

350
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,283
Security people are full of secrets

351
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,279
Time for a break

352
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,273
Hey, what's going on?

353
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:54,952
What are you guys doing here?

354
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:03,568
Sorry, SP Wong

355
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,816
We're asked to take some mug shots

356
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,338
I don't know what's going on either

357
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,580
l asked CIB to open a file

358
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:15,313
and take a picture of everyone, anything wrong?

359
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,573
Officers, are you done?

360
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,782
Wow, everybody's here

361
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,629
We were on the trail of Mr. Shen

362
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,871
But that led us to Sam by chance

363
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,408
We even busted Sam's man

364
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,791
I'll let CIB handle the triads

365
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,634
Sam, long time no see

366
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,168
What brings you here?

367
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,492
Just accompanying some friends

368
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,505
You HK Police is so inefficient

369
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,939
I'll speed it up then

370
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,509
He beat you up. Wanna press charges?

371
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,900
If not, then sign here

372
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,850
I beat you up. Wanna press charges?

373
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,053
You're out of your mind

374
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:42,991
Stand there

375
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,014
3G
Keung, let's go

376
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,790
Wait

377
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:05,572
Do you recognize me?

378
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,435
But I recognize you. Be careful

379
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,690
SP Wong

380
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,409
They're all yours

381
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,026
No need. We know each other so well

382
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,408
The CIB colleagues, you can go now

383
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,620
Thanks, Ming

384
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,359
It's my duty

385
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:50,584
Let's go

386
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:56,504
What's your game?

387
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,279
You think it's a game?

388
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:01,252
It's life-and-death

389
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,350
I'm glad you know that

390
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,559
Hurry up and thank me

391
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:23,347
For what?

392
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,515
Look what you're doing now

393
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,013
Just eating

394
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:27,655
You're eating shark fin

395
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,659
You're eating shark fin

396
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,262
Boss took me to Thailand last time

397
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,434
l had shark fin and then I moved up

398
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,143
You have shark fin. You'll move up

399
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,860
Boss is mean but he buys you shark fin

400
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,553
Just think about it

401
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:01,554
Take him

402
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,407
Let go of him

403
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,021
Boss

404
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,184
You let them take Yan to China?

405
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,439
Ask him why he smashed his head

406
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,538
He smashed his head?

407
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,713
It's no big deal. On the street

408
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,882
either you smash me or I smash you

409
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,028
Yan has smashed his head, right?

410
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,804
How about this?

411
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,998
Is that OK now?

412
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,562
Liang

413
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,422
Are you here to make a scene?

414
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,396
Or are you here for business?

415
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,051
Scram

416
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:08,933
Scram

417
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,334
We are even now

418
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,536
Let's talk business

419
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,432
Il heard your arms business is huge

420
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,644
If you can let me chip in

421
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,428
then the blood they have spilled

422
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:33,957
will not be in vain

423
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,526
Boss

424
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:57,968
So what about it?

425
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,558
You have a grudge against me?

426
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,550
No

427
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,632
Ever met a guy who seems nice

428
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,458
but might whack you any moment?

429
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,522
I've met someone like that before

430
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,277
So what's your conclusion, Boss?

431
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,411
I'm wondering

432
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,499
Why he didn't whack you

433
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:43,115
You look after them from now on

434
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:46,904
Take this

435
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,329
Shen's not what he seems

436
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:07,904
Security is on his trail

437
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:10,854
Could be related to arms smuggling

438
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,633
Sam stopped all his deals in China

439
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,522
They're gonna work together soon

440
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,584
That's big shit

441
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,078
What should I do?

442
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,464
You're not at the shrink yet?

443
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,855
Why should I see a shrink?

444
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,134
You beat people up

445
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,682
l persuaded Department of Justice

446
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,598
to send you to a shrink instead of jail

447
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:32,787
It's fine if you don't wanna go

448
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,594
See you in jail

449
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,007
Hello

450
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,362
What's the address?

451
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,577
l have an appointment with Dr. Lee

452
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,139
Over there, please

453
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,500
Planning to spend the night here?

454
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,234
I can't fall asleep in my clinic

455
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,211
Unlike him

456
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:33,062
He said since he's an undercover

457
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,292
he could only fall asleep here

458
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,930
I still remember

459
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,748
He told me that night

460
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,413
Everything'll be OK after tomorrow.

461
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,390
And then he died

462
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,245
You're a doctor

463
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,596
You still keep his file?

464
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:49,194
He's dead, but he's still a patient

465
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:55,916
Let's go

466
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:56,931
OK

467
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,966
"Three Hours Later"

468
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,303
We found an envelope on sarge's desk

469
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,215
There's a tape inside

470
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,604
It's a chat between him and Sam

471
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,051
After Sam's death

472
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:16,787
SP Leung suspects one of the moles
wants to clear his ass off

473
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,198
and kill everybody else

474
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,547
I think he is responsible for sarge's death

475
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,420
SP Yeung could be Sam's man we're searching for

476
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,464
Do you understand what ! said?

477
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,254
Sorry

478
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,626
I won't sign if she doesn't show up

479
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:50,524
Got it?

480
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:52,422
OK

481
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,083
My wife is divorcing me

482
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,650
Did I scare you? I'm sorry

483
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,021
Be careful

484
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,262
Of what?

485
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,488
Your car's next to mine. I drive badly

486
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,352
If l scratch your car, look for me

487
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:33,746
I'm a good driver. Don't worry

488
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,443
The Taiwanese will be discharged next week

489
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,607
Taiwan authorities have no comments

490
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,509
Mainland's police will come for repatriation

491
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,712
Their boss is a good friend of mine

492
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,387
So stick to the plan

493
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,497
When those big shots arrive

494
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,148
banquets and shopping are inevitable

495
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,500
Make sure they feel welcomed

496
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:43,643
How about the nightclub?

497
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,515
[ think Macau is better

498
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,455
You're not afraid of paparazzi?

499
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,898
I'l just bag them

500
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,118
OK, you bring the bags

501
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,674
SP Yeung

502
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,544
It's Chun's memorial next week

503
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,153
We wanna hire some monks for a service

504
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:18,772
Make sure it's decent

505
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:19,973
Yes

506
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:21,468
Back to the Taiwanese police

507
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,399
Talk to the Macau guys tomorrow

508
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:25,418
Let them plan the evening

509
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,919
I'll talk to them about security

510
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:30,376
Without planning, it'll be a mess

511
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:31,715
Then we won't have a good time

512
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,110
Any addition to your testimony?

513
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:52,118
No

514
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,293
Call us if you got extra information

515
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,165
Thanks

516
00:50:58,822 --> 00:50:59,522
All set?

517
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:00,507
Yes

518
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,346
Can I touch this?

519
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:05,422
Yes

520
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:06,866
OK, thanks

521
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,118
Is everything OK?

522
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,835
It's like that when I came in

523
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,848
They stole some cash and watches

524
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,639
And the computer is gone

525
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,217
Might as well start from scratch

526
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,435
But the computer's useless to them

527
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:40,446
I locked it with my password

528
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,089
They won't know it's my license plate number

529
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:57,424
Your eyes are red. You didn't sleep?

530
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,334
Been working on several cases

531
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,625
You should get some sleep

532
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,918
Everything'll be OK after tomorrow

533
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,543
Il have to go. Call me

534
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,719

538
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,270
You're ordered to undergo treatment

539
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,533
In the coming 6 months

540
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:27,772
you should complete the treatment

541
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,286
I'll then submit a report to the Court

542
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:34,082
The Court will base on this report

543
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,011
and decide if you should go to jail

544
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:40,546
Jail?

545
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,486
Isn't the treatment all there is?

546
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:47,094
You should follow the doctor's orders

547
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,301
Or the Court can revoke the sentence

548
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:52,998
And detain you for handling

549
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:54,547
Got it

550
00:53:58,202 --> 00:53:59,102
Excuse me

551
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:05,645
Damn you, SP Wong

552
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,383
You don't need to call the cops

553
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:12,971
Just give me a call

554
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,527
You have my number, right?

555
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,013

00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,488
Hypnotism?

571
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:09,705
You can refuse

572
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:12,157
But the Court can revoke

573
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,169
And lock me up, right?

574
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:20,533
Go ahead

575
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,876
Hypnotize me then

576
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,188
Let's begin

577
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,277
Please introduce yourself

578
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,306
Talk about your family

579
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:39,782
Mr. Chan?

580
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:41,874
Mr. Chan

581
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,077
Can you co-operate?

582
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,049
I was practicing

583
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:48,658
In case you can't hypnotize me

584
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:50,716
I can hypnotize myself for you

585
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,002
You know

586
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,779
willis particularly strong. It's not easy to hypnotize r

587
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,431
l haven't started yet

588
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:04,911
Not yet

589
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:15,888
You wanna know my story?

590
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,985
My surname wasn't really Chan

591
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,513
I was an illegitimate child

592
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,081
My dad was a drug pusher

593
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,868
I had to work since I was little

594
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:32,998
l earned two hundred grand a month

595
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:34,486
I brought a Porsche at seventeen

596
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,031
I hired two drivers coz

597
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:37,644
I didn't have a driver's license

598
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:41,315
This shrink thing is useless

599
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,644
Shrink or jail time. You choose

600
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,560
She wants to hypnotize me

601
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,204
If I spill the beans

602
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:53,578
don't blame me

603
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:55,628
It's not that easy to be hypnotized

604
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,966
Don't concentrate and she can't

605
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:01,263
It's tough not to concentrate

606
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,888
Dr. Lee is nice

607
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:09,652
Nice person

608
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,670
You won't understand

609
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,216
"The Third Session"

610
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:28,701
You are looking at the sky with lots of cloud

611
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:33,098
You are enveloped by warm water

612
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,609
You feel weightless

613
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,860
You're floating on water

614
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,794
You slowly open your eyes

615
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:48,667
The sky is so close

616
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,511
What're you doing?

617
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,386
I'm hungry

618
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:06,809
Gotta eat something

619
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:13,709
Are you done?

620
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:14,887
Yes, kind of

621
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,328
Let's start again

622
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:23,044
Can you see the sea?

623
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:29,112
The water is so warm

624
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,356
It envelops your whole body

625
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,580
You feel

626
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:47,996
What now?

627
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,136
Nothing really

628
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,667
I might oversleep during hypnosis

629
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,141
Better set my alarm

630
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:03,923
It's not difficult to remember

631
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,951
"The Fourth Session"

632
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:07,125
One Mercedes to Zhanjiang

633
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,600
One Land Cruiser to Zhuhai

634
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,719
Write it down if you can't remember

635
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:17,047
The cabin cruisers need new motors

636
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:18,778
Pink?

637
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,902
We are smuggling, not sailing

638
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:22,540
My fax number:

639
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:25,016
21918125

640
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:26,886
No fax machine?

641
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,667
Why ask my fax number then?

642
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:31,346
E-mail?

643
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,510
E-mail address?

644
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:37,566
No e-mail

645
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,090
Sorry, but I've been really busy

646
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:48,596
So are you done with your business?

647
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,652
Let's talk about your family

648
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,195
You said your dad had 3 wives

649
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:55,741
You have 16 sisters

650
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,273
Let's talk about your twelfth sis

651
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:06,899
Heh, I haven't

652
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:14,456
Are you OK?

653
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:15,290
Get away

654
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,452
Why so impulsive? I haven't listened

655
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:23,556
Better now?

656
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,920
The report for the Court

657
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,406
doesn't matter to me

658
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:40,233
I'm a doctor. I only wanna cure you.

659
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,356
You can leave any time if you like

660
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,200
But I've been trying to tell you

661
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,226
If you keep lying, I can't help you

662
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:32,733
"The ... Session”

663
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,064
Dr. Lee

664
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,900
What did I do besides sleeping?

665
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:07,067
You don't remember what you did?

666
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,199
I do but I'm not sure

667
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,756
Forget it. Bye

668
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:26,862
Dr. Lee

669
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:32,217
I find you particularly nice to me

670
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:33,766
You've got a crush

671
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:35,217
Delusion

672
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,123
Delusion?

673
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:43,549
No wonder

674
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:47,388
Bye

675
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,495
What's with you? Looking so smug

676
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:02,544
The doc said you're dying tomorrow?

677
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:04,462
You won't understand

678
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,508
You think [ have delusion?

679
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:09,315
Delusion?

680
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:10,572
Yes, you do

681
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,274
Maybe hypnotism makes me delusional

682
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,198
That can't be helped

683
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:18,764
Hey, watch out

684
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,009
So many cars

685
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,462
I'm a normal guy

686
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,801
But she makes me all confused

687
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,619
So I'll spill my guts

688
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,405
It has to do with Sigmund Freud

689
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:30,899
According to psychoanalysis

690
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,418
hypnosis gets to your subconsciousness

691
01:04:33,837 --> 01:04:35,037
Once it reaches your subconsciousness

692
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,335
it can reach your darker side

693
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,078
Then it can heal your traumas

694
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,102
And then with symbolic memories

695
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,777
It's so deep. Are you showing off?

696
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:47,466
I can't help it

697
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:50,264
It's written in Shen's Reader's Digest

698
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,524
Are you buddy buddy with Shen now?

699
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:53,809
Not at all

700
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,690
He tries to buddy buddy me instead

701
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:23,475
Mr. Shen

702
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,267
Let me apologize for Yan

703
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:28,263
I'l apologize for him

704
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,200
Pal, ever heard the saying

705
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,890
Men are changed by events,
not events by men?

706
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,361
Without the past, there's no present

707
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:51,563
I'm sorry

708
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,075
What?

709
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:54,550
Great speech

710
01:05:57,654 --> 01:05:58,554
Where's Sam?

711
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,428
He sent the two of us

712
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:53,669
Sam

713
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:57,012
Reading?

714
01:06:57,881 --> 01:06:58,961
Any recommendations?

715
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:00,406

l helped you a lot over the years

719
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:17,241
You speak first, Chief Inspector

01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,715
You know everything I know already

721

Cut the spiel. Will you help me?

722
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:33,404
You help me. I help you

723
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,120
We help each other

724
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:36,702
Good

01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,040

Who's that guy?

729
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:55,096
A pimp

730
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,093
Why are you following him?

731
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:01,413

01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,707
Actually, I'm short of cash

734
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,255
How about hiring me?

735
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,474
Be serious, doc

736
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:18,987
Be serious, pimp

737
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,000
Hello, Internal Affairs

738
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,172
Boss, I saw Yeung with Sam today

739
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:58,322
He may be a mole. Run a check on him

740
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,385
Sam's deal with Shen may start soon

741
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:56,234
Uncle Chan, why so late?

742
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:58,385
Refill the water dispenser

743
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:01,726
You're good

744
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,681
You know when we run out of water

745
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:07,274
Don't just talk. Give me a hand

746
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,368
Damon, help

747
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,341
Why said nothing just then?

748
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,541
Yan just sent me a tape

749
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:56,373
Yan sent you a tape?

750
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:03,205
Wait for me

751
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:09,888
What's the matter with you?

752
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:10,606
I got something important to do

753
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:11,563
Wait

754
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:12,584
What?

755
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,306
You've been back for two days

756
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:18,642
You haven't seen anybody but me

757
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,122
Am I supposed to greet everyone?

758
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:35,544
Did I scare you?

759
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:37,675
I'm sorry

760
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,048
I'm sorry

761
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:49,718
I dunno why you

762
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:51,236
locked yourself up for two days

763
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:55,258
Don't take everything on yourself

764
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:03,481
Everything'll be OK after tomorrow

765
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:09,404
Ming

766
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:17,549
The door is over there

767
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:53,908
Let's give it to OCTB

768
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:05,757
Did you listen to it?

769
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:08,530
No

770
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:36,941
vam and Shen's transaction will take place in two day

771
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:39,457
There'll be lots of arms and coke

772
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,492
I'll contact you before take-off

773
01:14:42,445 --> 01:14:44,375
So Sam doesn't trust you fully

774
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,492
Beware of Yeung first

775
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:49,207
I will

776
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,379
Can you bust him?

777
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,554
You saw them together. That's not enough

778
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:55,853
How can I bust him?

779
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,789
Boss, I'm risking my life for you

780
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:00,345
So don't run that bullshit on me

781
01:15:01,397 --> 01:15:02,857
I'll take care of Yeung

782
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:10,258
It's you?

783
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,167
Don't worry. Ming's a great help

784
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:15,113
Do you know what you're saying?

785
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,804
You won't die if it's not for him

786
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,394
It was an accident

787
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:22,243
Didn't you want us dead?

788
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,791
l only wanna be a good guy

789
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,088
Can you give me another chance?

790
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,888
Sorry, but I'm a cop

791
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:42,276
Are you OK?

792
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,570
I'm fine

793
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:48,373
I'm OK

794
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,233
Do you know what you just did?

795
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,480
I know. What about it?

796
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:17,969
Can you take me back to the clinic?

797
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,627
Sure. Are you OK?

798
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:22,574
Ok. Let's go

799
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,980
Good morning, Dr. Lee

800
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,347
Your hypnosis is great

801
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:29,514
I'm so relaxed

802
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:33,493
I guess I won't need to go to jail

803
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:44,382
Hypnotherapy is a two-way process

804
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:48,179
If you don't tell the truth

805
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,235
[can't help you

806
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:53,004
I'm already very co-operative

807
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:56,800
You don't talk about the triads

808
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:00,393
That's OK. But even on matters

809
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,256
like your favorite food and films

810
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:05,613
You still have to lie

811
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,187
Well, that beats me

812
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:14,408
You're not me. You won't understand

813
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:26,821
The brain is not

814
01:19:27,463 --> 01:19:29,242
made for keeping secrets

815
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,693
l remember when I was a kid

816
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,093
I stole a candy bar in a supermarket

817
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:41,263
It's a foot long

818
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,208
The manager caught me

819
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:50,266
l was so scared I cried

820
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,460
The manager finally let me go

821
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:58,264
Later I went there with my mom

822
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,314
And I saw the manager

823
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:04,317
I felt he's staring at me

824
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,032
I was very uneasy

825
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,889
My mom asked me what was wrong

826
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:12,456
said the manager had molested me

827
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:15,612
My mom called the cops

828
01:20:16,078 --> 01:20:17,508
So the cops took the manager away

829
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:21,326
He never told on me

830
01:20:22,785 --> 01:20:25,855
But I never saw him again

831
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:29,736
Then I went to college

832
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,362
I finally told this to a classmate

833
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,731
After I finished telling the story

834
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,350
I felt like a new-born

835
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,442
Can I really start over again?

836
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,089
Do you trust me?

837
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,763
I do

838
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:56,968
I do

839
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:00,428
As long as you trust me

840
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:05,191
When did you join the triads?

841
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:07,995
[ didn't wanna join the triads

842
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:15,223
l wanna be a good guy

843
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,486
But then I met Mary

844
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,100
Your wife?

845
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:27,288
She's Sam's woman

846
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:31,201
Why do I have to talk about this?

847
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:37,256
You gotta trust me for hypnosis to work

848
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:39,466
Then we can solve your problems.

849
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:44,697
You can't solve my problems

850
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,378
My job is to betray folks around me

851
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,090
I dunno when I can stop

852
01:21:57,446 --> 01:21:58,646
To survive

853
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:02,426
I have to betray others

854
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,317
I'm actually a cop

855
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:08,783
I'm a cop

856
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,445
I don't wanna be Sam's mole

857
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:37,535
Did I scare you?

858
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:41,151
I'm sorry

859
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:58,044
Everything'll be OK after tomorrow

860
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,429
Where were you? Today is D-Day

861
01:23:10,853 --> 01:23:11,403
Today?

862
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:11,943
Yeah

863
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:12,604
I forgot

864
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:13,828
Take out your phones

865
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:18,249
Distribute them

866
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:19,497
Yan

867
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:29,201
You take the boat. There're arms

868
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:32,423
If anything goes wrong

869
01:23:32,808 --> 01:23:33,598
l know

870
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,460
You drive me to the dockyard

871
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:46,897
D-Day of Shen and Sam's deal

872
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:48,522
will be tonight

873
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,257
They probably have heavy armories

874
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,562
We should wear bulletproof jackets

875
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:52,817
The marine is standing by

876
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,505
Team A and B get ready at the slopes

877
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:55,880
Wait for my order

878
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,537
The operation is called off

879
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:02,513
What are you saying?

880
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:04,248
That's an order from the top

881
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,969
An order from you or from the top?

882
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:15,973
I don't need to explain to you

883
01:24:18,954 --> 01:24:19,914
I've been on Sam's trail for years

884
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:22,282
Explain your ties with Sam

885
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,835
It's Security's top secret

886
01:24:25,327 --> 01:24:27,817
ou can make formal inquiry to the Asst. Commission

887
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:31,355
Call IA

888
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,560
Yes, Sir

889
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,029
Sir

890
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,611
Just do what Yeung said

891
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:46,341
No way

892
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:49,168
It's not as simple as you think

893
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:51,368
It's very simple for me

894
01:24:51,687 --> 01:24:53,327
My man is risking his life out there

895
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:56,073
Everybody in OCTB stays put

896
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,398
You're under disciplinary investigation

897
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:03,127
What kind of disciplinary issues?

898
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:06,519
You don't follow orders. That's a disciplinary issue

899
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,009
Where are you going?

900
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:18,142
Back to my room, Sir

901
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,137
Let's go

902
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:40,606
Turn back

903
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:43,670
Ask everyone to follow our car

904
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:49,351
But Yan is in the transaction

905
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,476
Your wife agrees to meet you this afternoon

906
01:27:14,129 --> 01:27:15,029
Is that OK with you?

907
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,929
Thank you

908
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,228
The people will come in today for repatriation

909
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:31,784
Make sure nothing goes wrong

910
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:35,564
Damon and Fai, you stay here

911
01:27:36,485 --> 01:27:39,094
Set the channel to 34879

912
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:41,268
Tell Transportation we can go now

913
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:22,566
Thank you

914
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:53,265
Ming, having fun in my office?

915
01:31:13,702 --> 01:31:15,952
Everyone, get ready and follow me

916
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,279
What's the matter, Ming?

917
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:21,458
We'll bring Yeung in

918
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:26,933
Those police are chatting inside.

919
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,184
They'll be meeting our boss in fifteen minutes

920
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:30,824
Don't make any mistake

921
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:33,199
Damon and Fai, get the documents ready

922
01:31:43,031 --> 01:31:44,260
Yeung

923
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:46,996
You're under suspicion for collusion with Sam

924
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:49,602
Please come with us to IA

925
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,010
Ming, you know what you're doing?

926
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:56,500
l know

927
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:02,252
l found a cassette tape

928
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,661
What tape? I don't get it

929
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:06,910
Listen and you will

930
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:36,246
Where's Mr. Sam?

931
01:32:36,618 --> 01:32:37,788
He's not here yet?

932
01:32:59,641 --> 01:33:00,491
They're empty

933
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:03,624
Shen

934
01:33:43,852 --> 01:33:45,162
Boss, the arms cost over ten mill

935
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,490
Please give them back.

936
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:48,431
Those Mainlanders are animals

937
01:33:49,858 --> 01:33:51,258
What if they're here to set me up?

938
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:52,858
Which bitch told you that?

939
01:33:54,696 --> 01:33:56,276
My life told me so

940
01:33:56,898 --> 01:33:58,238
What if you're wrong?

941
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:01,414
Then I'll co-operate with them

942
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,508
But Yan's gonna die either way

943
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:10,345
We're all risking our lives here

944
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:13,223
l almost died twice

945
01:34:13,848 --> 01:34:15,718
Boss, no more jokes

946
01:34:16,184 --> 01:34:17,354
Boss

947
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,432
l have only one henchman

948
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:24,088
Don't do this to me

949
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:08,723
Tell me

950
01:35:10,605 --> 01:35:13,325
Where are my goods?

951
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,596
Go ask Sam yourself

952
01:35:26,187 --> 01:35:30,547
Why didn't you shoot my head?

953
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:33,393
I didn't aim

954
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:34,514
Stand up

955
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:36,380
Stand up

956
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,779
You guys are together?

957
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:54,843
You guys are together

958
01:35:55,617 --> 01:35:57,427
Sorry, I'm a cop

959
01:35:58,319 --> 01:35:59,519
Go ahead and shoot

960
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:01,424
Save me a bullet

961
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,798
What kinda cop are you?

962
01:36:06,628 --> 01:36:10,027
I got an "A" for writing reports

963
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,788
After I kill you, l can write anything

964
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33,750
He's not Sam's man

965
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:44,871
Then you're not Shen

966
01:37:01,783 --> 01:37:02,683
You're in time

967
01:37:04,452 --> 01:37:06,412
Come join us. It's entertaining

968
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:16,321
So you don't wanna help me, Ming?

969
01:37:17,265 --> 01:37:19,875
I do, but they're watching me

970
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:21,671
So you're not worried about me

971
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:23,559
You're worried about yourself

972
01:37:24,105 --> 01:37:25,304
Whatever you say

973
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:28,458
You'll deal with him

974
01:37:30,078 --> 01:37:33,238
Give me three days. I'll run a check

975
01:37:46,561 --> 01:37:47,550
Ming

976
01:37:49,664 --> 01:37:54,884
Ming, this is your last chance

977
01:38:03,311 --> 01:38:05,590
Ming, you're under arrest

978
01:38:06,114 --> 01:38:09,893
What're you doing? Ming is over there

979
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:14,038
We agreed to bust him. Why you help him?

980
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:16,439
Yeung found this tape in your room

981
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,181
Why did you make such a big mess?

982
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:20,996
He is chasing after me. I have to kill him

983
01:38:21,696 --> 01:38:22,626
I'm taking charge now

984
01:38:22,997 --> 01:38:24,197
I'l look after your deal

985
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:25,235
I've got it when we killed the cop today

986
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,910
I'll talk to you later

987
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:28,487
Cuff him

988
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:30,420
What're you doing?

989
01:38:30,638 --> 01:38:32,367
Get away. Sit down

990
01:38:32,707 --> 01:38:33,577
Sit down. Get away

991
01:38:33,775 --> 01:38:34,884
Get away

992
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:39,149
Get away. What're you doing?

993
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:46,312
I told you to be careful

994
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:47,677
Why should I be careful?

995
01:38:47,989 --> 01:38:48,978
Why should I be careful?

996
01:38:49,323 --> 01:38:50,663
I'm a good guy. Why should I be careful?

997
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,157
Why?

998
01:38:58,032 --> 01:38:59,462
l worked so hard

999
01:39:01,068 --> 01:39:02,498
Helping you guys

1000
01:39:03,704 --> 01:39:04,933
killing all of Sam's moles

1001
01:39:05,373 --> 01:39:06,043
Why can't you give me a chance?

1002
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:09,447
Why can't you give me a chance?

1003
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,421
l wanna be a good guy too

1004
01:39:12,346 --> 01:39:14,245
l wanna be a good guy too

1005
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:16,195
Why don't you give me a chance?

1006
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:18,427
Why? Answer me

1007
01:39:20,021 --> 01:39:21,861
Sorry, I'm a cop

1008
01:39:29,597 --> 01:39:32,177
Sorry, I'm a cop

1009
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:35,261
I'm a cop too

1010
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:38,367
Sure you won't go to the hospital?

1011
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:42,844
People like me can't see the light

1012
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:45,559
Same here

1013
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,447
More blood, more credits

1014
01:40:48,809 --> 01:40:49,769
Will that cause you trouble?

1015
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:51,164
It's just a report

1016
01:40:53,114 --> 01:40:55,364
You trade intel with Sam. Be careful

1017
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:58,630
You should be careful. Sam set you up

1018
01:40:59,253 --> 01:41:00,923
You won't bump into me every time

1019
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,504
Will we see each other again?

1020
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:06,580
I'l pass

1021
01:41:06,694 --> 01:41:08,624
Speak Mandarin

1022
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:10,862
I'll go to Beijing next week. Join me

1023
01:41:12,433 --> 01:41:13,723
I'll quit after this.

1024
01:41:16,704 --> 01:41:17,523
And you?

1025
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:20,529
I'm a snitch

1026
01:41:21,142 --> 01:41:22,512
We don't have holidays

1027
01:41:25,046 --> 01:41:25,976
OK

1028
01:41:27,448 --> 01:41:29,408
See you

1029
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:32,348
You haven't told us

1030
01:41:32,687 --> 01:41:33,557
What's your name?

1031
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:37,180
Name?

1032
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:38,675
I dunno

1033
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:41,266
Just call me "Shadow."

1034
01:41:41,829 --> 01:41:43,318
How corny

1035
01:41:46,367 --> 01:41:47,357
About time for me, too

1036
01:41:48,536 --> 01:41:49,646
You haven't answered me

1037
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:52,158
l asked if you remembered me

1038
01:41:53,908 --> 01:41:56,018
At the cadet school in 1991

1039
01:41:56,544 --> 01:41:58,384
If you hadn't left, 1 couldn't get the award

1040
01:43:23,664 --> 01:43:25,334
Ming is in critical condition at the hospital

1041
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:28,980
The bullet penetrated his upper jaw

1042
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:30,574
and has entered his brain

1043
01:43:31,105 --> 01:43:32,504
The doctor says even if he can survive

1044
01:43:33,274 --> 01:43:34,764
his brain will be seriously damaged

1045
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:37,859
Stuff about him and the moles are all over the walls
in his room

1046
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:41,309
The whole IA has been covered with CCTV

1047
01:43:41,916 --> 01:43:43,846
all connected to SP Yeung's computer

1048
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:13,540
Mary

1049
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:16,732
He won't make it

1050
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:46,590
Ten Days after Yan's Death

1051
01:44:59,994 --> 01:45:03,454
He's dead. What's the point?

1052
01:45:08,702 --> 01:45:11,832
There're things we've gotta do

1053
01:45:50,544 --> 01:45:52,414
Hey pal, you're right

1054
01:46:47,935 --> 01:46:51,625
Everything'll be OK after tomorrow

1055
01:46:53,107 --> 01:46:56,267
I'll arrest Ming myself

1056
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:10,653
One Month Later

1057
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:29,579
Take it back

1058
01:47:33,614 --> 01:47:35,284
He made me a limper

1059
01:48:07,681 --> 01:48:09,380
Is he Yan's friend too?

1060
01:48:15,889 --> 01:48:18,929
They were in cadet school together

1061
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:25,657
Twelve Years Before

1062
01:48:27,167 --> 01:48:29,357
Now that you're in the cadet school,
you should follow the rules

1063
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,700
Those who break the rules will be like him

1064
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,500
They will be expelled

1065
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:37,099
Who wants to trade place with him?

1066
01:48:41,448 --> 01:48:44,288
Yeung, congrats for the Award

1067
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:47,495
If he weren't kicked out, it should have been his?

1068
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:09,458
Perhaps that's fate

1069
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:13,294
Destiny is destiny

1070
01:49:14,915 --> 01:49:18,575
Men are changed by events, not events by men

1071
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:23,349
But these two men

1072
01:49:25,325 --> 01:49:26,995
They have changed certain events

1073
01:49:32,499 --> 01:49:36,568
Let bygones be bygones

1074
01:49:39,106 --> 01:49:40,856
Tomorrow is another day

1075
01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:20,758
Seven Months Later

1076
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:55,471
You're here?

1077
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,109
The baby can say "papa"

1078
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,411
November 2002. Seven days before Yan's death

1079
01:51:59,746 --> 01:52:01,356
He shot me so I shot him back

1080
01:52:01,648 --> 01:52:03,668
I was just a punk at that time

1081
01:52:04,184 --> 01:52:06,844
Stop bitching and learn from Yeung

1082
01:52:07,521 --> 01:52:08,221
Learn what?

1083
01:52:08,689 --> 01:52:10,029
How to write a report

1084
01:52:10,824 --> 01:52:12,754
Did you kill anyone? It's big shit

1085
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:14,397
So it's small shit if 1 got killed’?

1086
01:52:15,862 --> 01:52:16,852
Send me a report

1087
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:18,704
I'll send you shit

1088
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:20,503
What did you say?

1089
01:52:30,711 --> 01:52:31,201
Scram

1090
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:32,368
What do you mean?

1091
01:52:32,679 --> 01:52:33,549
Time for lunch

1092
01:52:33,847 --> 01:52:35,017
I've hardly finished breakfast

1093
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:37,905
Do you wanna eat shit instead?

1094
01:52:47,628 --> 01:52:49,407
Excuse me

1095
01:52:49,863 --> 01:52:50,593
Can I help you?

1096
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:55,380
I'd like to try this stereo

1097
01:53:06,813 --> 01:53:09,393
Ksitigarbha Sutra:

1098
01:53:09,816 --> 01:53:13,626
"People of the like shall be cast
into the Avinci Hell

1099
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:20,678
and will continue to suffer from Kalpas to Kalpas
with no means of escape."
