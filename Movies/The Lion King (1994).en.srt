00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:33,168
From the day we arrive

23
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,243
On the planet

24
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,353
And, blinking, step into the sun

25
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,582
There's more to see

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,518
Than can ever be seen

27
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,641
More to do

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,603
Than can ever be done

29
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,567
There's far too much

30
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,309
To take in here

31
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,389
More to find

32
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,837
Than can ever be found

33
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,309
But the sun rolling high

34
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,004
Through the sapphire sky

35
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,830
Keeps great and small

36
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,935
On the endless round

37
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:20,102
It's the circle of life

38
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:26,047
And it moves us all

39
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:30,657
Through despair and hope

40
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:37,606
Through faith and love

41
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:42,698
Till we find our place

42
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:48,663
On the path unwinding

43
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:54,894
In the circle

44
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,962
The circle of life

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,730
It's the circle of life

46
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,136
And it moves us all

47
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:02,415
Through despair and hope

48
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,929
Through faith and love

49
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:14,449
Till we find our place

50
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:20,894
On the path unwinding

51
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:26,212
In the circle

52
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:32,437
The circle of life

53
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,467
Life's not fair, is it?

54
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,754
You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.

55
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,234
And you shall never see
the light of another day.

56
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,394
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food?

57
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,544
What do you want?

58
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,739
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,

59
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,376
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.

60
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,349
Oh, look, Zazu.

61
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,728
You've made me lose my lunch.

62
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,506
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

63
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,299
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

64
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,788
I quiver with fear!

65
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,482
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

66
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,001
Help!

67
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,431
Scar?

68
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,605
Drop him.

69
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,646
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,779
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high

71
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,130
to mingle with the commoners.

72
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,238
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

73
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,558
That was today?

74
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,994
I feel simply awful!

75
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,945
Must've slipped my mind.

76
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,110
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,

77
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,120
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

78
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,078
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

79
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,998
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

80
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,053
I shall practice my curtsy!

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,770
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

82
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,319
Oh, no, Mufasa.

83
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,043
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

84
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,174
Is that a challenge?

85
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,793
Temper, temper.

86
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,885
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

87
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,998
Pity. Why not?

88
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,229
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

89
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,666
But when it comes to brute strength,

90
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

91
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,409
There's one in every family, sire.

92
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,156
Two in mine, actually,

93
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,188
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

94
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,378
What am I going to do with him?

95
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,205
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

96
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,451
Zazu!

97
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,799
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,

98
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,002
you could take him out and beat him.

99
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,236
Simba.

100
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,171
Dad! Dad!

101
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,503
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!

102
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,133
Sorry.

103
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,372
Dad! Dad!

104
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,221
Your son is awake.

105
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,330
Before sunrise, he's your son.

106
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,646
Dad! Come on, Dad.

107
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,092
You promised.

108
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,820
Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up.

109
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,051
Yeah!

110
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,401
Look, Simba.

111
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,334
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

112
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,361
Wow.

113
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,986
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

114
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,131
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

115
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,728
and will rise with you as the new king.

116
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,592
-And this'll all be mine?
-Everything.

117
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,511
Everything the light touches.

118
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,935
What about that shadowy place?

119
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,083
That's beyond our borders.

120
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,632
You must never go there, Simba.

121
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,707
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

122
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,996
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

123
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,523
-There's more?
-Simba...

124
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:46,449
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

125
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,650
As king, you need to
understand that balance

126
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,606
and respect all the creatures,

127
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,407
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

128
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,464
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

129
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,009
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

130
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,019
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

131
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,855
and the antelope eat the grass.

132
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:09,895
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

133
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,567
-Good morning, sire!
-Good morning, Zazu.

134
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,579
Checking in with the morning report.

135
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:15,777
Fire away.

136
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,468
Well! The buzz from the bees

137
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,417
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

138
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,676
Really?

139
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,028
What are you doing, son?

140
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,752
Pouncing.

141
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,973
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

142
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,984
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...

143
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,063
-Zazu, would you turn around?
-Yes, sire.

144
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,232
The cheetahs are hard up, but...

145
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,919
Stay low to the ground.

146
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,371
Cheetahs never prosper...

147
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,409
Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.

148
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,815
-What going on?
-A pouncing lesson.

149
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,966
Very good. Pouncing.

150
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,328
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...

151
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,356
This is so humiliating.

152
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,045
Try not to make a sound.

153
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,273
What are you telling him, Mufasa?

154
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,556
Mufasa? Simba?

155
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,839
That's very good.

156
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,764
-Zazu!
-Yes!

157
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,302
-News from the underground.
-Now, this time...

158
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,594
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!

159
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,375
Zazu, take Simba home.

160
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,652
Dad, can't l come?

161
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,828
No, son.

162
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,024
I never get to go anywhere.

163
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,935
Young master,
one day, you will be king.

164
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,910
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

165
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,227
from dawn until dusk.

166
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,665
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

167
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,745
I despise guessing games.

168
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,035
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

169
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,294
Oh, goody!

170
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,242
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

171
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,165
and I'm gonna rule it all!

172
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,675
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.

173
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,194
Bad back, you know.

174
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,535
Hey, Uncle Scar.

175
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,856
When I'm king, what'll that make you?

176
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,204
A monkey's uncle.

177
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,891
-You're so weird.
-You have no idea.

178
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,261
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

179
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:09,625
Everything.

180
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,988
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

181
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,575
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

182
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,813
And he's absolutely right.

183
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,335
It's far too dangerous.

184
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,709
Only the bravest lions go there.

185
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,412
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

186
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,918
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

187
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,208
Why not?

188
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,314
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favorite nephew.

189
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,473
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.

190
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,109
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

191
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,196
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

192
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,132
An elephant what? Whoa!

193
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,249
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

194
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,189
Well, l suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

195
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,289
you being so clever and all.

196
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,224
Just do me one favor.

197
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:01,547
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

198
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,438
No problem.

199
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,110
There's a good lad.

200
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,811
You run along now and have fun.

201
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,527
And remember,

202
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,009
it's our little secret.

203
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,252
-Hey, Nala.
-Hi, Simba.

204
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,401
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

205
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,983
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

206
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,149
And it's time for yours.

207
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,348
Mom!

208
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,161
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

209
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,065
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?

210
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,621
So, where are we going?

211
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,189
It better not be anyplace dumb.

212
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,091
No, it's really cool.

213
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,606
So, where is this really cool place?

214
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,830
-Around the water hole.
-The water hole?

215
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,806
What's so great about the water hole?

216
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,995
I'll show you when we get there.

217
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,208
Mom, can I go with Simba?

218
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,580
What do you think, Sarabi?

219
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:00,736
Well...

220
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,243
-Please?
-Please?

221
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,462
It's all right with me.

222
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:04,633
-Yeah!
-All right!

223
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,561
As long as Zazu goes with you.

224
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,486
No, not Zazu.

225
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:09,915
Step lively.

226
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,622
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

227
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,857
So, where are we really going?

228
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,415
An elephant graveyard.

229
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,557
Wow!

230
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,118
Zazu.

231
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,693
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

232
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,700
Just look at you two.

233
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,778
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

234
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,195
Your parents will be thrilled,

235
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,651
what with your being betrothed and all.

236
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:34,906
Be-what?

237
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,627
Betrothed. Intended.

238
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,646
Affianced.

239
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:39,840
Meaning...

240
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,743
One day, you two are
going to be married.

241
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,049
Yuck!

242
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,237
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

243
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,512
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

244
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,551
Sorry to bust your bubble,

245
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,199
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

246
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,749
It's a tradition going back generations.

247
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,375
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

248
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,251
-Not so long as I'm around.
-Well, in that case, you're fired.

249
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,807
Nice try, but only the king can do that.

250
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,536
Well, he's the future king.

251
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,918
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

252
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,597
Not yet, I don't.

253
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,118
And with an attitude like that,

254
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:14,714
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

255
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,648
Not the way I see it.

256
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,757
I'm gonna be a mighty king

257
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,926
So enemies beware

258
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,561
Well, I've never seen
a king of beasts

259
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,853
With quite so little hair

260
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,502
I'm gonna be the main event

261
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,702
Like no king was before

262
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,375
I'm brushin' up on lookin' down

263
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm workin' on my roar

264
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:40,123
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing

265
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,040
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

266
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,420
You've rather a long way to go,
young master, if you think...

267
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,958
-No one sayin’, "Do this"
-Now, when ! said that...

268
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,454
-No one saying, "Be there"
-What I meant was...

269
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,866
-No one sayin’, "Stop that"
-You don't realize...

270
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,709
-No one sayin’, "See here"
-Now, see here!

271
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,081
Free to run around all day

272
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,958
Well, that's definitely out.

273
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,737
Free to do it all my way

274
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,260
[think it's time that you and!

275
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,446
Arranged a heart-to-heart

276
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,378
Kings don't need advice

277
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,893
From little hornbills for a start

278
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,457
If this is where
the monarchy is headed

279
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,900
Count me out

280
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,304
Out of service, out of Africa

281
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,900
! wouldn't hang about

282
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,166
This child is getting
wildly out of wing

283
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:38,644
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

284
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,261
Everybody, look left

285
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,130
Everybody, look right

286
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,706
Everywhere you look, I'm

287
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,448
Standing in the spotlight

288
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,240
Not yet!

289
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,832
Let every creature
go for broke and sing

290
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,831
Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing

291
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,457
It's gonna be
King Simba's finest fling

292
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:20,375
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

293
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,319
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

294
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:30,225
Oh, I just can't wait

295
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,890
To be king

296
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,789
Il beg your pardon, madam, but

297
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,962
get off!

298
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,711
Simba?

299
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,940
Nala!

300
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,801
All right! It worked!

301
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,225
-We lost him.
-lam a genius.

302
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,455
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

303
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,670
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

304
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,729
-With me!
-Yeah?

305
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,897
-Pinned ya.
-Hey, let me up!

306
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,895
Pinned ya again.

307
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,576
This is it. We made it.

308
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,483
Whoa!

309
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,897
It's really creepy.

310
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,112
Yeah.

311
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,429
Isn't it great?

312
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,435
-We could get in big trouble.
-l know!

313
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,685
l wonder if its brains are still in there.

314
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,761
There's only one way to know.

315
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,643
Come on, let's go check it out.

316
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:56,182
Wrong! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.

317
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,809
Oh, man!

318
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,194
We're way beyond the boundary
of the Pride Lands.

319
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,006
Look, banana beak is scared.

320
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,761
It's Mr. banana beak to you, fuzzy,

321
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,164
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

322
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,904
Danger?

323
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,956
l walk on the wild side.

324
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,274
I laugh in the face of danger.

325
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,299
Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?

326
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,466
I don't know, Shenzi.

327
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,955
What do you think, Ed?

328
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,922
Just what I was thinking.

329
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,041
Atrio of trespassers!

330
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,266
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

331
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,252
A simple navigational error.

332
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,264
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

333
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,089
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

334
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,669
I], madam, am the king's major-domo.

335
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,449
And that would make you...

336
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,861
The future king.

337
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,249
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

338
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,300
You can't do anything to me.

339
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,585
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

340
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,651
But you told me they're nothing but
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

341
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,574
Ix-nay on the upid-stay.

342
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,620
-Who are you callin’ upid-stay?
-My, my, my. Look at the sun!

343
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,973
-It's time to go!
-What's the hurry?

344
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,949
We'd love you to
stick around for dinner.

345
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,254
Yeah, we could have
whatever's lion around!

346
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,448
Wait, wait, wait, 1 got one, I got one!

347
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,470
Make mine a cub sandwich!
Whaddaya think?

348
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,731
What, Ed? What is it?

349
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,734
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

350
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:30,989
No, why?

351
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,097
‘Cause there it goes!

352
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,972
-Did we lose 'em?
-I think so.

353
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,634
Where's Zazu?

354
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,776
The little major-domo bird
hippety-hopped

355
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,888
all the way to the birdie-boiler.

356
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,917
No! Not the birdie-boiler!

357
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,487
Hey, why don't you pick
on somebody your own size?

358
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,110
-Like you?
-Oops.

359
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,281
Boo!

360
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,309
Simba!

361
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,635
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

362
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:45,767
That was it?

363
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,081
Do it again. Come on.

364
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,476
-Please, please! Uncle, uncle!
-Silence!

365
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,691
-We're gonna shut up right now!
-Calm down. We're really sorry.

366
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,905
If you ever come near my son again...

367
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,864
This is... This is your son?

368
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,316
-Your son.
-Did you know that?

369
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,856
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?

370
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,872
-No, of course not.
-No.

371
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,100
Ed?

372
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:23,775
Toodles.

373
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,613
-Dad, I...
-You deliberately disobeyed me.

374
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,884
-Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
-Let's go home.

375
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,540
Il thought you were very brave.

376
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,918
Zazu.

377
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,198
Yes, sire?

378
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,194
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

379
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,593
Come, Nala.

380
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,915
Simba, good luck.

381
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,750
Simba!

382
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,363
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

383
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,805
-l know.
-You could've been killed.

384
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,888
You deliberately disobeyed me,

385
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:04,483
and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

386
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,341
l was just trying to be brave, like you.

387
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,707
I'm only brave when I have to be.

388
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,366
Simba, being brave

389
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,933
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

390
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,069
But you're not scared of anything.

391
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,509
l was today.

392
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,624
-You were?
-Yes.

393
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,863
l thought I might lose you.

394
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,705
I guess even kings get scared, huh?

395
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,523
-But you know what?
-What?

396
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,089
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

397
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,790
‘Cause nobody messes with your dad.

398
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,383
-Come here, you.
-No! No!

399
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,591
Come here!

400
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:50,805
Gotcha!

401
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,564
Dad?

402
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,260
-We're pals, right?
-Right.

403
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,096
And we'll always be together, right?

404
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,740
Simba, let me tell you something
that my father told me.

405
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,209
Look at the stars.

406
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:17,028
The great kings of the past
look down on us from those stars.

407
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,750
-Really?
-Yes.

408
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,099
So whenever you feel alone,

409
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:26,611
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you.

410
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,297
And so will I.

411
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,489
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
l won't be able to sit for a week.

412
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,569
It's not funny, Ed.

413
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,508
Hey, shut up!

414
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,016
Will you knock it off?

415
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,079
-Well, he started it.
-Look at you guys.

416
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,829
No wonder we're dangling
at the bottom of the food chain.

417
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,504
Man, I hate dangling.

418
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,160
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions,
we'd be runnin’ the joint.

419
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,960
Man, I hate lions.

420
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,662
-So pushy.
-And hairy.

421
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,804
-And stinky.
-And, man, are they...

422
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,886
Ugly!

423
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,849
Surely we lions are not all that bad.

424
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,048
Scar. It's just you.

425
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,152
We were afraid it was
somebody important.

426
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,742
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

427
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,322
-Yeah.
-l see.

428
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,605
-Now that's power!
-Tell me about it.

429
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,504
I just hear that name and I shudder.

430
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,069
-Mufasa!
-Do it again.

431
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,658
Mufasa!

432
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,176
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!

433
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,216
It tingles me.

434
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,951
I'm surrounded by idiots.

435
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,120
Now, you, Scar, l mean, you're
one of us. mean, you're our pal.

436
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:49,594
Charmed.

437
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,465
I like that. He's not king,
but he's still so proper.

438
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,682
Yeah. Hey, did you
bring us anything to eat,

439
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,848
Scar, old buddy, old pal?
Huh? Did ya, did ya, did ya?

440
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,230
I don't think you really deserve this.

441
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,306
I practically gift-wrapped
those cubs for you,

442
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,775
and you couldn't even dispose of them.

443
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,425
Well, you know, it wasn't exactly
like they was alone, Scar.

444
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,926
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?

445
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,975
Kill Mufasa?

446
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,635
Precisely.

447
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,731
! know that your powers of retention

448
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:39,598
Are as wet as a warthog's backside

449
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,815
But thick as you are, pay attention

450
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:47,703
My words are a matter of pride

451
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,450
It's clear from your vacant expressions

452
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,430
The lights are not all on upstairs

453
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,994
But we're talking kings
and successions

454
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,908
Even you can't be caught unawares

455
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,775
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime

456
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:11,156
Be prepared for sensational news

457
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:15,123
A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer

458
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,061
And where do we feature?

459
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,289
Just listen to teacher

460
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,301
! know it sounds sordid

461
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,267
But you'll be rewarded

462
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,665
When at last 1 am given my dues

463
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,302
And injustice deliciously squared

464
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,649
Be prepared

465
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,709
Yeah, be prepared.
We'll be prepared. For what?

466
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,450
For the death of the king.

467
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,841
-Why, is he sick?
-No, fool, we're going to kill him.

468
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,177
-And Simba, too.
-Great idea. Who needs a king?

469
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,114
No king, no king

470
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,153
-Idiots! There will be a king!
-Hey, but you said...

471
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,343
I will be king!

472
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,185
Stick with me,

473
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,947
and you'll never go hungry again.

474
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,551
-Yeah! All right!
-Long live the king!

475
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,927
Long live the king! Long live the king!

476
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,081
It's great that we'll soon be connected

477
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,329
With a king who'll be all-time adored

478
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,020
Of course, quid pro quo
you're expected

479
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,030
To take certain duties on board

480
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,904
The future is littered with prizes

481
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,301
And though I'm the main addressee

482
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,862
The point that l must emphasize is

483
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,916
You won't get a sniff without me!

484
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,366
So prepare for the coup of the century

485
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:45,687
Be prepared for the murkiest scam

486
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,775
Meticulous planning

487
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,750
Tenacity spanning

488
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,891
Decades of denial

489
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,410
ls simply why I'll be king undisputed

490
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,657
Respected, saluted

491
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,983
And seen for the wonder! am

492
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,775
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared

493
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,144
Be prepared

494
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,638
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared

495
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,571
Be prepared

496
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,474
You wait here. Your father has
a marvelous surprise for you.

497
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,206
What is it?

498
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,240
If l told you, it wouldn't be
a surprise now, would it?

499
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,454
If you tell me,
I'll still act surprised.

500
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,350
You are such a naughty boy.

501
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,520
-Come on, Uncle Scar.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

502
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,025
This is just for you and your daddy.

503
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:54,512
You know, a sort of father-son thing.

504
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,610
Well, I'd better go get him.

505
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,632
-I'll go with you.
-No.

506
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:04,632
No. Just stay on this rock.

507
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,910
You wouldn't want to end up
in another mess

508
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,752
like you did with the hyenas.

509
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,497
-You know about that?
-Simba, everybody knows about that.

510
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,313
-Really?
-Yes.

511
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:18,984
Lucky daddy was there
to save you, eh?

512
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,878
And just between us,

513
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,270
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours, hmm?

514
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:27,838
Okay.

515
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,545
Hey, Uncle Scar,
willl like this surprise?

516
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:37,866
Simba, it's to die for.

517
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,914
Shut up.

518
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,139
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.

519
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,913
Stay put.

520
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,225
Can't I just pick off
one of the little sick ones?

521
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,940
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

522
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,559
There he is. Let's go.

523
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,046
"Little roar."

524
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,464
Look, sire, the herd is on the move.

525
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,849
-Odd.
-Mufasa, quick.

526
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,902
Stampede in the gorge.

527
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,543
-Simba's down there!
-Simba?

528
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,242
Zazu, help me!

529
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,277
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

530
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,652
Hurry!

531
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,637
There! There on that tree!

532
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,210
Hold on, Simba!

533
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,052
Dad!

534
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,094
Scar, this is awful!

535
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,377
What'll we do? What'll we do?

536
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,058
I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do.

537
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,161
Dad!

538
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,705
Scar!

539
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,197
-Brother.
-Brother, help me!

540
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,635
Long live the king.

541
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,880
No!

542
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,286
Dad!

543
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,670
Dad?

544
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:51,645
Dad?

545
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,231
Dad, come on.

546
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,163
You got to get up.

547
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,393
Dad?

548
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,384
We got to go home.

549
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:14,904
Help!

550
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,992
Somebody!

551
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,049
Anybody.

552
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,958
Help.

553
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,357
Simba. What have you done?

554
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,686
There were wildebeests,
and he tried to save me.

555
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,002
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

556
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:11,105
Of course. Of course you didn't.

557
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:16,563
No one ever means for
these things to happen.

558
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,072
But the king is dead.

559
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:23,558
And if it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive.

560
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,761
What will your mother think?

561
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,653
What am I going to do?

562
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,078
Run away, Simba.

563
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:41,061
Run. Run away and never return.

564
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,589
Kill him.

565
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,718
Whoa!

566
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,620
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.

567
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,439
So go get him.

568
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,288
There ain't no way I'm going in there.

569
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,982
What, you want me to come out
looking like you, cactus butt?

570
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:54,723
But we got to finish the job.

571
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,645
Well, he's as good as
dead out there anyway.

572
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,082
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

573
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,317
Yeah! You hear that?

574
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,548
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!

575
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,516
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

576
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:23,020
But to lose Simba,
who had barely begun to live...

577
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:28,735
For me, itis a deep, personal loss.

578
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:32,904
So it is with a heavy heart
that l assume the throne.

579
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,211
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise

580
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,399
to greet the dawning of a new era

581
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:44,174
in which lion and hyena come together

582
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:48,486
in a great and glorious future.

583
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,216
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!

584
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,609
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.

585
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,226
Gets 'em every time.

586
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,380
Hey, Timon, you better come look.

587
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,580
I think it's still alive.

588
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:55,287
All righty, what have we got here?

589
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,512
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!

590
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,916
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

591
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,429
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.

592
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,224
-Can we keep him?
-Pumbaa, are you nuts?

593
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,433
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.

594
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,060
-But he's so little.
-He's going to get bigger.

595
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,368
Maybe he'll be on our side.

596
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,364
That's the stupidest thing
l ever heard. Maybe he'll...

597
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:29,738
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

598
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:33,111
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

599
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,540
So we're keeping him?

600
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,739
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

601
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,515
My point exactly.

602
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,690
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.

603
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:52,625
-You okay, kid?
-l guess so.

604
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,080
You nearly died.

605
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,734
I saved you.

606
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,937
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

607
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,882
Thanks for your help.

608
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,415
Hey, where you going?

609
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:04,607
Nowhere.

610
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,116
Gee, he looks blue.

611
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,130
-I'd say brownish gold.
-No, no, no. 1 mean he's depressed.

612
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,223
Kid, what's eating you?

613
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:16,111
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.

614
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,240
The food chain!

615
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,825
So, where you from?

616
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,817
Who cares? I can't go back.

617
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,202
You're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.

618
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,781
-What'd you do, kid?
-Something terrible.

619
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,772
-But I don't want to talk about it.
-We don't want to hear about it.

620
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:39,145
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

621
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:41,824
Not unless you can change the past.

622
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,120
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says,

623
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,810
"You got to put your
behind in your past."

624
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,589
No, no, no.

625
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,057
-[ mean...
-Amateur.

626
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:53,192
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

627
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,331
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."

628
00:43:56,701 --> 00:44:00,301
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?

629
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:01,768
-Right.
-Wrong!

630
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,249
When the world turns its back on you,

631
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,042
you turn your back on the world.

632
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,115
Well, that's not what I was taught.

633
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,377
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

634
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:13,796
Repeat after me.

635
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,788
-Hakuna matata.
-What?

636
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,630
Hakuna matata.

637
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,103
It means "no worries".

638
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:23,005
Hakuna matata.

639
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,171
What a wonderful phrase.

640
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,677
Hakuna matata.

641
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,933
Ain't no passing craze

642
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,480
It means no worries

643
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,435
For the rest of your days

644
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:43,366
It's our problem-free philosophy

645
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,267
Hakuna matata

646
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,227
Hakuna matata?

647
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:50,766
-Yeah. It's our motto.
-What's a motto?

648
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,172
Nothin’. What's-a-motto with you?

649
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,989
You know, kid, these two words
will solve all your problems.

650
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:01,426
That's right.
Take Pumbaa, for example. Why...

651
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,359
When he was a young warthog

652
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,162
When I was a young warthog

653
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,279
-Very nice.
-Thanks.

654
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,218
He found his aroma
lacked a certain appeal

655
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:15,598
He could clear the savanna
after every meal

656
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,783
I'ma sensitive soul

657
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,301
Though I seem thick-skinned

658
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:26,389
And it hurt that my friends
never stood downwind

659
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:30,248
-And, oh, the shame
-He was ashamed

660
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,898
-Thought of changing my name
-Oh, what's in a name?

661
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,664
And I got downhearted

662
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,649
-How did you feel?
-Every time that...

663
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,394
-Hey, not in front of the kids.
-Oh, sorry.

664
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,475
Hakuna matata

665
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,673
What a wonderful phrase

666
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,720
Hakuna matata

667
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,852
Ain't no passing craze

668
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,272
It means no worries

669
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,254
For the rest of your days

670
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:57,042
Yeah, sing it, kid.

671
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,898
It's our problem-free

672
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,691
Philosophy

673
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,924
Hakuna matata

674
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:08,781
Welcome to our humble home.

675
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,346
-You live here?
-We live wherever we want.

676
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,875
Yep. Home is where your rump rests.

677
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,792
It's beautiful.

678
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,094
I'm starved.

679
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,326
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.

680
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:23,243
We're fresh out of zebra.

681
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,967
Any antelope?

682
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,649
-Hippo?
-Nope.

683
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,667
Listen, kid, if you live with us,
you have to eat like us.

684
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,371
Hey, this looks like a good spot
to rustle up some grub.

685
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,124
What's that?

686
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:36,936
A grub. What's it look like?

687
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,944
Gross.

688
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:41,758
Tastes like chicken.

689
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,270
Slimy yet satisfying.

690
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,006
These are rare delicacies.

691
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,859
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.

692
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,810
You'll learn to love them.

693
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:56,185
I'm telling you, kid, this is the great life,

694
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:58,564
no rules, no responsibilities.

695
00:46:58,883 --> 00:47:01,252
The little cream-filled kind.

696
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,022
And best of all, no worries.

697
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,118
Well, kid?

698
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,910
Oh, well. Hakuna matata.

699
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,361
Slimy, yet satisfying.

700
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:18,074
That's it.

701
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,671
Hakuna matata

702
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,079
Hakuna matata

703
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,717
Hakuna matata

704
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,292
-Hakuna...
-lt means no worries

705
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,438
For the rest of your days

706
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:43,721
It's our problem-free

707
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:46,145
Philosophy

708
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,334
Hakuna matata

709
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,130
Hakuna matata

710
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,533
Hakuna matata

711
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,606
Hakuna matata

712
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,278
Hakuna matata

713
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,133
Hakuna matata

714
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:07,681
Hakuna matata

715
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:11,532
Hakuna matata

716
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,456
Yeah

717
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,124
Ta-ta!

718
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,029
Nobody knows

719
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,540
The trouble I've seen

720
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:33,347
Nobody knows

721
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,548
My sorrow

722
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,750
Zazu, do lighten up.

723
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,046
Sing something with a little bounce in it.

724
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,866
It's a small world after all

725
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,096
No, no! Anything but that!

726
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,100
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts

727
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,660
Deedle dee dee

728
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,854
There they are a-standing in a row

729
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:00,084
Big ones, small ones,
some as big as your head

730
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,183
I would never have had
to do this with Mufasa.

731
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,417
What? What did you say?

732
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,703
-Nothing.
-You know the law.

733
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,932
Never, ever mention that name
in my presence. I am the king!

734
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:14,827
Yes, sire, you are the king.

735
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,809
I... Lonly mentioned it
to illustrate the differences

736
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,395
in your royal managerial approaches.

737
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:23,627
-Hey, boss.
-What is it this time?

738
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,084
-We got a bone to pick with you.
-I'll handle this.

739
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,600
Scar, there's no food, no water.

740
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:32,426
Yeah. It's dinner time
and we ain't got no stinking entrées.

741
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:36,937
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.

742
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,441
Yeah, but they won't go hunt.

743
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,353
-Eat Zazu.
-You wouldn't want me.

744
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:45,236
I'd be so tough and gamey and...

745
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:48,636
Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.

746
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:50,955
I thought things
were bad under Mufasa.

747
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,475
-What did you say?
-l said Muf...

748
00:49:53,858 --> 00:49:55,288
lsaid qué pasa?

749
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,669
Good. Now get out.

750
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,407
But we're still hungry.

751
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,589
Out!

752
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,151
-Whoa! Nice one, Simba.
-Thanks.

753
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,207
-Man, I'm stuffed.
-Me, too.

754
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,607
l ate like a pig.

755
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,786
Pumbaa, you are a pig.

756
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,865
Right.

757
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:36,587
-Timon?
-Yeah?

758
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:40,631
Ever wonder what those
sparkling dots are up there?

759
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,801
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.

760
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,925
What are they?

761
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:48,891
They're fireflies.

762
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:53,066
Fireflies that got stuck
up in that big blueish-black thing.

763
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:55,431
Gee.

764
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,636
l always thought they were balls of gas

765
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:02,093
burning billions of miles away.

766
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,883
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.

767
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,077
Simba, what do you think?

768
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,221
Well, don't know.

769
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,277
Come on. Give, give, give, give.

770
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:15,263
Come on. We told you ours. Please?

771
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:16,962
Well...

772
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,608
Somebody once told me

773
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,947
that the great kings of the past
are up there watching over us.

774
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:25,535
Really?

775
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:28,676
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys
are watching us?

776
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,941
-Who told you something like that?
-Yeah, yeah.

777
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:41,488
-What mook made that up?
-Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?

778
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,819
-You're killing me.
-Yeah.

779
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:57,486
Was it something I said?

780
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,573
Simba?

781
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,235
He's... He's alive? He's alive!

782
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:11,287
It is time.

783
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:17,976
A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

784
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:19,992
A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

785
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:23,924
In the jungle, the mighty jungle

786
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:28,008
The lion sleeps tonight

787
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,999
In the jungle, the mighty jungle

788
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,183
The lion sleeps to...

789
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:36,375
Il can't hear you, buddy. Back me up.

790
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,604
A-Pumbaa-bum-baa-weh

791
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,254
Pumbaa? Pumbaa?

792
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:03,306
Timon?

793
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,493
Pumbaa?

794
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,645
Pumbaa! Pumbaa!

795
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:37,092
Pumbaa, Pumbaa!
Hey, what's going on?

796
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,611
She's going to eat me!

797
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:45,008
Whoa! Jeez, why do I always
have to save your...

798
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,958
Don't worry, buddy. I'm here for you.
Everything's going to be okay.

799
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:58,366
Get her! Bite her head!

800
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,316
Go for the jugular! The jugular!

801
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:03,692
See, I told you he'd come in handy.

802
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:09,632
Nala?

803
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,064
Is it really you?

804
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:19,019
-Who are you?
-It's me. Simba.

805
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,346
Simba?

806
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,024
Whoa! How did you...

807
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,402
-Wow!
-Where did you come from?

808
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,441
This is gr... It's great to see you!

809
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:35,393
-Hey, what's goin’ on here?
-What are you doing here?

810
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,699
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

811
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,931
Hey! What's goin’ on here?

812
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:44,061
Timon, this is Nala.
She's my best friend.

813
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:47,984
-Friend?
-Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here.

814
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,759
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.

815
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,484
-Pleased to make your acquaintance.
-The pleasure is all mine.

816
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,511
How do you... Whoa, whoa!
Time out! Let me get this straight.

817
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,843
You know her, she knows you.

818
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:05,161
But she wants to eat him,
and everybody's okay with this?

819
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:08,136
-Did I miss something?
-Relax, Timon.

820
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,128
Wait till everyone finds out
you've been here all this time.

821
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,712
And your mother, what will she think?

822
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:18,095
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.

823
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,595
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.

824
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:21,998
They do?

825
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:25,019
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.

826
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,589
He did? What else did he tell you?

827
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,809
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means, you're the king.

828
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:39,188
King? Lady, have you got
your lions crossed!

829
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:40,947
King?

830
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:44,761
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.

831
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,915
-Stop it.
-It's not gravel, it's grovel.

832
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:51,435
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?

833
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,312
-No.
-Simba!

834
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,793
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be,

835
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,196
but that was a long time ago.

836
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,855
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?

837
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,812
-Look, I'm still the same guy.
-But with power.

838
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,768
Could you guys excuse us
for a few minutes?

839
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:09,875
Hey, whatever she has to say,

840
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:12,057
she can say in front of us, right, Simba?

841
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:15,928
Maybe you'd better go.

842
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,069
It starts. You think you know a guy.

843
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:26,866
Timon and Pumbaa,
you learn to love 'em.

844
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,873
What?

845
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:33,709
What is it?

846
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:37,035
It's like you're back from the dead.

847
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,921
You don't know how much
this will mean to everyone.

848
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,122
What it means to me.

849
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,730
-Hey, it's okay.
-I've really missed you.

850
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,660
I've missed you, too.

851
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,862
I tell you, Pumbaa. This stinks.

852
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:56,868
Sorry.

853
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,970
Not you! Them!

854
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,676
Him, her, alone.

855
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,283
What's wrong with that?

856
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,684
-l can see what's happening
-What?

857
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:09,327
-And they don't have a clue
-Who?

858
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,816
They'll fall in love
and here's the bottom line

859
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,870
Our trio's down to two

860
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,050
The sweet caress of twilight

861
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,126
There's magic everywhere

862
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:27,392
And with all this
romantic atmosphere

863
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:31,888
Disaster's in the air

864
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:42,894
Can you feel the love tonight?

865
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:48,687
The peace the evening brings

866
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:52,143
The world for once

867
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,372
In perfect harmony

868
00:58:55,832 --> 00:59:00,462
With all its living things

869
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,515
So many things to tell her

870
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:08,022
But how to make her see

871
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:10,755
The truth about my past?

872
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:14,334
Impossible, she'd turn away from me

873
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,571
He's holding back, he's hiding

874
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,995
But what, I can't decide

875
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:24,355
Why won't he be
the king I know he is?

876
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:28,135
The king l see inside?

877
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:34,696
Can you feel the love tonight?

878
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,306
The peace the evening brings

879
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,375
The world for once

880
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,588
In perfect harmony

881
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:52,411
With all its living things

882
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:59,911
Can you feel the love tonight?

883
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:05,945
You needn't look too far

884
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,984
Stealing through

885
01:00:10,307 --> 01:00:13,207
The night's uncertainties

886
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:18,154
Love is where they are

887
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:25,016
And if he falls in love tonight

888
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:31,254
It can be assumed

889
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,339
His carefree days

890
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:38,719
With us are history

891
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:42,679
In short, our pal

892
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,459
ls doomed

893
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,276
Isn't this a great place?

894
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:01,303
It is beautiful.

895
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:04,198
But I don't understand something.

896
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:06,701
You've been alive all this time.

897
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:09,164
Why didn't you
come back to Pride Rock?

898
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:13,746
Well, I just needed to get out
on my own, live my own life.

899
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,041
And I did, and it's great.

900
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,243
We've really needed you at home.

901
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:22,275
-No one needs me.
-Yes, we do. You're the king.

902
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,499
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.

903
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:29,420
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the Pride Lands.

904
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,633
-What?
-Everything's destroyed.

905
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:33,444
There's no food, no water.

906
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,060
Simba, if you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.

907
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:37,598
-l can't go back.
-Why?

908
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:39,787
-You wouldn't understand.
-What?

909
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,410
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
Hakuna matata.

910
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:44,321
-What?
-Hakuna matata.

911
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:47,828
It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...

912
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:49,294
Simba...

913
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:52,372
..and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

914
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,819
-Because it's your responsibility.
-Well, what about you? You left.

915
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,967
I left to find help, and I found you.

916
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:04,327
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.

917
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,408
-Sorry.
-What's happened to you?

918
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:11,355
-You're not the Simba I remember.
-You're right. I'm not.

919
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:15,018
-Now are you satisfied?
-No. Just disappointed.

920
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:18,018
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

921
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,151
Good. At least one of us does.

922
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,411
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?

923
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,651
You don't even know
what I've been through.

924
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,173
l would if you'd just tell me.

925
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:30,018
-Forget it!
-Fine!

926
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,570
She's wrong. I can't go back.

927
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,630
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.

928
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:42,931
You can't change the past.

929
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,986
You said you'd always be there for me!

930
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,573
But you're not.

931
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:55,887
And it's because of me.

932
01:02:56,673 --> 01:02:58,923
It's my fault.

933
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,466
It's my fault.

934
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:07,192
Asante sana, squash banana

935
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:08,714
We we nugu, imi mi apana

936
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,528
Asante sana, squash banana

937
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,307
We we nugu, imi mi apana

938
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,305
Asante sana, squash banana

939
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:16,431
We we nugu, imi mi apana

940
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:44,244
Asante sana, squash banana
We we nugu, imi mi apana

941
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:47,816
Come on, will you cut it out?

942
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,671
Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back!

943
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:53,814
Creepy little monkey.
Will you stop following me?

944
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:57,664
-Who are you?
-The question is, who are you?

945
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,977
I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure.

946
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:07,777
Well, l know who you are.
Come here. It's a secret.

947
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:11,317
Asante sana, squash banana

948
01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:13,985
Enough!
What is that supposed to mean?

949
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:17,247
It means you are a baboon, and I'm not.

950
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,312
I think you're a little confused.

951
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:24,208
Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused.

952
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:27,667
-You don't even know who you are.
-And I suppose you know.

953
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:30,794
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.

954
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:35,069
-Bye.
-Hey, wait!

955
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,281
You knew my father?

956
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:48,317
Correction, I know your father.

957
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,560
I hate to tell you this,

958
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,572
but he died a long time ago.

959
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,105
Nope. Wrong again!

960
01:04:59,696 --> 01:05:02,125
He's alive, and I'll show him to you.

961
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:05,158
You follow old Rafiki.
He knows the way. Come on!

962
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,375
Don't dawdle. Hurry up!

963
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,750
-Hey, whoa, wait, wait.
-Come on. Come on!

964
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:24,786
Would you slow down?

965
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,162
Stop!

966
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,579
Look down there.

967
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,558
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.

968
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,459
No.

969
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:18,258
Look harder.

970
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,013
You see?

971
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,669
He lives in you.

972
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,493
Simba.

973
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,320
Father?

974
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:48,862
Simba, you have forgotten me.

975
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:51,142
No. How could I?

976
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:55,664
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.

977
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:58,301
Look inside yourself, Simba.

978
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:02,317
You are more than
what you have become.

979
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:05,749
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

980
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:09,702
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.

981
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:13,693
Remember who you are.

982
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,690
You are my son and the one true king.

983
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,256
Remember who you are.

984
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,290
No! Please, don't leave me!

985
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:27,726
Remember.

986
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:29,311
-Father!
-Remember!

987
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:31,329
Don't leave me.

988
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,344
Remember.

989
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,965
What was that?

990
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,780
The weather.

991
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,312
-Very peculiar, don't you think?
-Yeah.

992
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,670
Looks like the winds are changing.

993
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,151
Change is good.

994
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,507
Yeah, but it's not easy.

995
01:07:56,773 --> 01:08:01,193
I know what I have to do, but going
back means I'll have to face my past.

996
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:04,714
I've been running from it
for so long.

997
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:08,046
Jeez! What was that for?

998
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,834
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.

999
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,034
Yeah, but it still hurts.

1000
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,373
Yes, the past can hurt.

1001
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:18,881
But the way I see it
you can either run from it

1002
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:21,882
or learn from it.

1003
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,787
You see? So what are you going to do?

1004
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,491
First, I'm gonna take your stick.

1005
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,857
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!

1006
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:33,362
-Hey! Where are you going?
-I'm going back!

1007
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,452
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

1008
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:54,712
Grubs! Grubs!

1009
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,120
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1010
01:09:06,341 --> 01:09:09,381
It's okay! Whoa, whoa!
It's okay! It's me!

1011
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:13,036
Don't ever do that again.

1012
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,133
Carnivores!

1013
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:17,755
-Have you guys seen Simba?
-l thought he was with you.

1014
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:20,461
He was, but now ! can't find him.
Where is he?

1015
01:09:21,224 --> 01:09:22,974
You won't find him here!

1016
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,040
The king has returned.

1017
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:29,172
I can't believe it. He's gone back!

1018
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,239
Gone back? What do you mean?

1019
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:34,214
Hey, what's goin’ on here?

1020
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:36,774
-Who's the monkey?
-Simba went back to challenge Scar.

1021
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,036
-Who?
-Scar.

1022
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,877
-Who's got a scar?
-No, it's his uncle.

1023
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:41,693
-The monkey's his uncle?
-No!

1024
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:45,134
Simba's gone back to challenge
his uncle to take his place as king.

1025
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:45,987
Simba, wait up!

1026
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:53,589
-It's awful, isn't it?
-I didn't want to believe you.

1027
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:55,897
What made you come back?

1028
01:10:56,519 --> 01:10:58,769
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

1029
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,195
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1030
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,931
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1031
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:07,017
If l don't fight for it, who will?

1032
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,120
-I will.
-It's gonna be dangerous.

1033
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,450
Danger? I laugh in the face of danger.

1034
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,647
Il see nothing funny about this.

1035
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:19,566
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?

1036
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,939
At your service, my liege.

1037
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:25,465
We're gonna fight your uncle for this?

1038
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:29,309
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1039
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:31,885
Talk about your fixer-upper!

1040
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:36,171
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

1041
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:58,871
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1042
01:11:59,382 --> 01:12:01,571
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

1043
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:04,968
-Live bait.
-Good idea. Hey!

1044
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:07,878
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1045
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,614
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

1046
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:12,991
Luau!

1047
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,682
If you're hungry for a hunk
of fat and juicy meat

1048
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:16,514
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here
because he is a treat

1049
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,549
Come on down and dine
on this tasty swine

1050
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,615
All you have to do is get in line

1051
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:22,577
-Are you achin'
-Yep, yep, yep.

1052
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,509
-For some bacon?
-Yep, yep, yep.

1053
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:26,234
-He's a big pig
-Yep, yep.

1054
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,315
You could be a big pig, too!

1055
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:36,509
Nala, you find my mother
and rally the lionesses.

1056
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:39,706
I'll look for Scar.

1057
01:12:42,325 --> 01:12:43,845
Sarabi!

1058
01:12:58,708 --> 01:12:59,788
Yes, Scar?

1059
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:03,079
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.

1060
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:06,096
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

1061
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,902
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

1062
01:13:09,252 --> 01:13:12,792
It's over. There is nothing left.

1063
01:13:13,356 --> 01:13:16,786
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

1064
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:20,366
-We're not going anywhere.
-You have sentenced us to death.

1065
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,793
-Then so be it.
-You can't do that.

1066
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:25,149
lam the king. l can do whatever I want.

1067
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,638
If you were half the king Mufasa was...

1068
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,280
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

1069
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,716
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1070
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:44,746
Mufasa?

1071
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:48,092
No. It's me.

1072
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:53,511
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?

1073
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:57,532
It doesn't matter. I'm home.

1074
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,267
Simba?

1075
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:03,508
Simba! I'm a little surprised to see you

1076
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,450
alive.

1077
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:10,369
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1078
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:12,596
Simba, you must understand.

1079
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:15,022
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1080
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:18,250
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

1081
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:20,858
Well, I would, naturally.

1082
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:23,833
However, there is one little problem.

1083
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,870
You see them?

1084
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,780
They think I'm king.

1085
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,442
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

1086
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,670
The choice is yours, Scar.

1087
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:38,232
Either step down or fight.

1088
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:40,711
Must this all end in violence?

1089
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,847
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1090
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:48,248
-Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
-That's not gonna work, Scar.

1091
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:50,135
I've put it behind me.

1092
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,959
But what about your faithful subjects?

1093
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,000
Have they put it behind them?

1094
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,130
Simba, what is he talking about?

1095
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:00,205
So you haven't told them
your little secret.

1096
01:15:00,763 --> 01:15:03,783
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1097
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,923
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1098
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,519
lam.

1099
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,263
It's not true.

1100
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:22,058
Tell me it's not true.

1101
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:26,663
-It's true.
-You see? He admits it!

1102
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:29,749
-Murderer!
-No! It was an accident.

1103
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,472
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead!

1104
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:35,423
-Do you deny it?
-No.

1105
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:39,294
-Then you're guilty.
-No, I'm not a murderer!

1106
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:41,952
Simba, you're in trouble again,

1107
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,964
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1108
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,273
and now everyone knows why!

1109
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:50,735
Simba!

1110
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:58,939
Now, this looks familiar.

1111
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:04,600
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.

1112
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,467
Yes. l remember.

1113
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:11,580
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1114
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:17,183
And here's my little secret.

1115
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:20,824
I killed Mufasa.

1116
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:25,562
No! Murderer!

1117
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,902
-No, Simba, please.
-Tell them the truth.

1118
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,531
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...

1119
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,352
All right.

1120
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,427
All right.

1121
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:39,133
I did it.

1122
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,201
So they can hear you.

1123
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:45,141
I killed Mufasa!

1124
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,290
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin’ through. Hot stuff.

1125
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:32,432
-Let me out! Let me out!
-Let me in! Let me in!

1126
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,270
Please, don't eat me.

1127
01:17:36,519 --> 01:17:37,949
Drop 'em!

1128
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:40,267
-Hey, who's the pig?
-Are you talkin’ to me?

1129
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,369
-He called him a pig.
-To me?

1130
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,298
-Shouldn't have done that.
-To me?

1131
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,600
-Now they're in for it.
-They call me Mr. Pig!

1132
01:17:53,536 --> 01:17:55,906
Take that, you stupid...

1133
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:58,052
Take that and that!

1134
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,687
Run, you yellow-belly!

1135
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,519
-Murderer.
-Simba. Simba, please.

1136
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:30,366
-Please, have mercy. I beg you.
-You don't deserve to live.

1137
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:35,686
But Simba, l am family.

1138
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:39,515
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.

1139
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,312
It was their fault. It was their idea.

1140
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:44,458
Why should I believe you?

1141
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,590
Everything you ever told me was a lie.

1142
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:49,707
What are you going to do?

1143
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:53,184
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

1144
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:55,899
No, Scar.

1145
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:57,865
I'm not like you.

1146
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,000
Simba, thank you. You are truly noble.

1147
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:04,807
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?

1148
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:06,767
Tell me. l mean, anything.

1149
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,398
Run.

1150
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,914
Run away, Scar,

1151
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,240
and never return.

1152
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,196
Yes.

1153
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,415
Of course.

1154
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:21,090
As you wish,

1155
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,330
your Majesty!

1156
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,990
My friends!

1157
01:20:20,349 --> 01:20:23,749
Friends? I thought he said
we were the enemy.

1158
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:26,713
Yeah. That's what I heard.

1159
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:28,456
Ed?

1160
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,671
No. Let me explain.
No, you don't understand!

1161
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:39,439
No, I didn't mean... No! No!

1162
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,590
It is time.

1163
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:15,568
Remember.

1164
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:31,040
Se-fi-le

1165

On the path unwinding

In the circle

1177
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:18,224
The circle of life

1178
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:20,447
Circle of

01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:22,746
Life
