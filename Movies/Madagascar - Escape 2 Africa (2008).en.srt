1
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,947
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,344
No, no, son. Over here.

3
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,785
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

4
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,412
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

5
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,654
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

6
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,568
Da-da.

7
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,997
Now, Alakay, let me
show you something, OK?

8
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,698
You see this mark?

9
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,199
You and me are the same.

10
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,582
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

11
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,482
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

12
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,298
No, Alakay. No dancing!

13
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,225
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

14
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,777
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

15
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,416
Now, come on, let's try it again.

16
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,431
No, Alakay.

17
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,900
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

18
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,286
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

19
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,759
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

20
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,109
Look on the bright side. After 1 defeat
you and become alpha lion,

21
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,461
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

22
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,819
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

23
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,569
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

24
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,822
I'm better looking, ! have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

25
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,342
..and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

26
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,619
We fight on three. One...

27
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,669
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

28
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,640
Two, three!

29
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,477
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

30
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,623
Don't you forget it.

31
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,648
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

32
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,326
Alakay?

33
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,852
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

34
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,040
This one's a beauty.

35
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,386
He'll be worth a few bucks.

36
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,586
It just gets easier and easier.

37
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,966
Daddy!

38
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,941
Alakay! Alakay!

39
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,363
Alakay!

40
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,941
Da-da!

41
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,451
No! No! No!

42
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:26,736
Alakay!

43
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,244
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,808
Da-da!

45
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,492
Alakay!

46
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,966
Daddy!

47
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,739
I've been around the world
in the pouring rain

48
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,203
Feeling out of place
and feeling strange

49
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,308
Take me to a place
where they know my name

50
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,649
â€˜Cause I ain't met nobody
that looks the same

51
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,839
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

52
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,479
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

53
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,743
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

54
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,916
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

55
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,329
I need my peoples, my peoples
Take me to my peoples

56
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,079
Play that jungle fever
Show 'em some love

57
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,385
Show love

58
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,848
Just gotta have someone
Gotta have someone

59
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,491
To relate to, to relate to

60
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,430
I've found a brand new home

61
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,585
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home

62
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,072
Feeling right at home
I've found a brand new home

63
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,515
See I been traveling
Been traveling forever...

64
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,922
- [ don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

65
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,326
He's kind of a showoff.

66
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,715
You think he's cute?

67
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,123
Roar!!

68
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,688
The King of New York City...

69
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,842
...Alex the Lion!

70
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,094
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

71
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,332
The guy's an animal.

72
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:04,137
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

73
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,448
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

74
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,897
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

75
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:14,077
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

76
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,361
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

77
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,650
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

78
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,871
He was a very bad kitty.

79
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,921
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

80
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,310
to have the animals sent to Africa,

81
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,586
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals

82
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,459
was reported missing today.

83
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,388
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo

84
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,179
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

85
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,048
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

86
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,889
I like to move it, move it

87
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,820
He likes to move it, move it

88
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,816
She likes to move it, move it

89
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,488
- We like to
- Move it!

90
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:38,837
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

91
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,926
- We like to
- Move it!

92
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,234
Weill miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

93
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,841
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

94
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,920
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

95
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,705
Seriously though, call. OK?

96
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,738
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

97
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,928
You can't leave without this!

98
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,283
Surprise, freaks!

99
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,066
Shake it! Shake it.

100
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,836
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

101
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,149
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

102
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,424
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

103
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:25,390
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that 1 am coming with you.

104
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,483
Oh, no, thank you.

105
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,716
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

106
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,445
Until 1 return with the spoils
from the new country...

107
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,840
... Stevie will be in charge!

108
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,697
I don't think they like that idea.

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,110
What are you saying, Stevie?

110
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,100
No.

111
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,265
Could we...? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

112
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,270
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

113
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,574
Let them eat cake!

114
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,456
King Julien, wait for me!

115
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,749
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

116
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,889
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

117
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,215
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

118
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,180
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

119
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,069
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

120
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,934
- Struts.
- Check.

121
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,136
- Flaps.
- Check.

122
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,743
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

123
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,862
You guys!

124
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,361
Copsie-daisy!

125
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,173
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

126
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,814
But it'll have to do. Attention.

127
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,576
This is your captain speaking.

128
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,614
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head

129
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,714
then kiss your... good-bye.

130
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,963
New York City, here we come!

131
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,658
Pray to your personal God
this hunk of junk flies.

132
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,961
Personal God, hunk...? What?

133
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,407
We are go, sir.

134
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,415
Open the door! I'm outside!

135
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,563
If cabin pressure is lost,

136
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,104
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

137
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,285
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

138
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,999
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

139
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,756
Launch!

140
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:18,974
- Launch!
- Launch!

141
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,346
Gremlin!

142
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,168
Hey, Mort.

143
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,460
Hi!

144
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:13,609
That was weird.

145
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,690
- Somebody's dreaming.
- [ think l saw Mort on the plane wing.

146
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,953
You got Madagascar on the brain.

147
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,612
I know I'm gonna miss it.

148
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,687
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

149
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,745
Like when you bit me on the butt?

150
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,920
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

151
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,834
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

152
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,868
Are the butts next to the croutons?

153
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,248
You don't need to be sarcastic.

154
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,434
When we get back, I might sign up
for the breeding program.

155
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,968
Breeding program?

156
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,923
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

157
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,516
Settle down, have a relationship.

158
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,869
I can see that.

159
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,950
What? Like dating?

160
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,787
Yeah, dating.

161
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,275
Other... other guys?

162
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,562
What do you mean, other guys?

163
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,564
Darn it!

164
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,466
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

165
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,844
I'm gonna go check.

166
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,228
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

167
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,342
It's so funny!

168
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,141
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

169
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,759
To laugh!

170
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,442
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

171
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:39,041
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

172
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,772
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

173
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,528
- In-flight slave.
- Can l help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

174
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,301
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

175
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,570
We were checking on our drink order.

176
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,853
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

177
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,458
- l guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?

178
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,774
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

179
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,192
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

180
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,105
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

181
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,549
Weill go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

182
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,358
Skipper, look.

183
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,175
Analysis.

184
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:17,053
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

185
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,560
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

186
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:20,769
That too, sir.

187
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,137
Right! Rico?

188
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,405
Manual!

189
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,204
Problemo solved.

190
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,522
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

191
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,366
We've lost engine one...

192
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,045
..and engine two is no longer on fire.

193
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,948
Buckle up, boys.

194
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,490
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

195
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,036
Attention! This is your captain.

196
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,655
l have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

197
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,956
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

198
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,806
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

199
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,085
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

200
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,657
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

201
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,692
I can fly!

202
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:22,224
This could be it, Marty! 1 want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

203
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,552
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

204
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,159
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!

205
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,215
I broke your iPod!

206
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,874
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

207
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,263
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

208
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,269
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

209
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,081
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

210
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,036
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

211
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,946
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

212
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,929
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

213
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,035
Rico, you've had your fun.

214
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,440
Pull up.

215
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,051
Gear down.

216
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,034
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

217
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,926
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

218
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,261
I said, kiss it!

219
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,177
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

220
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,977
I believe that's checkmate.

221
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,514
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

222
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,773
Oh, we're here.

223
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,566
What in the world?

224
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,189
What happened to the plane?
What did yâ€˜all do to the plane?

225
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,813
I'm OK. I'm alive.

226
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,714
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

227
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,059
Kowalski, casualty report.

228
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,117
Two passengers unaccounted for.

229
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,016
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

230
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,730
Who says a penguin can't fly?

231
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:34,523
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

232
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,501
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

233
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,354
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

234
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,283
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

235
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,384
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

236
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,207
Kowalski, 1 say we use
this setback to our advantage.

237
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,376
- Where'd you get that number?
- l want you to reconfigure the design.

238
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,454
How do you estimate that?

239
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,873
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

240
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,136
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

241
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:07,456
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

242
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,139
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

243
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,306
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

244
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,288
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

245
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,906
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

246
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,793
Correcto-mundo. Because ! decided to.

247
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,606
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

248
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,247
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

249
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,206
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

250
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,136
Phil! l should wash
your hands out with soap.

251
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,940
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

252
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,053
You know, grit and spit and spit.

253
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,013
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

254
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,419
That don't sound too promising.

255
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,985
You're right. We're stuck here.

256
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,877
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

257
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,308
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

258
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,825
Behold! The lion!

259
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,490
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

260
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,986
Wait, wait, wait! People!

261
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,894
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

262
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,643
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

263
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,297
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

264
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,950
I know you!

265
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,225
You.

266
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,210
It's the bad kitty.

267
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,273
How do you like some of that?!

268
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,455
Come in, Tokyo!

269
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,673
Right in the batteries.

270
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,445
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

271
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,754
Next time, 1 won't go so easy on you!

272
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,371
Thank you, dear.

273
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,017
Moving on!

274
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,159
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

275
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,671
Out of my mind?

276
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,547
Who's out of my mind now?

277
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,005
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

278
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,292
Out of my mind. We're going home.

279
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,170
Message E-4.

280
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,832
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

281
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,599
Please try again later.

282
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,726
Am I trippinâ€™?

283
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,048
All those zebras... like me.

284
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,735
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

285
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,447
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

286
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:04,118
- [ know this place.
- [ think it's Africa.

287
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,506
Africa?

288
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,075
It's got to be.

289
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,763
Our ancestral crib.

290
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,239
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

291
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,935
No, it's more than that. It's like...

292
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,071
...dÃ©ja vu, like I've been here before.

293
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,051
It's like Roots!

294
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,809
No, it's like...

295
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,033
...dÃ©ja vu, like I've been here before.

296
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,595
How!

297
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,766
How!

298
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,228
Me Alex!

299
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,550
Me and me friends fly,

300
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,903
fly in great metal bird.

301
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,678
Then plummet!

302
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,118
Smash ground!

303
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,566
Go boom!

304
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,688
Then here we emerge.

305
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,116
We offer only happiness

306
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,019
and good greetings.

307
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,302
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

308
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,908
Yeah. We just... yeah.

309
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,927
I thought... Sorry.

310
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,102
You came from off the reserve?

311
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,128
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

312
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,625
Don't strain yourself.

313
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,980
What's going on here?

314
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,749
They say they're from off the reserve.

315
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:33,116
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

316
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,492
You look familiar. Do I know you?

317
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,048
How could you survive the hunters?

318
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,480
We didn't see any hunters.

319
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,473
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

320
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,548
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

321
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,222
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

322
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,671
Is there a manager we could talk to?

323
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,726
l see. You're here to challenge me!

324
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,656
What? No! No.

325
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,541
That's what it looks like to me!

326
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,187
Zuba! Wait.

327
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,138
I'm trying to take care of business...

328
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,760
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

329
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:05,927
Alakay?

330
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,029
Is that you?

331
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,357
No, it's Alex. Ix. Like New York Knicks.

332
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,870
Zuba, look!

333
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,830
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

334
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,286
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

335
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,095
A mark.

336
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,548
All right, this is a little weird.

337
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,724
Honey, he's come home.

338
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,877
What?

339
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,825
You've come home.

340
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,322
Son.

341
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:48,602
Dad.

342
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,483
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

343
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,836
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

344
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,603
l got a mom and dad!

345
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,249
My baby's alive!

346
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,850
Dad!

347
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,709
My son!

348
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,924
My son is home!

349
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,875
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

350
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:21,196
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

351
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,006
I thought you hated Zuba.

352
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,520
No, I do. I do. I do.
l hate him. Oh, I do.

353
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,328
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

354
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,840
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

355
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,914
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

356
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,702
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

357
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,579
New York!

358
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:45,581
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

359
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,995
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

360
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,451
This calls for a celebration!

361
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,437
Maurice, I think they like me.

362
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,982
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

363
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,447
Chukka-chukka what?

364
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,708
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

365
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,543
Hey, Marty!

366
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,761
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

367
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,698
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackinâ€™.

368
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,468
That's right! Crack-a-lackinâ€™.

369
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,490
You guys speak
my crack-a-lackin' language.

370
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,073
What? You don't have doctors here?

371
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,745
Not anymore.

372
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,194
Well, what if you catch a cold?

373
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,293
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

374
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,132
You guys really need a doctor.

375
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,291
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

376
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,941
Me? A doctor?

377
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,071
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

378
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,255
Why donâ€™t you have a man? You got worms?

379
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,922
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

380
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,017
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

381
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:08,221
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

382
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,134
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

383
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,073
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

384
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,822
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

385
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,886
Roar!

386
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:25,724
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

387
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,571
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

388
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,443
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

389
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,695
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

390
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:43,102
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, yâ€˜all!

391
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,480
How do I look?

392
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:51,302
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

393
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,293
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

394
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,047
Voila! He's a witch doctor!

395
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,706
My mother will be so happy.

396
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,492
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

397
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:11,606
Here he comes.

398
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,177
I like 'em big

399
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,545
I like 'em chunky

400
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,481
I like 'em big
I like â€˜em plumpy

401
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,265
I like â€˜em round
With somethinâ€™ somethinâ€™

402
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,625
They like my sound
They think I'm funky

403
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,168
Goodness, girl... you huge.

404
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,531
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

405
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,978
You as quick as you are hefty.

406
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,573
So you're Moto Moto?

407
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,863
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

408
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,828
I kind of like it, fatso.

409
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,794
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

410
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,578
Cops!

411
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,768
l hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

412
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:06,071
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

413
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,695
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

414
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,472
They're griping that Alakay
never went through

415
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,705
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

416
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:19,783
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

417
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,526
I forgot about the rite of passage.

418
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,865
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

419
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,430
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

420
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,112
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

421
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:34,897
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

422
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,170
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

423
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,994
If it's tradition, 1 want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

424
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,078
I want to be Alaki.

425
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,413
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

426
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,045
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

427
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,803
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

428
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,194
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

429
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,440
That's my boy!

430
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:05,575
I'm a private dancer

431
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,154
A dancer for money

432
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,084
Any old music will do

433
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,842
Beautiful, isn't it?

434
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,885
It's amazing.

435
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,174
Guys...

436
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,823
.. this is where we belong.

437
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,860
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

438
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,053
Oh, I like that one.

439
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,868
It works on many levels.

440
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,730
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

441
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,328
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

442
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,197
Stations.

443
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,238
Stage one. Go!

444
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,724
Oh, no! What have I done?

445
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,444
Come on, take the bait.

446
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,985
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

447
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,747
Is it dead?

448
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,924
Stage two! Go, go, go!

449
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:21,063
I will give him the kiss of life.

450
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:23,930
Rico!

451
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,886
Rico!

452
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,503
Reverse!

453
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,608
Gas!

454
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,915
Music!

455
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,217
No! Stop! Stop!

456
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,248
Stop!

457
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:42,817
Come back!

458
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,423
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

459
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,929
Is she dead?

460
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:56,764
No!

461
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,673
You hoodlums!

462
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,547
Good heavens! Are you OK?

463
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,652
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

464
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,392
My handbag. Such a good boy.

465
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,846
Nana can't survive without it.

466
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,102
You are one tough cookie.

467
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,077
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

468
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,830
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

469
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,521
Weill wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...

470
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:33,991
Where are you going?

471
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:39,043
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

472
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,039
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

473
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,985
Please! We need to stay...

474
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:48,983
...together.

475
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,032
Fine! We'll go that way!

476
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,667
Does anyone want a hard candy?

477
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,887
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

478
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:05,167
And right here... OK, are you ready?

479
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,622
This is where you always slept.

480
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,428
Oh, man!

481
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:18,547
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

482
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,084
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

483
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,031
- l remember this!
- He remembers.

484
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,187
A little harder than...

485
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,866
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

486
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,180
Is that...?

487
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:34,828
Is that my...?

488
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,165
Is that me?

489
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:40,824
You had the cutest little paws.

490
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,383
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

491
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,341
You did that the day we lost you.

492
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,346
Wow. I was so young.

493
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,543
What happened to me?

494
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,778
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

495
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,032
It was not your fault.

496
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:03,941
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

497
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,060
Far off the reserve.

498
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,178
Finally, had to assume the hunters...

499
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:10,898
.. well...

500
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:14,293
We thought they'd killed you.

501
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,842
But my son fought them off!
Donâ€™t mess with the King of New York!

502
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:20,947
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

503
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:25,063
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

504
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,505
You used to call this "foofie."

505
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,225
"Foofie"?

506
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,480
Foofie.

507
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,058
He doesn't want that.

508
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,720
This is my foofie!

509
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,671
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

510
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:45,743
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

511
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:49,528
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

512
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,168
You'll need all your strength.

513
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,644
I will bring the house down for you.

514
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,567
l hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

515
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,901
Jeez, Mom, really?

516
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,976
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

517
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,001
You were born with it.

518
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,093
Good night, Alakay.

519
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,963
My boy. My own boy.

520
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,401
My son's a king.

521
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,404
My son's a king.

522
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,116
Good night, Mom.

523
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,062
Good night, Alakay.

524
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,278
Foofie.

525
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,040
Look at foofie! My foofie!

526
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,236
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

527
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,550
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

528
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,219
I think we're lost.

529
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,018
Nana, do you know where you're going?

530
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:06,506
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

531
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,195
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

532
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:14,335
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

533
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,093
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

534
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,589
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

535
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,656
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?

536
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,263
How will we all survive?

537
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:30,008
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

538
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:35,083
You can let nature
get the best of you,

539
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,647
or you can get the best of nature.

540
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,785
Gather â€˜round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

541
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,426
Yeah.

542
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,690
We survive the concrete jungle!

543
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,206
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

544
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,150
- Am I right?
- She's right.

545
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,446
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

546
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:01,883
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

547
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,397
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

548
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,846
If we can make it there,

549
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,424
we can make it anywhere!

550
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,824
I'm coming, King Julien!

551
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,649
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

552
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,653
No, shark, no! Sit!

553
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,884
Why am I laughing?

554
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,520
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

555
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,198
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

556
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,393
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

557
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,304
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

558
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,470
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

559
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,405
Darn you, Darwin!

560
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:10,037
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

561
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,352
Rico! You're coming with me!

562
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,815
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

563
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,536
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

564
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,096
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

565
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,265
Oh, ! doubt that.

566
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,897
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

567
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,799
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

568
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:49,062
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

569
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:50,841
Any questions?

570
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,532
Good! Let's get to work.

571
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:03,676
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

572
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,425
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

573
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:17,902
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

574
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,560
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

575
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,668
Sure, mister.

576
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:28,416
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

577
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,050
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

578
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,860
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

579
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,257
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

580
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,534
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

581
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,960
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

582
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,932
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

583
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,134
Well, l wish I could help,

584
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:54,799
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

585
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,573
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

586
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,764
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

587
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:04,558
Makunga, right? Thank you.

588
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,186
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

589
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:08,922
Shake it out.

590
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,364
A five, six, seven, eight.

591
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,973
Let's go, let's do this.

592
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,800
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

593
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,109
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

594
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,633
On it, Mom!

595
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,401
Who will be the first participant?

596
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,966
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

597
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,672
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

598
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:48,742
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

599
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,087
Let me see.

600
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,653
I guess I'll pick...

601
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:58,939
... Teetsi?

602
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,242
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

603
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,738
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

604
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,589
Somebody, wake him up!

605
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,917
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

606
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:30,281
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

607
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,832
- Let's dance!
- OK.

608
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,567
But let me warn you
that lam a protÃ©gÃ© of...

609
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,514
...Fosse and Robbins!

610
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,367
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

611
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,563
Dance fight! You got it.

612
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,229
- ls he dancing?
- What's he doing?

613
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,574
I know that boy is not dancing.

614
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,427
This is even better than I thought.

615
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,842
Alakay, turn around!

616
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,958
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

617
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:18,675
Oh, no.

618
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,951
Alakay! Are you hurt?

619
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,013
Yeah, l am.

620
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,069
Did I... did l win?

621
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,527
No, son.

622
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,569
How could this happen?

623
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,464
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

624
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:37,572
lam a king. I'm the King of New York.

625
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,049
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

626
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,627
Perform?

627
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,651
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

628
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,846
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

629
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,485
..his own son?

630
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,563
Zuba, no.

631
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,562
Zuba, yes.

632
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:03,461
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

633
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,717
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

634
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,571
Dad, what are you doing?

635
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:24,602
Dad, no! You can't do this.

636
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,388
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

637
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:31,808
Anyone?

638
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,900
Someone? No one?

639
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,366
You, sir!

640
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,027
I guess not.

641
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,926
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

642
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,702
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

643
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,854
Teetsi! Get the hat.

644
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:54,178
As your new leader,
l hereby banish Alakay!

645
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,729
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

646
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,648
..and leave the watering hole

647
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,508
for a thousand years, or life!

648
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,615
Whichever comes last.

649
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,306
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

650
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:15,656
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

651
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,511
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

652
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,009
What did you expect?!

653
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:24,248
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

654
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,336
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!

655
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,415
No, I guess not. You dance!

656
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:33,284
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

657
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,281
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

658
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,207
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

659
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:41,651
A real lion.

660
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,030
Thanks.

661
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:48,842
Thanks a lot.

662
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,056
Saw.

663
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:02,716
Suture.

664
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:05,885
Swab.

665
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,487
You're in my light, Stephen.

666
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,225
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

667
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:14,768
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

668
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,630
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

669
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,200
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

670
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,716
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

671
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,208
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

672
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:29,790
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

673
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,995
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

674
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:38,161
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

675
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:41,634
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

676
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:44,558
This won't hurt a bit.

677
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:48,672
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spot just like that.

678
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,920
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

679
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,335
Wednesday, no Joe?

680
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,750
l can breathe! Thanks, doc!

681
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:01,698
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

682
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:05,607
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

683
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,950
But I've never heard of it.

684
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:11,149
I mean... 1 donâ€™t have any penicillin.

685
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,756
I'll need a CAT scan
just to get started!

686
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,048
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

687
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,036
Ta-dal!!

688
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,747
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

689
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,476
Hollah!

690
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:37,397
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

691
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,725
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

692
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,421
Well, you can try all you want to,

693
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,560
but it takes years of practice.

694
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,662
You'll never get a tight stream

695
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:50,904
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

696
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,422
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

697
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,525
Ta-da!

698
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,350
How did you...? You guys got it
right out of the box!

699
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,393
- If you can do it...
- ...we can do it.

700
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:18,761
It's in our blood!

701
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,583
l always thought I was a bit unique.

702
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,036
We are unique!

703
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,034
We are like a force of nature!

704
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:27,863
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

705
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:30,189
Exactly the same!

706
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,552
Exactly the same.

707
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:38,426
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

708
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,273
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

709
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:45,745
Nice.

710
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,899
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

711
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:04,177
I've ruined my parentsâ€™ lives.

712
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:06,328
That is definitely not crack-a-lackinâ€™.

713
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:10,731
It is lackin' in the crackinâ€™,
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

714
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:12,589
So...

715
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:16,808
.. there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

716
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:18,278
Hey, guys.

717
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,080
Is this place great or what?!

718
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,136
I'd go with "or what."

719
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:26,634
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

720
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:29,775
...[ got a date with Moto Moto.

721
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,231
Who's Moto Moto?

722
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,649
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

723
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:38,477
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

724
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,546
It means, "Hot Hot."

725
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:41,925
â€œHot Hot"?

726
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,606
When did you start parlez-ing African?

727
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,072
It's in my blood.

728
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:49,627
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

729
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,661
Melman, why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

730
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:54,977
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

731
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,683
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town!

732
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,314
Whoa, guys.

733
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:00,994
Main Street's mine!

734
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,152
Well, you can have it!

735
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,117
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

736
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:09,642
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

737
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,297
Melman, just tell her.

738
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:15,015
What? What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.

739
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,930
I guess I'll go, then.

740
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,398
Don't bother.

741
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:21,796
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

742
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:26,116
- [thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

743
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:28,261
- Marty?
- Marty?

744
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:29,576
Marty?

745
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,108
What the heck is going on?

746
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:36,973
You're not...? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

747
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:40,085
You thought that guy...

748
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:41,601
.. was me?

749
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:44,256
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

750
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:46,562
You thought I was him?

751
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,914
You guys kind of do look a little...

752
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,573
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

753
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,369
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

754
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,596
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

755
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,826
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

756
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,253
I'm just like any other zebra.

757
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:05,982
No. Of course you're different!

758
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:07,687
How?

759
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,420
OK, I can't tell you apart.

760
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,482
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

761
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,202
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

762
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:20,202
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

763
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:22,984
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

764
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:26,464
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

765
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,973
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

766
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,759
It's always about you, isn't it?

767
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:37,248
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

768
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:40,205
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

769
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,558
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

770
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,841
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

771
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:50,328
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

772
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:55,866
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

773
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,823
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

774
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,430
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

775
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:05,687
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

776
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,803
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

777
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,586
Nice hat, you showoff!

778
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,591
Marty...

779
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,067
...don't go.

780
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:21,957
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

781
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,098
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

782
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,433
Look, Maurice!

783
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:29,882
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

784
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,804
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

785
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,212
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

786
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:41,573
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

787
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,239
I'm terminal, you know?

788
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:48,616
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

789
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,186
That's a bummer, man.

790
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,129
lf l, King Julien... that's my name...

791
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,692
..only had two days left to live,

792
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:58,554
l would do all the things

793
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,986
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

794
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,024
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

795
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:08,218
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

796
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:10,556
make my living out of it.

797
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:23,779
You know what else I would do?
l would invade a neighboring country

798
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:27,948
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

799
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,192
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

800
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:34,171
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

801
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:38,299
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

802
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:42,296
- There is this one thing.
- What? Tell me.

803
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,470
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

804
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,190
I never told Gloria
how I feel about her.

805
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,219
What is it? Please tell me!

806
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,824
l never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

807
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,751
How I've always felt about her.

808
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,630
Fine. Don't tell me!

809
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:02,623
Is ita woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

810
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:07,003
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

811
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:09,564
Yeah. Yeah.

812
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:11,567
You're right.

813
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,739
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

814
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,134
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

815
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,066
Just a little, or almost all the way.

816
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:25,172
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

817
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:28,736
.. just lips' distance
away from each other.

818
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,439
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

819
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,942
Actually, it's more like love her.

820
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:40,048
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

821
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:43,661
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

822
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,641
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

823
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,467
- He didn't hear you.
- l can't hear you!

824
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,446
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

825
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,939
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

826
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,189
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

827
00:51:57,648 --> 00:52:00,078
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

828
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,188
Do you feel it?

829
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:04,803
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

830
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:09,732
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

831
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:13,224
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

832
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,921
I love that happy little head.

833
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,237
She love

834
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,129
Moto Moto

835
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:22,345
She love

836
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:23,943
Moto Moto

837
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,361
She loves me
She loves my eyes

838
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:31,375
She loves me
She loves my thighs

839
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:33,726
She loves my roundness

840
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,654
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

841
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:41,825
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

842
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,996
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

843
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,287
She love me...

844
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,032
...'cause she love me

845
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,637
Moto Moto...

846
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:55,082
...before things get too serious, well,

847
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:59,316
l was wondering,
if l were to, for example, stay here...

848
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:01,314
.I'd like to ask you...

849
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:05,622
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

850
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:08,357
l have so many questions.

851
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,839
I promise the answer will always be yes.

852
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,662
Unless no is required.

853
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:18,809
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

854
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:22,584
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

855
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,700
OK. Other than that.

856
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:26,462
Let's see.

857
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:29,367
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

858
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:31,844
Right.

859
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:36,061
My gosh, girl, you huge.

860
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:37,482
You said that.

861
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:39,598
Yeah, that's right.

862
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,294
We don't have to talk no more.

863
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:43,803
Gloria!

864
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:46,149
Gloria.

865
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:47,543
Melman.

866
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:53,003
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

867
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:58,191
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

868
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:02,226
- l guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

869
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,080
Apology accepted.

870
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:08,471
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

871
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:12,217
OK. Well, that's it, then.

872
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,333
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

873
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:18,243
No. No, that's not it.

874
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:22,687
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

875
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,490
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

876
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:29,350
If was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

877
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:33,043
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers. OK?

878
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,030
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

879
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,654
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

880
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,470
No crust, the way she likes it.

881
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:44,841
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

882
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,582
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

883
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:52,305
She has the most amazing laugh.

884
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:58,723
That's what I would do if l were you.

885
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,479
But I'm not, so you do it.

886
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,560
OK.

887
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:06,939
What?

888
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,261
That was beautiful.

889
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,765
Anyways, where were we?

890
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:15,781
I'm "huge"?

891
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,211
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

892
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,323
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

893
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:26,596
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

894
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:30,701
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

895
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,431
And making me look like a fool!

896
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,154
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

897
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:54,987
Coward.

898
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,380
The water. It's gone.

899
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,609
It's never gone dry before.

900
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:13,421
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

901
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:16,707
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

902
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:19,694
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

903
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,160
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

904
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,822
Makunga, what do we do?

905
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:25,391
Quiet!

906
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:30,406
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

907
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:33,542
Weill all have to fight for it.

908
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,044
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

909
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,171
That's not fair. You'd win!

910
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:40,699
Exactly, Shirley.

911
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:41,901
I'm Bob...

912
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,529
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

913
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:48,833
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

914
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:52,573
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

915
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,556
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

916
00:56:57,381 --> 00:56:59,370
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

917
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,010
Hunters would shoot us!

918
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:02,917
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

919
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,830
I left the reserve!

920
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,015
And survived.

921
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,258
Il can do something about this.

922
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,370
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

923
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,835
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

924
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,156
You?

925
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:21,986
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

926
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:26,949
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, 1 see you're all set!

927
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:32,678
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

928
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,100
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

929
00:57:42,326 --> 00:57:43,496
Zuba would know what to do.

930
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,537
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

931
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:47,836
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

932
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,138
All right, fine!

933
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,674
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

934
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:05,784
Marty?

935
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,568
Hey! Marty!

936
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:22,941
Marty?

937
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,369
Marty.

938
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,104
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

939
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,539
Excuse me! Excuse me!

940
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,772
Hi. Is Marty in there?

941
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,712
Anyone seen Marty?

942
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,920
Which one of us is Marty?

943
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,992
All right. Well, if you see him,

944
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:47,529
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

945
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,321
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

946
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,687
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

947
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,064
You can't leave the reserve!

948
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:08,914
What are you doing?

949
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:11,246
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

950
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:13,826
Could you leave the hat?

951
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,544
Marty! 1 know you're in there.

952
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,483
Before I go, 1 got something
I want to say.

953
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,846
You've been a great friend.

954
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:26,263
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

955
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,403
that I never think of you having any.

956
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,223
l wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

957
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,646
Just like back at the zoo.

958
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:39,522
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

959
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:42,337
I just want you to know that I...

960
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:45,157
You're one in a million.

961
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,492
This is touching.

962
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,044
It is touching.

963
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:52,623
So could you turn around
so l can tell you to your face?

964
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,473
That's right. Gotcha!

965
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,339
l see you in there! Yeah, you.

966
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,428
You, right there.

967
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,480
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

968
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,298
That's you, Marty.

969
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,363
I know it's you.

970
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:12,217
Know what makes you special?

971
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:16,709
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

972
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:18,941
You're a dreamer, Marty.

973
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,636
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

974
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,470
and horrible taste in friends.

975
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,869
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

976
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:32,855
OK, I'm in.

977
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,146
Marty, you can't come with me.

978
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:37,049
You don't have a choice.

979
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,445
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

980
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,568
The people will get you!

981
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,920
Don't lose the hat!

982
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,216
Bye, hat!

983
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:55,911
Any water?

984
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,442
No, just more diamonds and gold.

985
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,291
Don't give up hope.

986
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:09,080
Listen up! I will help you!

987
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,249
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

988
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:15,633
I, your beloved King Julien

989
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:20,573
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

990
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,968
in the volcano!

991
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:28,837
What does that do?

992
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:31,559
What does that do? Excellent question.

993
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,875
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

994
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:38,835
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

995
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:41,563
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

996
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,418
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough."

997
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:46,913
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

998
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,410
"] don't want another sacrifice!"

999
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:52,463
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

1000
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:58,064
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

1001
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,917
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you.

1002
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:03,529
What?

1003
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,109
Does it work?

1004
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:07,739
No! I mean, yes.

1005
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:09,835
Well, Maurice?

1006
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,410
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

1007
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:15,307
Weill do it!

1008
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:17,703
Excellent!

1009
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,935
Now all l need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

1010
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,222
and get eaten by gods.

1011
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,458
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

1012
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,944
l need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

1013
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:36,025
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

1014
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,466
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

1015
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,451
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

1016
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,719
Melman, what is wrong with you?

1017
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:59,337
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

1018
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,793
Are you nuts?

1019
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:04,448
l want you to know, back at the zoo,

1020
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:07,778
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

1021
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,258
It was always you.

1022
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:12,727
Seeing you every day.

1023
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,989
That's what kept me going.

1024
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:20,678
Melman! Wait!

1025
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:26,098
Melman! Melman! Melman!

1026
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:31,629
You going to mope like this all day?

1027
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:34,086
Don't "hmph" me.

1028
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,763
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

1029
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:42,561
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

1030
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,089
What are you saying, woman?

1031
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:49,949
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

1032
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:00,973
Zubal

1033
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,598
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

1034
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,500
What do you want?

1035
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:06,825
It's awful.

1036
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:09,163
The watering hole is dried up.

1037
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:12,026
Dried up? That's impossible!

1038
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,089
There's nothing left!

1039
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:17,694
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

1040
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,941
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1041
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,925
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

1042
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,594
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

1043
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,986
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

1044
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,050
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1045
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,465
Hurry, Zuba!

1046
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,404
I'm so parched.

1047
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,964
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1048
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:55,401
Weill slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

1049
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,545
Why are we doing this?

1050
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,957
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

1051
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:03,944
l want to show him I'm a real lion.

1052
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,080
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1053
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:12,317
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

1054
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,062
What?!

1055
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,750
As far as my dad is concerned.

1056
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,326
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

1057
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:22,663
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

1058
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,869
Marty, this is it!

1059
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,412
This is the clog! Come on.

1060
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,632
Well, there's the water.

1061
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,259
Stay down. Look at that.

1062
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:44,956
Knit one, purl two.

1063
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:46,268
It's her.

1064
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:47,966
- Is this right?
- Very good.

1065
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:49,944
Nana, slow down.

1066
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,676
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

1067
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:55,132
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

1068
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:57,642
We need dynamite. Got any?

1069
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:01,597
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

1070
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,880
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

1071
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,442
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

1072
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,258
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

1073
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:13,985
No, no! Squiggly squid!

1074
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:15,564
Etch A Sketch!

1075
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:18,569
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

1076
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,040
- Run, Marty!
- l can't leave you here!

1077
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:28,111
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

1078
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:31,365
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

1079
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,679
Save us
We love you

1080
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,295
OK.

1081
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:40,134
OK, OK, OK.

1082
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,953
- Save us
- Melman

1083
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:50,759
- We love you
- Melman

1084
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:51,910
Save us

1085
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,248
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

1086
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:56,361
- Melman
- We love you

1087
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,049
- Melman
- Save us

1088
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,688
Here we go! Here we go!

1089
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,801
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

1090
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,510
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

1091
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:10,130
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

1092
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:13,317
So Melman's not dying!

1093
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,503
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

1094
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,036
Melman!

1095
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:19,604
Move!

1096
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,313
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

1097
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:28,120
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1098
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,647
Yes!

1099
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,828
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

1100
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,196
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

1101
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:39,858
Because...

1102
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,735
You can't do this, Melman.

1103
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,670
First, that hurts.

1104
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:05,896
Second, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

1105
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:08,569
Melman, I gotta know...

1106
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:12,243
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

1107
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:14,786
Of course I did.

1108
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,131
- That's crazy.
- Itis?

1109
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:23,573
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

1110
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:27,064
...to find out the perfect guy for me

1111
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:29,197
lived right next door.

1112
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,456
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

1113
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:35,316
You and me for the next 18 hours.

1114
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,812
I'll take whatever you got.

1115
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:45,287
- Maurice, what happened?
- l believe the fat lady has sung.

1116
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:48,245
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

1117
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:52,138
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

1118
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:54,822
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

1119
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:01,207
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

1120
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,228
Now, maternity leave.

1121
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,576
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1122
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,265
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

1123
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,225
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

1124
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:15,609
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

1125
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:19,895
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1126
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:27,382
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

1127
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,446
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1128
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:42,346
Finally.

1129
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,053
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

1130
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,740
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

1131
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:55,984
This is wrong.

1132
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:59,389
You see? You are survivors.

1133
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:03,236
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1134
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,473
You can't eat a lion.

1135
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:07,434
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

1136
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:09,757
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1137
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,772
She's out of her mind, people!

1138
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:16,668
I'm from New York City!

1139
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,316
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

1140
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,093
Dad!

1141
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:32,878
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

1142
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,008
Stay behind me.

1143
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,110
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

1144
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:41,907
Stay back!

1145
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,155
You'd let your dinner get away?

1146
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,677
- What are you doing?
- The only thing 1 know how to do.

1147
01:10:58,321 --> 01:10:59,191
What the heck?

1148
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,477
Hey, I know those moves.

1149
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,126
Alex?

1150
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,728
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

1151
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:15,537
It is Alex!

1152
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,112
Only one lion can move like that!

1153
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,950
He's beautiful.

1154
01:11:25,348 --> 01:11:26,218
I can't believe it.

1155
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,022
How does he do that?

1156
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,234
What are you doing?

1157
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,979
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

1158
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:53,952
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

1159
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,604
Butterfly!

1160
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,092
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1161
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,912
Roar!

1162
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,804
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

1163
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,591
Dad, look out!

1164
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:32,868
What the...

1165
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,652
Alex! Get in!

1166
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,244
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

1167
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:40,355
- What?
- She's got a gun!

1168
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,740
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

1169
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:50,646
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

1170
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:54,154
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

1171
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,820
All right! But it's his funeral.

1172
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,697
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

1173
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,567
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1174
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,269
Come back! That's my dinner!

1175
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,248
Kowalski, full throttle.

1176
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:17,929
Music!

1177
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,348
- l like this song.
- It never gets old.

1178
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:25,328
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

1179
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:29,639
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

1180
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,019
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

1181
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,918
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

1182
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:41,111
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

1183
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:48,407
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

1184
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,328
Are you sure?

1185
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,710
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

1186
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:56,768
No! Medic!

1187
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:02,624
Ramming speed!

1188
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,470
Bring it on!

1189
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,557
Bad kitties.

1190
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,086
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

1191
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,843
The science seemed so solid.

1192
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:30,719
I'd jump right in that volcano
if l wasn't so good at whistling.

1193
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,727
It's you! I found you!

1194
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,082
Mort?

1195
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,443
Bad fishy!

1196
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,331
l wonder if the gods like seafood.

1197
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,295
Let's find out.

1198
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,170
Look, Maurice.

1199
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:09,290
- That was quick.
- I did it!

1200
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,029
I did it! I did it!

1201
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:14,546
OK, you did it!

1202
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,460
Oh, yes!!

1203
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:43,675
Look!

1204
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,982
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

1205
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,546
You did it!

1206
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,961
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1207
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,303
Zuba! Alakay!

1208
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:01,026
You're back!

1209
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,708
I'm so glad you're safe!

1210
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,355
Out of my way.

1211
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,280
Well, well, well.

1212
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:15,517
You know, Zuba, if ! remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

1213
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,014
And you were kicked out.

1214
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:21,786
So don't think that this
changes anything.

1215
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:26,731
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

1216
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,572
Aman bag. Very popular where Iâ€™m from.

1217
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,999
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1218
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:36,894
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

1219
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,510
But you're still banished.

1220
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:41,545
We figured you'd say that.

1221
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,833
My handbag!

1222
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:48,159
You bad kitty!

1223
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:53,611
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1224
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,103
You deserve this, son.

1225
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,356
Welcome to the pride.

1226
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:16,780
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

1227
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,656
No, son. To us!

1228
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:28,800
My son! The King of New York!

1229
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,730
That's my baby!

1230
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,952
Love transcends all differences.

1231
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:47,803
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

1232
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:52,095
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

1233
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:57,121
For better, please.

1234
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,864
What a beautiful, weird couple!

1235
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,120
That's not going to last.

1236
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,183
Can I kiss the bride?

1237
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:08,148
No! Music!

1238
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:10,044
- Struts.
- Check.

1239
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:11,389
- Flaps!
- Check.

1240
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:13,304
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

1241
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,485
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

1242
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,810
See you later!

1243
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,608
Weill be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

1244
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,641
or whenever the gold runs out.

1245
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:25,149
Come back soon!

1246
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:29,854
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1247
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,318
You're right about that!

1248
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,340
As long as I'm with her...

1249
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:37,983
..and you two, I don't care
where we are.

1250
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,904
She has the most amazing laugh.

1251
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,103
Love has no boundaries!

1252
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:49,373
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

1253
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,868
Dad? What's wrong?

1254
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,571
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

1255
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:02,206
- You got me!
- l got you, son!

1256
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,728
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

1257
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,538
I got you, son!

1258
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:13,397
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

1259
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,889
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

1260
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,122
- [don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

1261
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,518
Ain't no Marty here.

1262
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:25,757
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

1263
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:29,232
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1264
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,568
But now that ! found a home
feels like I'm in heaven

1265
01:19:33,035 --> 01:19:35,905
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1266
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:37,982
But now that I'm home

1267
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:41,494
Hey! Shake the hot things!

1268
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,224
