1
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,120
Onward, Chauncey!

2
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,650
To the highest room
of the tallest tower...

3
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,440
.. where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Charming!

4
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,039
This is worse than "Love Letters".
I hate dinner theater!

5
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,110
Me, too.

6
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
Whoa there, Chauncey!

7
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,759
Hark!
The brave Prince Charming approacheth.

8
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,970
Fear not, fair maiden.
I shall slay the monster that guards you...

9
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,100
.. then take my place as rightful king.

10
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,929
What did she say?

11
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,950
It's Shrek!

12
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,760
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

13
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,800
Prepare, foul beast...

14
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,130
..to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

15
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,980
Happy birthday to thee
Happy birthday to thee

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,490
Do you mind?

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,630
Do you mind? Boring!

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,279
Prepare, foul beast...

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,480
Someday you'll be sorry.

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,780
We already are!

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,030
Charming

22
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,170
Mommy...

23
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,040
Don't stop believing!
Mommy's little angel

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,070
You're right. I can't let this happen.

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,400
I can't!

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,840
lam the rightful King of Far Far Away.

27
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,230
And I promise you this, Mother...

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,080
...[ will restore dignity to my throne.

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,710
And this time...

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,280
King Royally Sick
Shrek and Fiona fill in for King

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,150
..No one will stand in my way.

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,810
FAR FAR AWAY

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,640
Good morning.

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,200
Good morning.

35
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,830
Morning breath.

36
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,820
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

37
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,380
Good morning, good morning

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,200
The sun is shining through

39
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,459
Good morning, good morning To you

40
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,670
And you! And you!

41
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,080
They grow up so fast.

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,190
Not fast enough.

43
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,690
You'll be filling in
for the King and Queen.

44
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,829
Several functions
require your attendance, sir.

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,100
Great! Let's get started.

46
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,029
Come on, lazybones.
Time to get moving!

47
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,090
You need to get a pair of jammies.

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,130
SHREK THE THIRD

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,180
I got some sleep and I needed it

50
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,970
Not a lot, just a little bit

51
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,040
Someone's always trying to keep me from it

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,950
It's a crying shame

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,880
It's a royal pain in the neck

54
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,719
I knight thee.

55
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,510
If you're filling in for a king,
you should look like one.

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,600
Can somebody
come in and work on Shrek?

57
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,980
I will see what I can do.

58
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,880
Yeah, wow.

59
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,980
Is this really necessary?

60
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,410
Quite necessary, Fiona.

61
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,110
- I'm Shrek, you twit.
- Whatever.

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,690
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

63
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,859
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

64
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,120
I don't know how much longer
l can keep this up.

65
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,100
I'm sorry, but can you just
try to grin and bear it?

66
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,320
It's just until Dad gets better.

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,680
Shrek?

68
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,450
You look handsome.

69
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,410
Come here, you.

70
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,370
My butt is itching up a storm
and I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

71
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,140
Hey, you! Come here.
What's your name?

72
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,570
Fiddlesworth, sir.

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,940
Perfect.

74
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,599
Ladies and gentlemen...

75
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,710
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

76
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,710
Ahh! You've got it.

77
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,380
A little to the left.

78
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,540
That's it! That's good.

79
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,560
Oh, yeah!
Scratch that thing! You're on it.

80
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,270
Shrek!

81
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,070
My eye!

82
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,340
What are you doing?

83
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,630
Fiona!

84
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,420
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

85
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,239
Shrimp! My favorite!

86
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,160
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Calm down.

87
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,760
Calm down?

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,740
Who do you think we're kidding?
lam an ogre.

89
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,219
I'm not cut out for this, Fiona,
and I never will be.

90
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
I think that went well.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,010
Donkey!

92
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,760
Come on, Shrek!

93
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,140
Some people
just don't understand boundaries.

94
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,300
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,740
.in our vermin-tilled
shack strewn with fungus...

96
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,700
..and filled with
the stench of mud and neglect.

97
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,409
You had me at "vermin-filled".

98
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,590
And, um...maybe even the
pitter-patter of little feet on the floor.

99
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,919
That's right,
the swamp rats will be spawning.

100
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,520
Uh, no.

101
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,890
What I'm thinking of is
a little bigger than a swamp rat.

102
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,390
Donkey?

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,690
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

104
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,110
.. they were little ogre feet?

105
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,369
Honey, let's be rational about this.

106
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,880
Have you seen a baby lately?

107
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,990
They just eat and poop, and they cry...

108
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,329
.. then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

109
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,230
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

110
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,880
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

111
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,500
Shrek, don't you
ever think about having a family?

112
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,060
Right now, you're my family.

113
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,140
Somebody better be dying.

114
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,130
I'm dying.

115
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,620
Harold?

116
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,440
Don't forget to pay the gardener, Lillian.

117
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,570
Of course, darling.

118
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,350
Fiona.

119
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,900
Yes, Daddy?

120
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,520
I know I made many mistakes with you.

121
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,030
It's okay.

122
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,150
But your love for Shrek has...

123
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,480
.. taught me much.

124
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,359
My dear boy...

125
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,430
... am proud to call you my son.

126
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,590
And I'm proud to call you my frog...

127
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
.. King dad-in-law.

128
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,300
Now there is a matter
of business to attend to.

129
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,410
The Frog King...is dead.

130
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,250
Put your hat back on, fool.

131
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,970
Shrek...

132
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,690
.. please come hither.

133
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
Yeah, Dad?

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,670
This kingdom needs a new king.

135
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,250
You and Fiona
are next in line for the throne.

136
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,910
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

137
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,369
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

138
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,370
Come on, Dad. An ogre as king?

139
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,060
That's not such a good idea.

140
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,290
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

141
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,160
Aside from you,
there is only one remaining heir.

142
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,589
Really? Who is he, Dad?

143
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,870
His name is...

144
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,350
.
wo lS...

145
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,930
What's his name?

146
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,610
.
wo lS...

147
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,550
Daddy!

148
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,890
His name is Arthur.

149
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,470
Arthur?

150
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,430
I know you'll do...

151
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,210
.. what's right.

152
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,520
Harold?

153
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,170
Dad? Dad!

154
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,770
Dad?

155
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,810
Do your thing, man.

156
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,950
When you were young and your heart

157
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,380
Was an open book

158
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,000
You used to say live and let live

159
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,480
You know you did,
you know you did You know you did

160
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,890
But if this ever changing world
In which we live in

161
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
Makes you give in and cry

162
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,520
Ye Olde Foot Locker

163
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,580
Say live and let die

164
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,520
Live and let die

165
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,380
Unhappy Hour 5-7 pm

166
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,160
Hey, lady You, lady

167
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,110
Cursing at your life

168
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,250
You're a discontented mother

169
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,410
And a regimented wife

170
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,060
What does a prince
have to do to get a drink here?

171
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,120
Ah, Mabel!

172
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,130
Why they call you an ugly stepsister,
I'll never know.

173
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,280
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

174
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,990
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

175
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,719
What do you want, Charming?

176
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,560
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

177
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,790
And a Fuzzy Navel.

178
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,680
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

179
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,690
We're not your friends.

180
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,750
You don't belong here.

181
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,670
You're absolutely right,
but, I mean, do any of us?

182
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,620
Do a number on his face.

183
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,820
Wait, wait, wait!
We are more alike than you think.

184
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,780
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs
saved Snow White, and what happened?

185
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,380
Oh, what's it to you?

186
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,460
They left you the unfairest of them all.

187
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,670
Now here you are,
hustling pool to get your next meal.

188
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,900
How does that feel?

189
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,690
Pretty unfair.

190
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,199
And you!

191
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,420
Your star puppet abandons
the show to go and find his father.

192
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,150
I hate that little wooden puppet.

193
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,170
And Hook.

194
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,930
Need I say more?

195
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,920
- And you, Frumpypigskin!
- Rumpelstiltskin.

196
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,650
Where's that
firstborn you were promised?

197
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,500
Mabel. Remember how you couldn't
get your little fat foot...

198
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,730
.into that tiny glass slipper?

199
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,470
Cinderella is in Far Far Away right now...

200
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,250
.. eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

201
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,070
.. that has ever done you wrong!

202
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,630
Once upon a time,
someone decided that we were the losers.

203
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,750
But there are two sides to every story...

204
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,340
..and our side has not been told!

205
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,870
So who will join me?
Who wants to come out on top for once?

206
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,000
Who wants their...

207
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,030
..."happily ever after"?

208
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,280
This way, gents.

209
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,569
It's out of my hands, senorita.
The winds of fate have blown on my destiny.

210
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,480
But I will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

211
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,109
As are you.

212
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,520
And, uh, you.

213
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,630
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

214
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,239
I got to go!

215
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,150
I don't wanna leave you either.

216
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,900
But you know how Shrek is
The dude's lost without me.

217
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,929
But don't worry.
I'll send you airmail kisses every day!

218
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,719
Be strong, babies.

219
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,070
Coco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

220
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,889
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

221
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,580
That's my special boy!

222
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,550
Come here, all of you!
Give your daddy a big hug!

223
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,360
Shrek?

224
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,060
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

225
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,670
Come on.
There's no way I could run a kingdom.

226
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,770
That's why your cousin Arthur
is a perfect choice.

227
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,379
It's not that. You see...

228
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,560
And if he gives me trouble,
l always have persuasion and reason.

229
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,050
Here's persuasion...and here's reason.

230
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,920
Fiona...

231
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,910
..soon it's just going to be you, me...

232
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,840
..and our swamp.

233
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,939
It's not going to be just you and me.

234
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,050
All aboard!

235
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,790
It will be. I promise.

236
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,500
I love you.

237
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,600
We Love You Daddy

238
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
That's lovely.

239
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,090
Bye-bye, babies!

240
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,570
Shrek!

241
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,700
- Wait!
- What is it?

242
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,379
I'm...I'm...

243
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,939
I love you, too, honey!

244
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,710
No! I said I'm...

245
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,080
You're what?

246
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,470
I said I'm pregnant!

247
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,950
What was that?

248
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,879
You're going to be a father!

249
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,470
That's great!

250
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,580
Really? I'm glad you think so!

251
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,280
I love you!

252
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,250
Yeah!

253
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,600
Me, too! You!

254
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
I'm going to be an uncle!
I'm going to be an uncle!

255
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,639
And you, my friend, are royally...

256
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,949
Home.

257
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,000
Shrek!

258
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,520
Fiona!

259
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,639
Fiona?

260
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,390
Oh, no.

261
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,060
Better out than in, I always say.

262
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,800
No, no, no!

263
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,210
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

264
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,379
Stop! Hey, wait!

265
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,220
Donkey. Donkey!

266
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,610
Wake up!

267
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,239
Dada!

268
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,400
Shrek! Are you okay?

269
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,960
I can't believe I'm going to be a father.
How did this happen?

270
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,270
Allow me to explain.
When a man has feelings for a woman...

271
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,020
..a powerful urge sweeps over him.

272
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,580
I know how it happened.

273
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,430
I just can't believe it.

274
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,860
How does it happen?

275
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,180
And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon

276
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,170
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon

277
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,780
When you coming home, son?
I don't know when

278
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,170
But we'll get together then, Dad.

279
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,250
Donkey! Can you just cut to the part

280
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,780
where you're supposed
to make me feel better?

281
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,900
You know I love Fiona, boss. Right?

282
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,729
What I am talking about is you,
me, my cousin's boat...

283
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,070
..an ice cold pitcher of mojitos
and two weeks of nothing but fishing.

284
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,420
Don't listen to him!

285
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,050
Having a baby
isn't going to ruin your life.

286
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,280
It's not my life
I'm worried about ruining, it's the kid's.

287
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,580
When have you ever heard the
phrase "as sweet as an ogre”...

288
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,270
..or "as nurturing as an ogre”...

289
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,370
..or "You'll love my dad.
He's a real ogre."

290
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,480
Okay. I get it.

291
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,750
It's not going to be easy.
But you got us to help you.

292
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,720
That's true.

293
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,270
I'm doomed.

294
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,000
You'll be fine.

295
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,689
You're finished.

296
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,330
Uh, with your journey.

297
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,320
Worcestershire

298
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,170
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree"?
Now that sounds fancy!

299
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,919
It's Worcestershire.

300
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,780
Like the sauce?

301
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,280
It's spicy!

302
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,659
They must be expecting us.

303
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,870
What in the shista-shire
kind of place is this?

304
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,709
Well, my stomach aches and my palms
just got sweaty. Must be a high school.

305
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,420
High school?

306
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,020
Ready? Okay!

307
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,320
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

308
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,120
Yeah, we think so, we think so!
And dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

309
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,790
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

310
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,250
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

311
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,840
STUDENT DRIVER

312
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,390
For lo, bro, don't burn
all my frankincense and myrrh.

313
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,830
I'm feeling nauseous from
memories of wedgies and swirlies!

314
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,540
How did you receive wedgies

315
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,600
when you are clearly
not the wearer of underpants?

316
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,420
Let's just say some things
are better left unsaid.

317
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,330
So I was all like, "I'd rather get the
black plague than go out with you."

318
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,890
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

319
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,669
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

320
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,630
I just altered my character
level to +3 superb-ability.

321
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,260
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

322
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,550
Who rolled a +9 dork spell
and summoned the beast and his quadruped?

323
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
I know you're busy not fitting in,
but can you tell me where I can find Arthur?

324
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,399
He's over there.

325
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,640
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

326
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,830
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

327
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,129
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

328
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,800
Sorry.

329
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,850
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

330
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,460
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

331
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,169
It's top secret!

332
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,570
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

333
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,730
Greetings, Your Majesty.

334
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,409
This is your lucky day.

335
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,150
What are you supposed to be?

336
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,300
Some kind of
giant mutant leprechaun or something?

337
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,590
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

338
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,090
Unhand me, monster!

339
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,090
Stop squirming, Arthur.

340
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,410
I'm not Arthur.

341
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,740
lam Lancelot.

342
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,450
That dork over there is Arthur.

343
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,890
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

344
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,770
..but Tiffany thinkest
hou vex her so soothly.

345
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,250
She thought perchance thou would ask her
to the Homecoming Dance.

346
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,750
Excuse me?

347
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,340
Like, whatever. She's into college guys
and mythical creatures.

348
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,840
Oh, Arthur...

349
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,330
..come out, come out, wherever you are!

350
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,710
You better run,
you little punk no-goodniks!

351
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,270
I Suck-eth

352
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,440
The days of
Donkey Dumpy Drawers are over!

353
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,730
ASSEMBLY TODAY!

354
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,639
Hold it.

355
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,160
We're here for the mascot contest.

356
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,580
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

357
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,219
This is a costume?

358
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,360
Worked on it all night long.

359
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,350
Looks pretty real to me.

360
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,750
If he were real, could I do this?

361
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,040
Or this?

362
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,480
If it were real,
that would have been agonizingly painful.

363
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,870
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

364
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,590
Thank you to Professor Primbottom
and his lecture...

365
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,390
..on "just say nay".

366
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,020
And now, without further ado,
let's give a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

367
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,630
..to the winner of
our mascot contest, the...

368
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,989
..ogre?

369
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,010
That's right. I'm the new mascot.

370
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,460
So let's really try
and beat the other guys at...

371
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,710
... whatever it is they're doing!

372
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,970
This is all a bit unorthodox...

373
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,530
Where can I find Arthur Pendragon?

374
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,379
Hey, wait...

375
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,899
Classic.

376
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,790
- You should be ashamed of yourself!
- I didn't do it. They did.

377
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,320
Please don't eat me.

378
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,640
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

379
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,130
I'm not here to eat him!

380
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,050
Time to pack up
your toothbrush and jammies.

381
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,379
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

382
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,200
What?

383
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,390
Artie a king?
More like the Mayor of Loserville!

384
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,229
Burn.

385
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,750
Is this for real?

386
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,730
Absolutely. Clean out your locker,
kid. You have a kingdom to run.

387
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,650
So, wait...I'm really the only heir?

388
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
The one and only.

389
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,240
Give me a second.

390
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,050
My good people...

391
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,680
.. there's a lesson here for all of us.

392
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,740
Next time you're about to dunk a kid's head
in a chamber pot, stop and think,

393
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,500
"Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.

394
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,450
Maybe I should cut him some slack.

395
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,690
‘Cause maybe...just maybe...

396
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,330
..this guy's gonna turn out to be,
I don't know, a king?

397
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,130
Maybe his first royal decree will be
to banish everyone who ever picked on him."

398
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,300
I'm looking at you, jousting team!

399
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,660
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

400
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,000
I've always loved you.

401
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,100
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

402
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,470
.. enjoy your stay here in prison
while I rule the free world!

403
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,340
Okay, let's not overdo it.

404
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,490
I'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n' roll!

405
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,620
You just overdid it.

406
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,889
Look at you!

407
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,540
You look darling.

408
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,700
Just precious. Look at her.

409
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,080
Any cravings since you got pregnant?

410
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,730
No. Not at all.

411
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,280
Do you smell ham?

412
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,270
It's present time!

413
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,850
Fiona, please open mine first.
It's the one in front.

414
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,340
"Congratulations on your new mess mak..."
Oh, mess maker!

415
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,570
"Hopefully this helps. Love, Cinderella."

416
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,600
- Look at that!
- What is it?

417
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,350
It's for the poopies.

418
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,060
Wait...babies poop?

419
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,590
Everyone poops, Beauty.

420
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,030
Fiona!

421
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,750
We all chipped in
for a little present, too.

422
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,260
Ta-da!

423
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,949
You know the baby will love it,
because I do!

424
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,930
Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

425
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,600
Who's this one from?

426
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,340
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you most.

427
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,439
"Have one on me. Love, Snow White."

428
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,889
What is it?

429
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,570
He's a live-in babysitter.

430
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,709
Where's the baby?

431
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,410
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

432
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,000
It's nothing. I have six more at home.

433
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,910
- What does he do?
- Cleaning.

434
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,580
- Feeding.
- Burping.

435
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,950
So, what are Shrek
and I supposed to do?

436
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,150
Work on your marriage.

437
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,820
Thanks, Rapunzel.
What's that supposed to mean?

438
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,810
Come on now, Fiona.
You know what happens.

439
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,880
You're tired all the time.

440
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,790
You start letting yourself go.

441
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,020
Stretch marks.

442
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,439
Say goodbye to romance.

443
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm sorry, but how many of you have kids?

444
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,580
She's right!

445
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,610
A baby will only strengthen
the love Shrek and Fiona have.

446
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,670
How did Shrek react when you told him?

447
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,790
When he first found out, Shrek said...

448
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,130
Onward, my new friends!
To our happily ever afters!

449
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,899
Now...bombs away!

450
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,390
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Peter Pan.

451
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,070
His name's not Peter.

452
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,660
Shut it, Wendy.

453
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,909
BOOTERY

454
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,520
HOOTERS

455
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,030
The One-Eyed Lady

456
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,129
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

457
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,340
You go! Take care of the baby!

458
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,350
Everybody stay calm!
We're going to die!

459
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,710
Everyone in! Now!

460
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,940
Come on! Put some back into it!

461
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,630
We don't have time. Now go!

462
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,470
Quickly, ladies!

463
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,080
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

464
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,360
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

465
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,620
The name doesn't ring a bell.

466
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,440
No bell.

467
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,610
I suggest you freaks cooperate...

468
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,299
..with the new King of Far Far Away!

469
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,880
The only thing you're ever gonna be
king of is King of the Stupids!

470
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,370
- Hook!
- Right!

471
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,690
Avast, ye cookie.

472
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,840
Start talking.

473
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,470
- Gingy!
- Papa!

474
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,920
Settle down now.

475
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,259
On the good ship Lollipop

476
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,680
It's a sweet trip to the candy shop

477
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,109
You!

478
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,820
You can't lie.

479
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,330
So tell me, puppet...where is Shrek?

480
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,339
Well... don't know where he's not.

481
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,700
You don't know where Shrek is?

482
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,049
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

483
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,260
..that I couldn't exactly not say that
is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

484
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,150
So you do know where he is!

485
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,500
On the contrary, I'm possibly more or less

486
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,780
not definitely rejecting the idea

487
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,290
that in no way,
with any amount of uncertainty...

488
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,750
Stop it!

489
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,780
...[ do not know where he shouldn't be.

490
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,190
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't.

491
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,660
Even if he wasn't not where I knew he was,
it could mean...

492
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,060
On the good ship Lollipop

493
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,200
Enough! Shrek went off
to bring back the next heir!

494
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,080
He's bringing back the next heir?

495
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,740
No!

496
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,750
Hook! Get rid of this new "King".

497
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,820
But bring Shrek to me.

498
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,870
I have something special in mind for him.

499
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,220
He'll never fall for your tricks!

500
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,480
Oh, boy.

501
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,650
I can't believe it. Me, a king?

502
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,649
I knew I came from royalty, but...

503
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,940
...[ figured everyone forgot about me.

504
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,480
Oh, no. In fact
the King asked for you personally.

505
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,220
Really? Wow.

506
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,660
But I know it's not all fun and games.

507
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,569
It really is all fun and games, actually.

508
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,100
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

509
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,259
By the way, make sure you hit the boat
just right with the bottle.

510
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,310
Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.

511
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,860
Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks.

512
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,010
This is going to be huge.

513
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,470
Parties, princesses, castles. Princesses.

514
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,589
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

515
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,110
The finest chefs will wait for your order.

516
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,120
And fortunately,
you'll have the royal food tasters.

517
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,960
What do they do?

518
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,180
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

519
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,020
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

520
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,430
Don't worry.
Your bodyguards will keep you safe.

521
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,860
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

522
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,630
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

523
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,310
Really?

524
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,200
The kingdom will look to you
for wisdom and guidance.

525
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,570
Make sure they don't die of famine!

526
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,320
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

527
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,140
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

528
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,720
Festering sores!
You are one funny kitty cat.

529
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,040
What did I say?

530
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,360
We don't want Artie getting the wrong idea.

531
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,340
Artie?

532
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,040
There goes my hip!

533
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,220
Artie! What are you doing?

534
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,150
What does it look like?!

535
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,990
This really isn't up to you.

536
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,830
I don't know anything about being king!

537
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,930
You'll learn on the job!

538
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,100
Sorry, but I'm going back.

539
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,590
Back to what? Being a loser?

540
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,650
Now look what you did!

541
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,790
Look what I did?
Who's holding the wheel, chief?

542
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,460
Shrek!

543
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,130
Land ho!

544
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,940
How humiliating.

545
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,580
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

546
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,610
Now it's "Your Highness"?
What happened to "loser"?

547
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,130
If you think this is getting you
out of anything, it isn't.

548
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,799
We're heading back to
Far Far Away one way or another...

549
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,430
..and you're going to be a father!

550
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,070
What?

551
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,340
You just said "father".

552
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,960
King! You're going to be king!

553
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,930
"You're going to be king!" Yeah, right.

554
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,630
Where are you going?

555
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,990
Far Far Away...from you!

556
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,090
Get back here, young man!

557
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,310
Boss? I don't think he's coming back.

558
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,430
Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

559
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,660
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king?

560
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,549
Come on. Why would I do that?

561
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,600
Besides,
he'll be ten times better at it than me.

562
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,450
Then change your tactics if
you want to get anywhere with him.

563
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,700
You're right, Donkey.

564
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,420
What about this?

565
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,990
- Shrek!
- Come on. It's just a joke.

566
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,040
Still...

567
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,720
Listen, Artie.

568
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,760
If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope,
I feel you, dude.

569
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm not trying to get up in your grill
or raise your roof.

570
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,390
But what I am screamin’ is, yo...

571
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,500
..check out this kazing thazing, bazaby!

572
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,820
If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying

573
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,549
ain't straight trippin’,
say, "Oh, no, you didn't!

574
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,070
You're getting on my last nerve."

575
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,050
And then I'll know it's...I'll know it's wack!

576
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,940
Help!

577
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,080
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

578
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,690
- Artie, wait.
- Come on! Help! Hello?

579
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,650
Greetings, cosmic children of the universe.

580
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,850
Welcome to my serenity circle.

581
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,680
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

582
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,860
Now prepare to...

583
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,910
I knew I should have got that warranty!

584
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,200
Mr. Merlin?

585
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,750
You know this guy?

586
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,660
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

587
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,130
Technically,
l was merely a victim of a level 3 fatigue.

588
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,399
At the request of my therapist,

589
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,920
and the school authorities,
I retired to the tranquility of nature

590
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,260
to discover my divine purpose.

591
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,800
Can I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

592
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,230
Uh, no.

593
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,360
Sure you don't
want to try my Rock Au Gratin?

594
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,750
It's organic.

595
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
Thanks. I ate a boulder on the way in.

596
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,980
We need directions to Far Far Away.

597
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,580
"We"? Who said 1 was going with you?

598
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,660
I did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

599
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,070
If the job's so great, you do it.

600
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,390
Understand this, kid.
No more Mr.Nice Guy from here on out.

601
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,970
That was your Mr. Nice Guy?

602
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,980
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

603
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,050
Why don't you go
terrorize a village and leave me alone!

604
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,509
Was that a crack about ogres?
You get your royal highness to Far Far Away...

605
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,609
.. before I kick it there!
Now, which way am I kicking?

606
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,819
I could tell you, but since you're

607
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,370
in the midst of a self-destructive rage spiral,

608
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,790
it would be karmically irresponsible.

609
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,290
Self-destructive...?
Are you going to help us or not?

610
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,020
Most definitely, but only after you

611
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,150
take the journey to your soul!

612
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,799
I don't think so.

613
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,350
It's either that or primal scream therapy.

614
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,050
All right. Journey to the soul.

615
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,700
Now, all of you,

616
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,180
look into the Fire of Truth

617
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,170
and tell me what you see.

618
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,779
Ooh, charades!

619
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,160
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

620
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,050
Okay, monster...go for it.

621
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,080
l see a rainbow pony.

622
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,020
Excellent work! Now the boy.

623
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,630
This is lame.

624
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,850
You're lame! Now just go for it.

625
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,759
Okay.

626
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,439
There's a baby bird and
a father bird sitting in a nest.

627
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,799
Yes! Stay with it!

628
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,210
The dad just flew away.
Why did he leave the little bird all alone?

629
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,200
It's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

630
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,300
It's going to fall!

631
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,529
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

632
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,410
Okay, I get it. The bird's me.
My dad left. So what?

633
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,810
Look, Artie, um...

634
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,560
Just thought I'd help set the mood...

635
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,850
..for your big heart-to-heart chat.

636
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,130
I know what it's like
to not feel ready for something.

637
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,720
Even ogres get scared.

638
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,190
You know...once in a while.

639
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,600
I know you want me to be king, but I can't.

640
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,620
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be.

641
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,880
Even my own dad knew
l wasn't worth the trouble.

642
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,060
He dumped me at that school
first chance he got...

643
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,040
..and I never heard from him again.

644
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,150
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

645
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,900
I doubt he was worse than mine.

646
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,970
Oh, yeah?

647
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,720
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

648
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,820
I guess I should have realized it.

649
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,859
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

650
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,259
I guess that's pretty bad.

651
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,660
It may be hard to believe,

652
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,960
what, with my
obvious charm and good looks,

653
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,980
but people used to think
l was a monster.

654
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,570
And for a long time, I believed them.

655
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,220
But after a while,

656
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,540
you learn to ignore
the names people call you

657
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,080
and just trust who you are.

658
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,990
You know...you're okay, Shrek.

659
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,150
You just need to do a little less yelling
and use a little more soap.

660
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,210
Thanks, Artie.

661
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,650
The soap's because you stink...really bad.

662
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,339
Yeah...1 got that.

663
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,870
This place is filthy!

664
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,850
I feel like a hobo.

665
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,520
I'm sorry, but this isn't working for me.

666
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,830
Everything's always about you.
It's not like your attitude is helping.

667
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,610
Maybe it just bothers you
l was voted fairest in the land.

668
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,919
You mean in that rigged election?

669
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,810
Give me a break. "Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

670
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,920
..let down thy golden extensions!"

671
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,480
Ladies, let go of your petty complaints
and let's work together!

672
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,410
So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

673
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,670
in this stinkhole until we rot.

674
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,029
No, we get inside and
find out what Charming's up to.

675
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,850
I know he's a jerk and everything,

676
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,830
but that Charming
makes me hotter than July.

677
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,720
That's it!

678
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,720
Come on! This way!

679
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,029
Rapunzel, wait!

680
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,750
Charming, let go of her.

681
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,330
But why would I want to do that?

682
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,830
What?

683
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,320
Say hello, ladies,
to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

684
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,270
Rapunzel, how could you?

685
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,500
Jealous much?

686
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,950
Soon you'll be back where you started,

687
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,570
scrubbing floors or locked away in towers.

688
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,130
That is, if I let you last the week.

689
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,930
Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

690
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,770
Not here, kitten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

691
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,020
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

692
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,180
Shrek will be back soon,
and you'll be sorry.

693
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,879
Sorry?!

694
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,779
Don't you realize
once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away...

695
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,910
.. he's doomed?

696
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,370
Look out! They got a piano!

697
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,529
Kill them all...except the fat one.

698
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,770
King Charming has something special
in mind for you, ogre.

699
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,490
King Charming?

700
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,670
Attack!

701
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,780
Artie, duck!

702
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,930
Ready the plank!

703
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,560
- Shrek!
- Help!

704
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,370
Cowards!

705
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,640
What has Charming done with Fiona?

706
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,250
She's going to get what's coming to her.

707
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:37,190
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

708
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,660
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

709
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,220
Get yourself back to Worcestershire, kid.

710
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,509
No, Shrek. Hold on. I've got an idea.

711
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,009
lam a buzzing bee.

712
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,590
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them...

713
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,650
..[ mean us, back to Far Far Away.

714
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,040
Forget it. I don't have that
kind of magic in me anymore.

715
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,690
How about a hug?
That's the best kind of magic.

716
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,240
Please. I know you can do it.

717
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,149
I said forget it!

718
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,640
But...

719
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,250
What's with you?

720
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,390
It's just so hard, you know?

721
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,840
They need to get back,
‘cause their kingdom's in trouble.

722
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,580
‘Cause there's a really bad man.

723
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,509
It's just so hard!

724
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,630
Take it easy.

725
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,850
No! I don't think you understand!

726
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,230
There's a mean person
doing mean things to good people.

727
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,320
Have a heart, old man.

728
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,190
They really need your help
to get back. Why won't you help them?!

729
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,620
Okay.

730
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,640
I'll go get my things.

731
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,540
Piece of cake.

732
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,790
Well, well.
You want eggs with that ham?

733
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,410
lam a little rusty,
so there could be some side effects.

734
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,320
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

735
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,720
Whatever it is,
no matter how excruciatingly painful,

736
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,990
it will wear off eventually. I think.

737
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,100
- Oops.
- You sure about this?

738
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,000
If Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

739
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,250
Even if his robe doesn't cover...

740
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,660
Alacritious expeditious...

741
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,370
..a-zZoomy-Zoom-Zoom !

742
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,190
Let's help our friends get back...

743
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,279
soon!

744
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,850
It worked!

745
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,930
l haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

746
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,730
Donkey?

747
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,460
What? Is something in my teeth?

748
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,330
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

749
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,529
At least you don't look like
some kind of bloated pinata!

750
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,950
You should think about going on a diet!

751
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,140
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
I feel all exposed and nasty!

752
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,280
So you two think this is funny?

753
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,430
I'm really sorry, guys.

754
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,870
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

755
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,390
How in the Hans Christian Andersen

756
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,190
am I supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

757
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,990
Hey, hey, hey! Be very careful with those.

758
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,490
They were made in Madrid by the finest...

759
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,170
You'll learn to control that.

760
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:52,960
GO GO AWAY

761
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,410
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort inserts
or arch supports or something.

762
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,990
Watch it. I'm walking here and
I'm gonna keep going until...

763
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,660
Pinocchio!

764
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,160
Shrek! Help me!

765
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,230
- What happened?
- Charming and the villains took over!

766
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,920
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
Now she's...

767
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,820
She's what?! What?!

768
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,940
Five Dollars

769
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,750
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

770
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,980
You heard him. Help the brother out.

771
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,120
Do you see any pockets on me?

772
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,060
Hold on a second.

773
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,190
I had no idea, really. I...l swear.

774
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,620
Quick! Where is Fiona?

775
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,200
Charming has her locked away someplace.
You have to find him!

776
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,190
He's probably getting ready for the show!

777
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,640
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

778
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,720
"It's a Happily Ever After After All".

779
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,089
"Shrek's final performance"?

780
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,000
Shrek! You didn't tell us
you were in a play!

781
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,520
I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

782
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,410
The ogre! Get him!

783
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,800
Don't worry, jefe. I got this.

784
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,730
Uck! Kill it!

785
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,200
Look. Don't you know
who he thinks he is? How dare you!

786
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,360
We're dealing with amateurs.

787
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,680
He's a star, people! Hello?
I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

788
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,660
I'm going to lose it!

789
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,190
Is everything ready?
You did get the list for the dressing room?

790
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,470
Breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

791
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,730
I hope you have the saffron corn
with jalapeno honey butter.

792
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,759
Our client cannot get into
his proper emotional state

793
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,740
without jalapeno honey butter!

794
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,200
I just lost it.

795
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,290
They should talk to
Nancy in Human Resources.

796
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,629
Oh, we will have much to
say to Nancy, I promise!

797
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,730
"With this sword, I do..." No. "With..."

798
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,410
"With this sword, I do smote thee!"

799
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,750
Is "smote" the right word? "Smoot"?

800
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,740
I don't think that's a word.

801
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,770
Maybe I should just "smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

802
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,100
Shrek attacks me.
I pretend to be afraid.

803
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,850
"Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

804
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,610
Blah, blah, blah. Oh,
it just doesn't feel real enough!

805
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,520
Who told you to stop dancing?!

806
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,110
Wink and turn.

807
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,180
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

808
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,550
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mummy.

809
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,900
And I assure you...

810
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,530
..the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second...

811
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,680
.. we've had to wait.

812
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,590
Break a leg.

813
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,200
On second thought,
let me break it for you.

814
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,259
Thank goodness. I was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

815
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,250
Where's Fiona?

816
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,180
Don't worry. She and the others
are safe...for now.

817
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,290
Let me guess. Arthur.

818
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,000
It's Artie, actually.

819
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,610
This boy is supposed to be the
new King of Far Far Away?

820
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,090
How pathetic.

821
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,820
Stand still, so 1 won't make a mess.

822
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,160
Charming, stop! I'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

823
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,120
This isn't about him.

824
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,700
Then who's it about?
I'm supposed to be king, right?

825
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,130
You weren't really
next in line for the throne.

826
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,960
l was.

827
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,050
But you said
the King asked for me personally.

828
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,110
Not exactly.

829
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,670
What does that mean?

830
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,070
l said whatever I had to say,
all right?

831
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,610
l wasn't right for the job,
so l needed some fool to replace me.

832
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,290
And you fit the bill.
So just go!

833
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,399
You were playing me the whole time.

834
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,270
You catch on real fast, kid.

835
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,240
Maybe you're not
as big of a loser as I thought.

836
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,680
You know, for a minute...

837
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,770
- ...L actually thought...
- What?

838
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,990
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

839
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,100
What did you expect?

840
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:51,290
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

841
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,759
Leave me out with the waste

842
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,820
This is not what I do

843
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,410
It's the wrong time

844
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,250
She's pulling me through

845
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,810
It's a small crime

846
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,610
And I got no excuse

847
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,080
And is that all right, yeah?

848
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,480
Is that all right with you?

849
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,170
Is that all right, yeah?

850
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,569
If 1 give my gun away when it's loaded?

851
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,049
If you don't shoot it
how am I supposed to hold it?

852
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,990
Is that all right? Is that all right?

853
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,360
Is that all right with you?

854
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,790
No.

855
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,640
Had we stayed put like I suggested,

856
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,380
we'd be sipping tea
out of little heart-shaped cups.

857
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,030
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

858
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,750
And eating crumpets
smothered with loganberries.

859
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,350
Yeah, loganberries.

860
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,220
- Shut up, Cindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

861
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,990
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

862
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,830
Who cares who's "running the kingdom"?

863
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,020
- l care.
- You should all care.

864
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,660
l have your badge number, tin can!

865
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,700
- Donkey?
- Princess!

866
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,950
Puss?

867
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,529
lam Puss,
stuck here inside this hideous body.

868
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,600
- And I'm me!
- But you're...

869
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,480
Everything's fruity in the loops,
but what happened is

870
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,780
we went to high school,
the boat crashed

871
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,930
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

872
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,700
You poor sweet things.

873
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,200
I don't get it.

874
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,850
The cat turned into a little horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

875
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,380
Who dat?

876
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,589
Where's Shrek?

877
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,870
Charming has him. He plans to kill Shrek tonight
in front of the whole kingdom!

878
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,500
All right, everyone.
We need to find a way out now.

879
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,100
You're right. Ladies, assume the position!

880
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,140
What are you doing?

881
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,160
Waiting to be rescued.

882
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,090
You've got to be kidding me.

883
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,800
What else can we do? We're just four...

884
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,020
..[ mean three, super-hot princesses...

885
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,000
.. two circus freaks,
a pregnant ogre and an old lady!

886
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,930
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

887
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,189
Mom!

888
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,140
You didn't think you got your fighting skills
from your father, did you?

889
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,120
Excuse me. There's still one more.

890
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,120
Why don't you just lie down?

891
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,350
Okay, girls, from here on out...

892
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,910
..we take care of business ourselves.

893
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,020
Dopey

894
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,460
The Far Far Away Theatre
at the Charming Pavilion is proud to present...

895
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,940
"It's A Happily Ever After After All."

896
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,740
Enjoy your evening
of theatrical reverie, citizen.

897
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,970
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

898
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,759
Places, everyone!

899
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,190
Backstage No Admittance

900
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,820
Easy!

901
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,420
Sorry. l was showing off for the little one.

902
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,610
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Come here, beautiful.

903
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,569
Well, she's got your eye.

904
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:13,259
Who would have thought a monster like me
deserved something as special as you?

905
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,360
Little birdies, take wing

906
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,690
Flitting down from the trees they appear

907
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,259
And to chirp in my ear

908
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,290
All because I sing

909
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:35,910
Move it! Go!

910
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,069
ZOO

911
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,880
My babies!

912
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,870
Help!

913
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,950
Day Old Sale All Items Must Go!

914
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,359
Hey, how's it goin'?

915
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,460
O to the K. The coast is clear.

916
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,010
Let's do this. Go, Team Dynamite!

917
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,670
I thought we agreed to
use the name Team Super Cool.

918
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,140
I recall it was Team Awesome.

919
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,840
I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

920
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,399
Okay! From henceforth,

921
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,009
we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome
Cool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

922
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,220
Ach de liebe! There is some strange little girl
over there staring at us!

923
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,759
Artie!

924
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,200
Wait, wait!

925
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,340
Where is the fire, senor?

926
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,440
Please. Don't act so innocent.

927
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,960
You both knew what was going on
and kept it to yourselves.

928
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,890
It's not like it seems.

929
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,589
It's not? I think it seems pretty clear.

930
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,180
He was using me. That's all.

931
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,640
Using you? You really don't get it.

932
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,610
Shrek only said those things to protect you.

933
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,529
Charming was going to kill you,
Artie! Shrek saved your life.

934
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,609
Cue the spot!

935
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,580
I wait alone up here

936
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,290
I'm trapped another day

937
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,430
Locked up here, please set me free

938
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,490
My new life I almost see

939
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,250
A castle, you and me

940
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:08,000
Yes, a castle, you and me

941
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,470
Cherubs!

942
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,550
Tis I, Tis 1 Upon my regal steed

943
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,490
Princess, my love

944
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,160
At last you shall be freed I'm strong

945
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,290
And brave And dashing my way there

946
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,740
With speed! With might!
With soft and bouncy hair!

947
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,479
- Through the blistering desert
- Hot!

948
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,609
- Across the stormiest sea
- Wet!

949
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,769
Facing creatures so vile

950
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,069
Foul!

951
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:45,839
So you can gaze upon me!

952
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,490
I knew you'd come for me

953
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,149
And now we finally meet

954
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,950
I knew you'd wait

955
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,109
And from my plate of love you'd eat

956
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,670
SHREK

957
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,530
Who is this terribly ugly fiend
Who so rudely intervened?

958
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,590
Will Charming fight or flee?

959
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,870
Please rescue me!

960
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,479
From this monstrosity!

961
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:31,090
Fear thee not, honey lamb!
I will slice this thing up like a ham!

962
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,029
Oh, boy.

963
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:37,339
You are about to enter a world of pain

964
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,609
With which you are not familiar!

965
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:49,120
It can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance.

966
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,840
"Prepare, foul beast."

967
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,820
Prepare, foul beast, your time is done!

968
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,030
Could you kill me and then sing?

969
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,200
Be quiet!

970
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,040
I'm just having fun with you.
That's actually a very nice leotard.

971
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,690
Thank you.

972
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,790
Do they come in men's sizes?

973
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,400
Now that be funny!

974
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,410
Enough!

975
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,150
Now you'll finally know what it's like...

976
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,710
.. to have everything you worked for...

977
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,650
everything
that's precious to you, taken away.

978
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,090
Now you'll know how I felt.

979
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,890
Sausage roll!

980
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,860
Pray for mercy from Puss!

981
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,580
And Donkey!

982
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:07,830
D

983
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,570
Hi, honey.

984
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,410
Sorry we're late. You okay?

985
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,850
Much better, now that you're here.

986
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:32,030
So, Charming, you want to let me out of these
so we can settle this ogre-to-man?

987
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,450
Ooh, that sounds fun.
But I have a better idea.

988
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,200
No! Let go of me!

989
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,120
You will not ruin things this time, ogre.
Kill it.

990
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,719
Everybody, stop!

991
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,440
Oh, what is it now?!

992
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,920
Artie?

993
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,429
Who thinks we need to
settle things this way?

994
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,930
You mean you want to be
villains your whole lives?

995
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,680
But we are villains!
It's the only thing we know.

996
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,309
You never wish
you could be something else?

997
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,640
Easy for you to say.
You're not some evil enchanted tree.

998
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,590
You morons!
Don't listen to him! Attack!

999
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,350
What Steve means is
it's hard to come by honest work

1000
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,480
when the whole world's against you.

1001
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,280
Right. Thanks, Ed.

1002
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,330
Fair enough. You're right.
I'm not a talking tree.

1003
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,910
But you know...

1004
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,800
..a good friend once told me...

1005
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,570
.. just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

1006
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,000
..or just some loser...

1007
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,260
..doesn't mean you are one.

1008
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,469
What matters most is
what you think of yourself.

1009
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,700
If there's something you really want,
or someone you want to be...

1010
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,410
..the only person
standing in your way is you.

1011
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,790
- Me?
- Get him!

1012
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,240
No, no, no!

1013
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,020
What I mean is each of you...

1014
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,450
.. iS standing in your own way.

1015
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,540
l always wanted to play the flute.

1016
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,050
I'd like to open up a spa...in France!

1017
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,500
I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

1018
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,430
A new era finally begins!

1019
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,960
Now all of you...

1020
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,990
.. bow before your King!

1021
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,360
You need to work on your aim.

1022
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,270
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

1023
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,860
Well, you need to keep looking...

1024
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,830
.. because I'm not giving up mine.

1025
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,139
Mommy?

1026
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,980
It's yours if you want it.

1027
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,840
But this time it's your choice.

1028
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,750
Author!

1029
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,810
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

1030
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,889
Excuse me. That's my seat.

1031
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,200
Okay, Senor Hocusy-Pocusy,
the time has come to rectify some wrongs!

1032
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,990
Though I have been
enjoying these cat baths.

1033
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,669
Please say you didn't.

1034
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,580
All right! Look.

1035
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,050
You'll feel a pinch
and possibly lower intestinal discomfort...

1036
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,240
..but this should do the trick.

1037
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,590
- Are you...?
- I'm me again!

1038
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,970
- And lam not you!
- All right!

1039
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,740
Oops.

1040
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,960
Ah, never mind.

1041
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,370
What did I tell you?
The kid's going to be a great king.

1042
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,020
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

1043
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,410
l have something
much more important in mind.

1044
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,250
Finally.

1045
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,040
Dada.

1046
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,849
Was I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place

1047
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,590
I smell Shrek Junior!

1048
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,250
Where else could a creep like me

1049
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,000
Meet such a pretty face

1050
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,780
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1051
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,350
Looking up, it's looking like

1052
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,120
My losing streak is done

1053
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,360
Peek-a-boo!

1054
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:45,800
Peek-a-boo!

1055
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,550
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

1056
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,170
Used to always feel like

1057
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,890
Wished that 1 was dressed better

1058
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,530
Where's the baby?

1059
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,530
Never had a lot of luck
Until I finally met her

1060
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,530
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1061
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,420
Looking up, it's looking like

1062
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,710
My losing streak is done

1063
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,080
My losing streak is done

1064
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,970
Well...what shall we do now?

1065
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,040
I got it.

1066
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,170
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Once again, come on!

1067
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,700
l want to thank you
for letting me be myself

1068
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,309
Again!

1069
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,140
Look at my hips!

1070
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,870
l want to thank you
for letting me be myself

1071
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:22,870
Again!

1072
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,380
- Break it down!
- Let's go!

1073
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,720
Stiff all in the collar

1074
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,580
Fluffy in the face

1075
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,020
Chit chat chatter trying

1076
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,460
Stuffy in the place

1077
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,190
Thank you for the par-tay

1078
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,180
But I could never stay

1079
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,680
I'm sorry.

1080
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,009
I got many things on my mind

1081
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,460
But the word's in the way

1082
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:05,000
And I want to thank you for
letting me be myself

1083
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,880
Again

1084
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,620
Different strokes for different folks

Sing a simple song

01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,860
