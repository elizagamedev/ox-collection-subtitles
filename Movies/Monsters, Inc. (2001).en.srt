1
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,641
Good night, sweetheart.

2
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,678
Good night, Mom.

3
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,789
Sleep tight, kiddo.

4
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,562
Whoa!

5
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,629
Oh! Aye! Oh! Oh!

6
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,351
Simulation terminated.

7
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:10,882
Simulation terminated.

8
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:15,041
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

9
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,559
Simulation terminated.

10
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,704
All right,
Mr. Bile, is it?

11
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,317
Uh... my friends
call me Phlegm.

12
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,629
Uh-huh.

13
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,704
Mr. Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

14
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,033
I fell down?

15
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,846
No, no, before that.

16
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,449
Can anyone tell me
Mr. Bile's big mistake?

17
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,116
Anyone?

18
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,193
Let's take a look
at the tape.

19
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,318
Here we go.

20
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,356
Uh, right...
puh-puh-puh-puh...

21
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,965
Ah! There, see?

22
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,829
The door.
You left it wide open.

23
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,511
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake

24
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,136
any employee can make
because...?

25
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,989
Um... it could let in a draft?

26
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,597
It could let in

27
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,643
a child!

28
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,049
Oh! Mr. Waternoose!

29
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,370
There is nothing more toxic
or deadly than a human child.

30
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,975
A single touch could kill you!

31
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,030
Leave a door open

32
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,926
and a child could walk
right into this factory!

33
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,048
Right into the monster world!

34
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,521
I won't go in a kid's room!

35
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,572
You can't make me!

36
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,353
You're going in there
because we need this.

37
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,039
Our city is counting on you

38
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,325
to collect
those children's screams.

39
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,127
Without scream,
we have no power.

40
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,237
Yes, it's dangerous work

41
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,119
and that's why I need
you to be at your best.

42
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,232
I need scarers who are
confident, tenacious

43
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,138
tough, intimidating.

44
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:49,347
I need scarers like... like...
James P. Sullivan.

45
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,740
Hey! Good morning,
Monstropolis.

46
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,045
It's now five after
the hour of 6:00 A.M.

47
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,594
in the big monster city.

48
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,318
Temperature's
a balmy 65 degrees--

49
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,237
which is good news
for you reptiles--

50
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,642
and it looks like
it's going to be a perfect day

51
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,701
to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in

52
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,440
or simply... work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

53
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,204
Get up, Sulley!

54
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,711
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

55
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,998
Hey! Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!

56
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,626
Feel the burn!

57
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,055
You call yourself a monster?

58
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,601
Scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet!

59
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,786
Oop! The kid's awake!

60
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,479
Okay, scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet, scary feet--

61
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,548
kid's asleep!

62
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,780
Twins! In a bunk bed!

63
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,601
Ooh! I thought I had you there.

64
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,112
Okay, Sulley, here we go.

65
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,477
You ready? Follow it.

66
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,572
Oh! It's over here!

67
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,758
Oh, look over there!

68
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,140
Don't let the kid touch you!

69
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,332
Don't let it touch you!

70
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,120
I don't know,
but it's been said

71
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,777
l love scaring kids in bed!

72
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,712
Come on, fight that plaque!
Fight that plaque!

73
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,212
Scary monsters
don't have plaque!

74
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,467
118... do you have 119?

75
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,126
Do I see 120?

76
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,433
Oh, I don't believe it!

77
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:56,912
I'm not even
breaking a sweat.

78
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:57,973
Not you!

79
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,084
Look! The new commercial's on!

80
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,370
The future is bright
at Monsters, Incorporated.

81
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:04,787
I'm in this one!
I'm in this one!

82
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,201
We're part of your life.

83
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,299
We power your car.

84
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,577
We warm your home.

85
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,287
We light your city.

86
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,056
I'm Monsters, Incorporated.

87
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,595
Hey, look! Betty!

88
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,857
Carefully matching every child
to their ideal monster...

89
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,960
to produce superior scream

90
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,906
refined into clean,
dependable energy.

91
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,335
Every time you turn something on

92
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,671
Monsters, Incorporated,
is there.

93
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,687
I'm Monsters, Incorporated!

94
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,445
We know the challenge--

95
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,360
the window of innocence
is shrinking.

96
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,676
Human kids are harder to scare.

97
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,400
Of course, M.I. is prepared
for the future

98
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:38,814
with the top scarers...

99
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,403
the best refineries

100
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,245
and research
into new energy techniques.

101
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,544
Okay, here I come.

102
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,050
We're working for
a better tomorrow... today!

103
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,763
We're Monsters, Incorporated!

104
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,893
We're M.I.--
Monsters, Incorporated.

105
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:59,006
We scare because we care.

106
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,727
I can't believe it.

107
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:02,885
Oh, Mike...

108
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,246
I was on TV!

109
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,022
Did you see me? I'm a natural!

110
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,145
Hello.

111
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,146
I know!

112
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,147
Hey, wasn't I great?

113
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,378
Did the whole family see it?

114
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,555
It's your mom.

115
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,663
What can I say?
The camera loves me.

116
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,361
I'm telling you, big daddy

117
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,806
you're going to be seeing this
face on TV a lot more often.

118
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,792
Yeah? Like, on
Monstropolis's Most Wanted?

119
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,645
You've been jealous
of my good looks

120
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,816
since the fourth grade, pal.

121
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,284
Have a good day, sweetie.

122
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,422
You, too, hon.

123
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,458
Whoo!
Okay, Sulley, hop on in.

124
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,660
Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

125
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,681
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

126
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,972
Where you going?
What are you doing?

127
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,746
Mikey, there's a scream
shortage. We're walking.

128
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:49,935
-Walking?!
-Yep.

129
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:50,973
No, no, no, my baby.

130
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:51,987
Come on. Come on.

131
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,128
Look, she needs to be driven.

132
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,526
Bye, baby.
1... I'll call you!

133
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,425
Hey, genius,
you want to know why

134
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,817
I bought the car? Huh?

135
00:07:59,045 --> 00:07:59,865
Not really.

136
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:00,976
To drive it!

137
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,287
You know, like, on the street?

138
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,712
With the honk-honk
and the vroom-vroom

139
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:04,736
and no walking involved.

140
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,179
Give it a rest,
will you, butterball?

141
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,877
Come on, you could
use the exercise.

142
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,292
I could use the exercise?!

143
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,330
Look at you.
You have your own climate!

144
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,615
How many tentacles
jump the rope?

145
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,328
Morning, Mike!
Morning, Sulley!

146
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,413
Hey! Morning, kids.

147
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:18,414
Hey, kids.

148
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,415
How you doing?

149
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,025
Bye, Mike! Bye, Sulley!

150
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,817
Ow! Hey!

151
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,215
Ah, nuts.

152
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,003
Hey, hey, hey! Fellas!

153
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,098
Hey, Tony!

154
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,329
Tony! Ba-da-bing!

155
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,501
-Tony!
-Hey, Tony!

156
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,502
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow!

157
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,962
I hear somebody's close
to breaking

158
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,038
the all-time scare record.

159
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,269
Ah, just trying
to make sure

160
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,717
there's enough scream
to go around.

161
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,133
Hey! On the house!

162
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,058
-Hey, thanks!
-Grazie!

163
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,820
Ba-da-bing!

164
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,567
Oh, great.

165
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:56,735
Hey, Ted!

166
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,213
Good morning!

167
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,888
See that, Mikey?

168
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,336
Ted's walking to work.

169
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,624
Big deal.

170
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,362
Guy takes five steps
and he's there.

171
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,711
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

172
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,946
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

173
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,109
Morning, Sulley.

174
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,110
Morning, Ricky.

175
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,111
Hey, it's the Sullster!

176
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,222
See you on the scare floor,
buddy!

177
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,415
Hey, Marge.
Hey, how was jury duty?

178
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,087
Morning, Sulley!

179
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,382
Hey!

180
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,538
Hey, it's still leaning
to the left.

181
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:31,887
It is not!

182
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:32,922
Hey, fellas.

183
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:33,923
Hey, Jerry.

184
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,184
Hey, Mr. Sullivan!

185
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,895
Guys, I told you,
call me Sulley.

186
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,162
I don't think so.

187
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,043
We just wanted to wish you
good luck today.

188
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,215
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

189
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,463
Come on, get lost, you two.

190
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,960
You're making him lose
his focus.

191
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,036
Oh. Sorry.

192
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,037
See you later, fellas.

193
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,828
Go get ‘em, Mr. Sullivan!

194
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,700
Quiet! You'll make him lose
his focus.

195
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:53,943
Oh, no. Sorry!

196
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,024
Shut up!

197
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,865
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

198
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,030
Monsters, Inc.
I'll connect you.

199
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,382
Ms. Fearmonger is on vacation.

200
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,647
Would you like her voice mail?

201
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,265
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo.

202
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,276
Googley Bear!

203
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,499
Happy birthday.

204
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,014
Oh, Googley-woogley,
you remembered!

205
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,456
Hey, Sulley-wulley.

206
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,814
Oh, hey, Celia...

207
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:13,972
weelia.

208
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,607
Happy birthday.

209
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,049
Thanks.

210
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,860
So, uh... are we going
anywhere special tonight?

211
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,363
I just got us
into a little place

212
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,468
called, um... Harryhausen's.

213
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,812
Harryhausen's?!

214
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,893
But it's impossible to
get a reservation there!

215
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,945
Not for Googley Bear.

216
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,691
I will see you
at quitting time

217
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,042
and not a minute later.

218
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,164
Okay, sweetheart.

219
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,535
Think romantical thoughts.

220
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,606
You and me

221
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,135
Me and you

222
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,270
Both of us together!

223
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,940
You know, pal, she's the one.

224
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,345
That's it. She is the one!

225
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,916
I'm happy for you.

226
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,578
Oh, and, uh,
thanks for hooking me up

227
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,046
with those reservations.

228
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,101
Oh, no problem.

229
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,212
They're under the name
Googley Bear.

230
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,236
Oh, good ide...

231
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,286
You know,
that wasn't very funny.

232
00:10:59,092 --> 00:10:59,912
What the...?

233
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:00,913
Wazowski!

234
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,350
What do you know?

235
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,052
It scares little kids
and little monsters.

236
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,334
I wasn't scared.

237
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,521
Il have... allergies.

238
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,339
Uh-huh. Sure.

239
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,274
Hey, Randall, save it for
the scare floor, will you?

240
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,913
I'm in the zone today,
Sullivan.

241
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,844
Going to be doing
- -
some serious scaring.

242
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,423
Putting up some big numbers.

243
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,548
Wow, Randall.

244
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,565
That's great.

245
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,176
That should make it
even more humiliating

246
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,558
when we break the record first.

247
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:27,183
Ha, ha!

248
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,687
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

249
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,062
Do you hear that?

250
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,886
It's the winds of change.

251
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,011
“You hear it? You hear
the winds of ch...?"

252
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,473
Oh, what a creep.

253
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,655
One of these days,
lam really...

254
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,276
going to let you
teach that guy a lesson.

255
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,449
Chalooby! Baby!

256
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,350
Good morning, Roz

257
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,312
my succulent
little garden snail.

258
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,924
And who would
we be scaring today?

259
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:03,022
Wazowski, you didn't file
your paperwork last night.

260
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,960
Oh, that darn paperwork.

261
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,351
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?

262
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,073
Don't let it happen again.

263
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,768
Yes, well, I'll, uh...

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,080
I'll try to be less careless.

265
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,542
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

266
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,621
Always watching.

267
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:21,807
Whoo! She's nuts.

268
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,645
Always!

269
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,750
All scare floors are now active.

270
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,609
Assistants, please report
to your stations.

271
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,412
Okay, people, eastern seaboard
coming on-line.

272
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,599
We got scarers coming out!

273
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,365
Ooh, they're
so awesome.

274
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,574
Hey... may the best monster win.

275
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,137
I plan to.

276
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,933
We are on in seven... six...

277
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,676
five... four... three...

278
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,926
two...

279
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,152
You're the boss.
You're the boss.

280
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,341
You're the big, hairy boss.

281
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,545
Oh, I'm feeling good today,
Mikey!

282
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:58,714
Yeah!

283
00:14:58,865 --> 00:14:59,945
Whoa!

284
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,273
Attaboy.
Attaboy.

285
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,577
Another door coming right up.

286
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,910
You're still behind,
Randall.

287
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,951
You know, maybe I should realign
the scream intake valve.

288
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,097
Just get me another door!

289
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,148
A door! Yes, door!

290
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,884
Well, Jerry,
what's the damage so far?

291
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,520
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.

292
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,459
Hmm. First time in a month.

293
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,341
Huh?!

294
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,213
What happened?

295
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,414
The kid almost touched me!

296
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:00,762
She got this close to me!

297
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,100
She wasn't scared of you?

298
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,314
She was only six!

299
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,696
I could've been dead!

300
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,627
I could've died!

301
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,769
Keep it together, man.

302
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,639
Hey! We got a dead door
over here!

303
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,101
-We're coming!
-Coming!

304
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,736
-Look out!
-Out of the way!

305
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,741
-Coming through!
-Excuse us.

306
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,921
We've lost 58 doors
this week, sir.

307
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,011
Oh, kids these days.

308
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,623
They just don't get
scared like they used to.

309
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,833
Let her rip!

310
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,683
Uh, sir?

311
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,684
What?!

312
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,175
Look.

313
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,363
Attention.

314
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,422
We have a new scare leader:
Randall Boggs.

315
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,571
Slumber party.

316
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,623
Whoo!

317
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,732
Never mind.

318
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,573
Hey! Watch it!

319
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,781
Well, James, that was
an impressive display!

320
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,973
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr. Waternoose.

321
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,017
Of course, I did learn
from the best.

322
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,483
If l don't see a new door
at my station in five seconds

323
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,337
I will personally put you
through the shredder!

324
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,300
Hey, Wazowski, nice job!

325
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,917
Those numbers are pretty sweet.

326
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,288
Are they?

327
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,773
You know,
I hadn't even noticed.

328
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,293
And, uh...
how is Georgie doing?

329
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,539
He's doing great!

330
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,890
Il love working
with that big guy.

331
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,176
Keep the doors coming,
Charlie.

332
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,347
I'm on a roll today.

333
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,045
George and I
are like brothers.

334
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,668
2319! We have a 2319!

335
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,693
Red alert! Red alert!

336
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,265
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!

337
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,783
George Sanderson

338
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,595
please remain motionless.

339
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:58,923
Prepare for decontamination.

340
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,191
Get it off!

341
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,779
Duck and cover, people!

342
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,037
Oh, not the CDA.

343
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,328
Move! Move! Move!

344
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,895
Coming through, please.
Stand aside.

345
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,240
Clear the contaminated area.

346
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,015
This is a 2319 in progress.

347
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,118
Keep the area clear.

348
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,259
Coming through. Watch yourself.

349
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,774
Stand back.

350
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,616
Careful.

351
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,631
All clear.

352
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,256
Situation is niner-niner-zero.

353
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,863
Ready for decon.

354
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,086
Hey, thanks, guys.

355
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,283
That was a close one.

356
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,754
Okay.

357
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,090
Okay, people, take a break!

358
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,612
We got to shut down
for a half-hour

359
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,773
and reset the system.

360
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,228
An entire scare floor
out of commission.

361
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,364
What else can go wrong?

362
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,094
Oh... what a day.

363
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,033
We're just going through
a rough time, sir.

364
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,191
Everyone knows you're going
to get us through it.

365
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,134
Tell that
to the board of directors.

366
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,491
James, this company

367
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,192
has been in my family
for three generations.

368
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,318
I would do anything
to keep it from going under.

369
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:33,998
Oh, so would I, sir.

370
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,466
Well...

371
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,105
Say, I could use your help
with something.

372
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,767
Anything, sir.

373
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,886
You see, we've hired
some new scare recruits

374
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,911
and frankly, they're...
they're, um... uh...

375
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,553
Inexperienced?

376
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,095
Oh, they stink!

377
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,459
Uh-huh.

378
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,354
And I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow

379
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:51,993
and give them a demonstration.

380
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,944
Show them what it takes
to be a top scarer, huh?

381
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,111
I'll start out with the old
Waternoose jump-and-growl.

382
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,902
Ha! Oh, oh, yes!

383
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,398
Now, that's my boy!

384
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,869
Let's go, everybody!

385
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,311
All doors must be returned!

386
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,002
No exceptions!

387
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,849
-Oh, yeah.
-Whoo!

388
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,723
I've never seen anything
like you today.

389
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,128
You were on a roll, my man.

390
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,223
Another day like this

391
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,561
and that scare record's
in the bag.

392
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,609
That's right, baby!

393
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,629
Uh-huh.

394
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,198
So get this--
as if dinner wasn't enough

395
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,303
I'm taking her to a monster
truck rally afterwards.

396
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,452
Nice.

397
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,773
What's on your agenda?

398
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,401
I'm going to head home
and work out some more.

399
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,369
Again? You know, there's
more to life than scaring.

400
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,009
Whew. Hey, can I
borrow your odorant?

401
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,501
Yeah. I got, uh...

402
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,292
smelly garbage or old dumpster.

403
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:50,532
You got low tide?

404
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,533
No.

405
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:52,533
How about wet dog?

406
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,554
Yep. Stink it up.

407
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,659
You know, I am so romantic

408
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,347
sometimes I think
I should just marry myself.

409
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,732
Give me a break, Mike.

410
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,176
What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.

411
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,699
Tonight is about me

412
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,476
and Celia.

413
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,042
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.

414
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,485
‘Cause I got
to tell you, buddy

415
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,600
that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

416
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:14,755
Yikes!

417
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:15,927
Hello, Wazowski.

418
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,598
Fun-filled evening
planned for tonight?

419
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,728
Well, as a matter of fact...

420
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,443
Then I'm sure you
filed your paperwork

421
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,276
correctly... for once.

422
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,899
Your stunned silence
- -
Is very reassuring.

423
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,089
Oh, no. My scare reports--
I left them on my desk

424
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:34,138
and if I'm not at the restaurant
in five minutes

425
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,446
they're going to give
our table away!

426
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:36,477
What am I going to tell...

427
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,478
Schmoopsie-poo?

428
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,000
Hey, Googley Bear.
Want to get going?

429
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,221
Do I ever!
It's just that...

430
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,389
What?

431
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,467
Uh, you know,
there's a small...

432
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,715
I don't understand.

433
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,453
It's just that I forgot
about some paperwork

434
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,724
I was supposed to file.

435
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,306
Mike was reminding me.

436
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,441
Thanks, buddy.

437
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,598
Whoo.

438
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,086
Il was? I mean, I was!
Yeah, I was.

439
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,420
Oh, okay. Let's go then.

440
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,462
We're going!

441
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,463
On my desk, Sulley.

442
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,754
The pink copies
go to Accounting

443
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,149
the fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing

444
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,399
and goldenrod ones
go to Roz.

445
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:00,435
Huh!

446
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:01,546
Leave the puce.

447
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,132
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.

448
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,426
No, the fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing.

449
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,398
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.

450
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,004
Man, I have no idea
what puce is.

451
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,372
Oh, that's puce.

452
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,712
Hmm?

453
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,725
Uh, hello?

454
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,011
Anyone?

455
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,394
There's a door here.

456
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,585
Hmm.

457
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,186
Hello?

458
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,187
Hey.

459
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,158
Psst.

460
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,915
Anybody scaring in here?

461
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,904
Hello?

462
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,045
Yo!

463
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,490
Hmm.

464
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,592
Whoa! Ah! Ah!

465
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,689
Oh!

466
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,954
Here.

467
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,260
Gotcha!

468
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,378
Eh!

469
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,451
Oh!

470
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:47,862
Yeow!

471
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,761
Eww.

472
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,351
Whew.

473
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,831
Kitty!

474
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,127
No, no-- stay back.

475
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,265
Hmm.

476
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,328
And hold it.

477
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,065
Get a paper bag!

478
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,015
Mmm.

479
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,020
Oh, Michael, I've had
a lot of birthday...

480
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,829
well, not a lot of birthdays

481
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,910
but this is
the best birthday ever.

482
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,055
Hmm.

483
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,107
What are you looking at?

484
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,369
I was just thinking

485
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,274
about the first time
I laid eye on you--

486
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,506
how pretty you looked.

487
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,640
Stop it!

488
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:23,925
Your hair was
shorter then.

489
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,426
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking
about getting it cut.

490
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,675
No, no, I like
it this length.

491
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,197
l like everything about you.

492
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,322
Just the other day

493
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,720
someone asked me who I thought

494
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,625
the most beautiful monster was
in all of Monstropolis.

495
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:35,793
You know what I said?

496
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,191
What did you say?

497
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,245
I said...

498
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,587
-Sulley?
-Sulley?

499
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:41,833
No! No, no.

500
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,204
That's not
what I was going to say.

501
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,712
Mike, you're not making sense.

502
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,397
Hi, guys!

503
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,898
What a coincidence,
running into you here!

504
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,476
Uh, I'm just going
to order something to go.

505
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,558
Michael...

506
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,559
Sulley!

507
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,700
I wonder what's good here.

508
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,168
Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.

509
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,399
I went back to get
your paperwork

510
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:56,430
and there was a door.

511
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:57,452
What?

512
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,502
A door?!

513
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,443
Randall was in it.

514
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:03,457
Wait a minute. Randall?

515
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,492
That cheater!

516
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,235
He's trying
to boost his numbers!

517
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:07,662
There's something else.

518
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,709
What?!

519
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:09,971
Ook-lay in the ag-bay.

520
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,012
What?!

521
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:11,983
Look in the bag.

522
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,651
What bag?

523
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,053
Oh!

524
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,261
They don't have
anything I like here.

525
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,342
So take care, Celia!

526
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,360
Excuse me, sir.

527
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,360
What's going on?

528
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,802
Celia, please try
to understand.

529
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,711
I have to do something!

530
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:31,799
Michael?

531
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,350
On three.

532
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,605
One... two....

533
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:38,543
A kid!

534
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,710
Boo!

535
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:45,473
A kid!

536
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,316
There's a kid here--
a human kid!

537
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,003
Oh!

538
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,502
Googley Bear!

539
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,406
Come on!

540
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,094
Let's get out of here!

541
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,307
Please remain calm.

542
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,582
This is not a drill.

543
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,439
We have an 835 in progress.

544
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,577
Please advise.

545
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,778
Michael? Michael?

546
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,027
Oh, Celia.

547
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,599
-Please come with me.
-Ow. Stop pushing.

548
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,533
Hey, get your hands off
my Schmoopsie-poo!

549
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,851
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.

550
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,781
Well, I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.

551
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,524
If witnesses are to be believed

552
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,683
there has been
a child security breach

553
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,042
for the first time
in monster history.

554
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,644
We can neither confirm nor deny

555
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,695
the presence of a human child
here tonight.

556
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,541
Well, a kid flew right over me

557
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,812
and blasted a car
with its laser vision!

558
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,178
I tried to run from it,
but it picked me up

559
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,667
with its mind powers
and shook me like a doll!

560
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,737
It's true!
I saw the whole thing!

561
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:59,341
It is my
professional opinion

562
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:02,254
that now is the time
to... panic!

563
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:03,781
Oh-oh.

564
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,284
Oh, it's coming!

565
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,589
It's coming!

566
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,389
Boo!

567
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,747
No, no, no, no, no!

568
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,008
Come here, kid.

569
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,062
Whee.

570
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,706
No, don't touch those,
you little...!

571
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:26,781
Oh, now

572
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:27,892
those were alphabetized.

573
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,056
It's okay, it's all right.

574
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,313
As long as it doesn't
come hear us

575
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,371
we're going to be okay.

576
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,229
Wanna ride on it!

577
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:40,645
Da, da-da.

578
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,629
Da-da-da.

579
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,710
Oh, y-you like this?

580
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,671
Fetch!

581
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,748
Hey, hey, that's it!

582
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,653
No one touches little Mikey!

583
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,587
Mike, give her the bear.

584
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,317
Oh, no.

585
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,082
Make it stop, Sulley!

586
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,327
Make it stop!

587
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,621
Look! See the bear?

588
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,743
Ooh, nice bear.

589
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:17,938
Sulley!

590
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,076
See?

591
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,241
Ooh, bear, ooh.

592
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,999
Oh, he's
a happy bear.

593
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,654
He's not crying,
neither should you

594
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:25,149
Or we'll be in trouble

595
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,287
‘Cause they're gonna find us

596
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,328
So please stop crying

597
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:29,587
Right now.

598
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:30,751
Good, good, Sulley.
Keep it up.

599
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,069
You're doing great.

600
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,343
Ooh, the happy bear,
he has no...

601
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,036
She touched me!

602
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,103
Sulley, the bear!

603
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,119
The bear!

604
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,139
Give her the...

605
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,674
Whoa!

606
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,779
What was that?

607
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:53,908
I have no idea

608
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,698
but it would be really great

609
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,323
if it didn't do it again.

610
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,117
Shh, shh, shh.

611
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,345
Shh...

612
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,426
Shh.

613
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,174
Shh...

614
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,581
Ah!

615
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,296
How could I do this?

616
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:20,788
How could I be so stupid?

617
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,412
This could destroy the company.

618
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,496
The company?

619
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,937
Who cares about the company?!

620
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,000
What about us?

621
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:27,491
That thing is
a killing machine!

622
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,559
La-la-la-la-la-la

623
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,605
I bet it's just waiting
for us to fall asleep

624
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,850
and then wham!

625
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,638
Oh, we're easy prey,
my friend-- easy prey.

626
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,593
We're sitting targets.

627
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:37,682
Okay, look, I think

628
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,029
I have a plan here.

629
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,131
Using mainly spoons, we dig
a tunnel under the city

630
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,267
and release it into the wild.

631
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,406
Spoons.

632
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:47,995
That's it, I'm out of ideas.

633
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,466
We're closed.
Hot air balloon?

634
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,194
Too expensive.
Giant slingshot?

635
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:52,293
Too conspicuous.

636
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,404
Enormous wooden horse?
Too Greek!

637
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,758
No plan. No plan.

638
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,129
Can't think. Can't think.

639
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:02,322
Flatlining.

640
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,337
Uh, Mike?

641
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,478
I think she's getting tired.

642
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,461
Well, then
why don't you

643
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,946
find someplace
for it to sleep?

644
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,695
While I think of a plan!

645
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:15,055
Are you sleepy?

646
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,110
You want to sleep?

647
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,362
Is that what you want?

648
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:19,707
Huh?

649
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,257
Okay, all right.

650
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,822
I'm making a nice little area
for you to...

651
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:37,618
No. Hey, hey, that's my bed!

652
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,146
You're going to get
your germs all over it.

653
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,426
Fine.

654
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,674
My chair is
more comfortable anyway.

655
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,251
What?

656
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,351
It's just a closet.

657
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:52,493
Will you go to sleep?

658
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,081
Hey, that looks like Randall.

659
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,513
Randall's your monster.

660
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,476
You think he's going
to come through the closet

661
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:04,732
and scare you.

662
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,693
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

663
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:07,834
Uh, it's empty.

664
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,249
-See?
-Ah!

665
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,004
No monster in here.

666
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,132
Well, now there is

667
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,641
but I'm not going to scare you.

668
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,054
I'm off-duty.

669
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,399
Okay.

670
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:29,524
How about I sit here,
until you fall asleep?

671
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,223
Go ahead.

672
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,671
Go to sleep.

673
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,730
Now.

674
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:38,491
Now... go.

675
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,054
Uh, you...

676
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:41,331
go...

677
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,480
to...

678
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:43,554
sleep.

679
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,618
Hey, Mike,
this might sound crazy

680
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,587
but I don't think
that kid's dangerous.

681
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,788
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.

682
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,994
l always wanted a pet
that could kill me!

683
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,437
Now, look.

684
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,210
What if we just put
her back in her door?

685
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,755
What?

686
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:30,837
Mike, think about it.

687
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,402
If we send her back,
it's like it never happened.

688
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,567
Everything goes back to normal.

689
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:34,587
Is that a joke?

690
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,668
Tell me you're joking.

691
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,619
Sulley, I'd like to think
that, given the circumstances

692
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,495
I have been extremely
forgiving up to now

693
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,826
but that is a horrible idea!

694
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,187
What are we going to do?

695
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,052
March right out into
public with that thing?

696
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,598
Then I guess we just waltz
right up to the factory, right?

697
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,481
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.

698
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,027
Sulley, a mop, a couple of
lights and some chair fabric

699
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,790
are not going
to fool anyone!

700
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,082
Just think about
a few names, will you?

701
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,386
Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman--

702
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,980
they all got one thing
in common, pal-- banishment.

703
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,535
We could be next!

704
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:06,787
Don't panic--
we can do this.

705
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:07,992
Hey, how you doing, Frank?

706
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,073
Hey, guys.

707
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,229
Everything's going

708
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,458
to be okay.

709
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,134
Number One wants this place
dusted for prints.

710
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:19,522
Careful with that.

711
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:20,948
I got a good view from here.

712
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,642
A little lower.

713
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,197
This was recovered
at the scene.

714
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:26,426
Don't panic. Don't panic!

715
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,461
Don't tell me not to panic.

716
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,496
Just keep it together.

717
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,509
Everything is not okay!

718
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:30,511
Boo.

719
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,031
..could be contaminated.

720
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,252
Gentlemen, safety

721
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,511
is our number one concern.

722
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:35,809
If there's anything that...

723
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:36,997
not now, not now.

724
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,538
Oh, hello, little one.

725
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,320
Where did you come from?

726
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:41,472
Mr. Waternoose!

727
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,190
Ah, James!
Is this one yours?

728
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,691
Actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's daughter, sir.

729
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,758
Yeah, it's, uh...

730
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,504
“Bring an Obscure
Relative to Work Day.”

731
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,252
Hmm, must have missed the memo.

732
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,475
Well, listen, James

733
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,872
why don't you stop by
the simulator after lunch today

734
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,682
and give us
that scare demonstration

735
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,002
we talked about, huh?

736
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,560
Oh, oh, sir, uh....

737
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:02,933
Excuse me,
Mr. Waternoose?

738
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,328
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

739
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,549
All right then, I'll see
you this afternoon, James.

740
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:08,854
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

741
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,096
Oh, boy.

742
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,138
Oh, a scare demo.

743
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,232
Well, that is great.

744
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,334
Why am!
the last to know?

745
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,465
We can bring your cousin's
sister's daughter along.

746
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:16,624
She'll be a big hit!

747
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:18,973
Halt!

748
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,145
Stop him!

749
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,801
Hold him down.

750
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:27,768
Come on, the coast is clear.

751
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,262
Okay, all we have to do
is get rid of that thing.

752
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,491
So, wait here while
I get its card key.

753
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,901
But she can't stay here.

754
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,082
This is the men's room.

755
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,720
That is the weirdest thing
you have ever said.

756
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,236
It's fine. It's okay.

757
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:40,421
Look, it loves it here!

758
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,587
It's dancing with joy!

759
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,936
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

760
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,914
I'll be right back
with its door key.

761
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,814
That's a cute little
dance you've got.

762
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,663
It almost looks
like you've got to...

763
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,243
Oh.

764
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,635
Uh, are you done in there?

765
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,631
Ah! Sorry. Sorry.

766
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,768
Okay, you
finished now, right?

767
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,187
Hello?

768
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,126
Boo.

769
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,350
Where did she go?

770
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,810
Oh, did she disappear?

771
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:50,323
Did she turn invisible?

772
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,810
I just have no idea.

773
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,750
Gotcha!

774
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,315
Boo.

775
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,655
Hey, you're good.

776
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,692
Be relaxed,
be relaxed, be relaxed.

777
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,557
Roz, my tender, oozing blossom

778
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,192
you're looking fabulous today.

779
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,506
Is that a new haircut?

780
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:17,594
Come on, tell me.

781
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,962
It's a new haircut, isn't it?

782
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,064
That's got to be a new haircut.

783
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,101
New makeup? You've had a lift.

784
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,496
You've had a tuck.
You've had something.

785
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,339
Something has been
inserted in your skin

786
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,682
that makes you look like...

787
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,745
Listen, I need a favor.

788
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,690
Randall was working
late last night

789
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,145
out on the scare floor.

790
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,832
l really need the key
for the door he was using.

791
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:36,673
Well, isn't that nice?

792
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,965
But guess what?

793
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:42,124
You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

794
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,254
He didn't... I... no paperwork?

795
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,302
This office is now closed.

796
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:51,565
Ready or not, here I come!

797
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,433
I'm getting warmer.

798
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,778
Any second now.

799
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,776
Fee fi fo...

800
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,192
What are you doing?!

801
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,950
I-I'm looking for the kid.

802
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,196
You lost it?!

803
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,483
No, no, she was just...

804
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,530
Here she is.

805
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,016
Hey, what's the matter?

806
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,674
l already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.

807
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,340
All right, carry on.

808
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,865
Randall!
Thank goodness!

809
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,143
What are we going to do
about the child?

810
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:28,485
Shh!

811
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,651
Shh, shh, shh.

812
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,667
The front page!
It's on the front page.

813
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,535
The child--
the one you were after.

814
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,810
Will you be quiet?!

815
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,892
Don't you think I'm aware
of the situation?

816
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,834
I was up all night
trying to find it.

817
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,326
I did a simple
calculation

818
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,780
factoring in the size
of the sushi restaurant.

819
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,442
The child may have escaped!

820
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,098
Yeah, well, until
we know for sure

821
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,296
we're going to act like nothing
happened, understand?

822
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,125
You just get the machine
up and running.

823
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:10,424
I'll take care of the kid.

824
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,568
And when I find whoever
let it out, they're dead!

825
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,137
Oh!

826
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:16,983
Why are you still here?

827
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,261
Come on, go!

828
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,469
Move! Now!

829
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:20,911
Ow, ow! I'm not here.

830
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,959
They're gone.

831
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,619
Eww.

832
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:29,286
This is bad.
This is so very bad.

833
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,890
What were they talking
about a machine?

834
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,058
Who cares? Oh!

835
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,570
Look, don't panic--
all we have to do

836
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,287
is call her door down
and send her home.

837
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,613
You're right, you're right.

838
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,731
We're just two regular joes
on our way to work.

839
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,243
We will blend right in.

840
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,748
Top of the mornin’, fellas!

841
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,203
Hey, what's shakin’, bacon?

842
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,397
Did you lose weight?

843
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,475
Or a limb?

844
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,753
You have her card key, right?

845
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,115
Of course
I have her card key.

846
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:49,573
I told you
I'd get her card key.

847
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,831
I went and got her card key

848
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,795
and now I have her card key.

849
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,052
Okay, here we go.

850
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:57,374
Take care of yourself.

851
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,395
Try not to run
through any more closets.

852
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,199
Mike, that's not her door.

853
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,048
What are you talking about?

854
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,725
Of course it's her door.
It's her door.

855
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,805
No, her door was white
and it had flowers on it.

856
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,710
No. It must have been
dark last night

857
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,049
because this is its door.

858
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,368
Hey, you hear that?

859
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,289
Sounds like
fun in there!

860
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,804
Okay, send me a postcard, kid.

861
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,366
That's Mike Wazowski, care of

862
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,567
22 Mike-Wazowski-
you-got-your-life-back Lane.

863
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,339
Mowki Kowski.

864
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,101
Very good. Now bon voyage!

865
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,640
Bye-bye!
Come on.

866
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,251
Look at the stick.
See the stick?

867
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,566
Go get the stick! Go fetch.

868
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,504
Mike, this isn't Boo's door.

869
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,019
Boo? What's Boo?

870
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,334
That's what I decided
to call her.

871
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,950
Is there a problem?

872
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,711
Sulley, you're not
supposed to name it.

873
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,043
Once you name it, you start
getting attached to it!

874
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:42,326
Now put that thing

875
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,050
back where it came from,
or so help me...

876
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,062
Oh, hey!

877
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,611
We're rehearsing a scene
for the upcoming company play

878
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,057
called Put That Thing
Back Where It Came From

879
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,550
Or So Help Me.

880
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,618
It's a musical!

881
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,756
Put that thing back where
it came from or so help me

882
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,075
Bom-bom, bom-bom,
bom-bom...

883
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,123
So help me, so help me.

884
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,397
And cut!

885
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:05,578
We're still working on it.

886
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:06,627
It's a work in progress

887
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,221
but, hey, we need ushers.

888
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,448
Sulley, I've had enough.

889
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,116
Now say good-bye to...
where'd it go?

890
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,292
What'd you do with it?

891
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,333
Where is she?

892
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,428
I don't believe it.

893
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,769
She got away from you again?!

894
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:16,837
Well, that is just...

895
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:17,964
Wait a minute.

896
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,476
The sun is coming up.

897
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:20,814
This is perfect!

898
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,679
She's gone!

899
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

900
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,192
Where are you going?

901
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,482
Sulley, please,
don't blow this.

902
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,407
Not when we're so close
to breaking the record.

903
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,819
Somebody else
will find the kid.

904
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,247
It'll be their problem,
not ours!

905
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,269
She's out of our hair!

906
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:34,708
What are you two doing?

907
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,729
They're rehearsing a play.

908
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,518
She's out of our hair!

909
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,745
Can it, Wazowski!

910
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,584
So, what do you think of that
kid getting out, Sullivan?

911
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,044
Pretty crazy, huh?

912
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,868
Oh, yeah, crazy.

913
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,090
Word on the street is the kid's

914
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,285
been traced back
to this factory.

915
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:49,576
You haven't seen anything,
have you?

916
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,077
Uh, well, uh...

917
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,352
No, no way!

918
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:54,526
But if it was an inside job

919
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,538
I'd put my money on Waxford.

920
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:57,828
Waxford?

921
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,089
Yeah, the one at station six.

922
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,677
You know,
he's got them shifty eyes.

923
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:01,991
Hey, Waxford!

924
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,230
Sulley!

925
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,814
Michael Wazowski!

926
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,882
Last night was one
of the worst nights

927
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:11,588
of my entire life, bar none!

928
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,402
I thought
you cared about me.

929
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,493
Honey, please.

930
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:18,681
Schmoopsie, I thought
you liked sushi.

931
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,403
Sushi? Sushi?!!

932
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,941
You think this is about sushi?!

933
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:29,986
Wazowski!

934
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,634
Michael! Mike...

935
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:32,986
Men.

936
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:35,572
Breathe. Keep breathing.

937
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,785
Whew.

938
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,013
Yikes!

939
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,770
Where's the kid?

940
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,553
Kid? What kid?

941
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,105
It's here in
the factory, isn't it?

942
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,440
You're not pinning this on me.

943
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,770
It never would have gotten out

944
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,455
if you hadn't been
cheating last night!

945
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:57,631
Cheating?

946
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,597
Cheating. Right.

947
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,318
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.

948
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:08,532
What happens when the whistle
blows in five minutes?

949
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,330
Uh... I get a time-out?

950
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,082
Everyone goes to lunch!

951
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:17,382
Which means the scare floor
will be...?

952
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,106
Painted?

953
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,921
Empty! It'll be
empty, you idiot!

954
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,027
You see that clock?

955
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:27,285
When the big hand
is pointing up

956
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,558
and the little hand
is pointing up

957
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,037
the kid's door
will be in my station.

958
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,390
But when the big hand
points down

959
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,045
the door will be gone.

960
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,098
You have until then
to put the kid back.

961
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,941
Get the picture?

962
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,177
Boo!

963
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:56,777
No.

964
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:57,857
Hey, you! Halt!

965
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,524
He's the one.

966
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,024
The one from the commercial!

967
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:02,221
Affirmative. That's him.

968
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,480
Can we get an autograph?

969
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:05,068
Oh, oh, sure. No problem.

970
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:08,022
You can make that out
to Bethany, my daughter.

971
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,549
Yes. Let's see...

972
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,350
“From your scary friend

973
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:13,038
best wishes..."

974
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,057
So I said,
“If you talk to me

975
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:17,366
like that again,
we're through!"

976
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:18,642
What'd she say?

977
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:19,805
You know my mom.

978
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,537
She sent me to my room.

979
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:23,336
See you guys later,
take it easy.

980
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:24,578
Bottoms up!

981
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:42,692
No!

982
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:47,394
Whoa!

983
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:48,565
Hey.

984
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:52,352
Oh, well, hello, there.

985
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,633
What's your name?

986
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:55,428
Mike Wazowski!

987
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,015
Sulley!

988
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,810
Oh, Sulley.

989
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,173
Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.

990
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:43,368
Hey, you guys seen
Sulley anywhere?

991
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:44,748
Nope. Sorry.

992
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:45,955
Oh, Sulley!

993
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,357
Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.

994
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,413
2319!

995
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:53,069
We have a 2319!

996
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,331
Oh, dear.

997
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:55,532
Get him!

998
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:58,843
Sulley? Sulley!

999
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,183
Sulley!

1000
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:04,343
Oh, great news, pal.

1001
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:05,752
I got us a way out of this mess

1002
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,006
but we got to hurry.

1003
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,151
Where is it?

1004
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,164
Sull, that’s a cube of garbage.

1005
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:14,941
Uh-oh.

1006
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,712
I-l can still hear
her little voice.

1007
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:19,412
Mike Wazowski!

1008
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:20,777
Hey, I can hear her, too.

1009
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,408
Mike Wazowski!

1010
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,129
How many kids
you got in there?

1011
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,045
Mike Wazowski!

1012
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,360
Kitty!

1013
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,035
Boo!

1014
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,571
Boo, oh,
you're all right!

1015
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,512
I was so worried!

1016
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:37,704
Don't you ever run away from me
again, young lady!

1017
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:40,779
Oh, but I'm so glad
you're safe.

1018
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,908
My, what an affectionate father.

1019
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,138
Actually, she's
my cousin's sister's...

1020
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,279
Okay, Sulley.

1021
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,361
That's enough. Let's go.

1022
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,382
Mike Wazowski!

1023
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,383
Yeah, yeah.

1024
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,824
Step aside, kid. We're in a...

1025
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,657
Will you stop
making Boo laugh?

1026
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,502
I didn't, so come on!

1027
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:08,875
I still don't understand.
You've got Boo's door?

1028
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,225
I'll explain later.
Run.

1029
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,681
Okay, let's move,
let's move, let's move.

1030
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,789
Come on.

1031
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,693
Oh, please be there, please
be there, please be there.

1032
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,362
There it is!

1033
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:17,444
Just like Randall said!

1034
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:18,444
Randall? Wait a minute.

1035
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,480
Oh, hey.

1036
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,481
One, two, three, four!

1037
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:22,482
Get the kid back
through the door!

1038
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:23,482
Hey, hey.

1039
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,684
We're going to get
our lives back.

1040
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:25,719
The nightmare is over.

1041
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:26,720
Hey, it's okay, Boo.

1042
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:27,541
What's the matter?

1043
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,870
Come on, it's time to move!

1044
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:29,942
Mike, what are you thinking?

1045
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:30,957
We can't trust Randall.

1046
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:31,958
He's after Boo.

1047
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:32,959
Who cares? Let's go.

1048
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,010
This is a limited time offer.

1049
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,028
No, no.

1050
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:36,109
I don't like this.

1051
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,470
Look, Sulley, you wanted
her door and there it is.

1052
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:39,665
Now, let's move.

1053
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,247
No, Mike.

1054
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,445
You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up?

1055
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,154
Fine! He wants the door,
I get the door...

1056
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,149
Mike, wait!

1057
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,720
He's a paranoid delusional
furball.

1058
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:51,358
Mike!

1059
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,961
Shh, shh, shh.

1060
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:53,407
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?

1061
00:49:53,858 --> 00:49:55,168
Sulley? Sulley?

1062
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:10,656
Huh?

1063
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:12,068
Mike?

1064
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:13,125
Mike?

1065
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:15,767
Where are you?

1066
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,756
You in there?

1067
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,718
Where are you, buddy?

1068
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:20,854
Mike?

1069
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,255
Hey.

1070
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,630
Boo, way to go.

1071
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,920
It's okay.

1072
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,131
Yes! I got the kid!

1073
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,780
Oh, huzzah!

1074
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:18,835
That's great news.

1075
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:20,616
Not that I was concerned,
of course.

1076
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,398
Just get over here and help me!

1077
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:23,436
Come on, come on, come on.

1078
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:24,451
While we're young here, Fungus!

1079
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:30,933
Kid needs to take
off a few pounds.

1080
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,096
Wazowski?!

1081
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,601
Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

1082
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:39,969
Okay, first of all,
it's cree-tin.

1083
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:41,714
If you're going to threaten me,
do it properly.

1084
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:43,836
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me

1085
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,714
is going to help you cheat
your way to the top!

1086
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:51,308
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

1087
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,835
Well... I did, right up
until you chuckled like that

1088
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:58,299
and now I'm thinking
I should just get out of here.

1089
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:01,649
lam about to revolutionize
the scaring industry

1090
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:05,125
and when I do, even
the great James P. Sullivan

1091
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:07,019
is going to be working for me.

1092
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,187
Well

1093
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:10,348
somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.

1094
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:12,121
First, l need to know
where the kid is

1095
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,442
and you're going to tell me.

1096
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,711
Yeah, I don't know anything.

1097
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:15,718
Uh-huh, sure.

1098
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:16,716
I don't.

1099
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:17,827
I mean, I don't.

1100
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,265
Oh-oh.

1101
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,841
What's that?

1102
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:23,176
Come on. Wait, wait, wait.

1103
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:24,573
Oh-oh. Oh-oh. Oh, come on.

1104
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:25,645
No, no, no, no, no.

1105
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,829
Come on, hey, hey, hey.

1106
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:28,531
This thing is moving.

1107
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,589
I don't like big...

1108
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,901
moving things that are
moving towards me.

1109
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:34,447
No! Come on!

1110
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,992
Hey, Randall!

1111
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,060
Say hello
to the scream extractor.

1112
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,240
Hello.

1113
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,635
Come on, where you going?

1114
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,676
We'll talk.

1115
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,847
Come on, we'll have a latte!

1116
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:45,959
Come on.

1117
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,620
We can talk about this.

1118
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:53,231
What's that thing?
What is that thing?

1119
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:54,683
Wait, wait, wait!

1120
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:55,861
Stop, stop!

1121
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,210
No, no!

1122
00:52:57,408 --> 00:52:58,278
Come on, hey!

1123
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,530
Help! Help! Help!

1124
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:02,599
Help!

1125
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:10,183
Oh, for...

1126
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,584
What did you
do wrong this time?

1127
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:12,719
I don't know.

1128
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,970
I calibrated the drive...

1129
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:15,388
Go check the machine!

1130
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,432
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

1131
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:20,068
That's the problem
with these 3250 units...

1132
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,181
Huh?

1133
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,115
Hmm.

1134
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:38,598
Psst!

1135
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,182
Fungus. Fungus.

1136
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,317
You like cars, huh?

1137
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,929
‘Cause I got a really nice car.

1138
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,264
If you let me go,
I'll give you...

1139
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,760
a ride in the car.

1140
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,158
Please, Fungus?

1141
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,939
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said

1142
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:54,595
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.

1143
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,770
Hmm...

1144
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,014
What happened?

1145
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:09,665
Where's Wazowski?

1146
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,727
Where is he?!

1147
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,314
Come on!

1148
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:22,898
This is crazy.
He's going to kill us!

1149
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,057
Careful. That could be
contaminated.

1150
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:26,732
We got to get out of here now!

1151
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:29,154
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.

1152
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:30,736
Good-bye, Monsters, Inc.!

1153
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,544
Good-bye, Mr. Waternoose!

1154
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:34,063
No, Mike, wait!

1155
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,501
Hey, what are you doing?

1156
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:37,016
Follow me. I have an idea.

1157
00:54:37,241 --> 00:54:39,791
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

1158
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:42,255
Simulation terminated.

1159
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:43,468
No, no, no, no, no.

1160
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:44,607
What was that?

1161
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,272
You're trying to scare the kid,
not lull it to sleep.

1162
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,991
I was going
for a snakesninja approach

1163
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:52,694
with a little hissing.

1164
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,246
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1165
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,022
It's all about presence!

1166
00:54:57,261 --> 00:54:59,041
About how you enter the room!

1167
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,639
Mr. Waternoose!

1168
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,594
James! Perfect timing.

1169
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,176
No, no.
Sir, you don't understand.

1170
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,040
Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.

1171
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,153
What? No, no, I can't...

1172
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,174
Sir... sir, you have

1173
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,188
to listen to me.

1174
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,239
Pay attention, everyone.

1175
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,257
You're about to see

1176
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:12,698
the best in the business.

1177
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:13,759
Reset the simulator.

1178
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:14,761
But-but, sir!

1179
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:16,082
Good night, sweetheart.

1180
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,510
Night, Mom.

1181
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,564
Kitty!

1182
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:19,795
No, Boo, no, no!

1183
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,443
Now, give us a big, loud roar.

1184
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,235
Mr. Waternoose,
there's no time for this.

1185
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,044
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Roar!

1186
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:26,189
But-but-but, sir!

1187
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:27,026
Roar!

1188
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:39,605
Well done.

1189
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,290
Well done, James.

1190
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:42,878
Boo?

1191
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,446
-All right, gentlemen,
I hope you've learned...
-Right this way, everyone.

1192
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,209
..a valuable lesson
in scaring today.

1193
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:51,544
Boo.

1194
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,463
Boo?

1195
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,622
Boo, it's me.

1196
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,567
The child!

1197
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:09,699
Sir, she isn't toxic.

1198
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,537
I know it sounds
crazy, but trust me.

1199
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:12,652
Boo?

1200
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:13,792
No, no, no, no.

1201
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:14,821
It's okay.

1202
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:15,932
I was just...

1203
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,040
No, no, no, no, no,
don't be scared.

1204
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,859
That wasn't real.

1205
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,161
It's just a...

1206
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:23,306
I was just...

1207
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:24,653
No...

1208
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:36,999
Boo.

1209
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:38,564
..and he was going
to test it out

1210
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,545
on that sweet, little girl.

1211
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:42,411
-Boo.
-Now that we have her...

1212
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:43,776
«he is trying to kill us.

1213
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,337
This whole thing
is Randall's fault.

1214
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,859
Randall?

1215
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,260
Yes. And we can take you to his
secret lab, which is right here

1216
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:50,456
in this factory.

1217
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:51,747
How could this happen?

1218
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,672
Oh, how could this happen?

1219
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,844
Does anyone else
know about this?

1220
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:56,996
No, sir.

1221
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,517
Good.

1222
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,238
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

1223
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:05,368
Now, before we do
anything else, let's...

1224
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,973
take care of the child.

1225
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:14,685
Oh, I never thought things
would come to this...

1226
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,762
not in my factory.

1227
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:21,038
I'm sorry you boys
got mixed up in this.

1228
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:22,811
Especially you, James.

1229
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,560
But now we can set

1230
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,878
everything straight again
for the good of the company.

1231
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:32,037
Uh...

1232
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,175
sir, that's not her door.

1233
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:35,918
I know, I know.

1234
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:39,949
It's yours.

1235
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:45,425
No!

1236
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,761
Boo!

1237
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,373
No! No!

1238
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,321
No! No! No! No!

1239
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:00,479
No!

1240
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:02,882
It's too late!

1241
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,506
We're banished, genius.

1242
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:06,388
We're in the human world!

1243
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,640
Oh, what a great idea, going
to your old pal Waternoose!

1244
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:12,047
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!

1245
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:15,606
All you had to do was listen
to me-- just once!

1246
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:18,022
But you didn't, did you?

1247
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,518
You're still not listening!

1248
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:28,998
Take that!

1249
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,468
Welcome to the Himalayas!

1250
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,683
“Abominable”!

1251
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,093
Can you believe that?

1252
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,866
Do I look abominable to you?

1253
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:48,733
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman or...

1254
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:51,586
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

1255
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:53,102
I'm a nice guy.

1256
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,435
Snow cone?

1257
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:55,481
Yuck.

1258
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:56,482
No, no, no.

1259
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,033
Don't worry-- it's lemon.

1260
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,138
Uh, how about you, big fella?

1261
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,430
Snow cone?

1262
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:06,809
Did you see the way she...
looked at me?

1263
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,652
Ah, poor guy.

1264
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:11,904
l understand.

1265
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:13,542
It ain't easy being banished.

1266
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:14,984
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.

1267
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:16,235
When he was banished

1268
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,050
he fashioned an enormous diaper
out of poison ivy.

1269
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,189
Wore it on his head
like a tiara.

1270
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:22,858
Called himself King Itchy.

1271
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:25,553
Ah, it won't be so hard for
you guys, though, you know.

1272
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,219
I mean, how lucky
can you get?

1273
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:28,801
Banished with your
best friend.

1274
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,262
He is not my friend.

1275
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:32,204
Oh. I just assumed you
were buddies, you know

1276
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:33,906
when I saw you out
there in the snow

1277
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:34,987
hugging and all that.

1278
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:36,098
Look at that big jerk.

1279
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:37,563
Ruined my life, and for what?

1280
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:38,763
A stupid kid!

1281
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,642
Because of you, ! am now stuck

1282
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,311
in this frozen wasteland!

1283
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:43,415
Wasteland?

1284
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,750
I think you mean wonderland!

1285
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,253
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?

1286
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,835
Oh, and wait till you see
the local village.

1287
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:52,618
Cutest thing in the world.

1288
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:54,936
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.

1289
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,627
What... what did you say?

1290
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,710
Yak's milk.

1291
00:59:57,861 --> 00:59:59,411
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic.

1292
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,183
You know, once you pick
the hairs out

1293
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:02,365
it's very nutritious.

1294
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,792
No, no. Something
about a village.

1295
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,080
Where? Are there kids in it?

1296
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,258
Kids? Sure.

1297
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,366
Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks...

1298
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:09,522
Where is it?!

1299
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:10,962
It's at the bottom
of the mountain.

1300
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:12,163
Around a three-day hike.

1301
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,482
Oh, three days?!

1302
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:14,907
We need to get there now!

1303
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,759
You want to go to the village?

1304
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,104
Okay, rule number one
out here.

1305
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:31,387
Always...

1306
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:32,551
No.

1307
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,749
Never go out in a blizzard.

1308
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:36,525
We need to get to Boo.

1309
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,875
Boo?!

1310
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,337
What about us?

1311
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,092
Ever since that kid came in

1312
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:45,601
you've ignored
everything I've said

1313
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,679
and now look where we are!

1314
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,258
Oh, we were about
to break the record, Sulley.

1315
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:51,954
We would have had it made!

1316
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:53,232
None of that matters now.

1317
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,696
None of it matter...

1318
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,102
Wa-wait a second.

1319
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,247
None of it matters?

1320
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:02,488
Okay.

1321
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,472
That's.... no. Good. Great.

1322
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,161
So, now the truth comes out,
doesn't it?

1323
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:10,371
Oh, would you look at that?

1324
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,440
We're out of snow cones, uh...

1325
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,162
Let me... just go outside

1326
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:15,544
and make some more.

1327
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:19,639
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

1328
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,110
Does that matter? Huh?

1329
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:25,277
And what about Celia?

1330
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:28,889
lam never... never
going to see her again.

1331
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:30,816
Doesn't that matter?

1332
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:37,883
What about me?

1333
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,494
I'm your pal.

1334
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,598
I'm... I'm your best friend.

1335
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,738
Don't I matter?

1336
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:48,424
I'm sorry, Mike.

1337
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:51,185
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

1338
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,504
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

1339
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,299
But Boo's in trouble.

1340
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,155
I think there might
be a way to save her

1341
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,910
if we can just
get down to that...

1342
01:01:59,149 --> 01:01:59,999
"We"?

1343
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa. "We"?

1344
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:03,158
No.

1345
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:05,133
There's no "we" this time, pal.

1346
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,505
If-if-if you want
to go out there

1347
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:08,964
and freeze to death

1348
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:11,269
you be my guest...

1349
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:14,225
because you're on your own.

1350
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,748
Hey, I got more snow cones!

1351
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,192
Ohh!

1352
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:06,118
Ahh!

1353
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:13,665
Ahh!

1354
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:44,802
Oh, come on, now, George.
I know you can do this.

1355
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:47,148
I picked out an easy door
for you-- in Nepal.

1356
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:49,297
Nice, quiet Nepal.

1357
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,112
You know, you're right.

1358
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:52,411
Here, take this.

1359
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,084
Go get 'em, Georgie!

1360
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,881
Gangway! Look out!
Coming through!

1361
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,272
Sorry, George.

1362
01:03:57,467 --> 01:03:58,607
Hey, you can't just...

1363
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,656
23...

1364
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:07,993
Out of the way!

1365
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,028
-Hey!
-Whoa!

1366
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,489
Don't!

1367
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,693
Finally!

1368
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,844
I never should have
trusted you with this.

1369
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,372
Because of you, I had
to banish my top scarer!

1370
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:21,803
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.

1371
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,115
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.

1372
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:27,057
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be!

1373
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,363
Kitty!

1374
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,679
Kitty!

1375
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,400
Sullivan?

1376
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,408
Wh-whoa!

1377
01:04:57,694 --> 01:04:58,864
Kitty!

1378
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,051
Sorry, Boo.

1379
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,430
Stop him!

1380
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,906
Let's get you home.

1381
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:07,806
Ooh!

1382
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,171
Finish him off!

1383
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:10,241
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

1384
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:17,679
You don't know how long

1385
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,434
I've wanted to do
that, Sullivan.

1386
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:26,471
Hah!

1387
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:27,383
Ooh!

1388
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,611
Ooh!

1389
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,842
Mike?!

1390
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,610
Look, it's not that I
don't care about the kid.

1391
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,004
Mike, you don't understand.

1392
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,750
Yes, I do. l was
just mad, that's all.

1393
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:40,232
I needed some time to think.

1394
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,167
But you shouldn't
have left me out there.

1395
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:44,766
I'm being attacked!

1396
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,114
No, I'm not attacking you.

1397
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,359
I'm trying to be honest.

1398
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:48,394
Just hear me out.

1399
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,625
You and I are a team.

1400
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:52,183
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

1401
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:53,399
I-I-l know, kid.

1402
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,510
He's too sensitive.

1403
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,419
Come on, pal.

1404
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,081
If you start crying,
I'm going to cry

1405
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:01,633
and I'll never get through this.

1406
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:04,108
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you

1407
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:05,310
but lam now.

1408
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,162
Ow!

1409
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,606
Sulley, lam baring
my soul here.

1410
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:09,641
The least you could do
is pay attention!

1411
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,660
Hey, look at that--
it's Randall! It's...

1412
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:17,823
Oh.

1413
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,084
Come on!

1414
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,415
Get up!

1415
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,010
There can't be any witnesses.

1416
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:23,674
There won't be.

1417
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,491
I'm glad you came back, Mike.

1418
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:30,259
Somebody's got to take care
of you, you big hairball.

1419
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:31,636
Ow!

1420
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:33,538
Schmoopsie-poo,
Il really can't talk.

1421
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,723
Come on!

1422
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:36,261
Michael, if you don't tell me

1423
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,393
what's going on right
now, we are through!

1424
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:39,745
You hear me? Through!

1425
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:40,979
Here's the truth.

1426
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,804
You know the kid that they're
looking for-- Sulley let her in.

1427
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:43,935
We tried to send her back

1428
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,240
but Waternoose
had this secret plot

1429
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,607
and now Randall's right behind
us and he's trying to kill us!

1430
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,807
You expect me to believe that
pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!

1431
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:52,411
Mike Wazowski!

1432
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,140
l love you, Schmoopsie-poo!

1433
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,955
Move it! Look out, you...

1434
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:57,913
Oh!

1435
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:58,867
- idiot!

1436
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:01,966
Look out. Coming through,
here, coming through!

1437
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:03,362
Make way. Move it!

1438
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:04,692
Hurry up, hurry up.

1439
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,618
There they are!

1440
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:09,379
Attention, employees:
Randall Boggs

1441
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:12,309
has just broken
the all-time scare record.

1442
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,545
Huh?

1443
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:14,546
No, I didn't.

1444
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:15,657
Get out of my way!

1445
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,206
Go get 'em, Googley Bear!

1446
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:20,591
There it is!

1447
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,140
Get off my tail!

1448
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:23,392
Let me through!

1449
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,433
Sulley,
what are you doing?

1450
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:29,461
Grab on, Mike!

1451
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,572
Are you out of your...?

1452
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,486
Sulley, what are we doing?

1453
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,661
We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.

1454
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:48,344
What a plan--
simple, yet insane!

1455
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,207
Whoa.

1456
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,741
Oh, boy.

1457
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:04,556
Hold on!

1458
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:13,816
Wow!

1459
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:14,807
Don't look down!

1460
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,536
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick!

1461
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,638
Whoa!

1462
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:38,412
Oh, no!

1463
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:43,658
No!

1464
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:44,933
Aah...

1465
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,551
-Boo's door?
-There it is!

1466
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:49,778
How are we supposed
to get to it now?

1467
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,585
Oh, it's a dead end, Sulley!

1468
01:08:56,099 --> 01:08:57,179
There he is.

1469
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:58,217
Make her laugh.

1470
01:08:58,368 --> 01:08:59,038
What, Sulley?!

1471
01:08:59,167 --> 01:08:59,688
Just do it!

1472
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:01,381
Oh... ow!

1473
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,037
Get it open.

1474
01:09:10,345 --> 01:09:11,805
Here he comes.

1475
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:13,888
Give me that kid!

1476
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,964
Why couldn't we
get banished here?

1477
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,216
Come on. We got to
find another door.

1478
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,600
Look, Boo's door!

1479
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:34,953
There he is!

1480
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:36,154
Hurry up, hurry up!

1481
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:37,709
Give me your hand.

1482
01:09:43,845 --> 01:09:45,045
Come on, it slides,
it slides!

1483
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,178
Ooh, right, right, right.

1484
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,830
Jump! I'm behind you!

1485
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:57,763
Come on!

1486
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:01,987
Hurry up! Keep moving!

1487
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,248
Get inside!

1488
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,199
Ooh! That was weird.

1489
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:07,732
Mike?

1490
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,166
Oh, sorry, buddy.

1491
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:17,829
Oh!

1492
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,849
l hope that hurt, lizard boy!

1493
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:26,684
Great job, buddy. We lost him.

1494
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:28,807
Boo!

1495
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:29,808
Ha, ha!

1496
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:30,779
No!

1497
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:34,876
Nice working with you!

1498
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:35,981
Get it open!

1499
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:37,592
-I'm trying!
-Open the door!

1500
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:39,144
Come on, get in here!

1501
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:49,955
Boo!

1502
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:54,519
There they are!

1503
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:00,338
Sulley, what are you doing?

1504
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,790
Sulley!

1505
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,416
Looks like we caught
the express, pal.

1506
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:08,786
Do you see them?

1507
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:10,255
Straight ahead!

1508
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:13,545
No...

1509
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,090
Kitty!

1510
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:36,124
Boo!

1511
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:45,357
Look at everybody's
favorite scarer now!

1512
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,077
You stupid, pathetic waste!

1513
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,300
You've been number one
for too long, Sullivan.

1514
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,640
Now your time is up!

1515
01:11:56,946 --> 01:11:58,586
And don't worry.

1516
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:01,598
I'll take good care of the kid.

1517
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:02,808
No!

1518
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,440
She's not scared
of you anymore.

1519
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,277
Looks like you're out of a job.

1520
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:32,871
All right, come on,
over the plate.

1521
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:34,039
Let's see
the ol’ stuff here, pal.

1522
01:12:34,217 --> 01:12:35,706
Come on, now, chuck him,
chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.

1523
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:36,882
Hum, baby, here's the pitch.

1524
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,193
Wait, please, don't,
don't, don't!

1525
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:39,154
No!

1526
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:40,107
And he is... out of here!

1527
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,834
Mama, another gator
got in the house.

1528
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,043
Another gator?!

1529
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,864
Give me that shovel! Come here!

1530
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:50,334
Get him, Mama! Get that gator!

1531
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:52,944
Care to do the honors, Mikey?

1532
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:55,629
With pleasure.

1533
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:05,153
That's right, Boo.

1534
01:13:05,348 --> 01:13:06,338
You did it.

1535
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:07,475
You beat him.

1536
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:09,974
Come on.

1537
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:14,224
Okay, Boo, it's time to go home.

1538
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:16,513
Take care of yourself,
and be a good girl, okay?

1539
01:13:18,027 --> 01:13:19,017
Oh, no!

1540
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,045
The power's out!

1541
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:21,456
Make her laugh again.

1542
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:22,834
All right, 1 got a move here.

1543
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:24,172
It'll bring down the house.

1544
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:25,327
Up...

1545
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,050
Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.

1546
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:31,742
What?! What'd you do,
forget to check

1547
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:32,964
if her stupid hood was up

1548
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,251
ya big dope?!

1549
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:36,407
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.

1550
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:38,052
You know we still need her
to laugh.

1551
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:39,101
Right.

1552
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:41,713
Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!

1553
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,355
Funny, right? Huh?
See what the...

1554
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,607
These are the jokes, kid.

1555
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:46,777
Whoa!

1556
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:48,506
What's happening?

1557
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,718
Hold on!

1558
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:54,175
When the door lands
in this station, cut the power.

1559
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,862
You'll have the child
and the criminals responsible

1560
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,483
for this whole mess.

1561
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,585
Great.
A welcoming committee!

1562
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:03,421
What are we going to do?!

1563
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,273
This is the CDA.

1564
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:17,442
Come out slowly

1565
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,050
with the child in plain sight.

1566
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,308
Okay, okay.

1567
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:22,474
You got us.

1568
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:23,615
Here we are.

1569
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:24,663
Here's the kid.

1570
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,137
I'm cooperating.

1571
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:28,032
But before you take us away,
I have one thing to say:

1572
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:30,562
Catch!

1573
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,516
2319!

1574
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:34,262
We have a toxic projectile!

1575
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:35,937
Halt! After the suspect!

1576
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:37,432
Cover the area!
Bring in reinforcements!

1577
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,950
Stop him!

1578
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:42,957
Come on.

1579
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,105
Don't let them get away.

1580
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,264
What...?!

1581
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:47,375
No, wait, wait!

1582
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:49,010
Come back! He has the child!

1583
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,777
Sullivan? Sullivan!

1584
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:58,556
Give me the child!

1585
01:14:58,794 --> 01:14:59,844
Me not go!

1586
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:00,819
Give her to me!

1587
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:13,605
Open this door!
Open this door!

1588
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,588
Hey!

1589
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,137
Sullivan!

1590
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:21,866
Don't do it.

1591
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:23,652
Come on.

1592
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:26,416
Don't go in that room!

1593
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,574
I think we stopped him, Boo.

1594
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:31,883
You're safe now.

1595
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:34,960
You be a good girl, okay?

1596
01:15:35,398 --> 01:15:37,648
This has gone far enough, James.

1597
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,200
She's home now!
Just leave her alone!

1598
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:40,392
I can't do that!

1599
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:41,559
She's seen too much.

1600
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,287
You both have.

1601
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,739
It doesn't have to be this way.

1602
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,370
I have no choice!

1603
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:47,539
Times have changed.

1604
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,170
Scaring isn't enough anymore.

1605
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:50,702
But kidnapping children?!

1606
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:52,312
I'll kidnap
a thousand children

1607
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,858
before I let this company die

1608
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,663
and I'll silence anyone

1609
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,558
who gets in my way!

1610
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:58,990
No!

1611
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:01,238
Good night, Mom.

1612
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,047
Good night, sweetheart.

1613
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,162
Good night, Mom.

1614
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,346
What, wh-what is this?!
What? Who? Huh?

1615
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,742
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

1616
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,815
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys

1617
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,800
but I spotted
several big mistakes.

1618
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,379
But-but-but how-how did...?
How did...?

1619
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:15,593
You know what?

1620
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:18,260
Let's watch my favorite part
again... shall we?

1621
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:21,391
I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die.

1622
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,481
What...? Wha...?

1623
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,496
I'll kidnap
a thousand children before...

1624
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,539
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

1625
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,091
Shh!

1626
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:31,169
lll get him.

1627
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,309
All right, come with us, sir.

1628
01:16:32,488 --> 01:16:33,508
Wh-what are you doing?

1629
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:34,539
Take your hands off me!

1630
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,650
You can't arrest me!

1631
01:16:35,825 --> 01:16:36,934
Il hope you're happy, Sullivan!

1632
01:16:37,126 --> 01:16:39,086
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!

1633
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:41,735
Where will everyone
get their scream now?!

1634
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:44,118
The energy crisis
will only get worse

1635
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,833
because of you!

1636
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:51,131
Stay where you are.

1637
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:52,294
Huh?

1638
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:53,815
Number One
wants to talk to you.

1639
01:16:54,043 --> 01:16:55,793
Attention!

1640
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:03,981
Hello, boys.

1641
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,186
Roz?!

1642
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:08,834
Two and a half years
of undercover work

1643
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:11,058
were almost wasted

1644
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:14,517
when you intercepted
that child, Mr. Sullivan.

1645
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:18,097
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known

1646
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:21,057
that this went all the way up
to Waternoose.

1647
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,024
Now...

1648
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,607
about the girl...

1649
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:30,593
I just want to send her home.

1650
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:32,033
Very good.

1651
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,875
Bring me a door shredder.

1652
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,927
What, you mean... you mean,
I can't see her again?

1653
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:41,344
That's the way it has to be.

1654
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,510
I'll give you five minutes.

1655
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,767
Well, so long, kid.

1656
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,736
Mike Wazowski!

1657
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,237
Yeah.

1658
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:05,169
Ah, Boo, it's been fun.

1659
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:06,988
Go ahead.

1660
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,373
Go grow up.

1661
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:29,224
Uh-uh, B-Boo...?

1662
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:31,366
Um... Boo?

1663
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:34,065
Oh, look at that.

1664
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:36,263
Yeah, you know...

1665
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:38,068
Oh, that's cute, yeah.

1666
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:40,475
Uh, Boo, um...

1667
01:18:41,684 --> 01:18:44,584
Well, that's very nice.

1668
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,250
Come here, you!

1669
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:57,027
Oh, he's a happy bear...

1670
01:19:03,272 --> 01:19:04,942
Nothing's coming
out of your closet

1671
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,547
to scare you anymore, right?

1672
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:07,764
Mm...

1673
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:10,113
Yeah.

1674
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:12,616
Good-bye, Boo.

1675
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:15,258
Kitty.

1676
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:17,518
Kitty has to go.

1677
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:00,093
Boo!

1678
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,458
Kitty?

1679
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,342
None of this

1680
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:17,152
ever happened, gentlemen.

1681
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:21,706
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

1682
01:20:43,806 --> 01:20:45,826
Take him away.

1683
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,927
I bet we get
the rest of the day off.

1684
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,202
You idiot!

1685
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,220
They're going to shut down
the factory!

1686
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,990
I'm telling you, pal,
when that wall went up

1687
01:20:57,286 --> 01:20:59,476
you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.

1688
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:01,752
Whoo-hoo! I hope we get
a copy of that tape.

1689
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:03,107
Hey, you all right?

1690
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:05,132
Come on, pal,
cheer up, we did it!

1691
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:06,416
We got Boo home.

1692
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,675
Ah, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet, and...

1693
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,107
gee, hundreds of people
will be out of work now.

1694
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,543
Not to mention the angry mob
that'll come after us

1695
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,509
when there's no more power,
but, hey...

1696
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:18,401
at least we had
some laughs, right?

1697
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:23,343
Laughs...

1698
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:44,428
Hey, is this thing on? Hello?

1699
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,156
Hello? Testing, testing.

1700
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,662
Hey, good evening. How are you?

1701
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,180
How are you? Nice to see you.

1702
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:51,134
I tell you, it's good
to be here in... your room.

1703
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:52,493
Where you from?

1704
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:53,814
Never mind.

1705
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:55,789
You're in kindergarten, right?

1706
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:57,068
Oh, I love kindergarten.

1707
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,766
Best three years of my life.

1708
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,215
Of my life.

1709
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,269
But I love sports.

1710
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:03,591
Dodgeball was the best.

1711
01:22:03,786 --> 01:22:04,636
Oh, yeah.

1712
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:06,077
I was the fastest one out there.

1713
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,777
Course I was the ball.

1714
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,573
But I...

1715
01:22:09,825 --> 01:22:11,165
was the ball, see?

1716
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:12,853
All right.

1717
01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:23,437
Ah...

1718
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,000
Ah?

1719
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:28,826
Hey, thanks a lot.

1720
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,031
I'll be here all week.

1721
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:31,702
Remember to tip your waitresses.

1722
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:37,594
Great job, Mikey.

1723
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,746
You filled your quota on
the first kid of the day.

1724
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,045
Not bad, huh?

1725
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:43,093
You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing

1726
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,068
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

1727
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:46,697
Uh-huh, and the fact
that laughter is

1728
01:22:46,929 --> 01:22:48,189
ten times more
powerful than scream

1729
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,390
had nothing to do with it.

1730
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:51,906
Oh, Googley Bear.

1731
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,090
Come here, you.

1732
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,260
Schmoopsie-poo!

1733
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,340
Googley.

1734
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:57,465
Whoa!

1735
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:00,907
Girls!
Girls, put...

1736
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,096
Stop, stop, stop!

1737
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:05,462
Michael, you're such a charmer.

1738
01:23:05,781 --> 01:23:06,951
Hey, did you bring the magazine?

1739
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,229
They just delivered a whole box.

1740
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:10,410
Let me see it!

1741
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,089
Sulley and !
made the cover, right?

1742
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,251
I don't believe it.

1743
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,121
Googley Bear...

1744
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:20,349
I'm on the cover of a magazine!

1745
01:23:20,796 --> 01:23:22,026
Ow!

1746
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,608
Oh, this is great!

1747
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:36,903
Oh.

1748
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,454
Hey, Sulley!

1749
01:23:57,799 --> 01:23:58,789
Hey, uh, Mike.
I was, uh, just...

1750
01:23:58,967 --> 01:23:59,956
Well, listen,
if you got a minute

1751
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:01,395
there's something
I want to show you.

1752
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:02,453
But-but-but...

1753
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:03,454
Okay, close your eyes.

1754
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:04,565
Follow me. Come on.

1755
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:05,590
I-I-I...

1756
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:06,761
No peeking.

1757
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:10,013
Keep coming, keep coming,
keep coming.

1758
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:11,179
Come on, keep coming.

1759
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,306
Keep coming, keep coming.

1760
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:13,504
Mike...

1761
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:15,352
Follow the sultry
sound of my voice.

1762
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:16,637
Okay, stop.
Open them.

1763
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:18,368
Ta-da!

1764
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:20,140
Mike...

1765
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:21,499
Is that...?

1766
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:22,830
Sorry it took

1767
01:24:23,025 --> 01:24:24,014
so long, pal.

1768
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,302
It was a lot of wood
to go through.

1769
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:27,998
You know, it only works

1770
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,009
if you have every piece.

1771
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,962
Boo?

1772
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:00,841
Kitty!

1773
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:13,294
-Speed.
-Marker.

1774
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:14,465
And... action.

1775
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:21,923
With a million or two

1776
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,081
I'd live in a penthouse

1777
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:29,497
In a room with a view

1778
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:31,672
And if l were handsome

1779
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:32,797
No way.

1780
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,071
It could happen.

1781
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:37,692
Those dreams do come true

1782
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,889
I wouldn't have nothing
if l didn't have you

1783
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:45,807
Wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have

1784
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:49,588
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

1785
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,568
Wouldn't have nothing...

1786
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:55,046
Okay, cut.

1787
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,340
Okay, you finished now, right?

1788
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:01,476
Hello?

1789
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:02,442
Hello.

1790
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:07,441
Come on, get lost, you two.

1791
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:08,858
You're making him lose
his focus.

1792
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:09,914
Oh, sorry.

1793
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:11,205
See you later, fellas.

1794
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,389
Go get 'em, Mr. Solomon.

1795
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:13,417
You idiot!

1796
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:14,558
It's Sullivan, not Solomon!

1797
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:15,556
What?

1798
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:16,574
You're messing up the scene!

1799
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:17,588
Sorry.

1800
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,079
We're never going to work
in Hollywood again!

1801
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:20,157
Let me do it over.

1802
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:21,158
Shut up!

1803
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:22,159
Keep rolling!

1804
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:23,160
You're making it worse!

1805
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:25,151
Duck and cover, people!

1806
01:26:31,053 --> 01:26:31,923
Hey, thanks, guys.

1807
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:33,137
That was a close one.

1808
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,624
Ta-da!

1809
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,325
Oh, Boo, it's been fun.

1810
01:26:49,071 --> 01:26:50,241
Go ahead.

1811
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:52,115
Go throw up.

1812
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:54,748
What? What did I say?

1813
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,826
What? What?

1814
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:56,847
Cut.

1815
01:26:58,714 --> 01:26:59,564
Hey, Ted!

1816
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:00,585
Good morning!

1817
01:27:02,017 --> 01:27:02,867
Cut.

1818
01:27:03,018 --> 01:27:04,248
Hey, how was that? Was I scary?

1819
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:05,309
Do I get the part?

1820
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,390
Thank you.

1821
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:07,405
Can I do it again?

1822
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:08,406
I can be taller!

1823
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:09,407
Next!

1824
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,398
And action!

1825
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:13,183
Okay, let's move.
Let's move, let's move!

1826
01:27:15,497 --> 01:27:16,317
Ow!

1827
01:27:17,766 --> 01:27:20,425
Can we get a little more wax
on the floor, please?

1828
01:27:20,836 --> 01:27:21,766
Wait a minute. Randall?

1829
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:22,787
That cheater!

1830
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:24,518
He's trying
to boost his numbers!

1831
01:27:24,773 --> 01:27:25,913
There's something else.

1832
01:27:26,108 --> 01:27:26,958
What?!

1833
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:29,299
Look-lay in the bag-bay.

1834
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:31,664
I think you mean
“Ook-lay in the ag-bay.”

1835
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,000
What? Didn't I...?

1836
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:34,880
Well, you know, maybe
you should just take a minute

1837
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,049
and ead-ray your ipt-scray.

1838
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,472
You think he's going
to come through the closet

1839
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:40,641
and scare you.

1840
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:42,279
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

1841
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:43,664
Uh, it's empty.

1842
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:44,819
See?

1843
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,333
Guess who.

1844
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:57,521
Hey, what's the...

1845
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:01,061
Okay, very funny.

1846
01:28:01,243 --> 01:28:02,943
Hey, I look good in a suit.

1847
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:04,551
Marker.

1848
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,530
Let her rip.

1849
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:07,865
Go.

1850
01:28:10,185 --> 01:28:11,005
Whoa!

1851
01:28:11,153 --> 01:28:13,023
Shut it off! Shut it off!

1852
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:15,826
Pull the lever!

1853
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,232
You're making it worse!

1854
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:24,423
But I must admit it

1855
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:28,736
Big guy,
you always come through

1856
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:33,904
I wouldn't have nothing
if l didn't have you

1857
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:40,067
You and me together

1858
01:28:40,549 --> 01:28:43,919
That's how it
always should be

1859
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:49,672
One without the other
don't mean nothing to me

1860
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:53,042
Nothing to me...

1861
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:54,418
Oh, hey!

1862
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:56,965
We're rehearsing a scene
for the upcoming company play

1863
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,382
called Put That Thing Back
Where It Came From

1864
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:01,101
Or So Help Me.

1865
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,420
It's a musical!

1866
01:29:03,605 --> 01:29:05,184
Put that thing back where
it came from, or so help me

1867
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:06,437
Bom-bom, bom-bom,
bom-bom...

1868
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:07,838
Get that thing
away from me, you guys

1869
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:10,883
Put that thing back
where it came from

1870
01:29:11,313 --> 01:29:13,653
Or I'll poke myself
in the eye!

1871
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,595
It's a work in progress.

1872
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,371
It's gonna get better.

1873
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:21,765
Ladies and gentlemen

1874
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:24,620
welcome to this year's
company play

1875
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,366
starring, written

1876
01:29:26,595 --> 01:29:28,055
and directed by Mike...

1877
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:29,146
and produced!

1878
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:31,347
And produced by Mike Wazowski.

1879
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:33,126
Oh.

1880
01:29:35,637 --> 01:29:39,097
Put that thing back where it
came from, or so help me

1881
01:29:39,608 --> 01:29:40,478
So help me

1882
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:42,722
So help me get by

1883
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,564
Put that thing back
where it came from

1884
01:29:44,813 --> 01:29:45,683
Or so help me

1885
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:46,807
So help me

1886
01:29:46,982 --> 01:29:48,622
I just gotta cry...

1887
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:50,694
Your seat is right
over there, sir.

1888
01:29:50,986 --> 01:29:52,296
Boo!

1889
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,010
There's a child,
there's a child

1890
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:55,246
There's a human child

1891
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:56,280
Oh, no!

1892
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:57,511
Running ‘round
the restaurant

1893
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,422
This is really wild

1894
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:01,184
What in heaven's name
will become of us

1895
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:03,516
We who are living
in Monstropolis?

1896
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,135
All right, Wazowski.

1897
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,514
Tell us where the kid is.

1898
01:30:13,642 --> 01:30:15,192
I will never talk!

1899
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:16,380
Never!

1900
01:30:19,047 --> 01:30:21,797
She's out of our hair

1901
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:28,799
And just when I dare...
to care

1902
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:32,417
She says, "au contraire”

1903
01:30:32,861 --> 01:30:36,581
You're my pair... of friends

1904
01:30:37,132 --> 01:30:37,922
I love you.

1905
01:30:39,234 --> 01:30:40,604
Keep it together, man!

1906
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:46,845
And so we put that kid
back where she came from

1907
01:30:47,709 --> 01:30:50,318
And she helped us to find

1908
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:56,452
A better tomorrow today!

1909
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:58,575
Thank you!

1910
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,777
What a night for my mother
to be in the audience!

1911
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:01,939
Ladies and gentlemen

1912
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:02,910
my mom!

1913
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,240
Thank you, Monstropolis!

1914
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:11,062
I don't have to say it

1915
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:12,519
Ah, say it anyway.

1916
01:31:12,701 --> 01:31:13,551
‘Cause we...

1917
01:31:13,702 --> 01:31:16,072
Both know it's true

1918
01:31:16,438 --> 01:31:20,598
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

1919
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:24,519
I wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have

1920
01:31:25,013 --> 01:31:28,793
I wouldn't have nothing
if l didn't have you

1921
01:31:29,351 --> 01:31:34,891
Wouldn't have nothing
if l didn't have you.

1922
01:31:36,725 --> 01:31:38,395
One more time.

1923
01:31:40,562 --> 01:31:41,412
It worked!

1924
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:43,113
I don't have to say it

1925
01:31:43,365 --> 01:31:44,594
I'm gonna anyway!

1926
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:46,669
‘Cause we both know
it's true

1927
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:48,668
Let's take it home, big guy.

1928
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:52,537
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

1929
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:56,294
I wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have

1930
01:31:56,778 --> 01:32:00,588
I wouldn't have nothing
if l didn't have you

1931
01:32:01,149 --> 01:32:02,639
You, you

1932
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:03,874
A, E, I, ©...

1933
01:32:04,052 --> 01:32:05,862
That means you, yeah.
