1
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:50,094
My name's Ralph, and I'm a bad guy.

2
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,751
Let's see. I'm nine feet tall.
! weigh 643 pounds.

3
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,958
Got a little bit of a temper on me.

4
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,706
My passion bubbles
very near the surface,

5
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,775
I guess, not gonna lie.

6
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,749
Anyhoo, what else?

7
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,432
I'ma wrecker. I wreck things.
Professionally.

8
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,093
I'm very good at what ! do.
Probably the best I know.

9
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,264
The thing is, fixing
is the name of the game.

10
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,176
Literally, Fix-It Felix, Jr.

11
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,032
So, yeah, naturally,

12
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,740
the guy with the name
Fix-It Felix is the good guy.

13
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,770
He's nice enough as good guys go.

14
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,777
Definitely fixes stuff really well.

15
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,925
But if you've got a magic hammer
from your father,

16
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,708
how hard can it be?

17
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,923
If he was a regular contractor
carpenter guy,

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,570
! guarantee you would not be able

19
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,679
to fix the damage that I do as quickly.

20
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,716
And when Felix does
a good job, he gets a medal.

21
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,782
But are there medals for
wrecking stuff really well?

22
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,926
To that I say, "Ha!"

23
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,649
And, no, there aren't.

24
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,922
Thirty years I've been doing this

25
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,704
and I've seen a lot of
other games come and go.

26
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,893
Kind of sad. I think about
all those guys from Asteroids.

27
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,460
Boom! Gone. Centipede?

28
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,452
Who knows where
that guy is, you know?

29
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,458
Look, a steady arcade gig
is nothing to sneeze at.

30
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:24,807
I'm very lucky.

31
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,176
It's just, l got to say,

32
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,772
it becomes kind of hard to love your job

33
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,051
when no one seems to
like you for doing it.

34
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,314
All clear! The arcade is closed!

35
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,132
Shoryuken!

36
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,908
Whoo! What a day! You want to
head to Tappers, Ken?

37
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,765
If you're buying, buddy.

38
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:51,927
Quitting time!

39
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,587
! don't know.

40
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,229
Maybe ! wouldn't be feeling this way

41
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,284
if things were different after work.

42
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,810
But it is what it is.

43
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,055
Good job, everyone!

44
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,583
Felix and the Nicelanders

45
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,505
go hang out in their homes

46
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,050
which he's just fixed,
and everyone, you know...

47
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,948
They go to their homes, I go to mine

48
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,871
which happens to be a dump.

49
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,777
And when! say "a dump,"

50
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,249
! don't mean like a shabby place.

51
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,679
! mean an actual dump,

52
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,990
where the garbage goes

53
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,218
and a bunch of bricks
and smashed building parts...

54
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,096
That's what I call home.

55
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,379
I guess I can't bellyache too much.

56
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,007
! got my bricks, l got my stump.

57
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,841
It looks uncomfortable.
It's actually fine. I'm good.

58
00:03:56,937 --> 00:04:01,007
But if I'm really honest with myself...

59
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,892
! see Felix up there
getting patted on the back,

60
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:10,093
people are giving him pie
and thanking him

61
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,394
and so happy to see him all the time.

62
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,764
Sometimes I think...

63
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:20,643
Man, it sure must be nice
being the good guy.

64
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,488
Nice share, Ralph.

65
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:27,986
As fellow bad guys,

66
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,465
we've all felt what you're feeling

67
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,976
and we've come to terms with it.

68
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,508
-Really?
-Right here.

69
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,596
lam Zangief. lam bad guy.

70
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,775
-Hi, Zangief!
-Hi, Zangief.

71
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,830
l relate to you, Ralph.
When I hit bottom,

72
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,640
l was crushing man's skull

73
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,315
like sparrow egg between my thighs.

74
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,566
And I think, "Why do you have
to be so bad, Zangief?

75
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,162
"Why can't you be more like good guy?"

76
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,828
Then I have moment of clarity.

77
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,958
If Zangief is good guy,

78
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,973
who'll crush man's skull

79
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,201
like sparrow's egg between thighs?

80
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,477
And I say, "Zangief, you are bad guy,

81
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,806
"but this does not mean
you are 'bad' guy.”

82
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,926
Right. I'm sorry. You lost me there.

83
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,735
-Zombie! Bad guy!
-Hi, Zombie.

84
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,193
Hi, Zombie.

85
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,499
Zangief saying
labels not make you happy.

86
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,919
Good! Bad!

87
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,429
You must love you.

88
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,821
-Yeah! Inside here!
-Yes.

89
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,904
Okay. All right, l get you.
Watch out. It's dripping.

90
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,313
Question, Ralph.

91
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,751
We've been asking you
to Bad-Anon for years now

92
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,864
and tonight you finally show up.

93
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:38,943
-Why is that?
-l don't know.

94
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,376
I just felt like coming.

95
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,430
Il suppose it has
something to do with the fact that...

96
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,897
Well, today is the 30th
anniversary of my game.

97
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,020
Well, happy anniversary, Ralph.

98
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,440
Thanks, Satan.

99
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,908
It's Sateen, actually.

100
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,257
Got it. But here's the thing.

101
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,762
I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

102
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,161
You can't mess with
the program, Ralph.

103
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,850
You're not going Turbo, are you?

104
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,215
Turbo? No, I'm not going Turbo!
Come on, guys!

105
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,293
Is it Turbo to want a friend?
Or a medal?

106
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,419
Or a piece of pie every once in a while?

107
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,241
Is it Turbo to want more out of life?

108
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,749
Yes!

109
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,765
Ralph, Ralph, we get it.

110
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,716
But we can't change who we are.

111
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,135
And the sooner you accept that,

112
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,430
the better off your game
and your life will be.

113
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,697
Hey. One game at a time, Ralph.

114
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,437
Let's close out with
the Bad Guy Affirmation.

115
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,917
I'm bad, and that's good.

116
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,656
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

117
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,204
There's no one I'd rather be than me.

118
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,316
Okay, gang, see you next week.

119
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,282
Listen, can't do snacks next week.

120
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,971
Hang in there, Ralph.

121
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,460
Hey, Zombie, don't forget your hatchets.

122
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,685
There you go.

123
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,988
Step aside, sir. Random security check.

124
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,130
Random my behind!
You always stop me.

125
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,452
I'm just a surge protector
doing my job, sir.

126
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,313
-Name?
-Lara Croft.

127
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,992
-Name?
-Wreck-lt Ralph!

128
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,521
And where are you coming from?

129
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,991
Pac-Man.

130
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,490
Did you bring any fruit with you?

131
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,052
No! No. No fruit.

132
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,503
Okay, then. Where are you heading?

133
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,635
Fix-It Felix Jr.

134
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,449
-Anything to declare?
-l hate you.

135
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,320
I get that a lot. Proceed.

136
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,294
Bad guy coming!

137
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,813
If you leave your game,

138
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,813
stay safe, stay alert,

139
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,198
and whatever you do, don't die.

140
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:39,486
Because if you die
outside your own game

141
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,175
you don't regenerate.

142
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,978
Ever. Game over.

143
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,273
Here you go, buddy.

144
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,214
It's fresh. Straight from Pac-Man's.

145
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,052
Hang in there, guys.

146
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,361
Name?

147
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,622
"Happy 30th Anniversary"?

148
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,154
They're having a party without me.

149
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,494
Pac-Man? They invited Pac-Man?

150
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,067
That cherry-chasing dot-muncher

151
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,690
isn't even part of this game!

152
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,605
Great party, Felix.

153
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,030
Why, thank you, friend.

154
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,962
Felix. You're needed on the dance floor!

155
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,784
Fix-It Felix! Fix-It Felix!

156
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,835
I'll bet that's Mario.

157
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,096
Fashionably late, per the norm.

158
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,845
I'll get it, Felix.

159
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:20,736
It's Ralph!

160
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,885
-He'll wreck the party!
-Hide the stemware!

161
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,074
Get rid of him, Felix.

162
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,665
Oh, right. I'll go talk to him.

163
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,434
Carry on, everyone.

164
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,328
Ralph, can I help you?

165
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,286
Hey, Felix.
Just wanted to check on you.

166
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,302
l saw a big explosion

167
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,689
or something go over the building there.

168
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,450
Those were just fireworks.

169
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,079
Fireworks. Okay. Phewf.

170
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,887
Somebody's birthday, or...

171
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,892
Well, it's more of an anniversary.

172
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,770
The 30th anniversary
of our game, actually.

173
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,886
What? Is that today?

174
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,238
Il know!

175
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,686
I'm such a dummy with dates.

176
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,954
Anyway, congratulations.

177
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,120
Thank you, Ralph. And to you, too.

178
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,270
Just a heads-up, Felix.

179
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,442
They're bringing out the cake
in a few shakes.

180
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,200
-Hey, Glen.
-Ralph.

181
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,234
Cake? Heard about this cake stuff.

182
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:21,797
Never had it.

183
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,218
No one ever seems to throw it out

184
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,412
so it never ends up in the dump.

185
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,094
l never actually tasted it.

186
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,916
I've always wanted to try cake.

187
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,807
I don't suppose you'd like to

188
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,499
come in and have a slice, would you?

189
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,914
Hey-o, everybody!

190
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,379
I'm okay. I'm okay. Fit as a fiddle.

191
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,343
-Now, you all know Ralph.
-Evening.

192
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,739
Evening, Nell, Lucy, Don, Dana...

193
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,860
-Deanna.
-Big Gene!

194
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,359
Why is he here?

195
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,530
He's just here for a slice of cake.

196
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,443
And I'm a big part of the game,

197
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,078
technically speaking.

198
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,883
Why are you here, Gene?

199
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,458
Oh, look! The cake!

200
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:12,535
Well, I'll be dipped. You've
really outdone yourself, Mary.

201
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,306
Oh, and look!
There's all of us at the top.

202
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,661
Each apartment
is everyone's favorite flavor.

203
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,568
Norwood's is red velvet.

204
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,723
Guilty!

205
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,992
And lemon for Lucy, rum cake for Gene,

206
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:26,785
-and for Felix...
-Hey, Mary.

207
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,201
What's the flavor of that mud
that I'm stuck in there?

208
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,218
Oh. Chocolate.

209
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,888
I've never been real fond of chocolate.

210
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,872
Well, I did not know that.

211
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,285
One other little thing.

212
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,596
I hate to be picky,
but this angry little guy here...

213
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,863
-My cake!
-...might be a lot happier

214
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,279
if you put him up here
with everyone else.

215
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,538
See that? Look at that smile.

216
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,734
No, no. You see, Ralph,

217
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,882
there's no room for you up here.

218
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,436
What about this? We can make room.

219
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,198
Here. We could take turns. Easy.

220
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,269
How about we just eat the cake?

221
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,664
Hang on. Felix needs to be on the roof

222
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,753
because he's about to get his medal!

223
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,092
Then how about we just take that medal

224
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,631
and give it to Ralph for once?

225
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,262
Would that be
the end of the world, Gene?

226
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,117
Now you're just being ridiculous.

227
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,925
Only good guys win medals,

228
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,421
and you, sir, are no good guy.

229
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,133
I could be a good guy if I wanted to,

230
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,332
and I could win a medal!

231
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,089
And when you do, come and talk to us.

232
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,915
Then would you finally let me be
on top of the cake with you guys?

233
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,259
If you won a medal,

234
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,150
we'd let you live
up here in the penthouse!

235
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,181
But it will never happen

236
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,231
because you're just the bad guy
who wrecks the building.

237
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,080
No, I'm not.

238
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,345
Yes, you are!

239
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,053
No, I'm not!

240
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,647
Yes, you are.

241
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,735
All right, Gene. You know what?

242
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,451
I'm going to win a medal.

243
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,909
Oh, lam going to win a medal!

244
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,835
The shiniest medal
this place has ever seen!

245
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,398
A medal that will be so good

246
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,430
that it will make Felix's
medals wet their pants!

247
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,170
And good night!
Thank you for the party.

248
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,978
-ls he serious?
-Oh, please!

249
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,199
Where's a bad guy
going to win a medal?

250
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,339
Of course he's not serious.

251
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,704
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

252
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,598
That's why I came
straight here, Tapper.

253
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,189
You've never given me a bum steer.

254
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,751
Now, come on. Where can a guy
like me go and win a medal?

255
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,305
I don't think such a game exists, Ralph.

256
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,951
Oh, come on. You know people.
There's got to be...

257
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,363
Tapper, I need a root beer.

258
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,934
Coming! Hold that thought.

259
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,729
Okay. As you were saying.

260
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,651
I was saying,
l can't spend another 30 years

261
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,298
living alone in the garbage.

262
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,139
I'm not going back without a medal.

263
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,798
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

264
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,083
Maybe somebody left a medal here.

265
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,402
You're welcome to dig
through the lost and found.

266
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,113
Okay, let's see what we got here.

267
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,470
Go on, get out of here.

268
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,531
Mushroom? No.

269
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,137
What is this? No.

270
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,976
Come on, Zangief! Gross.

271
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:20,925
What am I doing?

272
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,445
-Hey, excuse you!
-We are humanity's last hope.

273
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,228
Our mission? Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

274
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,568
We are humanity's last hope.

275
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,361
You okay there, space cadet?

276
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,213
We've only been plugged in a week

277
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,574
and every day it's,
"Climb the building, then fight bugs.

278
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,155
"Climb the building, fight more bugs!"

279
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,627
Yeah, yeah. Right. Look.

280
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,625
Easy on the overalls, spaceman.

281
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,093
It's tough all over, all right?

282
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,839
And all for what? A lousy medal?

283
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,722
Medal? You win a medal?

284
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,638
Yeah, Medal of Heroes.

285
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,643
Is it shiny?

286
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,442
Pretty shiny.

287
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,488
-And it says "hero" on it?
-Oh, yeah.

288
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,847
And you say you win it
by climbing a building?

289
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,699
-And fighting bugs!
-Right, bugs.

290
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,233
Is there any chance I could go
with you to your game

291
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,512
and maybe get one of those medals?

292
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,482
-Negatory.
-Does that mean maybe?

293
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,744
No! Look, only the bravest

294
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,680
and the best serve in our corps.

295
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:17,993
Bug!

296
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,739
We are humanity's last hope.

297
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,940
Attention! The arcade will
open in five minutes.

298
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,169
Please report to your games.

299
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,675
I can't feel my legs.
What is all this stuff?

300
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,464
Smells like Ralph in here.

301
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,420
Okay. All right.
What was it called again?

302
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,456
Hero's something.

303
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,931
Duty. Hero's Duty.

304
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,213
There it is.

305
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,165
Sorry, Q*bert. It's me, Ralph.

306
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:12,661
The wall.

307
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,800
Morning, kids. Come on in.

308
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,155
Good to see you.
Good to see you. You, too, little fella.

309
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,693
Quarter alert! Quarter alert!

310
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:33,901
This is not a drill.

311
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,523
Ooh! Sweet golden medal!

312
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,212
On a planet with no name

313
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,190
a top-secret experiment
has gone horribly wrong.

314
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,318
You are humanity's last hope.

315
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,930
Rooting-tooting, ready for shooting!

316
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,542
All right.

317
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,370
Now listen up, because
I'm only going to say this once.

318
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,087
Fear is a four-letter word, ladies.

319
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,719
If you want to go pee-pee
in your big-boy slacks,

320
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,227
keep it to yourself.

321
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,600
It's make your mamas proud time!

322
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,076
l love my mama!

323
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,824
Heads up! First-person shooter,

324
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,022
coming through!

325
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,550
Ooh, robot!

326
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,790
Game play in three, two, one.

327
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,942
We are humanity's last hope.

328
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,120
Our mission?

329
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,913
Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

330
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,245
You ready, rookie? Let's find out.

331
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,436
Sweet Mother Hubbard!

332
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,989
No, no, no! Wait a second!

333
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,499
Cy-Bug, twelve o'clock. Take it, newbie.

334
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,634
No, no! Wait, wait!

335
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,092
Watch it, rookie! These monsters
become what they eat.

336
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,498
My gun! Give me that back.

337
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,316
Shoot the eggs before they hatch!

338
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,565
Oh, no!

339
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,127
Something's coming out of their bottom!

340
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,084
-Oh, gross!
-Markowski!

341
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,795
Get back in formation!

342
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,815
All right, ladies,

343
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,280
the kitten whispers
and tickle fights stop now.

344
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,216
The entrance to the lab
is straight ahead.

345
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,081
-I'll meet you guys inside!
-No!

346
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,305
Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

347
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,138
l thought this was going
to be like Centipede!

348
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,250
When did video games
become so violent and scary?

349
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,714
Please, get me out of here!

350
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,429
Take her!

351
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:47,846
What a rip-off!

352
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,727
Get off me! It's game over. Stop it!

353
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,627
Beacon up!

354
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,529
Cease fire! Cease fire!

355
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,991
Attention! Return to start positions.

356
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,940
Return to start positions.

357
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,187
Here, let me help you. Sorry about that.

358
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,273
Yeah, you must be upset.

359
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,165
-Markowski.
-Who?

360
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,040
Yeah, me. I'm Markowski.

361
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,904
What's the first rule of Hero's Duty?

362
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,456
No cuts, no butts, no coconuts?

363
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,436
Never interfere with
the first-person shooter.

364
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,443
Our job is to get the gamers
to the top of that building

365
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,122
so they can get a medal, and that's it!

366
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,355
So stick to the program, soldier!

367
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,557
Right. Right. Aye, aye.

368
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,175
Quarter alert! Quarter alert!

369
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,877
All right, pussy willows.
Back to start positions!

370
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,221
Yeah, right.
No way I'm going through that again.

371
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,913
So that's where they
keep the medal, huh?

372
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,193
"New racers daily."

373
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,466
Sweet! I got next game.

374
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:06,668
Go away, kid!

375
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,303
We're going to play
all nine of today's racers!

376
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,451
Yeah!

377
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,218
Sorry.

378
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,445
Where's the wrecking guy?

379
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,211
Where's Ralph? He should be
wrecking the building.

380
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,500
Stick with the program.

381
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,790
Fix it, Felix!

382
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,993
Ralph! Quarter alert! Game on!

383
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,284
Do something, Felix!

384
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,861
Just act natural. I'll fix it.

385
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,846
Ralph! Ralph!

386
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,177
What the...

387
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,376
Ralph? Ralph!

388
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,386
Oh, my land! Where is he?

389
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,960
Mr. Litwak!

390
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,598
What's the trouble, sweetheart?

391
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,040
The game's busted.

392
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,522
I can fix it! }can fix it!

393
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,878
Oh, boy.

394
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,753
Looks like the game's
gone cuckoo, like my nana.

395
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,670
Sorry, sweetie.
Here's your quarter back.

396
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,189
But what about the game?

397
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,134
I'll have someone look at it tomorrow...

398
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,324
But if he can't fix it, it might be time

399
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,561
to put old Ralph and Felix
out to pasture.

400
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,026
Like my nana.

401
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,932
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're out of order.

402
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,869
Sweet mercy!
Without Ralph, we're doomed!

403
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,982
They're going to pull our plug!

404
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,705
Okay, everybody, calm down.

405
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,022
Ralph probably fell asleep

406
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:06,661
in the washroom of Tapper's again.

407
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,203
See? There he is now.

408
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,624
Why, it's Q*bert.
What brings you here, neighbor?

409
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,172
What's he saying, Felix?

410
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,907
Stand by. My Q*bert-ese is a little rusty.

411
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,928
Ralph's gone Turbo!

412
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:57,599
Shiny.

413
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,197
Attention! The arcade is now closed.

414
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,870
Did you get a load of Markowski?

415
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:04,936
Shut your chew holes.

416
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:06,928
Cy-Bug.

417
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,219
Taste it!

418
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,206
Slick Tiddlywinking, pint-size.

419
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,938
I'm Fix-It Felix, Jr., ma'am.

420
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,458
From the game Fix-it Felix, Jr.

421
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,942
Jiminey jaminey!

422
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:39,338
Look at that high definition. Your face!

423
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,079
It's amazing!

424
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,548
Flattery don't charge
these batteries, civilian.

425
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,221
Now, state your business.

426
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,070
I'm looking for my colleague,
Wreck-it Ralph?

427
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:51,983
Never heard of him.

428
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,254
Well, Q*bert saw him come in here.

429
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,770
Impossible. Nothing gets past me.

430
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,110
That came from the tower.

431
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,121
Nice eggs. Nice eggs!

432
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,999
Okay. That was easy.

433
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,871
Congratulations, soldier.

434
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,103
It is my honor to bestow upon you

435
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,340
the Medal of Heroes.

436
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,106
Wow!

437
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,612
No way!

438
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:55,803
Ten-hut!

439
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,452
Wow!

440
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,660
History will long revere
your courage and sacrifice.

441
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,079
Well, thank you!

442
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,877
You have etched in the rock of virtue

443
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,812
a legacy beyond compare.

444
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,395
Thanks, guys. At ease!

445
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,380
You are the universe's greatest hero.

446
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,964
The living embodiment of
all this corps represents.

447
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,472
Bravery. Integrity.
Grace under pressure.

448
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,486
And above all, dignity.

449
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,601
Escape pod activated.

450
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:36,284
Get off my face!

451
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,484
Incoming!

452
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,487
-Ralph!
-Cy-Bug!

453
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,273
Oh, no!

454
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,680
Sayonara, sucker!

455
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,330
"Sugar Rush"?

456
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,524
Oh, no!

457
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,340
This is that candy go-cart game

458
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,979
over by the Whac-A-Mole.

459
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,684
I got to get out of here.

460
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,686
Oh, no! My medal!

461
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,384
No, no, no, no, my medal!

462
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,874
No, no, my medal!

463
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,409
Hi, mister.

464
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,413
Hello.

465
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:57,638
Man, you scared me, kid.
I nearly soiled myself.

466
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,773
What's your name?

467
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,529
Ralph. Wreck-It Ralph.

468
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,393
You're not from here, are you?

469
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,709
No, well, yeah. I mean,
not from right in this area.

470
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,356
I'm just doing some work here.

471
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:09,544
What kind of work?

472
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,591
Some routine candy tree trimming.

473
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,124
You probably want to stand back.

474
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,058
In fact, this whole area

475
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,590
is technically closed
while we're trimming.

476
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,558
-Who's "we"?
-Candy tree department.

477
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,504
Where is everybody else?

478
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,066
It's just me today.

479
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,407
So you just meant like the royal "we"?

480
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,560
Yep. That's right.

481
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,482
Hey, are you a hobo?

482
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,501
No. I'm not a hobo, but! am busy.

483
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:35,025
Okay? So you go home.

484
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,990
What's that? Didn't hear you.

485
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,209
Your breath is so bad
it made my ears numb.

486
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:40,605
Listen, I tried to be nice.

487
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,059
I tried to be nice.

488
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,578
-You're mimicking me.
-You're mimicking me!

489
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:46,651
-Okay.
-Okay.

490
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,088
That is rude,
and this conversation is over.

491
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,008
And this conversation is over.

492
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,824
I wouldn't grab that branch if l were you.

493
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,844
I'm from the candy tree department,
so I know what...

494
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,452
It's a double stripe.

495
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,449
Double stripes break.

496
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,156
Why are your hands so freakishly big?

497
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,072
I don't know. Why are you
so freakishly annoying?

498
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,728
Why are you so freakishly...

499
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,219
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
A gold coin!

500
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,003
Don't even think about it. That is mine.

501
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,551
-Race you for it!
-Hey!

502
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,186
I don't have to race for it
because it's mine!

503
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,349
-Double stripe!
-Come back here!

504
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,588
-The winner!
-Give it back! Give it!

505
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,810
Double stripe.

506
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,665
Thank you!

507
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,964
Wait! Let me talk to you for one second.

508
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,273
Okay. Here's the thing.

509
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:41,978
I'm not from the candy tree department.

510
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,587
Lying to a child. Shame on you, Ralph.

511
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,808
But I wasn't lying about the medal.
That is my medal!

512
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,327
That's why I was climbing the tree.
It's mine!

513
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,026
It's precious to me.

514
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,802
That thing is my ticket to a better life.

515
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,158
Yeah, well, now it's my ticket.

516
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,197
-What the...
-See you, chump!

517
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,832
Come back! I'll find you!

518
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,758
I will find you!

519
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,980
Double stripe!

520
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:08,829
Nowhere to hide!

521
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,209
Yeah, he banged around in here
like some kind of hot shot,

522
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,960
then he went barreling down
into that sweet little game

523
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,836
like a crazy person.

524
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,574
"Sugar Rush."

525
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,639
Cy-Bugs would chew up that game

526
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:26,174
faster than a chicken hawk
in a coop of crippled roosters.

527
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:28,591
-What was that, now?
-What are you, thick?

528
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,824
There was a Cy-Bug on that shuttle!

529
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,966
Do you even know what a Cy-Bug is?

530
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,990
Il can't say that 1 do, ma'am.

531
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,014
Cy-Bugs are like a virus.

532
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,653
They don't know they're in a game.

533
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,541
All they know is eat, kill, multiply.

534
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,528
Without a beacon to stop them,

535
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,510
they'll consume Sugar Rush.

536
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:47,928
But do you think they'll stop there?

537
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,527
-Yes!
-Wrong!

538
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,321
Viruses do not stop!

539
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,034
Once those Cy-Bugs
finish off Sugar Rush,

540
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,157
they'll invade every other game
until this arcade

541
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:02,837
is nothing but a smoking husk
of forgotten dreams.

542
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,005
Kohut! My cruiser.

543
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,837
Jeepers. Is she always this intense?

544
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,787
It's not her fault.

545
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,789
She's programmed with
the most tragic back-story ever.

546
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,299
The one day she didn't do
a perimeter check...

547
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,651
Her wedding day.

548
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,263
Wait, ma'am! I'm going with you.

549
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,365
Like fun you are, short stack.

550
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,897
If you die outside your game,
you don't regenerate.

551
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,667
Well, neither do you, ma'am.

552
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,639
And it is my job to fix
what Ralph wrecks.

553
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,626
And I cannot ask you

554
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,701
to risk your life cleaning up his mess.

555
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,620
No flex on this one, ma'am.
lam coming along with you.

556
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,528
Citizens of Sugar Rush...

557
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:41,592
Just in time.

558
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,823
all hail our rightful ruler, King Candy.

559
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,386
Hello, my royal subjects!

560
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,942
Have some candy!

561
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,597
Thank you for that
stirring introduction, Sour Bill.

562
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,635
And thank you to today's avatars.

563
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,671
It was a wonderful day of racing. It was.

564
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,604
But now the arcade is closed,

565
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,873
so it's time to wipe the slate clean

566
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,418
and race to decide our new roster.

567
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,043
The first nine racers
across that finish line

568
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:21,486
will represent Sugar Rush
as tomorrow's avatars!

569
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,299
Race! Race! Race!

570
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,705
Okay, calm down.

571
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,451
Listen! This event is pay-to-play.
We all know this.

572
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,278
The fee to compete is one gold coin

573
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,467
from your previous winnings,

574
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,216
if you've ever won, which I have.

575
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,308
Let me go first!

576
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,386
King Candy!

577
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:55,783
Taffyta Muttonfudge!

578
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:56,961
Stay sweet!

579
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,507
Adorabeezile Winterpop.

580
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,170
Gloyd Orangeboar!

581
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,643
Little stealer! Wait till l catch that brat.

582
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,054

583
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:15,978
Rancis Fluggerbutter.

584
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,012
Swizzle Malarkey.

585
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,528
Candlehead,

586
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,294
Sour Bill, who's that last one?

587
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,016
Vanellope von Schweetz!

588
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,279
Yippee! I'm in the race!

589
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:40,571
Vanellope?

590
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,373
The Glitch!

591
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,103
Now, now!

592
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,532
Everything is all right! Security!

593
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,165
Come here, kid!

594
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,504
We're not going to hurt you,
you little freak!

595
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,118
Get back here!

596
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,406
Slow down! Slow down a little bit.

597
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,065
You! Give me back my medal right now!

598
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,892
-Ah, boy!
-Go!

599
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,501
What is that?

600
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,359
Come on! Go! Roll!

601
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,029
Careful! What are you doing?

602
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,112
Come back here!

603
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:41,848
Il can't move!

604
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,427
Now we got him!

605
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:46,052
Oh, good, the cops. She went that way!

606
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:47,781
-Hold still!
-Take that!

607
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:48,973
What are you doing?

608
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,467
Okay, folks.

609
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,292
Calm down! Everything's all right.

610
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,582
The monster's been caught!

611
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,667
We'll repair all the damage.

612
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,756
Don't worry. We will have our race
before the arcade opens.

613
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,150
And I'm in it. Yes!

614
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,444
There's no way that
lam racing with a glitch.

615
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,517
Rancis, Candlehead, come on.

616
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:18,982
Sour Bill, that glitch
cannot be allowed to race!

617
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,571
And bring that thing to my castle.

618
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:23,477
Guys! She took...

619
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:32,077
Or-e-oh
Oreo!

620
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,438
Or-e-oh

621
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,544
Sour Bill, de-taffify this monster

622
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,527
So we Can see
what we're up against here.

623
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:51,859
Mm-kay.

624
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,619
Milk my duds! It's Wreck-It Ralph?

625
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:59,654
Yeah. Who are you,
the guy that makes the donuts?

626
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:02,755
Please. No. I'm King Candy!

627
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,445
Il see you're a fan of pink.

628
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,687
Salmon. Salmon, that's obviously...

629
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:09,493
What are you doing here?

630
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:13,488
Look, Your Candiness,
this is just a big misunderstanding.

631
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,495
Just get me out of this cupcake,

632
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,557
I'll get my medal,
and I'll be out of your way.

633
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:21,256
Your medal?
Bad guys don't win medals.

634
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,156
Well, this one did.

635
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,078
l earned it over in Hero's Duty.

636
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,339
You game-jumped?

637
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,851
Ralph, you're not going Turbo, are you?

638
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,457
What? No, no.

639
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,829
Because if you think you can
come in here to my kingdom

640
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,484
and take over my game,
you've got another thing coming!

641
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,408
Easy, Your Puffiness.

642
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,113
It's not my fault one of your children

643
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,998
of the candy corn stole my medal.

644
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,290
"Children of the candy corn"? Who'd...

645
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,156
The Glitch!

646
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,511
The coin she used to
buy her way into the race.

647
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:49,763
That was your medal?

648
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,961
She did what? I need that back!

649
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,799
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you.
It's gone, you know.

650
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,343
It's nothing but code now.

651
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,469
It will stay that way
until someone wins the cup

652
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,045
at the end of the race.

653
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,307
Maybe I'll have to have a little talk

654
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:05,669
with the winner then.

655
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,520
Is that a threat I smell?

656
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,000
Beyond the halitosis
you so obviously suffer from.

657
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,590
Listen, Nilly-Wafer,
I'm not leaving without my medal!

658
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,410
Yes, you are.

659
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,249
Wynnchel, Duncan,
get him out of that cupcake

660
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,265
and on the first train back home.

661
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,580
If lever see you here again,
Wreck-It Ralph,

662
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,370
I'll lock you in my fungeon.

663
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:28,669
Fungeon?

664
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,317
Fun dungeon, you know?
It's a play on words.

665
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,183
It's the...

666
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:37,345
Never mind! I've got a glitch
to deal with, thanks to you.

667
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,292
Goodbye, Wreck-it Ralph!
It hasn't been a pleasure.

668
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,267
This thing is hard as a rock.

669
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,385
Il can see that.

670
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,850
-Get the tools.
-What tools?

671
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,411
Quiet, you!

672
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,501
What? No!

673
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,249
-Take it easy, big boy!
-Stay away from me!

674
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,494
He's getting away!

675
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,817
Quick! Call out the Devil Dogs.

676
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,109
Chocolate. I hate chocolate!

677
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,920
I got to get my medal back.

678
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,513
The pot goes to the winning racer!

679
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,705
Hey, kids!
Can I talk to you for a second?

680
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,177
Hello, fellow racers!

681
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,183
It's that little crumb snatcher.

682
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,993
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis,
you're looking well.

683
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,655
Came by to check out
the competition, huh?

684
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,615
Well, here it is, the Lickety-Split!

685
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,924
Sheesh. Looks like she built it herself.

686
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,353
I built it myself.

687
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,885
Fastest pedal-power
west of the Whac-A-Mole.

688
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:07,291
Check her out.

689
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,640
Vanellope, it's so... You.

690
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:19,862
But you have to
back out of the race. Yeah.

691
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,748
No, I don't,

692
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,446
because I paid my fee
and I'm on the board...

693
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,793
So, yeah, I'm definitely racing.

694
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,721
Yeah, well, King Candy says
glitches can't race.

695
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,211
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta.
I've just got pixslexia, okay?

696
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,435
The rules are there
for a reason, Vanellope.

697
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,290
To protect us. Say I'm you.

698
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,140
I'm in my weird little car and I'm driving

699
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,819
and I actually feel kind of cool for once.

700
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,005
And then, all of a sudden, oh, no.

701
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,517
I'm glitching!

702
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,113
-Hey!
-See?

703
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,155
You're an accident
just waiting to happen.

704
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,123
Oh, no! I glitched, too!

705
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,734
Uncool.

706
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,392
Stop it! Stop! You're breaking it!

707
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,136
Please!

708
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,401
[ just want to race like you guys.

709
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,840
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch.

710
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,144
And that's all you'll ever be!

711
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,864
Hey! Leave her alone!

712
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,520
Let's get out of here!

713
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,230
Scram, you rotten little cavities!

714
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,888
Before I throw you in the mud!

715
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,089
What are you looking at?

716
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,559
You're welcome, you rotten little thief.

717
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,865
I'm not a thief!
[ just borrowed your stupid coin.

718
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,702
Il was going to give it back to you
as soon as I won the race.

719
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,120
It's not a coin. It is a medal.

720
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,256
Coin, medal, whatever.

721
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,912
Just go back to your own dumb game
and win another one.

722
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,395
I can't. I didn't win it in my game.

723
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,238
I won it in Hero's Duty.

724
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,437
Hero's Doodie?

725
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,440
It's not that kind of duty.

726
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,586
Il bet you really got to watch
where you step

727
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,881
in a game called Hero's Doodie!

728
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,551
What did you win the medal for, wiping?

729
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,072
l hope you washed your hands
after you handled that medal.

730
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:18,812
-Listen!
-One more, one more.

731
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,180
Why did the hero flush the toilet?

732
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,373
-Say "why."
-Why?

733
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,549
Because it was his doodie!

734
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,500
How dare you insult Hero's Duty?

735
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:29,796
You little guttersnipe!

736
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,331
l earned that medal

737
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,692
and you better get it back
for me toot-sweet, sister!

738
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,695
Well, unless you've got a go-cart

739
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,533
hidden in the fat folds of your neck,

740
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,089
I can't help you!

741
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,150
What a moron.

742
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,009
Hey, genius! It's a jawbreaker.

743
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,624
You're never going to break...

744
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:00,087
Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper baby?

745
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:01,665
Leave me alone.

746
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,680
Look, you want that medal,
right? And I want to race.

747
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,779
So here's what I'm thinking.

748
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,996
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

749
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,156
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

750
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,909
You want me to help you?

751
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,377
All you got to do is
break something for me.

752
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,167
Come on. What do you say, friend?

753
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,064
We are not friends.

754
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:28,003
Come on, pal. You son of a gun.

755
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,633
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

756
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,233
Come on, chumbo.

757
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,674
Ralph, my man. My main man.

758
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,507
Hey!

759
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,705
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?

760
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,366
You better win.

761
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,975
Well, I'll say this much,

762
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:51,407
they don't call your friend
"Wreck-It" for nothing.

763
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,264
There's the shuttle.

764
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,022
Is he in there?

765
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,934
Nope. Lucky for him.

766
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,556
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

767
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,360
No Cy-Bug, either.

768
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,942
Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs.

769
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:13,797
It came this way,

770
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,508
but the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

771
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,073
. .
are Jamming my sensor.

772
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,558
Can't get a read on it.

773
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,910
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

774
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,274
Why did he go AWOL?

775
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,843
I wish I knew, ma'am.

776
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,565
He was acting all squirrelly last night...

777
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,271
Going on about cake and medals...

778
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,287
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

779
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,830
"Go Turbo"?

780
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,542
That's right,
you guys just got plugged in.

781
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:40,018
Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

782
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,031
Turbo Time was by far
the most popular game.

783
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,584
-And Turbo...
-Turbo-tastic!

784
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,297
-He loved the attention.
-Turbo-tastic!

785
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,296
So, when RoadBlasters got plugged in

786
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,042
and stole Turbo's thunder...

787
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,607
New game. All right!

788
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,566
Boy, was he jealous.

789
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,889
So jealous that
he abandoned his game

790
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,765
and tried to take over the new one.

791
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,964
These are the greatest graphics
I've ever seen!

792
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:06,346
Turbo-tastic!

793
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,598
Hey. Is that... That looks like Turbo.

794
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,210
Hey. Is that... That looks like Turbo.

795
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,172
What's Turbo doing in this game?
Aw, come on!

796
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:14,861
Mr. Litwak!

797
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,280
Turbo ended up
putting both games and himself

798
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,747
out of order, for good.

799
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,014
Yes, the selfish man
is like a mangy dog

800
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,124
chasing a cautionary tale.

801
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:29,986
l know, right?

802
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:30,007
l know, right?

803
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,334
That's why I have to get Ralph home

804
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,530
or the same thing's
gonna happen to my game.

805
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:40,763
What is this?

806
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:44,086
-"Nesquik Sand"?
-Quicksand?

807
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,012
I'll hop out
and grab you one of those vines.

808
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,799
Il can't hop. I'm hop-less.
This is hopeless!

809
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:57,337
We're going to drown here.

810
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:58,871
Stop thrashing. Stop moving.

811
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,083
You're making us sink faster.

812
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,201
We're going to die!

813
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:02,709
Get ahold of yourself!

814
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,458
The vines. They're Laffy Taffy.

815
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,014
They're attracted to
whatever makes them laugh.

816
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,660
Here, hit me again.

817
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:19,872
That's not funny enough. Harder!

818
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:21,741
Look, you're a nice guy. I can't...

819
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:24,356
No, ma'am!
The arcade is depending on us.

820
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,194
Now do your duty. That's an ord...

821
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:31,851
It's working! Hit me again.

822
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:33,837
Your eye.

823
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,735
I can fix it. Now...

824
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,699
San Fran-tastic! Again!

825
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:43,216
You mean business!

826
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:46,162
Yikes on bikes!

827
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,782
Wow! We're... killing... them!

828
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,420
Comedy gold!

829
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,177
All right, enough with the goo-goo eyes.

830
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,965
We've got work to do. Let's go.

831
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,359
We lost the Cy-Bug.

832
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:29,315
Come on. We'll get
a better view from the air.

833
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,040
You think you can fix that shuttle?

834
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:33,176
Can do.

835
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,241
All right, do your thing, knuckles.
Bust it open!

836
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,188
What's this?
You're a full-on criminal, aren't you?

837
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,221
Hey, we shook on it.

838
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,442
Thank you, Jeeves.

839
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,806
What is this place?
Where are the carts?

840
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,272
You gotta make one.

841
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,509
What? No, no.

842
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,428
Look, kid, bad idea. Trust me.

843
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,570
I don't make things. I break things.

844
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,709
Well, it looks like
you're going to be stepping outside

845
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,324
your comfort zone, then, Gladys.

846
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:27,093
This is a good one!

847
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,985
Welcome to the bakery!
Let's bake a kart!

848
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:32,899
What is this, another game?

849
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,250
Yeah, well, it's a mini-game.

850
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,339
You have one minute to win it.

851
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:36,360
You have one minute to win it.

852
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,584
-What?
-Come on, Ralph!

853
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,285
Go! Mixing.

854
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,043
Put the ingredients in the bow!

855
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,605
and throw away the trash.

856
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,970
Hairbrush. No!

857
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:46,072
Underpants. No, no!

858
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,660
You're getting all the wrong stuff, kid.

859
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,415
I'm trying!

860
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,617
Let me up there. I'll do it. No. Yes.

861
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,557
Gross. Milk. Yes, yes, yes.

862
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,011
Batter up!

863
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,397
Come on! No sleeping on the job!

864
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,374
Baking! Pump up the heat

865
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,409
and hold the perfect temperature.

866
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,131
Ralph, a little help here?

867
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,326
I'm on it.

868
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,056
Yeah, no problem.
Give me this thing here.

869
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,213
Okay, good. Little more.

870
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:24,312
Yeah, that's it! Hold it, hold it, hold it.

871
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,676
Yes! Come on. Get up, Ralph!
Fifteen seconds!

872
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,589
-Decorating!
-Wheels first.

873
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:33,046
-How many?
-Four, doy!

874
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,230
Got it.

875
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,673
Now frosting. A buttload of frosting!

876
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:38,918
No problem.

877
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,008
Time's up! Congratulations.

878
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,107
You did it, and here's your cart!

879
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:11,161
Look, kid... I tried to warn you.

880
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,389
l can't make things. I just break...

881
00:51:14,872 --> 00:51:16,162
I love it.

882
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:17,790
You do?

883
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,455
I love it.

884
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,540
I love it! I love it! I love it!

885
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:23,408
Look, it's got a real engine!

886
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,357
And look at these wheels.

887
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:29,377
I love it! I finally have a real cart!

888
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,930
Come on. A work of art
like this must be signed.

889
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:37,921
Cream puffs.

890
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,788
This is Beard Papa.

891
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,637
The Glitch is in the bakery!
Get me King Candy!

892
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,924
What? You have teeth?

893
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,334
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile before.

894
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:03,127
I'm not smiling. I was... I'm gassy, okay?

895
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:08,286
Hold it right there, Glitch!

896
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,586
And Wreck-lt Ralph?

897
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,665
Start the cart! Start the cart!

898
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,069
What are you waiting for?
Come on. Let's go!

899
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:21,348
I don't know how to drive a real cart.

900
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,179
You don't what?

901
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:24,684
Are you hurt, Sire?

902
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,755
No, he just glazed me. Get them!

903
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:29,841
Gangway!

904
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,761
Stop, in the name of the king!
That's me!

905
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,012
Get off the road!

906
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:50,149
Head for Diet Cola Mountain!

907
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,901
-Drive into the wall!
-What?

908
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,609
Right there, between
the two sugar-free lollipops!

909
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:00,946
-Are you crazy?
-Just do it!

910
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:16,217
Where did they go?
They should have just turned.

911
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:20,952
Find that glitch! Destroy that cart!

912
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,522
She can't be allowed to race!

913
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:32,022
So let me get this straight.
You don't know how to drive.

914
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,140
Well, no, not technically.

915
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,975
-I just thought that...
-What did you think?

916
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,976
"Tl just magically win the race

917
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:40,743
"just because I really want to!"

918
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,078
Look, wise guy. I know I'm a racer.

919
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,187
I can feel it in my code.

920
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,678
That's it! I'm never
getting my medal back.

921
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:53,234
What is the big whoop about
that crummy medal anyway?

922
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:54,681
The big whoop?

923
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,978
Well, this may come as
a shock to you, but in my game,

924
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,387
I'm the bad guy
and I live in the garbage.

925
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,569
-Cool.
-No. Not cool.

926
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,375
Unhygienic and lonely and boring.

927
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:08,702
And that crummy medal
was going to change all that.

928
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:10,956
I go home with that baby
around my neck

929
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:13,045
and I'll get a penthouse. Pies.

930
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,600
Ice sculptures. Fireworks!

931
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,848
It's grown-up stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

932
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,584
No, I get it!

933
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:23,852
That's exactly
what racing would do for me!

934
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:25,458
-Well, guess what?
-What?

935
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,359
News flash! Neither one of us
is getting what we want!

936
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:33,162
What was that?

937
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,819
Yeah! Check it out. Look!

938
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:50,871
Yeah! Check it out. Look!

939
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:01,223
You got to watch out for the splash.

940
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,055
That stuff is broiling hot.

941
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,710
Yeah, I got that. Thank you.

942
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,156
What is this dump?

943
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,663
I think it's some sort of
unfinished bonus level.

944
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:12,935
Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

945
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:16,332
l found that secret opening,
and now I live here.

946
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:18,344
See? Look, look, look.

947
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,293
Welcome to my home!

948
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,882
I sleep in these candy wrappers.

949
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,864
l bundle myself up like
a little homeless lady.

950
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:29,582
By yourself?

951
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,485
With all this garbage around you?

952
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,511
Well, yeah.

953
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,713
I mean, everyone here
says I'm just a mistake

954
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,851
and that I wasn't
even supposed to exist.

955
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:41,594
What do you expect?

956
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,042
Listen, kid...

957
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,468
I know it's none of my business

958
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:49,224
but why do you even
stick around this game?

959
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,543
You really don't know anything, do you?

960
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,884
Glitches can't leave their games.

961
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,556
It's one of the joys of being me.

962
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,120
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!

963
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,210
I know it's a dump, but it's all I got.

964
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:13,806
If you're going to be a racer,

965
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,274
you're going to have
to learn how to drive.

966
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,279
And you can't do that without a track.

967
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:25,744
All right, now.

968
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:27,446
Let's hustle up.
We've got some driving to do.

969
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,974
I'm going to learn to drive!
I'm going to learn to drive!

970
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,527
Wait. Do you know how to drive?

971
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,619
Yeah! I mean, I haven't done it, but...

972
00:56:34,024 --> 00:56:35,394
Look, I flew a spaceship today, okay?

973
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,562
You crashed it.

974
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,107
Just get in. How hard can it be? Okay...

975
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,103
Start it up.

976
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,692
There we go. So there are
some buttons on the floor.

977
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:48,824
-Pedals.
-Pedals. Right.

978
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,249
Now, that's the go pedal.

979
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:57,501
That I believe is the stopper.

980
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,628
And this... Wait.

981
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:03,255
What is this? That doesn't do anything.

982
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:05,024
What does this joystick do?

983
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,625
Okay, good. Let's try that again.

984
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,189
Now shift it.

985
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,199
That's good. Keep going! Shift it again!

986
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:52,393
I told you, racing's in my code!

987
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,142
I got that medal in the bag!

988
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,314
Hey, Ralphie, watch this!

989
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,930
Look out!

990
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,402
Hot cola!

991
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:32,909
So how did I do?

992
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,374
Well, you almost blew up
the whole mountain.

993
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,181
Right, right. That's a good note.

994
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,363
You got to get that
glitch under control, kid.

995
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:42,988
Okay, I will, I will.

996
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,810
And then you think I got a chance?

997
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:49,825
Tiny.

998
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,587
Yes, I'm going to win!

999
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,598
I'm going to win! I'm going to win!

1000
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:55,574
-Top shelf.
-Top shelf.

1001
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:10,075
Did you find her?
Tell me you found her.

1002
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:13,219
You didn't?

1003
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,682
Go. Leave me.

1004
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:40,576
Up, up, down, down...

1005
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:44,462
Start!

1006
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:51,091
The code. It's the sweet
lifeblood of the game.

1007
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:01,741
Where are you? Let's see...
Stadium, no. Jumbotron.

1008
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,823
There it is. The winner's cup.

1009
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:11,312
One of these things is
not like the others... It's you!

1010
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:14,268
We're going to give you
a nice new home.

1011
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,546
Success!

1012
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,230
Sour Bill, I'm going out.

1013
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,648
You're in charge of the castle
until l get back.

1014
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:46,799
Your face is still red.

1015
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,713
You might want to
hit it again with your hammer.

1016
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,355
That's not blunt force trauma, ma'am.

1017
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:54,222
That's just the honey glow
in my cheeks.

1018
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:56,235
Okay.

1019
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,430
Ma'am, I just got to tell you...

1020
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,209
You are one dynamite gal.

1021
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:08,071
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.

1022
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,902
One dynamite gal.

1023
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:12,734
Dynamite gal.

1024
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,243
Dynamite gal.

1025
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:15,683
Dynamite...

1026
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,464
Get out.

1027
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,352
All l said is you're a dynamite gal.

1028
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:26,008
Il said get out!

1029
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,477
Jiminey jaminey.

1030
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,388
Yes?

1031
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:50,093
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr., sir,
from the game Fix-It Felix Jr.

1032
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,181
Have you seen my friend Ralph?

1033
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:53,779
Wreck-It Ralph?

1034
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,487
Yes. Yes, that's him!

1035
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,506
We should have locked him up
when we had the chance.

1036
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,042
Locked him up?

1037
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,830
I'm not making
the same mistake with you.

1038
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,279
Hurry, hurry! Let's go. Time's a-wastin’.

1039
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,656
Come on, Ralph!

1040
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:12,634
This is it. This is really happening.

1041
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,073
l almost don't believe it.

1042
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,881
I mean, l have dreamt about it
for so long, and now...

1043
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,250
And now... Now I think
I'm going to puke, actually.

1044
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:20,803
I mean, I think I might puke.

1045
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,444
-You know, like a "vurp."
-A what?

1046
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:24,266
Vomit and a burp together,

1047
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:26,598
and you can taste it,
and it's just like rising up.

1048
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,150
This is so exciting!

1049
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:30,015
Yes, it is. It's exciting.

1050
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,123
Am I ready to be a real racer?

1051
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,366
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

1052
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,714
Who doesn't love a brat
with dirty hair? Come on.

1053
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,208
Those people are going
to love you. You know why?

1054
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:44,072
-Because you're a winner.
-I'm a winner.

1055
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,894
-And you're adorable!
-I'm adorable!

1056
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,770
And everyone loves
an adorable winner!

1057
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,346
Yeah!

1058
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:52,504
Okay, come on. Listen to me.

1059
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,546
If you get nervous,
just keep telling yourself,

1060
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,669
"I must win Ralph's medal
or his life will be ruined."

1061
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,374
-And have fun. Got it?
-Got it.

1062
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,341
Oh, wait!

1063
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:07,973
Hold on!

1064
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:09,067
Where are you going?

1065
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,959
I forgot something! I'll be right back!

1066
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,640
Kids.

1067
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,140
Ralph! There you are. Hello!

1068
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,430
-You!
-l come alone, unarmed.

1069
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,069
I've had enough of you, pillow pants!

1070
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,107
Please. Calm down! Please, look. Don't!

1071
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,000
I'm going to beat the filling out of you!

1072
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:33,044
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1073
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,423
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's... Well played.

1074
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,040
What do you want, Candy?

1075
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:40,639
Listen, I just want to talk to you.

1076
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:43,544
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

1077
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,500
How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1078
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,798
My medal. How did you...

1079
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:53,383
It doesn't matter.
It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

1080
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,540
All lask is that you hear me out.

1081
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,163
About what?

1082
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,031
Ralph, do you know
what the hardest part

1083
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,847
about being a king is?

1084
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,369
Doing what's right, no matter what.

1085
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:09,615
Get to the point.

1086
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:12,134
Point being, I need your help.

1087
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:16,556
Sad as itis, Vanellope
cannot be allowed to race.

1088
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,024
Why are you people so against her?

1089
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:22,166
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

1090
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,175
If Vanellope wins that race

1091
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,265
she'll be added to the race roster.

1092
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,714
Then gamers can choose her
as their avatar.

1093
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,785
And when they see her glitching

1094
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:36,444
and twitching and just being herself,

1095
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,460
they'll think our game is broken.

1096
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,580
We'll be put out of order for good.

1097
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,423
All my subjects will be homeless.

1098
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:51,261
But there's one who cannot
escape because she's a glitch.

1099
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,138
Help! Somebody, help! Help!

1100
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,731
And when the game's plug is pulled...

1101
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,267
No!

1102
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,613
.. she'll die with it.

1103
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,799
You don't know that will happen.

1104
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:06,185
The gamers could love her.

1105
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,332
And if they don't?

1106
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:17,625
I know it's tough,

1107
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,761
but heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

1108
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:26,311
She can't race, Ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

1109
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,069
So can I! count on you to
talk a little sense into her?

1110
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:34,232
Very good.

1111
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:37,588
I'll give you two some time alone.

1112
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,327
I'm back!

1113
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,725
Did you miss me?

1114
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:12,167
Yeah... Can we talk for a second?

1115
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:12,218
Yeah... Can we talk for a second?

1116
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,065
Wait. First, kneel down.

1117
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,337
-What? No, we really...
-Will you just do it?

1118
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:18,337
Okay.

1119
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,339
-Now, close your eyes.
-Vanellope...

1120
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:23,919
Shush! Close them!

1121
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:29,084
Okay. Open them up.

1122
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:34,725
"To Stinkbrain." Gee, thanks.

1123
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,091
Turn it over.

1124
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:39,925
I made it for you.

1125
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:42,087
Just in case we don't win.

1126
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,465
Not that I think
there's even a remote chance

1127
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:45,703
we're not going to win.

1128
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:48,837
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1129
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:48,858
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1130
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:53,102
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.

1131
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,466
Ralph, come on. Move your molasses.

1132
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:00,484
-I've been thinking.
-That's dangerous.

1133
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:03,651
Who cares about
this stupid race anyway? Right?

1134
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,291
That's not very funny, Ralph.

1135
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:08,473
No, I'm serious, and it was really fun

1136
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:09,785
to build the car and everything...

1137
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:12,719
But maybe you shouldn't do it.

1138
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,439
Hello? Is Ralph in there?

1139
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:17,172
I'd like to speak to him, please.

1140
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,177
Look, what I'm saying is
you can't be a racer.

1141
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:20,586
What?

1142
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:23,292
Why would you...

1143
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,087
Wait a minute.

1144
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:27,779
No!

1145
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:28,911
Where did you get this?

1146
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,896
Look, I'm going to be
straight with you, kid.

1147
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:33,572
I've been talking to King Candy.

1148
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,190
-King Candy?
-Yeah.

1149
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:36,565
You sold me out?

1150
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,410
No, I didn't... Listen.
You don't understand.

1151
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:40,725
No, l understand plenty. Traitor!

1152
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,241
I'm not a traitor. Listen.

1153
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:43,635
You're a rat!

1154
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,923
And I don't need you, and
Il can win the race on my own.

1155
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:48,953
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid!

1156
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:50,792
Put me down! Let me go!

1157
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,127
No, you listen to me.

1158
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:53,218
Do you know what's going to happen

1159
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:54,319
when the players see you glitching?

1160
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:55,616
They'll think the game's broken.

1161
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:57,102
I don't care! You're a liar!

1162
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,550
You better care, because
if your game goes out of order,

1163
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:00,826
you go down with the ship, little sister!

1164
01:08:01,044 --> 01:08:01,944
I'm not listening to you!

1165
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,578
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!

1166
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,208
No, you're not!

1167
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,647
Take me down from here, Ralph,
right now!

1168
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,097
No. I'm doing this for your own good!

1169
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:16,708
Wait, wait, wait.

1170
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:18,557
No. No.

1171
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:20,549
No, no, no, no, no!

1172
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:21,819
Please, Ralph!

1173
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:22,915
No!

1174
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:26,947
Stop it! Stop it! No!

1175
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:45,660
You really are a bad guy.

1176
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,254
Hello? Anybody home?

1177
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:27,157
Felix? Mary?

1178
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:30,040
Well, you actually went and did it.

1179
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,880
Gene. Where is everybody?

1180
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:34,769
They're gone.

1181
01:09:35,071 --> 01:09:38,111
After Felix went to find you
and then didn't come back...

1182
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,671
Everyone panicked
and abandoned ship.

1183
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:42,839
But I'm here now.

1184
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,859
It's too late, Ralph.

1185
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,234
Litwak's pulling our plug in the morning.

1186
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:02,472
But never let it be said
that I'm not a man of my word.

1187
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:05,633
The place is yours, Ralph. Enjoy.

1188
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:10,905
Gene, wait! Wait!

1189
01:10:12,108 --> 01:10:14,628
Listen, this is not what I wanted!

1190
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:16,888
Well, what did you want, Ralph?

1191
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:19,317
I don't know. I just...

1192
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:25,721
l was just tired of
living alone in the garbage.

1193
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:25,772
l was just tired of
living alone in the garbage.

1194
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:29,236
Well, now you can live alone
in the penthouse.

1195
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:37,856
Hey, cough drop.

1196
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:40,155
Explain something to me.

1197
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,400
If Vanellope was never meant to exist,

1198
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,205
then why is her picture on
the side of the game console?

1199
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,108
What's going on

1200
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:52,574
in this candy-coated heart of darkness?

1201
01:11:52,909 --> 01:11:53,759
Nothing.

1202
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:54,880
-Talk!
-No.

1203
01:11:55,178 --> 01:11:56,468
-I'll lick you.
-You wouldn't.

1204
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:58,329
Oh, yeah?

1205
01:11:58,848 --> 01:11:59,958
That's like sandpaper!

1206
01:12:01,284 --> 01:12:02,654
Wonder how many licks it will take

1207
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:04,092
to get to your center.

1208
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:05,694
I'll take it to my grave!

1209
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:07,022
Fair enough.

1210
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,620
They call you Sour Bill for a reason.

1211
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:16,803
-Had enough yet?
-Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk!

1212
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,726
Vanellope was a racer

1213
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:21,144
until King Candy
tried to delete her code!

1214
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:23,366
Tried to delete her code?

1215
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:26,318
So that's why she's a glitch!
Why is he doing this to her?

1216
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,210
I don't know!

1217
01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:29,181
Suit yourself.

1218
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,125
No, no, no! I swear I don't know!

1219
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,937
He literally locked up our memories

1220
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,403
and I cannot remember!

1221
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:36,771
Nobody can!

1222
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,586
But I do know this.

1223
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:40,515
He'll do anything
to keep her from racing.

1224
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,003
Because if she crosses the finish line,

1225
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:45,886
the game will reset and
she won't be a glitch anymore!

1226
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:47,446
Where is she now?

1227
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,809
In the fungeon with Fix-It Felix.

1228
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:50,115
Felix?

1229
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,883
I'm sorry! That's all I know, I swear!

1230
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:55,901
Now, please, don't put me back
in your filthy mouth again!

1231
01:12:58,908 --> 01:12:59,758
Stick around.

1232
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:02,726
Yes, okay, I will. I will. Thank you!

1233
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:08,626
Come on. I know you're out there.

1234
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,429
Saccharine-saturated nightmare!

1235
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:18,727
But... Where?

1236
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:38,824
Doomsday and Armageddon
just had a baby and it is ugly!

1237
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:43,201
Hello? Hello?

1238
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:47,413
Somebody! Anybody! Please let me out!

1239
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:50,858
What's he say?

1240
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:53,244
I'm gonna wreck it!

1241
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,916
Why do I fix everything I touch?

1242
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,960
-Felix!
-Ralph!

1243
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,215
I'm so glad to see you!

1244
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:11,737
Wait. No, I'm not. What do
you have to say for yourself!

1245
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:14,961
Wait! I don't want to hear it.
I'm not talking to you!

1246
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:16,938
Okay, don't talk. That's fine.

1247
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,990
But you have to fix
this go-cart for me pronto.

1248
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:22,105
I don't have to do boo!
Forgive my potty mouth.

1249
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:25,185
I'm just so, so cross with you!

1250
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:27,565
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

1251
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:30,894
l ran higgledy-piggledy
all over creation looking for you.

1252
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,177
l almost drowned in chocolate milk-mix!

1253
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:36,909
And then... l met the most dynamite gal.

1254
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:40,667
She gives me the honey glow
something awful.

1255
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:44,154
But she rebuffed my affections.

1256
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,450
And then I got thrown in jail!

1257
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,146
Felix, pull yourself together.

1258
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:51,814
No! You don't know
what it's like to be rejected

1259
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:53,788
and treated like a criminal!

1260
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:56,440
Yes, I do. That's every day of my life.

1261
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:58,710
It is?

1262
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:02,371
Which is why I ran off
and tried to be a good guy, but I'm not!

1263
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:05,402
I'm just a bad guy, and I need your help.

1264
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:07,875
There's a little girl
whose only hope is this cart.

1265
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,007
Please, Felix, fix it.

1266
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,419
And I promise I will never try
to be good again.

1267
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:39,453
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.

1268
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:43,009
-And?
-And a real numskull.

1269
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:45,946
-And?
-A selfish diaper baby.

1270
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:47,359
And?

1271
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,173
And...

1272
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:51,455
A stinkbrain?

1273
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,344
The stinkiest brain ever.

1274
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,339
My sweet subjects,

1275
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:22,048
! can without a pinch
of hesitation assure you

1276
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:25,195
that l have never been
so happy in all my life

1277
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:27,655
to say the following words,

1278
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,977
let the Random Roster Race
commence!

1279
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,174
Okay, remember, you don't have to win.

1280
01:16:51,574 --> 01:16:53,824
Just cross that finish line,
and you'll be a real racer.

1281
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,060
I'm already a real racer.

1282
01:16:58,914 --> 01:16:59,994
And I'm going to win.

1283
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,857
Have some candy.

1284
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:02,247
Behind you!

1285
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:04,562
In front of you!

1286
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:14,856
-It's The Glitch!
-The Glitch?

1287
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:15,467
-It's The Glitch!
-The Glitch?

1288
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:16,998
Light them up, Candlehead.

1289
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:23,237
What's this? Cherry bombs!

1290
01:18:30,973 --> 01:18:33,403
I told you. You're just
an accident waiting to happen.

1291
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,593
My candle!

1292
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:56,175
All right. Gotta keep it under control.

1293
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,875
No more glitching.

1294
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,106
Okay, kid. Let's finish this thing

1295
01:19:01,337 --> 01:19:02,937
without any more surprises.

1296
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:05,897
Hope you're happy, junkpile.

1297
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:08,835
This game is going down,
and it's all your fault.

1298
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:10,668
My lady, you came back.

1299
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,160
Can it, Fix-It!

1300
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,784
That Cy-Bug you brought
with you multiplied.

1301
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:17,831
No. It died in the taffy swamp.
Believe me, I...

1302
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:22,593
Bullroar.

1303
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,918
Listen up, people. Head to
Game Central Station now!

1304
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:35,179
Move it! Let's go! Let's go!

1305
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:37,122
Go! Go! Go!

1306
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,464
No!

1307
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,633
Get off of my track!

1308
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:31,042
Hey!

1309
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:32,527
What, are you crazy!

1310
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:37,942
I forbid you to cross that finish line!

1311
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:41,192
Knock it off!

1312
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:45,262
Ralph, look!

1313
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,058
Kid!

1314
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:51,082
Stop it!

1315
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,059
I'm not letting you
undo all my hard work!

1316
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:57,862
Is that...

1317
01:21:00,923 --> 01:21:02,503
No way!

1318
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:05,532
What the... Who are you?

1319
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:09,641
I'm Turbo, the greatest racer ever!

1320
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:12,542
And I did not reprogram
this world to let you

1321
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,845
and that halitosis-riddled warthog

1322
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:17,760
take it away from me!

1323
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:20,465
Turbo-tastic.

1324
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:23,924
End of the line, Glitch!

1325
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,076
Glitch. That's it.

1326
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,150
Come on, Vanellope.

1327
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:30,878
I know you said you wouldn't do it again

1328
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,996
but you're going to do it one more time.

1329
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,235
Just focus and concentrate

1330
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:38,377
and glitch!

1331
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:45,676
Sweet mother of monkey milk! I did it!

1332
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:48,856
No!

1333
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:58,127
Bring it home, kid!
The finish line is wide open!

1334
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:14,585
No!

1335
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,367
Kid! Are you okay?

1336
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,688
I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's finish this race!

1337
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:25,212
Oh, my land.

1338
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,034
All right. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1339
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:29,119
But I didn't cross the finish line!

1340
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:31,058
There is no finish line!

1341
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:34,297
Move it or lose it, people.
Everybody, out. Now!

1342
01:22:37,019 --> 01:22:38,309
Ralph, it's not going to work!

1343
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:39,487
We got to try!

1344
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:43,681
Kid!

1345
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:46,006
Ralph, I told you I can't leave the game.

1346
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:48,812
-Come on. Get through.
-Ralph! Stop!

1347
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,273
It's got to work!

1348
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:53,496
Stop, it's no use.

1349
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,219
It's okay, Ralph.

1350
01:23:05,514 --> 01:23:06,504
All right, Fix-It.

1351
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:09,161
That's everyone.
Now, we've got to blow up this exit.

1352
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:13,914
Just go. Go without me.

1353
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:17,654
-But what about this game?
-Nothing we can do about it.

1354
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:21,163
Without a beacon, there's
no way to stop these monsters.

1355
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:25,726
Beacon?

1356
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:28,465
Stay with Felix.

1357
01:23:28,804 --> 01:23:29,944
Let me borrow that thing, lady.

1358
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,959
-Ralph! Where are you going?
-l got some wrecking to do!

1359
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:35,152
I'll meet you at the finish line!

1360
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:36,314
No! Wait!

1361
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:37,778
Fix-It, get behind me!

1362
01:23:52,895 --> 01:23:53,855
Come on!

1363
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:00,076
One more! One...

1364
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:04,187
Welcome to the boss level!

1365
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:05,703
Turbo.

1366
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,625
Because of you, Ralph,

1367
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:12,637
I'm now the most powerful
virus in the arcade!

1368
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:15,429
Il can take over any game ! want.

1369
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:17,361
I should thank you

1370
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:20,066
but it would be more fun to kill you.

1371
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:24,131
Get back here, little guy!

1372
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:31,334
Have some candy!

1373
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:34,508
Where do you think you're going?

1374
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:42,191
I'm not through with you yet. Up we go!

1375
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:43,710
No!

1376
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,349
Ralph!

1377
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:51,442
Fall back.

1378
01:24:53,622 --> 01:24:54,492
Kid!

1379
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:01,542
Vanellope!

1380
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:04,237
Look at that. It's your little friend.

1381
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,353
Let's watch her die together, shall we?

1382
01:25:07,903 --> 01:25:08,893
No!

1383
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:13,583
It's game over for both of you.

1384
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:16,919
No. Just for me!

1385
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:20,942
-Ralph!
-Vanellope!

1386
01:25:26,922 --> 01:25:29,501
I'm bad, and that's good.

1387
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:32,829
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

1388
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:37,840
There's no one I'd rather be...

1389
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:41,405
.. than me.

1390
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:10,548
Kid!

1391
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:13,592
Don't worry. I got it under control.

1392
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:41,560
You fools! Why are you
going into the ligh...

1393
01:26:44,733 --> 01:26:46,953
No! No, no, no. Yes...

1394
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,892
No! Yes... No!

1395
01:26:51,273 --> 01:26:53,353
Go into the light!

1396
01:27:01,483 --> 01:27:02,333
Chocolate?

1397
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:05,882
It's chocolate! I love chocolate!

1398
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:08,799
Oh, beautiful chocolate!

1399
01:27:09,091 --> 01:27:09,961
Yeah!

1400
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:14,179
You did it, Ralph! Way to go, brother!

1401
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:22,201
I... Excuse...

1402
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,671
All fixed.

1403
01:27:31,113 --> 01:27:33,773
-You ready for this?
-As ready as I'll ever be.

1404
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:45,375
What's with all the magic sparkles?

1405
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:15,955
Princess Vanellope?

1406
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:18,028
Now I remember.

1407
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:23,177
All hail the rightful ruler
of Sugar Rush...

1408
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:25,302
Princess Vanellope.

1409
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,268
l remember. She's our princess!

1410
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:29,650
Oh, that's right!

1411
01:28:30,005 --> 01:28:31,525
We are so sorry
about the way we treated you.

1412
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,169
Yeah, those were jokes!

1413
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:35,912
I was just doing
what Taffyta told me to do!

1414
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:38,008
Tut-tut.

1415
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:41,385
As your merciful princess,
Il hereby decree

1416
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:45,890
that everyone who was ever
mean to me shall be

1417
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:47,758
executed.

1418
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,139
What? No, please!

1419
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:51,672
Oh, my land.

1420
01:28:51,927 --> 01:28:54,327
This place just got interesting.

1421
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:54,349
This place just got interesting.

1422
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:56,272
I don't want to die!

1423
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:59,761
I'm just kidding. Stop crying, Taffyta.

1424
01:29:00,402 --> 01:29:01,982
I'm trying, but it won't stop.

1425
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:04,708
Wow.

1426
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:07,733
So this is the real you. Princess.

1427
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:11,740
Aw, Ralph, what are you, nuts?
Come on. This isn't me.

1428
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,555
This is me.

1429
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:18,859
Look, the code may say I'm a princess

1430
01:29:19,154 --> 01:29:20,554
but I know who I really am, Ralph,

1431
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:23,579
I'm a racer with
the greatest superpower ever.

1432
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,388
l was here, I was there.

1433
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,340
l was glitching through the walls.

1434
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:28,562
I'm not giving that up.

1435
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:30,637
Pardon me for asking,

1436
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:33,796
but without a princess,
who's going to lead us?

1437
01:29:34,269 --> 01:29:35,139
Yeah. Who?

1438
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:38,821
Me. I'm thinking more along the lines of

1439
01:29:39,274 --> 01:29:41,144
a constitutional democracy.

1440
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:44,540
President Vanellope von Schweetz.

1441
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:46,543
Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

1442
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:50,333
Fix-It, Wreck-lt,
the arcade's about to open.

1443
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:52,432
Let's move ‘em out.

1444
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:02,514
You could just stay here
and live in the castle.

1445
01:30:03,098 --> 01:30:04,148
You'd have your own wing

1446
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:05,922
where no one would ever
complain about your stench

1447
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:08,004
or treat you bad ever again.

1448
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:10,076
You could be happy.

1449
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:13,189
I'm already happy.

1450
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:15,248
I've got the coolest friend in the world.

1451
01:30:16,478 --> 01:30:18,318
And besides, I've got a job to do, too.

1452
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:22,017
It may not be as fancy
as being president

1453
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:23,657
but it's my duty.

1454
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:25,329
And it's a big duty!

1455
01:30:27,622 --> 01:30:28,582
Ralph, are you coming, brother?

1456
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:32,595
See you later, President Fart Feathers.

1457
01:30:33,128 --> 01:30:35,708
Au revoir, Admiral Underpants.

1458
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:39,107
And farewell, Baroness Boogerface.

1459
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:41,594
Goodbye, Major Body Odor!

1460
01:30:42,137 --> 01:30:44,067
-Hasta la vista, you...
-Ralph!

1461
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:46,622
-All right. To be continued.
-Yeah!

1462
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:48,468
Hooray!

1463
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:02,079
I'm gonna wreck it!

1464
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:07,494
Hey! Ralph's back! Isn't that great!

1465
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:07,515
Hey! Ralph's back! Isn't that great!

1466
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,816
The gang's all here!

1467
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:13,851
So, I'm happy to report,
and you'll be happy to hear,

1468
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,899
I'm taking life one game at a time.

1469
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:18,197
All right! Yeah, Ralph!

1470
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,930
Of course, the job hasn't changed.

1471
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:23,143
But, news flash,
the Nicelanders are being nice to me!

1472
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,664
But, news flash,
the Nicelanders are being nice to me!

1473
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:28,891
And that got me thinking about
those poor guys left without a game.

1474
01:31:29,918 --> 01:31:31,647
-So here's what we did.
-We're gonna wreck it!

1475
01:31:32,087 --> 01:31:33,987
We asked them to help us out
on the bonus levels.

1476
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,246
We can fix it!

1477
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,008
I'm telling you, guys,

1478
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:39,860
we haven't been this popular in years.

1479
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:40,001
we haven't been this popular in years.

1480
01:31:40,195 --> 01:31:41,245
-It's crazy.
-Wow!

1481
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:43,783
The gamers say we're "retro,"

1482
01:31:44,099 --> 01:31:46,589
which I think means "old but cool."

1483
01:31:47,102 --> 01:31:48,331
How come we never noticed this game?

1484
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:50,504
And I decided that living in the dump

1485
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:52,004
wasn't making me feel very good,

1486
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:54,721
so cleaned it up,
built myself a little shack

1487
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:56,406
and a couple for the new guys, too.

1488
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:00,629
Well, with a little help from Felix.

1489
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:03,223
And guess who was the best man
at his and Calhoun's wedding.

1490
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:06,472
That's right, my friends,
old Ham Hands himself.

1491
01:32:07,589 --> 01:32:09,229
Very elegant affair.
You should've seen it.

1492
01:32:09,591 --> 01:32:10,851
Lot of grandeur.

1493
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:12,386
And not a single bug.

1494
01:32:16,464 --> 01:32:19,534
Let's just say, some tears were shed.

1495
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,810
But I got to say, the best part of my day

1496
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,929
is when I get thrown off the roof.

1497
01:32:28,977 --> 01:32:30,557
Because when the Nicelanders
lift me up,

1498
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,040
! get a perfect view of Sugar Rush.

1499
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,239
And I can see Vanellope racing.

1500
01:32:39,254 --> 01:32:40,104
Yes!

1501
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:42,459
The kid's a natural.

1502
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:45,495
And the players love her, glitch and all.

1503
01:32:46,461 --> 01:32:47,721
Just like l knew they would,

1504
01:32:49,831 --> 01:32:52,291
Turns out I don't need a medal
to tell me I'm a good guy.

1505
01:32:54,436 --> 01:32:56,165
‘Cause if that little kid likes me...

1506
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,331
How bad can! be?
