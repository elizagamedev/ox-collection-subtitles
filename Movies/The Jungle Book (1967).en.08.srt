ls a question rather droll

12
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,252
For to march and drill
over field and hill

13
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,467
Is a military goal

14
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,149
Is a military goal

15
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,529

By the ranks or single file

18
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,821
Over every jungle mile

19
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,525
Oh, we stamp and crush
through the underbrush

20
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,920
In the military style

21
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,530
In the military style

22
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,414

And with...

30
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,127
Look for the bare necessities

31
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,237
The simple bare necessities

32
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,932
Forget about your worries
and your strife

33
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,189
1 mean, the bare necessities

34
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,279
Are Mother Nature's recipes

35
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:46,294
That bring
the bare necessities of life

36
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,958
Wherever I wander

37
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,214
Wherever I roam

38
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,600
! couldn't be fonder

39
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,592
Of my big home

40
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,288
The bees are buzzin' in the tree

41
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,120
To make some honey just for me

42
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,577
When you look under
the rocks and plants

43
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,739
And take a glance at the fancy ants

44
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,795
Then maybe try a few

45
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,386
The bare necessities of life
will come to you

46
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,977
They'll come to you

47
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,743

and your strife

50
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,109

51
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,488
That's why a bear can rest at ease

52
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,640
With just the bare necessities of life

53
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,778
Now, when you pick a pawpaw

54
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,274
Or a prickly pear

55
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,359
And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time beware

56
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,313
Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw

57
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,963
When you pick a pear
try to use the claw

58
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,629
But you don't need
to use the claw

59
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,098
When you pick a pear
of the big pawpaw

60
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,293
Have I given you a clue?

61
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,325
The bare necessities of life
will come to you

62
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,863
They'll come to you

63
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,653
When you find out
you can live without it

64
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,749
And go along not thinkin’ about it

65
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,348

We're a crackerjack brigade

When you're alone

171
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,251
When you're alone

To pluck you up

175
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,991
To pluck you up

176
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,023
When you are down

177
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:03,369
When you are down

178
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,400
And when you're outside looking in

179
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:12,007
Who's there to open the door?

180
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,102
That's

181
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:15,337

Who's always eager to extend

184
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:29,843
A friendly claw

185
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:35,105
That's what friends are for

186
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:37,532
And when you're lost

187
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,158
In dire need

188
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,747
Who's at your side

189
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:44,175
At lightning speed

190
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,851
We're friends with every creature
comin' down the pike

191
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:52,278
In fact, we've never met
an animal we didn't like

192
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:58,114
Didn't like

193
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:03,013
- So, you can see we're friends
- Friends in need

194
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,482
We're friends in need
and friends indeed

195
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:06,909
Friends indeed

196
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,290
Oh, friends indeed

197
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,900
We'll keep you safe in the jungle

198
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:18,274
Forevermore

199
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:24,935
That's what friends

200
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:30,538
Are for

201
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:33,383
My own home

202
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:37,529
My own home

203
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:41,273
My own home

204
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,744
My own home

205
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,905
Father's hunting in the forest

206
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:29,499
Mother's cooking in the home

207
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:33,459
! must go to fetch the water

208
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:36,843
Till the day that l am grown

209
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,150
Till 'm grown

! must go to fetch the water

212
01:14:49,452 --> 01:14:53,402
Till the day that l am grown

213
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:15,027
Then I will have a handsome husband

214
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,334
And a daughter of my own

215
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:22,291
And I'll send her to fetch the water

216

Look for the bare necessities

220
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:34,084
The simple bare necessities

221
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:37,226
Forget about your worries
and your strife

222
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:41,130
1 mean the bare necessities

223
01:17:41,557 --> 01:17:43,487
Are Mother Nature's recipes

224
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:46,726
That bring the bare necessities of life
