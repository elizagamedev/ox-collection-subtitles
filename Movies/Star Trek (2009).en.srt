1
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,530
U.S.S. Kelvin, go for Starfleet Base.

2
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,260
Starfleet Base, we’ve sent you
a transmission. Did you receive?

3
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,870
Kelvin, have you double-checked
those readings?

4
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,540
Our gravitational sensors are
going crazy here. You should see this.

5
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,009
It looks like a lightning storm.

6
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,470
What you've sent us
doesn't seem possible.

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,619
Yes, ma’am. ! understand.
That's why we sent it.

8
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,780
-Report.
-It's still out of visual range.

9
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,620
-Give me 20 seconds.
-Alert Captain Robau

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,590
that Starfleet advises your ship
to proceed with caution.

11
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,200
Polarise the viewscreen.

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,670
Could whatever this is
be of Klingon origin?

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,080
Captain, we have visual.

14
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,850
-Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
-Negative, Lieutenant.

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,510
You're 75,000 kilometres from...

16
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,340
Captain, are you seeing this?

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,950
My God.

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,440
I have a reading.

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,260
-They've locked weapons on us!
-Red alert!

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,310
Torpedo locked on us at 320 degrees,

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,510
-mark 2.
-Arm weapons!

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,080
Evasive pattern Delta-five!

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,170
Incoming fast!

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,640
Fire all phasers! Damage report.

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,709
Warp drive’s been knocked out!
Never seen anything like it.

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,910
Weapons are off-line. Main power 38%.

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,820
-They're firing another!
-All power to forward shields!

28
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,720
Lieutenant!

29
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,200
Atmospheric stabilisation has been lost.

30
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,130
-Were our shields even up?
-Oxygen failing, Decks 7 to 13.

31
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,050
-We have confirmed casualties, sir.
-Shields 11% and dropping.

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,620
Ten percent. Shields at nine.
We're dropping here.

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,570
All remaining power to forward shields.
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,100
Hello.

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,640
My commander requests
the presence of your Captain

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,040
in order to negotiate a cease-fire.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,860
You will come aboard our ship
via shuttlecraft.

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,530
Your refusal would be unwise.

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,220
Walk with me.

40
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,860
If l don't report in 15 minutes,
evacuate the crew.

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,600
-Sir, we could issue...
-There is no help for us out here.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,230
Use autopilot.

43
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
-And get off this ship.
-Aye, Captain.

44
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,900
You're Captain now, Mr Kirk.

45
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,960
His heart rate’s elevated.

46
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,080
Look at this ship.

47
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,049
-Are you familiar with this craft?
-Who is your commander?

48
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,140
-ls it him?
-I will speak for Captain Nero.

49
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,530
Then ask Captain Nero what gives him
the right to attack a Federation vessel.

50
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,489
Do you know the location
of Ambassador Spock?

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,170
I'm unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

52
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,390
-What is the current stardate?
-Stardate?

53
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,010
Twenty-two thirty-three zero-four.

54
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,510
Where are you from?

55
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,460
Sir, they're locked on our signal.
They're launching again!

56
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,060
Bravo-six manoeuvre! Fire full spread!

57
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,430
-Seventeen more out!
-I'm initiating General Order 13!

58
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,350
-We're evacuating!
-Yes, sir!

59
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,360
All decks, this is the Captain speaking.
Evacuate the ship immediately.

60
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,489
Get to your designated shuttlecraft.
Repeat. Evacuate...

61
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,340
That's George's voice.
What's happening?

62
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,830
You'll deliver in the shuttle. Go!

63
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,800
Move! This one's closed!
Let's go! Get him up!

64
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,570
I'm on my way!

65
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,790
-George.
-You're okay. Thank God.

66
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,609
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

67
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,610
-Yes.
-Everything’s gonna be okay.

68
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,320
-Do exactly as I say. Shuttle 37.
-George, it's coming.

69
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,550
-Our baby, it's coming now.
-I’m on my way.

70
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Autopilot function has been destroyed.

71
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,910
Manual operation only.

72
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,219
Clear those decks now!
Get to the shuttles! Move, move, move!

73
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,300
Get to the hangar deck!
Get to the hangar deck! Let's move it!

74
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,570
-That was a big one.
-Just keep breathing. You'll be fine.

75
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,310
-And the baby, too, right?
-And the baby, too.

76
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Right here. Go ahead and sit back.

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,070
Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife onboard?

78
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,690
-Yes, sir, she is.
-I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

79
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,250
-We're waiting on you, sir.
-No, just go. Take off immediately.

80
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,539
-That's an order.
-Yes, sir.

81
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,400
No, wait! We can't go yet!

82
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,500
Please stop! Stop!

83
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,930
George? The shuttle's leaving.
Where are you?

84
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,730
Sweetheart, listen to me.

85
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,300
I’m not gonna be there.

86
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,420
-No.
-This is the only way you'll survive.

87
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,010
Are you still on the ship?
You have to be here!

88
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,190
The shuttles will never make it
if l don't fight them off.

89
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,080
George, I can't do this without you.

90
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Okay, I need you to push now.

91
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,570
-What is it?
-It's a boy.

92
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,090
A boy?

93
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,720
Tell me about him.

94
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,200
He's beautiful.

95
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,730
George, you should be here.

96
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,740
Impact alert.

97
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,900
-What are we gonna call him?
-We can name him after your father.

98
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,320
"Tiberius"? You kidding me?
No, that's the worst.

99
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,010
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

100
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,240
Jim. Okay. Jim it is.

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
-Sweetheart, can you hear me?
-l hear you!

102
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,450
I love you so much. I love you...

103
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,650
Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.

104
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,130
You think you can get away with this
just ‘cause your mother’s off planet?

105
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
You get your ass back home now!

106
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,970
You live in my house, buddy.
You live in my house, and that’s my car.

107
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,900
You get one scratch on that car,
and I'm gonna whip your...

108
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,180
Yeah!

109
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,640
Hey, Johnny!

110
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,910
Citizen! Pull over.

111
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,290
No!

112
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,180
Is there a problem, Officer?

113
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,740
Citizen, what is your name?

114
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,370
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

115
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,410
What is the formula
for the volume of a sphere?

116
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,010
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

117
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,510
One-point-two-six.

118
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,590
An ellipse.

119
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,339
What is the electrical charge
of an up-type quark?

120
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,150
Positive two-thirds.

121
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,550
What is the square root of 2,396,324?

122
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,780
-1,548.
-What is the dimensionality...

123
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,360
Dimensionality equals the logarithm
and divided by...

124
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,920
Non-excludability and non-rivalry...
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

125
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,560
When it is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

126
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,970
Spock!

127
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,719
I presume you've prepared
new insults for today.

128
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,600
Affirmative.

129
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,690
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit
an emotional response from me.

130
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,760
You're neither human nor Vulcan, and
therefore have no place in this universe.

131
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,620
Look. He has human eyes.
They look sad, don't they?

132
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,990
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimuli.

133
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,240
He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
For marrying her. That human whore.

134
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,000
They called you a traitor.

135
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,870
Emotions run deep within our race.

136
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,220
In many ways,
more deeply than in humans.

137
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,620
Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience.

138
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
The control of feelings,
so that they do not control you.

139
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,709
You suggest
that I should be completely Vulcan,

140
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,430
and yet, you married a human.

141
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,550
As ambassador to Earth, it is my duty

142
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,200
to observe
and understand human behaviour.

143
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,550
Marrying your mother was

144
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,280
logical.

145
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,950
Spock. You are fully capable
of deciding your own destiny.

146
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,870
The question you face is,
which path will you choose?

147
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,090
This is something only you can decide.

148
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,000
Spock, come here, let me see you.

149
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,500
-No.
-Spock.

150
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,010
There's no need to be anxious.
You'll do fine.

151
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,620
lam hardly anxious, Mother.

152
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,120
And "fine" has variable definitions.
"Fine" is unacceptable.

153
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,310
Okay.

154
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,500
-May I ask a personal query?
-Anything.

155
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,710
Should I choose to complete
the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr

156
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,370
and purge all emotion,

157
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,369
I trust you will not feel
it reflects judgement upon you.

158
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,760
Spock.

159
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,080
As always, whatever you choose to be,

160
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,370
you will have a proud mother.

161
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,290
You have surpassed the expectations
of your instructors.

162
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,100
Your final record is flawless,
with one exception.

163
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,080
I see that you have applied
to Starfleet as well.

164
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
It was logical
to cultivate multiple options.

165
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,680
Logical, but unnecessary.

166
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,600
You are hereby accepted
to the Vulcan Science Academy.

167
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,300
It is truly remarkable, Spock,

168
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,370
that you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage.

169
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,520
All rise!

170
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,200
If you would clarify, Minister,

171
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,310
-to what disadvantage are you referring?
-Your human mother.

172
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,290
Council. Ministers, ] must decline.

173
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,000
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

174
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,720
Then as I am half human,
your record remains untarnished.

175
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,239
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honour the Vulcan way.

176
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,690
Why did you come
before this council today?

177
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,210
Was it to satisfy
your emotional need to rebel?

178
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,199
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

179
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,540
Thank you, Ministers,
for your consideration.

180
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,340
Live long and prosper.

181
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,889
-How are you?
-Hey.

182
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,760
-Hi.
-Hi.

183
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,790
Hi, I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea,
three Budweiser Classics,

184
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,820
-two Cardassian Sunrises and...
-Gotta try the Slusho. It's good.

185
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,729
The Slusho mix. Thank you.

186
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,250
That's a lot of drinks for one woman.

187
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,290
-And a shot of Jack, straight up.
-Make that two. Her shot's on me.

188
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,540
Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

189
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,350
Don't you want to at least
know my name

190
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,900
before you completely reject me?

191
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,760
-I'm fine without it.
-You are fine without it.

192
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,020
It's Jim. Jim Kirk.

193
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,050
If you don't tell me your name,
I'm gonna have to make one up.

194
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,620
-It's Uhura.
-Uhura? No way!

195
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,030
That's the name
I was gonna make up for you.

196
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
-Uhura what?
-Just Uhura.

197
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,090
They don't have last names
in your world?

198
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,550
Uhura is my last name.

199
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,470
Well, they don't have first names
in your world?

200
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,340
Excuse me, buddy.

201
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,159
So, you're a cadet, you're studying.
What's your focus?

202
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,669
Xenolinguistics.
You have no idea what that means.

203
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,010
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

204
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,530
It means you've got a talented tongue.

205
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm impressed.

206
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,560
For a moment there,
I thought you were just a dumb hick

207
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,020
-who only has sex with farm animals.
-Well, not only.

208
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,770
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

209
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,260
Beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

210
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,320
You could handle me.
That's an invitation.

211
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,260
-Hey, you better mind your manners.
-Relax, cupcake. It was a joke.

212
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,810
Hey, farm boy. Maybe you can't count,
but there are four of us and one of you.

213
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,460
So get some more guys,
and then it'll be an even fight.

214
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,290
Guys, stop it.

215
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,970
Stop it!

216
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,820
Enough!

217
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,479
Guys, he’s had enough!

218
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,379
Outside, all of you.

219
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,810
-Now!
-Yes, sir!

220
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,920
-He wouldn't even listen!
-I just bought a drink.

221
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,780
-Can you believe this?
-It's not really fair.

222
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,250
-Come on.
-You all right, son?

223
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,030
You can whistle really loud,
you know that?

224
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,430
You know, I couldn't believe it when
the bartender told me who you are.

225
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,399
-And who am I, Captain Pike?
-Your father's son.

226
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,520
Can I get another one?

227
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,120
For my dissertation,
Il was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin.

228
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,030
Something I admired about your dad,
he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.

229
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,830
He sure learned his lesson.

230
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,460
Well, it depends
on how you define winning.

231
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,610
-You're here, aren't you?
-Thanks.

232
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,520
You know, that instinct to leap
without looking, that was his nature, too.

233
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,920
And in my opinion,
it's something Starfleet's lost.

234
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,740
-Why are you talking to me, man?
-'Cause I looked up your file

235
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,370
while you were drooling on the floor.

236
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,920
Your aptitude tests are off the charts.
So what is it?

237
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,790
You like being the only genius-level
repeat-offender in the Midwest?

238
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,670
Maybe I love it.

239
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,080
So your dad dies. You can settle
for a less-than-ordinary life.

240
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,550
Or do you feel like you were meant
for something better?

241
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,720
Something special?

242
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,810
-Enlist in Starfleet.
-Enlist?

243
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
You guys must be way down
on your recruiting quota for the month.

244
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,669
If you're half the man your father was,
Jim, Starfleet could use you.

245
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,430
You can be an officer in four years.
You can have your own ship in eight.

246
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,129
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important.

247
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,210
It's a peacekeeping
and humanitarian armada...

248
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,980
-Are we done?
-I'm done.

249
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,600
Riverside Shipyard. Shuttle for
new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.

250
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,929
Now, your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.

251
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,840
He saved 800 lives,
including your mother's. And yours.

252
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,250
I dare you to do better.

253
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,150
Nice ride, man.

254
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,150
It's yours.

255
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,210
Four years? I'll do it in three.

256
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,070
At ease, gentlemen.

257
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,150
-Never did get that first name.
-You need a doctor.

258
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,430
I told you people, I don't need a doctor,
damn it, 1 am a doctor!

259
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,629
You need to get back to your seat.

260
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,750
l had one in the bathroom
with no windows.

261
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,710
-You need to get back to your seat now.
-I suffer from aviaphobia.

262
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,300
It means fear of dying
in something that flies.

263
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,040
Sir, for your own safety, sit down,
or else I'll make you sit down!

264
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,590
-Fine.
-Thank you.

265
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,399
This is Captain Pike.
We've been cleared for takeoff.

266
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,440
I may throw up on you.

267
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,610
I think these things are pretty safe.

268
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,990
Don't pander to me, kid.
One tiny crack in the hull

269
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,290
and our blood boils in 13 seconds.

270
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,060
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

271
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,940
And wait till you're sitting pretty
with a case of Andorian shingles.

272
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,169
See if you're still so relaxed
when your eyeballs are bleeding.

273
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,660
Space is disease and danger
wrapped in darkness and silence.

274
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,390
Well, I hate to break this to you,
but Starfleet operates in space.

275
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,670
Yeah, well, I got nowhere else to go.

276
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,810
The ex-wife took the whole damn planet
in the divorce.

277
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,030
All I got left is my bones.

278
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,710
-Jim Kirk.
-McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

279
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,600
Captain Nero! You've been
requested on the Bridge, sir.

280
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,659
Ayel says it's time.

281
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,260
Sir, we've arrived at the coordinates
you calculated. There's nothing here.

282
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,890
-What are your orders?
-We wait.

283
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,000
We wait for the one
who allowed our home to be destroyed,

284
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
as we've been doing for 25 years.

285
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,389
-And once we've killed him?
-Kill him?

286
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,100
I'm not gonna kill him.
I'm gonna make him watch.

287
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,479
Capture that ship!

288
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,710
Welcome back, Spock.

289
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,850
Why are you so happy?

290
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-No, I don't suppose you do.

291
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,700
Hello, ladies!

292
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,840
-I'm taking the test again.
-You gotta be kidding.

293
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,590
Yeah, tomorrow morning,
and I want you there.

294
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,860
You know, I've got better things to do

295
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,830
than watch you embarrass yourself
for a third time.

296
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,350
I'm a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

297
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,530
Bones, it doesn't bother you
that no one's ever passed the test?

298
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,130
Jim, it's the Kobayashi Maru.
No one passes the test.

299
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,120
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

300
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,820
I gotta study.

301
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,080
Study, my ass.

302
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,270
-Jim, I think I love you.
-That is so weird.

303
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,870
-Lights.
-Lights on.

304
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,180
Did you just say, "That is so weird"?

305
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,190
-Yeah, I did, but...
-You don't love me, too?

306
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,639
Oh, my God, my roommate!

307
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,890
But I thought you said
she was gone for the night.

308
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,699
Obviously she's not.
Quick, get under the bed.

309
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,370
-Under...
-Look, just get under the bed.

310
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,040
-Come on!
-She can't see you here.

311
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,510
-Why not?
-Because I promised her

312
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,810
-I'd stop bringing guys back to the room.
-Really?

313
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,320
-Well, how many guys have you...
-Just down! Just down!

314
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,709
-Hey.
-Hey.

315
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,150
-How are you?
-Good.

316
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,000
The strangest thing,
I was in the long-range sensor lab...

317
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,950
Yeah, I thought all night.

318
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,930
l was tracking solar systems and
I picked up an emergency transmission.

319
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,610
-Really?
-Yeah. From a Klingon prison planet.

320
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,460
-No.
-Yeah.

321
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,820
A Klingon armada was destroyed.
Forty-seven ships.

322
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,730
So you're not going back
to the lab tonight?

323
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,320
-Gaila, who is he?
-Who's who?

324
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,530
The mouth-breather
hiding under your bed.

325
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,180
You could hear me breathing?

326
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,770
-You!
-Big day tomorrow.

327
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,320
-You're gonna fail. Get out.
-Gaila, see you around.

328
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,950
If l pass,
will you tell me your first name?

329
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,670
-No! Good night.
-I think the fact

330
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,280
that you picked up a transmission
is very interesting.

331
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,290
We are receiving a distress signal
from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru.

332
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,410
The ship has lost power
and is stranded.

333
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,330
Starfleet Command
has ordered us to rescue them.

334
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,200
“Starfleet Command has ordered us
to rescue them,

335
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,770
“Captain.”

336
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,379
Two Klingon vessels
have entered the Neutral Zone

337
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,030
-and are locking weapons on us.
-That's okay.

338
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,750
-That's okay?
-Yeah, don’t worry about it.

339
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,220
Did he say, "Don't worry about it"?

340
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,100
Is he not taking
the simulation seriously?

341
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,060
Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

342
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,690
-I don't suppose this is a problem either.
-They're firing, Captain.

343
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,650
Alert Medical Bay to prepare to receive
all crew members

344
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,980
from the damaged ship.

345
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,670
And how do you expect us
to rescue them

346
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,240
when we're surrounded
by Klingons, Captain?

347
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,900
Alert Medical.

348
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,420
Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.

349
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,550
-l understand.
-Well, should we, I don't know,

350
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,140
fire back?

351
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,100
-No.
-Of course not.

352
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,250
What is this? What's going on?

353
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,850
Arm photons.
Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.

354
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,020
-Yes, sir.
-Jim, their shields are still up.

355
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,409
Are they?

356
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,640
No. They're not.

357
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,649
Fire on all enemy ships.

358
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,170
One photon each should do.
Let's not waste ammunition.

359
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,020
Target locked and acquired
on all warbirds. Firing.

360
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,270
-All ships destroyed, Captain.
-Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

361
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,760
So! We've managed to eliminate
all enemy ships,

362
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,649
no one onboard was injured,

363
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,450
and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.

364
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,790
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

365
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,940
I do not know.

366
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,790
This session has been called
to resolve a troubling matter.

367
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,310
James T. Kirk, step forward.

368
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,709
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been
submitted to this council

369
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,439
suggesting that you violated
the ethical code of conduct

370
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,790
pursuant to Regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

371
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,190
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

372
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,550
Yes, I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly.

373
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,670
Step forward, please.

374
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,510
This is Commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

375
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,409
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last four years.

376
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,080
-Commander?
-Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed

377
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
to install and activate a subroutine
in the programming code,

378
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,300
thereby changing
the conditions of the test.

379
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,380
-Your point being?
-In academic vernacular, you cheated.

380
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,710
Let me ask you something
I think we all know the answer to.

381
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,780
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?

382
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,770
I mean, you programmed it
to be unwinnable.

383
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,250
Your argument precludes the possibility
of a no-win scenario.

384
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,660
-I don't believe in no-win scenarios.
-Then not only did you violate the rules,

385
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,810
you also failed to understand
the principal lesson.

386
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,419
Please, enlighten me.

387
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,540
You of all people should know,
Cadet Kirk,

388
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,700
a captain cannot cheat death.

389
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,050
I of all people?

390
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,090
Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk,
assumed command of his vessel

391
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,960
before being killed in action, did he not?

392
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,750
I don't think you like the fact
that I beat your test.

393
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,860
Furthermore, you have failed to divine
the purpose of the test.

394
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,150
-Enlighten me again.
-The purpose is to experience fear,

395
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,080
fear in the face of certain death.

396
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,910
To accept that fear, and maintain
control of oneself and one's crew.

397
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,360
This is a quality expected
in every Starfleet captain.

398
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,439
Excuse me, sir.

399
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,050
We've received a distress call
from Vulcan.

400
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,040
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

401
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,200
I hereby order all cadets to report
to Hangar One immediately. Dismissed.

402
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,360
-Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
-I don't know, but I like him.

403
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,659
Fugeman, Regula One!
Gerace, U.S.S. Farragut!

404
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,859
McCoy, U.S.S. Enterprise!
McGrath, U.S.S. Wolcott!

405
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,300
Rader, U.S.S. Hood.
Welcome to Starfleet, and Godspeed.

406
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,630
He didn't call my name.

407
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,489
Commander? Sir, you didn't call
my name. Kirk, James T.

408
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,470
Kirk, you're on academic suspension.

409
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,139
That means you're grounded
until the Academy Board rules.

410
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,909
All right, listen up! I'm gonna read
this list one time, and one time only!

411
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,480
Jim, the Board will rule in your favour.
Most likely.

412
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,589
-Look, Jim, I gotta go.
-Yeah.

413
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,890
Yeah, you go. Be safe.

414
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,250
-Excuse me.
-Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

415
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,210
Damn it.

416
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,800
-Come with me.
-U.S.S. Newton! Uhura, U.S.S. Farragut!

417
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,440
Petrovsky, U.S.S. Antares!
Go to your stations and good luck.

418
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,480
-Bones, where are we going?
-You'll see.

419
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,290
-Commander, a word?
-Yes, Lieutenant?

420
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
-Was I not one of your top students?
-Indeed you were.

421
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,710
And did I not
on multiple occasions demonstrate

422
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,710
an exceptional aural sensitivity
and, I quote,

423
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,089
“an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies"

424
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,280
-in subspace transmissions tests?
-Consistently, yes.

425
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,440
And while you were well aware
that my unqualified desire

426
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,320
is to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise,
I'm assigned to the Farragut?

427
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,430
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favouritism.

428
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,980
No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.

429
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,070
-Yes, I believe you are.
-Thank you.

430
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,100
-What are you doing?
-I'm doing you a favour.

431
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,840
I couldn't just leave you there,
looking all pathetic.

432
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,859
Take a seat. I'm gonna give you
a vaccine against viral infection

433
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,580
-from Melvaran mud fleas.
-What for?

434
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,980
-To give you the symptoms.
-What are you talking about?

435
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,210
You're gonna start to lose vision
in your left eye.

436
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,540
Yeah, I already have.

437
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,080
Oh, and you're gonna get
a really bad headache and a flop sweat.

438
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,270
-You call this a favour?
-Yeah. You owe me one.

439
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,660
Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.

440
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,580
Medical code states the treatment

441
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,520
and transport of a patient is
to be determined

442
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,440
at the discretion of his
attending physician, which is me.

443
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,460
So I'm taking Mr Kirk aboard.

444
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,790
Or would you like to explain
to Captain Pike

445
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,700
why the Enterprise warped into a crisis

446
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,390
without one of its senior
medical officers?

447
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,750
-As you were.
-As you were. Come on.

448
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,430
-I might throw up on you.
-Jim, you've got to look at this.

449
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,960
-Jim, look.
-What?

450
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,069
Look.

451
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,819
-We need to get you changed.
-I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.

452
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,680
Hell, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

453
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,560
-Mr Spock.
-Captain.

454
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,530
-Engineering reports ready for launch.
-Thank you.

455
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,890
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

456
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,120
deserves more pomp and circumstance
than we can afford today.

457
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,900
Her christening will just have to be
our reward for a safe return. Carry on.

458
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,250
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

459
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,680
Helm, thrusters.

460
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Moorings retracted, Captain.
Dock Control reports ready.

461
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,100
Thrusters fired.
Separating from spacedock.

462
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,540
The fleet's cleared spacedock, Captain.
All ships ready for warp.

463
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,440
-Set a course for Vulcan.
-Aye-aye, Captain. Course laid in.

464
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,180
Maximum warp. Punch it.

465
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,300
Lieutenant,
where is Helmsman McKenna?

466
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,200
He has lungworms, sir.
He couldn't report to his post.

467
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,870
I'm Hikaru Sulu.

468
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,960
-And you are a pilot, right?
-Very much so, sir.

469
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

470
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,090
-ls the parking brake on?
-No. I'll figure it out. I'm just...

471
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,410
Have you disengaged
the external inertial dampener?

472
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,390
-Ready for warp, sir.
-Let's punch it.

473
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,180
-Where are we?
-Medical Bay.

474
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,980
-This isn't worth it.
-A little suffering's good for the soul.

475
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,720
-Hi! How are you?
-Come here.

476
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,980
-My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
-Well, those symptoms won't last long.

477
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,110
-I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
-I wish I didn't know you.

478
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,100
Don't be such an infant.

479
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,970
How long is it supposed to...

480
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,950
Unbelievable.

481
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,470
-Engines at maximum warp, Captain.
-Russian whiz kid, what's your name?

482
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,070
-Chanko? Cherpov?
-Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir.

483
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,580
Fine, Chekov, Pavel Andreievich.
Begin ship-wide mission broadcast.

484
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,520
Yes, sir. Happy to.

485
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,630
Ensign authorisation code
nine-five-Wictor-Wictor-two.

486
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,810
Authorisation not recognised.

487
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,980
Ensign authorisation code

488
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,940
nine-five-Victor-Victor-two.

489
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,790
May I have your attention, please?

490
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,270
At 2200 hours, telemetry detected
an anomaly in the Neutral Zone.

491
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,930
What appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

492
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,609
Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan High Command

493
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,300
that their planet
was experiencing seismic activity.

494
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,390
Our mission is to assess
the condition of Vulcan

495
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,690
and assist in evacuations if necessary.

496
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,609
We should be arriving at Vulcan within
three minutes. Thank you for your time.

497
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,720
-Lightning storm.
-Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

498
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,490
-Good God, man.
-What?

499
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,380
-What the hell's this?
-A reaction to the vaccine, damn it!

500
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,660
Nurse Chapel,
I need 50 cc's of cortisone!

501
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,470
Yes, sir!

502
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,190
... appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

503
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,490
-Hey!
-We gotta stop the ship.

504
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,399
Jim! I'm not kidding!
We need to keep your heart rate down!

505
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,310
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

506
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,350
You know, I haven't seen a reaction
this severe since med school.

507
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,350
-We're flying into a trap!
-Damn it, Jim, stand still!

508
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,310
Stop it!

509
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,460
-Uhura! Uhura...
-Kirk! What are you doing here?

510
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,410
The transmission from the Klingon
prison planet. What exactly...

511
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,370
Oh, my God,
what's wrong with your hands?

512
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,290
It's... Look, who is responsible
for the Klingon attack?

513
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,900
-What?
-And was the ship...

514
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,069
Was the ship what?

515
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,310
-What's happening to my mouth?
-You got numb tongue?

516
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,330
-Numb tongue?
-I can fix that.

517
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,290
-Was the ship what?
-Romulan.

518
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,140
-What? I...
-Romulan.

519
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,380
-Romulan?
-Yeah!

520
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,650
-Yes.
-Yes?

521
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,720
Damn it!

522
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,170
Prod Nero. Seven Federation ships
are on their way.

523
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,589
-Jim!
-What's going on?

524
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,670
-Jim, come back!
-Kirk!

525
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,420
-Captain! Captain Pike, sir...
-Jim, come back here!

526
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,950
-...we have to stop the ship!
-Kirk, how the hell

527
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,500
did you get onboard the Enterprise?

528
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,230
Captain, this man's under the influence

529
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,780
-of a severe reaction to a vaccine.
-Bones, please...

530
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,480
He's completely delusional,
and I take full responsibility.

531
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,990
Vulcan is not experiencing
a natural disaster.

532
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,399
It's being attacked by Romulans.

533
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,450
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've
had enough attention for one day.

534
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,040
McCoy, take him back to medical.

535
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,610
-We'll have words later.
-Aye, Captain.

536
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,110
Look, sir, that same anomaly
that we saw today...

537
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,830
Mr Kirk is not cleared
to be aboard this vessel, Captain.

538
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,200
-l get it. You're a great arguer.
-By Regulations...

539
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,880
-I'd love to do it again.
-...that makes him a stowaway.

540
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,240
-I can remove the cadet...
-Try it!

541
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,740
-Kirk...
-This cadet is trying to save the Bridge.

542
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,530
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
during a rescue mission?

543
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,360
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me, it's an attack.

544
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,109
Based on what facts?

545
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,620
That same anomaly, a lightning storm
in space that we saw today,

546
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,690
also occurred on the day of my birth,

547
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,420
before a Romulan ship
attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.

548
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,560
You know that, sir,
l read your dissertation.

549
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,090
That ship, which had formidable
and advanced weaponry,

550
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,920
was never seen or heard from again.

551
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,850
The Kelvin attack took place
on the edge of Klingon space,

552
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,509
and at 2300 hours last night,
there was an attack.

553
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,840
Forty-seven Klingon warbirds
destroyed by Romulans, sir,

554
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,130
and it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

555
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,950
And you know
of this Klingon attack how?

556
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,360
Sir, l intercepted and translated
the message myself.

557
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,100
-Kirk's report is accurate.
-We're warping into a trap, sir.

558
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,080
The Romulans are waiting for us,
I promise you that.

559
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,980
The cadet's logic is sound.

560
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,480
And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched
in xenolinguistics.

561
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,380
We would be wise
to accept her conclusion.

562
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,169
Scan Vulcan space. Check
for any transmissions in Romulan.

563
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,410
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish
the Romulan language from Vulcan.

564
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,560
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, Cadet...

565
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,210
Uhura. All three dialects, sir.

566
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,080
-Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
-Yes, sir.

567
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,980
Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.

568
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,310
All the other ships are out of warp, sir,
and have arrived at Vulcan,

569
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,569
but we seem to have lost all contact.

570
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,200
Sir, ! pick up no Romulan transmission,

571
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,360
-or transmission of any kind in the area.
-It's because they're being attacked.

572
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,100
Shields up. Red alert.

573
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,919
Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds.

574
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,190
Four, three, two...

575
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,430
-Emergency evasive!
-On it, sir.

576
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,280
-Damage report!
-Deflector shields are holding.

577
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,310
All stations! Engineer Olson, report!

578
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,750
Full reverse.
Come about starboard 90 degrees.

579
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,300
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

580
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,640
Sir, there's another Federation ship!

581
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,710
-Destroy it, too.
-Fire torpedoes.

582
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,050
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

583
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,350
Divert auxiliary power from port nacelles
to forward shields.

584
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,299
-Sulu, status report.
-Shields at 32%.

585
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,710
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

586
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,990
Get me Starfleet Command.

587
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,870
Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered
some kind of high-energy pulse device

588
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,370
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

589
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,900
Its signal appears to be blocking
our communications

590
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,950
-and transporter abilities.
-All power to forward shields.

591
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,440
Prepare to fire all weapons.

592
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,170
-Weapons ready.
-Wait!

593
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,090
-The hull. Magnify.
-Yes, sir.

594
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,910
Captain, we're being hailed.

595
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,170
Hello.

596
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,580
I'm Captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

597
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,750
Hi, Christopher. I'm Nero.

598
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,620
You've declared war
against the Federation.

599
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,520
Withdraw, I'll agree to arrange
a conference with Romulan leadership

600
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,770
-at a neutral location.
-! do not speak for the Empire.

601
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,500
We stand apart.

602
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,310
As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?

603
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,680
Pardon me, I do not believe
that you and I are acquainted.

604
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,360
No, we're not. Not yet.

605
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,379
Spock, there’s something
! would like you to see.

606
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,180
Captain Pike,
your transporter has been disabled.

607
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,460
As you can see by the rest
of your armada, you have no choice.

608
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,840
You will man a shuttle and come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.

609
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,110
That is all.

610
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,540
-He'll kill you. You know that.
-Your survival is unlikely.

611
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,370
Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy.
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

612
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,270
I, too, agree.
You should rethink your strategy.

613
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,960
l understand that.

614
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,660
I need officers who've been trained
in advanced hand-to-hand combat.

615
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,859
-I have training, sir.
-Come with me.

616
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,040
Kirk, you, too.
You're not supposed to be here anyway.

617
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,680
-Chekov, you have the conn.
-Aye-aye, Captain.

618
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,890
Prepare the red matter.

619
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,600
Yes, sir.

620
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,580
Without transporters,
we can't beam off the ship,

621
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,640
we can't assist Vulcan,
we can't do our job.

622
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,100
Mr Kirk, Mr Sulu, Engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

623
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,370
You will land on that machine
they've lowered into the atmosphere

624
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,390
that's scrambling our gear.
You'll get inside, you'll disable it,

625
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,960
then you'll beam back to the ship.

626
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,149
Mr Spock, I'm leaving you
in command of the Enterprise.

627
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,790
Once we have transport capability
and communications back up,

628
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,620
you'll contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

629
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,550
And if all else fails, fall back

630
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,590
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

631
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,110
Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.

632
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,520
-What?
-Captain?

633
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,320
Please, I apologise, the complexities
of human pranks escape me.

634
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,620
It's not a prank, Spock.
And I'm not the Captain, you are.

635
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,279
Let's go.

636
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,280
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

637
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,640
Well, ! guess you'll have to come
and get me.

638
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,070
Careful with the ship, Spock,
she's brand new.

639
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,660
Dr Puri, report.

640
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,340
It's McCoy.
Dr Puri was on Deck 6. He's dead.

641
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,250
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

642
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,879
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

643
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,919
Shuttle 37, you're clear forward!

644
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,450
Shuttle 89, U.S.S. Enterprise,
you are clear forward.

645
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,950
Interval check shows
positive and steady.

646
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,600
-You got the charges, right?
-Oh, yeah.

647
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,310
I can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.
Right?

648
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,299
-Yeah.
-Hell, yeah.

649
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,220
Shuttle command, we advise
you activate your shields now.

650
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,050
So what kind of combat training
do you have?

651
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,520
Fencing.

652
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,850
Pre-jump.

653
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,109
Shuttle commander, you are clear
from U.S.S. Enterprise airspace.

654
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,370
Gentlemen, we're approaching
the drop zone.

655
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,210
We have one shot
to land on that platform.

656
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,379
They may have defences,
so pull your chute as late as possible.

657
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,300
Three, two, one.

658
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,170
Remember, the Enterprise
won't be able to beam you back

659
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,750
until you turn off that drill.

660
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,750
Good luck.

661
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,090
Away team is entering
the atmosphere, sir.

662
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,670
Twenty thousand metres.

663
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,330
Approaching the platform
at 5,800 metres.

664
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,049
Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target, 5,000 metres.

665
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,810
Forty-six hundred metres
from the platform.

666
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,310
Forty-five hundred metres to target.

667
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,630
Four thousand metres.

668
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,700
-Three thousand metres.
-Three thousand metres.

669
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,830
-Two thousand metres.
-Pulling chute.

670
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,450
-Two thousand metres!
-Come on, pull your chute, Olson!

671
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,580
No, not yet! Not yet! 1,500 metres!

672
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,020
-Olson, open your chute!
-Olson, pull your chute!

673
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,960
One thousand metres!

674
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,190
No!

675
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,130
Olson!

676
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,630
Olson is gone, sir!

677
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,589
Kirk has landed, sir.

678
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,690
Give me your hand! Come on.

679
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,540
Olson had the charges.

680
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,610
I know.

681
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,770
-What do we do?
-This.

682
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,090
The jamming signal's gone.
Transport abilities are re-established.

683
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,440
-Transporter control is reengaged, sir.
-Chekov, run gravitational sensors.

684
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,150
I want to know
what they are doing to the planet.

685
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,260
Aye, Commander.
Captain. Sorry. Captain.

686
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,440
The drill's been sabotaged, sir,
but we have reached the planet's core.

687
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,930
Launch the red matter.

688
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,150
Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched
something at the planet

689
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,720
through the hole they just drilled.

690
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,990
-Do you copy, Enterprise?
-Yes, sir.

691
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,620
-Analysing data now.
-Transporter is now operational.

692
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,230
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

693
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,390
If my calculations are correct,

694
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,000
they're creating a singularity
that will consume the planet.

695
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,760
They're creating a black hole
at the centre of Vulcan?

696
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,490
-Yes, sir.
-How long does the planet have?

697
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,380
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

698
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,780
Alert Vulcan Command Centre
to signal a planet-wide evacuation,

699
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,279
-all channels, all frequencies.
-Spock, wait!

700
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,030
-Maintain standard orbit.
-Yes, sir.

701
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,070
-Where are you going?
-To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.

702
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,080
They are tasked
with protecting our cultural history.

703
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,190
-My parents will be among them.
-Can't you beam them out?

704
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,590
It is impossible.
They will be in the katric ark.

705
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,400
I must get them myself.

706
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,540
-Chekov, you have the conn.
-Aye.

707
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,350
-Kirk to Enterprise! Beam us out of here!
-Stand by. Locking on your signal.

708
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,530
-Retract the drill. Let's move out.
-Yes, sir. Pull it up!

709
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,450
1 can't lock on to you.
Don't move. Don't move!

710
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,280
-Kirk!
-Sulu!

711
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,780
Sulu!

712
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,120
Hold on!

713
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,069
I got you! Now pull my chute!

714
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,390
Kirk to Enterprise! We're falling
without a chute! Beam us up!

715
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,660
-I'm trying. I can't lock on to your signal.
-Beam us up!

716
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,360
-You're moving too fast.
-Beam us up!

717
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,569
I can do that. I can do that!

718
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,029
-Take the conn!
-Aye, sir.

719
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,230
The black hole's expanding.

720
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,370
We won't reach minimum safe distance
if we don't leave immediately.

721
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,690
Move, move, move, move, move!

722
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,540
I can do that! I can do that!
Move, move, move, move!

723
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,140
Quick, give me manual control!
I can lock on!

724
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,600
Beam us up!

725
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,030
Enterprise, where are you?

726
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,720
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

727
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,810
Now, now, now! Do it now!
Now, now, now, now!

728
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,880
Okay, okay, okay! Hold on! Hold on!
Compensating gravitational pull, and...

729
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,620
Gotcha!

730
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,250
-Thanks.
-No problem.

731
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,990
Clear the pad.
I'm beaming to the surface.

732
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,520
The surface of what?

733
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,970
What, are you going down there?
Are you nuts?

734
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,160
Spock, you can't do that!

735
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,730
-Energise.
-Spock!

736
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,580
-Spock!
-The planet has only seconds left.

737
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,890
We must evacuate.

738
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,080
Mother, now!

739
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,670
-Spock to Enterprise. Get us out now.
-Locking volume.

740
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,790
Don't move. Stay right where you are.

741
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,649
Transport in five, four, three, two...

742
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,350
-Mother!
-I'm losing her!

743
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,340
I'm losing her! I'm losing her!

744
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,430
No! I lost her. I lost her.

745
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,230
Acting Captain's Log, Stardate 2258.42.

746
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,660
We have had no word
from Captain Pike.

747
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,570
! have therefore classified him

748
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,220
a hostage of the war criminal
known as Nero.

749
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,580
Nero, who has destroyed
my home planet

750
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,130
and most of its six billion inhabitants.

751
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,000
While the essence of our culture
has been saved

752
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,960
in the elders
who now reside upon this ship,

753
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,130
J estimate no more than 10,000
have survived.

754
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,509
1! am now a member
of an endangered species.

755
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,440
I'm sorry.

756
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,080
I'm sorry.

757
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,260
I'm so sorry.

758
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,600
What do you need? Tell me.

759
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,810
Tell me.

760
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:12,400
I need everyone
to continue performing admirably.

761
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,500
Okay.

762
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,000
You must have
a lot of questions for me.

763
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,600
I only have one for you.

764
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,090
I need the subspace frequencies
of Starfleet's border protection grids,

765
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,850
specifically those surrounding Earth.

766
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,570
Christopher, answer my question.

767
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,790
No, you answer for the genocide
you just committed

768
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,470
-against a peaceful planet.
-No, I prevented genocide.

769
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,720
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

770
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,860
I chose a life of honest labour

771
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,830
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

772
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,370
l was off planet, doing my job
while your Federation did nothing

773
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,840
and allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

774
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,780
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us!

775
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,779
No, you're confused.

776
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,900
You've been misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

777
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,470
It's out there right now.

778
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,439
You're blaming the Federation
for something that hasn't happened.

779
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,340
It has happened! I watched it happen!

780
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,240
I saw it happen!
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

781
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,130
And when! lost her,
I promised myself retribution.

782
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,990
And for 25 years I planned my revenge
against the Federation,

783
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,910
and forgot what it was like
to live a normal life.

784
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,009
But I did not forget the pain.

785
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,589
It's a pain that every surviving Vulcan
now shares.

786
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,480
My purpose, Christopher,

787
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,930
is to not simply avoid
the destruction of the home that I love,

788
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,750
but to create a Romulus
that exists free of the Federation.

789
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,410
You see, only then
will she be truly saved.

790
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,799
That is why I will destroy
all the remaining Federation planets,

791
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,010
starting with yours.

792
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,250
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

793
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,140
You will give me the frequencies
to disable Earth's defences.

794
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,609
Centaurian slugs.

795
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,810
They latch on to your brain stem

796
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,859
and release a toxin
that will force you to answer.

797
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,759
Frequencies, please, sir.

798
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,540
Christopher Pike,
Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise...

799
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,070
As you wish.

800
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,140
Have you confirmed
that Nero is headed for Earth?

801
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,070
Their trajectory suggests
no other destination, Captain.

802
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,770
-Thank you, Lieutenant.
-Earth may be his next stop,

803
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,580
but we have to assume
every Federation planet's a target.

804
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,230
Out of the chair.

805
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,060
Well, if the Federation is a target,
why didn't they destroy us?

806
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,890
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

807
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,650
That is not it.

808
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,150
He said he wanted me
to see something,

809
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,590
the destruction of my home planet.

810
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,590
How the hell did they do that,
by the way?

811
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,570
I mean, where did the Romulans
get that kind of weaponry?

812
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,420
The engineering comprehension
necessaly

813
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,629
to artificially create a black hole
may suggest an answer.

814
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,080
Such technology
could theoretically be manipulated

815
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,260
to create a tunnel through space-time.

816
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,319
Damn it, man,
I'm a doctor, not a physicist.

817
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,009
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

818
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,840
If you eliminate the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable,

819
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,070
-must be the truth.
-How poetic.

820
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,560
Then what would an angry
future Romulan want with Captain Pike?

821
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,220
As Captain, he does know details
of Starfleet's defences.

822
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,000
What we need to do
is catch up to that ship,

823
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,960
disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

824
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,070
We are technologically outmatched
-
In every way.

825
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,190
A rescue attempt would be illogical.

826
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,870
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake them.

827
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,070
Then what about
assigning engineering crews

828
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,400
-to try and boost our warp yield?
-Remaining crew are repairing

829
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,340
-radiation leaks on the lower decks...
-Okay! All right!

830
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,109
...and damage to subspace
communications, without which

831
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,870
-we cannot contact Starfleet.
-There's got to be some way...

832
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,160
We must gather
with the rest of Starfleet

833
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,990
to balance the terms
of the next engagement.

834
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,580
There won't be a next engagement.

835
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,300
By the time we've gathered,
it'll be too late.

836
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,750
But you say he's from the future,
knows what's gonna happen?

837
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,910
Then the logical thing
is to be unpredictable.

838
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,259
You're assuming that Nero knows
how events are predicted to unfold.

839
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,080
The contrary, Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history,

840
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,850
beginning with the attack
on the U.S.S. Kelvin,

841
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:41,990
culminating in the events of today,

842
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,270
thereby creating
an entire new chain of incidents

843
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,960
that cannot be anticipated
by either party.

844
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,660
An alternate reality.

845
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,770
Precisely.

846
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,890
Whatever our lives might have been,
if the time continuum was disrupted,

847
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,670
our destinies have changed.

848
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,070
Mr Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system, warp factor 3.

849
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,520
Spock, don't do that.

850
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,950
Running back to the rest of the fleet
for a confab is a massive waste of time.

851
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,300
These are the orders issued
by Captain Pike when he left the ship.

852
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,180
He also ordered us
to go back and get him.

853
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,740
Spock, you are Captain now.
You have to make...

854
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,190
l am aware of my responsibilities,
Mr Kirk.

855
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,470
Every second we waste, Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

856
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,490
That is correct, and why
I'm instructing you to accept the fact

857
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,940
-that I alone am in command.
-I will not allow us to go backwards...

858
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:20,689
-Jim, he's the Captain!
-...away from the problem,

859
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,939
-instead of hunting Nero down!
-Security, escort him out.

860
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,270
-Hey!
-Enough, Jim!

861
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:40,719
Get him off this ship.

862
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:02,790
-Computer, where am I?
-Location, Delta Vega.

863
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,990
Class-M planet. Unsafe.

864
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:08,090
There is a Starfleet outpost
14 kilometres to the northwest.

865
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,590
Remain in your pod

866
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,010
-until retrieved by Starfleet authorities.
-You gotta be kidding me.

867
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,890
Stardate 2258.42.

868
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,220
Or 44. Whatever.

869
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,850
Acting Captain Spock
has marooned me on Delta Vega,

870
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,219
in what I believe to be
a violation of Security Protocol 49.09

871
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,730
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a star...

872
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,740
James T. Kirk.

873
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,240
-Excuse me?
-How did you find me?

874
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,120
How do you know my name?

875
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,490
I have been and always shall be
your friend.

876
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,490
-Look, I don't know you.
-l am Spock.

877
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,550
Bullshit.

878
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,019
It is remarkably pleasing
to see you again, old friend.

879
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,650
Especially after the events of today.

880
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,510
Sir, l appreciate
what you did for me today,

881
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,100
but if you were Spock,
you'd know we're not friends. At all.

882
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,740
You hate me.
You marooned me here for mutiny.

883
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,730
-Mutiny?
-Yes.

884
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,690
You are not the captain?

885
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:12,340
No, no, you're the captain.
Pike was taken hostage.

886
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,410
By Nero.

887
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,070
What do you know about him?

888
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,890
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

889
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,040
-Please, allow me. It will be easier.
-What are you doing?

890
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,970
Our minds, one and together.

891
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,990
One hundred twenty-nine years
from now,

892
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,769
a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

893
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,370
That is where I'm from, Jim, the future.

894
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:58,240
A star went supernova,
consuming everything in its path.

895
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,550
! promised the Romulans
that ! would save their planet.

896
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,930
We outfitted our fastest ship.

897
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,630
Using red matter,
! would create a black hole

898
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,650
which would absorb the exploding star.

899
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,990
} was en route,
when the unthinkable happened.

900
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,320
The supernova destroyed Romulus.

901
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,639
! had little time.

902
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,660
! had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.

903
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,309
As I began my return trip,
! was intercepted.

904
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,220
He called himself Nero,
last of the Romulan Empire.

905
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,670
In my attempt to escape, both of us
were pulled into the black hole.

906
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,670
Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.

907
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,780
Nero and his crew spent
the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.

908
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,150
But what was years for Nero

909
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,520
was only seconds for me.

910
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,540
! went through the black hole.

911
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,880
Nero was waiting for me.

912
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,430
He held me responsible
for the loss of his world.

913
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,840
He captured my vessel
and spared my life,

914
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,660
for one reason.

915
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,800
So that ! would know his pain.

916
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,300
He beamed me here
so that I could observe his vengeance.

917
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,599
As he was helpless to save his planet,

918
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,830
! would be helpless to save mine.

919
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,570
Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.

920
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,620
Because ! failed.

921
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,690
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind-meld.

922
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,610
-So you do feel.
-Yes.

923
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,280
Going back in time,
you changed all our lives.

924
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,380
Jim, we must go.

925
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,969
There is a Starfleet outpost
not far from here.

926
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,500
Wait. Where you came from,

927
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,950
did I know my father?

928
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,190
Yes.

929
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,590
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

930
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,320
He proudly lived to see you
become Captain of the Enterprise.

931
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,440
Captain?

932
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,350
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

933
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,640
-Warp 3, sir.
-Course 1-5-1, mark 3.

934
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,250
-Laurentian system, sir.
-Thank you, gentlemen.

935
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,520
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes, Doctor.

936
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,200
lam aware that James Kirk is
a friend of yours.

937
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,980
l recognise that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

938
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,769
Is that a thank-you?

939
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,320
lam simply acknowledging
your difficulties.

940
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,230
Permission to speak freely, sir.

941
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,750
-l welcome it.
-Do you? Okay, then.

942
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,509
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

943
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,950
Are you making a logical choice,
sending Kirk away?

944
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,830
Probably. But the right one?

945
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,349
You know, back home we got a saying,

946
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,790
“If you're gonna ride
in the Kentucky Derby,

947
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,970
“you don't leave your prize stallion
in the stable.”

948
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,400
A curious metaphor, Doctor,

949
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,330
as a Stallion must first be broken
before it can reach its potential.

950
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,850
My God, man, you could at least act
like it was a hard decision!

951
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,280
l intend to assist in the effort

952
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,690
to re-establish communication
with Starfleet.

953
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,349
However, if crew morale is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping,

954
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,410
I will gladly defer
to your medical expertise.

955
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,040
Excuse me.

956
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,669
Green-blooded hobgoblin.

957
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,890
Hello!

958
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,900
What?

959
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,540
You realise how unacceptable this is?

960
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,030
-Fascinating.
-What?

961
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,509
Okay, I'm sure you're just
doing your job,

962
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,270
but could you not have come
a wee bit sooner?

963
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,610
Six months I've been here,

964
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,470
living off Starfleet protein nibs
and the promise of a good meal!

965
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,210
And I know exactly
what's going on here, okay?

966
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,180
Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing.

967
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,089
For something
that was clearly an accident.

968
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,750
-You are Montgomery Scott.
-You know him?

969
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,910
Aye, that's me. You're in the right place.

970
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,910
Unless there's another hardworking,
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

971
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,570
-Me.
-Get aff! Shut up!

972
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,990
You don't eat anything!
You can eat, like, a bean,

973
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,269
and you're done.
I'm talking about food. Real food.

974
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,790
But you're here now, so thank you.
Where is it?

975
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,769
You are, in fact, the Mr Scott

976
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,940
who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming.

977
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,050
That's what I'm talking about.
How do you think I wound up here?

978
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,780
l had a little debate with my instructor

979
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,519
on the issue of relativistic physics
and how it pertains to subspace travel.

980
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,380
He seemed to think that the range of
transporting something like a grapefruit

981
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,180
was limited to about 100 miles.

982
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,719
I told him that I could not only
beam a grapefruit from one planet

983
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,800
to the adjacent planet
in the same system,

984
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,519
which is easy, by the way,

985
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,990
could do it with a life-form.

986
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,940
So, I tested it on Admiral Archer's
prize beagle.

987
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,450
-I know that dog. What happened to it?
-I'll tell you when it reappears.

988
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,540
I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.

989
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,300
What if I told you
that your transwarp theory was correct,

990
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,460
that it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is travelling at warp speed?

991
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,020
I think if that equation had been
discovered, I'd have heard about it.

992
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,980
The reason you haven't heard of it,
Mr Scott,

993
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,670
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

994
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,600
-Are you from the future?
-Yeah, he is. I'm not.

995
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,930
Well, that's brilliant.
Do they still have sandwiches there?

996
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,799
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

997
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,340
Shield emitters are totally banjaxed,
as well as a few other things.

998
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,820
On youse go.

999
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,600
So the Enterprise has had
its maiden voyage, has it?

1000
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,440
She is one well-endowed lady.

1001
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,440
I'd like to get my hands
on her ample nacelles,

1002
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,080
if you'll pardon
the engineering parlance.

1003
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,610
Except, the thing is,
even if I believed you, right,

1004
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,980
where you're from, what I've done,
which I don't, by the way,

1005
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,549
you're still talking about
beaming aboard the Enterprise

1006
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,340
while she's travelling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

1007
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,110
Get off there! It's not a climbing frame.

1008
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,450
The notion of transwarp beaming is like
trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet

1009
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,500
whilst wearing a blindfold,
riding a horse.

1010
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:01,790
What's that?

1011
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,600
Your equation
for achieving transwarp beaming.

1012
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,420
Get out of it.

1013
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,299
Imagine that!

1014
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,220
It never occurred to me to think of space
as the thing that was moving.

1015
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,610
You're coming with us, right?

1016
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,530
-No, Jim. That is not my destiny.
-Your...

1017
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,740
He... The other Spock
is not gonna believe me.

1018
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,019
Only you can explain
what the hell's happened.

1019
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,559
Under no circumstances
can he be made aware of my existence.

1020
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:31,870
You must promise me this.

1021
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,710
You're telling me I can't tell you
that I'm following your own orders?

1022
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:38,180
-Why not? What happens?
-Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

1023
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,660
To stop Nero, you alone
must take command of your ship.

1024
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:44,760
-How? Over your dead body?
-Preferably not.

1025
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,730
However, there is
Starfleet Regulation 619.

1026
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,830
Six-one-nine states
that any command officer

1027
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,880
who's emotionally compromised
by the mission at hand

1028
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,000
must resign said command.

1029
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,839
So, you're saying that I have
to emotionally compromise you guys.

1030
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,929
Jim, I just lost my planet.

1031
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,889
I can tell you,
lam emotionally compromised.

1032
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,470
What you must do is get me to show it.

1033
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,860
Aye, then, laddie.
Live or die. Let's get this over with.

1034
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,080
No, go. You cannae come with me.
Go on.

1035
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,470
You know, coming back in time,
changing history,

1036
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,509
that's cheating.

1037
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,730
A trick I learned from an old friend.

1038
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,800
Live long and prosper.

1039
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,669
Mr Scott!

1040
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,690
Mr Scott, can you hear me?

1041
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,639
Hold on a second!

1042
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,510
Oh, no.

1043
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,450
Don't worry, I...

1044
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:39,870
No. No!

1045
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,140
Turbine release vaive activated.

1046
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,940
You all right? You all right?

1047
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,309
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

1048
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,790
Captain Spock! Detecting unauthorised
access to Water Turbine Control Board.

1049
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,540
Bring up the video.

1050
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,120
Security, seal the Engineering Deck.

1051
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,820
We have intruders in Turbine Section 3.

1052
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,219
Set phasers to stun.

1053
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,140
-Halt!
-No, no!

1054
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,470
Come with me, cupcake!

1055
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,630
-Who are you?
-I'm with him.

1056
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,800
-He's with me.
-We are travelling at warp speed.

1057
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,490
How did you manage
to beam aboard this ship?

1058
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,810
Well, you're the genius,
you figure it out.

1059
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,670
As acting captain of this vessel,
l order you to answer the question.

1060
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,680
Well, I'm not telling, Acting Captain.

1061
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,390
What, did...

1062
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,200
That doesn't frustrate you, does it?
My lack of cooperation?

1063
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,810
-That doesn't make you angry.
-Are you a member of Starfleet?

1064
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,200
I... Yes. Can I get a towel, please?

1065
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,420
Under penalty of court martial,
l order you to explain to me

1066
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,720
how you were able to beam
aboard this ship while moving at warp.

1067
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,309
-Well...
-Don't answer him.

1068
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,000
You will answer me.

1069
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,830
-I'd rather not take sides.
-What is it with you, Spock?

1070
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,070
Your planet was just destroyed,
your mother murdered,

1071
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,070
-and you're not even upset.
-If you are presuming

1072
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,010
that these experiences in any way
impede my ability to command this ship,

1073
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,910
-you are mistaken.
-And yet, you are the one

1074
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,590
who said fear was necessary
for command.

1075
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,880
I mean, did you see his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1076
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,510
-Yes, of course I did.
-So are you afraid or aren't you?

1077
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,730
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

1078
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,940
-Then why don't you stop me?
-Step away from me, Mr Kirk.

1079
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,050
What is it like not to feel anger?
Or heartbreak?

1080
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,019
Or the need to stop at nothing

1081
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,920
to avenge the death
of the woman who gave birth to you?

1082
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,889
-Back away from me.
-You feel nothing!

1083
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,019
It must not even compute for you.

1084
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,910
You never loved her!

1085
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,019
Spock!

1086
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,260
Doctor, 1 am no longer fit for duty.

1087
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,250
I hereby relinquish my command,

1088
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:19,930
based on the fact that have been
emotionally compromised.

1089
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,080
Please note the time and date
in the ship's log.

1090
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,300
I like this ship! You know, it's exciting!

1091
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,620
Well, congratulations, Jim.

1092
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:59,530
Now we've got no captain, and
no goddamn first officer to replace him.

1093
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,019
Yeah, we do.

1094
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,890
-What?
-Pike made him first officer.

1095
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,910
-You gotta be kidding me.
-Thanks for the support.

1096
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,030
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, Captain.

1097
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,349
So dol.

1098
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,950
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.
This is James Kirk.

1099
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,310
Mr Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.

1100
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,080
1 know you were all expecting
to regroup with the fleet,

1101
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,560
but I'm ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.

1102
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,660
! want all departments at battle stations
and ready in 10 minutes.

1103
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,559
Either we're going down or they are.

1104
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,570
Kirk out.

1105
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,460
Speak your mind, Spock.

1106
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:58,919
That would be unwise.

1107
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,640
What is necessary is never unwise.

1108
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:07,019
lam as conflicted
as I once was as a child.

1109
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,630
You will always be a child of two worlds.

1110
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,250
l am grateful for this.

1111
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,559
And for you.

1112
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,340
I feel anger
for the one who took Mother's life.

1113
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,900
An anger I cannot control.

1114
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,410
I believe that she would say,

1115
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,809
"Do not try to.”

1116
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:44,420
You asked me once
why I married your mother.

1117
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,700
I married her because I loved her.

1118
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,120
Whatever the case, we need
to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1119
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,550
We can't just go in there guns blazing,
Jim, not with their technology.

1120
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,740
I'm telling you, the math doesn't support
what you're suggesting.

1121
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,870
-Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk!
-Yes, Mr Chekov. What is it?

1122
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,990
Based on the Narada’s course
from Vulcan,

1123
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,059
I have projected that Nero
will travel past Saturn.

1124
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,290
Like you said, we need to stay invisible
to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1125
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,720
If Mr Scott can get us to warp factor 4,

1126
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:23,010
and if we drop out of warp behind
one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,

1127
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,850
the magnetic distortion
from the planet's rings

1128
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,099
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1129
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,440
From there,
as long as the drill is not actuated,

1130
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,500
-we can beam aboard the enemy ship.
-Aye, that might work.

1131
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,890
Wait a minute, kid. How old are you?

1132
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,440
-Seventeen, sir.
-Oh, good, he's 17.

1133
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,240
Doctor.

1134
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:43,400
Mr Chekov is correct.
I can confirm his telemetry.

1135
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,800
If Mr Sulu is able
to manoeuvre us into position,

1136
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,440
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device

1137
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,160
and, if possible,
bring back Captain Pike.

1138
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,840
I won't allow you to do that, Mr Spock.

1139
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,800
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1140
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,960
Our cultural similarities
will make it easier for me

1141
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,950
to access the ship's computer
to locate the device.

1142
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,280
Also, my mother was human,

1143
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,130
which makes Earth
the only home I have left.

1144
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,230
Then I'm coming with you.

1145
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,970
I would cite Regulation,
but I know you will simply ignore it.

1146
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,470
See? We are
getting to know each other.

1147
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,099
Prepare the drill.

1148
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:01,470
All stop in three, two, one.

1149
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,610
Give me one-quarter impulse burst
for five seconds.

1150
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,580
I'll do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1151
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,770
-Aye.
-Fire.

1152
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,480
Transporter Room.
We are in position above Titan.

1153
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,950
Really? Fine job, Mr Sulu. Well done.

1154
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,549
-How are we, Scotty?
-Unbelievably, sir, the ship is in position.

1155
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,830
Whatever happens, Mr Sulu,

1156
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,599
if you think you have
the tactical advantage,

1157
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,900
you fire on that ship, even if we're still
onboard. That's an order.

1158
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:02,780
Yes, sir.

1159
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,370
Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise
when we're ready to be beamed back.

1160
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:07,970
Good luck.

1161
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,980
-I will be back.
-You better be.

1162
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,570
-I'll be monitoring your frequency.
-Thank you, Nyota.

1163
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,390
-So her first name's Nyota?
-Il have no comment on the matter.

1164
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,380
Okey-dokey, then,
if there's any common sense

1165
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,760
in the design of the enemy ship,

1166
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,650
I should be putting you
somewhere in the Cargo Bay.

1167
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,240
-Shouldn't be a soul in sight.
-Energise.

1168
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,080
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

1169
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,510
-One of them is Vulcan.
-No.

1170
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,230
Ayel!

1171
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:01,530
I'll cover you.

1172
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,730
-Are you certain?
-Yeah, I got you.

1173
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,770
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device.

1174
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,360
And Captain Pike.

1175
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,370
Move!

1176
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,750
They have activated the drill.

1177
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,519
Communication and transport
are inoperative.

1178
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,030
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1179
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,679
Otherwise we won't be able
to beam them back.

1180
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,290
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1181
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,080
l foresee a complication.

1182
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,530
The design of their ship is far
more advanced than I had anticipated.

1183
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,450
Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.

1184
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,670
Weicome back, Ambassador Spock.

1185
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,300
Wow, that's weird.

1186
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,940
Computer, what is
your manufacturing origin?

1187
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:39,120
Stardate 2387. Commissioned
by the Vulcan Science Academy.

1188
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,610
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1189
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,720
You're gonna be able
to fly this thing, right?

1190
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,110
Something tells me I already have.

1191
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,290
-Good luck.
-Jim.

1192
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,410
The statistical likelihood that our plan
will succeed is less than 4.3%.

1193
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,630
-It'll work.
-In the event that I do not return,

1194
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,640
-please tell Lieutenant Uhura...
-Spock!

1195
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,400
It'll work.

1196
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,260
Fascinating.

1197
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:22,400
Start-up sequence initiated.

1198
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,830
Nero, order your men to disable the drill
or I will...

1199
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,809
I know your face from Earth's history.

1200
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:06,379
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1201
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,880
He went on to captain
the U.S.S. Enterprise.

1202
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:10,360
But that was another life.

1203
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:13,880
A life I will deprive you of,
just like I did your father.

1204
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:49,100
Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship has been
taken. The drill has been destroyed.

1205
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,870
Spock!

1206
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,980
Spock!

1207
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,269
-Open a channel.
-Yes, sir!

1208
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:16,650
Spock. I knew I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

1209
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,990
I hereby confiscate
this illegally obtained ship

1210
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,259
and order you to surrender your vessel.

1211
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,280
-No terms. No deals.
-That ship, take it out.

1212
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,610
Sir, if you ignite the red matter,

1213
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,070
-you'll destroy...
-I want Spock dead now!

1214
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,100
-He went to warp, sir.
-Go after him!

1215
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,450
Yes, sir!

1216
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:15,080
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1217
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,550
-I can't...
-You can't what?

1218
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,220
You can't even speak.

1219
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,200
-What?
-I got your gun.

1220
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,059
What's he doing?

1221
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:55,060
Ambassador Spock,
you are on a collision course.

1222
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:56,990
Fire everything!

1223
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:07,740
Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.

1224
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:09,509
Understood.

1225
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,020
Captain, I've picked up another ship!

1226
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,750
-What are you doing here?
-Just following orders.

1227
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,099
Enterprise, now!

1228
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:25,150
Nice timing, Scotty!

1229
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:29,570
I've never beamed three people
from two targets onto one pad before!

1230
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:31,700
-Jim!
-Bones!

1231
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,370
I got him.

1232
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:36,550
That was pretty good!

1233
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,660
Captain, the enemy ship is losing
power! Their shields are down, sir.

1234
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:42,309
-Hail them now.
-Aye.

1235
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:18,620
This is Captain James T. Kirk
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

1236
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,519
Your ship is compromised.

1237
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,860
Too close to the singularity
to survive without assistance,

1238
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,780
which we are willing to provide.

1239
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,230
-Captain, what are you doing?
-Showing them compassion

1240
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,040
may be the only way
to earn peace with Romulus.

1241
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,880
It's logic, Spock.
I thought you'd like that.

1242
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,599
No, not really. Not this time.

1243
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,790
! would rather suffer the end of Romulus
a thousand times.

1244
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,980
! would rather die in agony
than accept assistance from you.

1245
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,070
You got it.

1246
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,780
-Arm phasers. Fire everything we've got.
-Yes, sir.

1247
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:36,370
-Sulu, let's go home.
-Yes, sir!

1248
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,240
-Why aren't we at warp?
-We are, sir.

1249
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:51,420
Kirk to Engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1250
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:52,880
You bet your ass, Captain!

1251
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,280
Captain, we're caught in the gravity well!
It's got us!

1252
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,550
-Go to maximum warp! Push it!
-I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!

1253
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,150
All she's got isn't good enough!

1254
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,240
-What else you got?
-Okay, if we eject the core and detonate,

1255
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,800
the blast could be enough
to push us away.

1256
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,019
I cannae promise anything, though!

1257
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:22,870
Do it, do it, do it!

1258
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,740
-Clear the area! Go!
-Yes, sir!

1259
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,250
Father!

1260
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,950
lam not our father.

1261
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,410
There are so few Vulcans left.
We cannot afford to ignore each other.

1262
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:16,940
Then why did you send Kirk aboard

1263
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,769
when you alone
could have explained the truth?

1264
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,990
Because you needed each other.
I could not deprive you

1265
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,730
of the revelation of all
that you could accomplish together,

1266
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:29,470
of a friendship that will define you both
in ways you cannot yet realise.

1267
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,710
How did you persuade him
to keep your secret?

1268
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:36,880
He inferred that universe-ending
paradoxes would ensue

1269
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,389
-should he break his promise.
-You lied.

1270
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,860
I... lL implied.

1271
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,320
-A gamble.
-An act of faith.

1272
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:49,300
One I hope that you'll repeat
in the future in Starfleet.

1273
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,130
In the face of extinction, it is only logical

1274
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,679
l resign my Starfleet commission
and help rebuild our race.

1275
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:56,010
And yet,
you can be in two places at once.

1276
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,840
l urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1277
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,210
I have already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1278
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,960
Spock, in this case, do yourself a favour.

1279
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,580
Put aside logic. Do what feels right.

1280
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:21,720
Since my customary farewell
would appear oddly self-serving,

1281
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:23,290
I shall simply say

1282
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:25,669
good luck.

1283
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:39,400
This assembly calls Captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1284
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,320
Your inspirational valour and
supreme dedication to your comrades

1285
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:46,050
is in keeping with
the highest traditions of service,

1286
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:50,509
and reflect utmost credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1287
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,570
It is my honour to award you
with this commendation.

1288
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,080
By Starfleet Order 28455,

1289
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:04,839
you are hereby directed to report
to Admiral Pike, U.S.S. Enterprise,

1290
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:06,839
for duty as his relief.

1291
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,040
I relieve you, sir.

1292
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,180
lam relieved.

1293
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:23,290
-Thank you, sir.
-Congratulations, Captain.

1294
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,019
Your father would be proud.

1295
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:56,879
Thrusters on full.

1296
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,990
Manoeuvring thrusters and
impulse engines at your command, sir.

1297
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,650
Weapons systems and shields
on standby.

1298
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,250
Dock Control reports ready, Captain.

1299
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:12,270
Bones! Buckle up.

1300
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:18,220
Scotty, how we doing?

1301
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:20,730
Dilithium chamber's
at maximum, Captain.

1302
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:23,230
Get down!

1303
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,809
Mr Sulu, prepare to engage thrusters.

1304
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,070
Permission to come aboard, Captain.

1305
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:35,190
Permission granted.

1306
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:37,870
As you have yet to select a first officer,

1307
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,800
respectfully 1 would like to submit
my candidacy.

1308
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,560
Should you desire,
I can provide character references.

1309
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,330
It would be my honour, Commander.

1310
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:53,190
Manoeuvring thrusters, Mr Sulu.

1311
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:56,730
Thrusters on standby.

1312
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,970
-Take us out.
-Aye-aye, Captain.

1313
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,740
Space, the final frontier.

1314
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:11,790
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

1315
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:16,389
Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,

1316
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:20,790
to seek out new life-forms
and new civilizations,

1317
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:25,500
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.
