1
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,146
Money, money, money. Hey!

2
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,685
You got a date with justice,
One-Eyed Bart.

3
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,681
Too bad, Sheriff. I'm a married man.

4
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,068
One-Eyed Betty!

5
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,539
I think you dropped something, mister.

6
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,464
-Jessie?
-Give it up, Bart!

7
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,063
You've reached the end of the line!

8
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,215
l always wanted to go out with a bang!

9
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,724
-Oh, no!
-The orphans!

10
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,501
Hate to leave early,
but our ride is here.

11
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,522
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

12
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,275
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

13
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,166
Hold him steady!

14
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:33,936
Woody, hurry!

15
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,409
No!

16
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,065
Glad I could catch the train!

17
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,391
Now let's catch some criminals.

18
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,391
To infinity and beyond!

19
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:12,472
To infinity and beyond!

20
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,692
Reach for the sky.

21
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,154
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

22
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,162
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

23
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,890
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

24
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,267
Evil Dr. Pork Chop!

25
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,220
That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork Chop to you.

26
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,732
“Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge.”

27
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,674
“Woody, no. It'll kill you." "Just do it!"

28
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,157
“You're going to jail, Bart.”
“Watch out!"

29
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:10,613
Mom!

30
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,454
No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I'm not here.

31
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:14,844
Oh, no, Molly!

32
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,331
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.

33
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,255
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!

34
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,438
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?

35
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,023
Come on.
Say "Happy birthday” to Molly.

36
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,856
-Happy birthday!
-Charming.

37
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,642
Happy birthday!

38
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,458
-Look how tall you're getting.
-Yeah!

39
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,755
“IL came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"

40
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,548
“Got it, Woody.”

41
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,316
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

42
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,621
“Good work, Buzz."

43
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,468
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.

44
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,784
Wait! I can't find my other eye.

45
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,402
-All right, whose foot's in my face?
-It's mine. Give it back.

46
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,282
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

47
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,671
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?

48
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,806
Yes. No. 1 mean, why would I mind
squeezing next to you?

49
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,082
Is it hot in here?

50
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,150
Here they come!

51
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:45,905
Sarge, you got it?

52
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,339
Mission accomplished.

53
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,597
Hooray!

54
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,780
Careful. Careful!

55
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,141
All right, guys. We got one shot
at this. Everyone ready?

56
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,167
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!

57
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,399
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.

58
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,524
Target is on approach.

59
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,923
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.

60
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,718
Hello?

61
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,070
Hello? Anyone there?

62
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,953
Molly, stay out of my room!

63
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,102
I wasn't in your room.

64
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,164
Then who was messing with my stuff?

65
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,729
It wasn't me.

66
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,277
Well, that went well.

67
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,222
He held me! He actually held me!

68
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,436
This is just sad.

69
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,825
Who we kiddin’?
The kid's 17 years old.

70
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,827
We ain't ever gettin’ played with.

71
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,293
Guys, hey, hold up.

72
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,928
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!

73
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,317
Not again!

74
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,325
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.

75
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,905
We are gathered, Woody.

76
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,441
Okay. First off,

77
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,329
we all knew Operation Playtime
was a long shot.

78
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,150
More like a misfire.

79
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,868
But we've always said this job isn't
about getting played with. It's about...

80
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,285
Being there for Andy. We know.

81
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,957
But we can try again! Right?

82
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,264
I'm callin’ it, guys.
We're closing up shop.

83
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,707
What?

84
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,975
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.

85
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,602
We're going into attic mode, folks.

86
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,504
Keep your accessories
with you at all times.

87
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,459
Spare parts, batteries, anything
you need for an orderly transition.

88
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,032
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!

89
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,909
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.

90
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,229
Yeah, but now it's here.

91
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,561
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...

92
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,113
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?

93
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,639
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.

94
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,895
-Moving on?
-You're going AWOL?

95
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,698
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.

96
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,047
And let's face it,
when the trash bags come out,

97
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,853
we army guys are the first to go.

98
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,411
-Trash bags?
-Who said anything about trash bags?

99
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,444
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck, folks.

100
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,843
You're gonna need it.

101
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,654
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

102
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,139
-We're getting thrown away?
-No. No one's getting thrown away.

103
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,589
How do you know?

104
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,587
-We're being abandoned!
-We'll be fine, Jessie.

105
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,022
-So why did Sarge leave?
-Should we leave?

106
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,220
-I thought we were goin’ to the attic.
-I hate all this uncertainty!

107
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,444
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!

108
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,153
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.

109
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,590
I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way.

110
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,315
-Wheezy and Etch and...
-Bo Peep?

111
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,776
Yeah. Even Bo.

112
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,075
All good toys
who've gone on to new owners.

113
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,722
But through every yard sale, every
spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!

114
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,333
He must care about us,
or we wouldn't be here.

115
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,990
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm...

116
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,694
-And we'll all be together.
-Exactly!

117
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,693
There's games up there,
and books, and...

118
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,628
-The racecar track!
-The racecar track. Thank you!

119
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,048
-And the old TV.
-There you go, the old TV.

120
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,188
And those guys from the Christmas
decorations box. They're fun, right?

121
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,026
Yeah.

122
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,487
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.

123
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,254
And he'll play with us then, right?

124
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,160
We'll always be there for him.

125
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,326
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready,

126
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,949
and go out on a high note.

127
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,865
I'd better find my other eye.

128
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,910
Where'd you leave it this time?

129
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,939
Someplace dark. And dusty.

130
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,378
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on eBay.

131
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,049
Don't worry. Andy's gonna
take care of us. I guarantee it!

132
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,351
You guarantee it, huh?

133
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,316
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?

134
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,117
Well, whatever happens,
at least we'll all be together.

135
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,594
For infinity and beyond.

136
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,598
-Can I have your stereo?
-No.

137
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,736
-Why not?
-'Cause I'm taking it with me.

138
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,967
-Can I have your computer?
-No.

139
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,265
-Your video games?
-Forget it, Molly.

140
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,164
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.

141
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,609
Anything you're not taking to college
either goes in the attic, or it's trash.

142
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,760
-Mom, I'm not leaving till Friday.
-Come on. It's garbage day.

143
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,800
-Mom.
-Look, it's simple.

144
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,901
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.

145
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,695
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.

146
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,256
Why do you still have these toys?

147
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,371
Molly, out of my room!

148
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,126
Three more days and it's mine!

149
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,545
Molly, you're not off the hook either.

150
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,517
You have more toys
than you know what to do with.

151
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,786
Some of them could make
other kids really happy.

152
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,098
What kids?

153
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,772
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.

154
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,411
What's daycare?

155
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,667
-Mom.
-No buts.

156
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,135
You choose the toys you want to
donate, I'll drop them off at Sunnyside.

157
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,966
Poor Barbie.

158
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,341
I get the Corvette.

159
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,739
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.

160
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:49,985
Like what?

161
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,872
Like what are you gonna do
with these toys?

162
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,405
Should we donate them
to Sunnyside?

163
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,193
-No.
-Maybe sell them online?

164
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,148
Mom, no one's gonna want
those old toys.

165
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,244
They're junk.

166
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,002
Fine. You have till Friday.

167
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,623
Anything that's not packed for college
or in the attic

168
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,680
-is getting thrown out.
-Whatever you say, Mom.

169
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,372
-What's happening?
-We're getting thrown out, you idiot.

170
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,558
That's what's happening.

171
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,810
-You need a hand?
-I got it.

172
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,325
Here.

173
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,113
So, you gonna miss me
when I'm gone?

174
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,508
-If l say no, do I still get your room?
-Nope.

175
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,865
Then, yes, I'll miss you.

176
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:26,915
Then, yes, I'll miss you.

177
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,406
I can't breathe!

178
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,688
-This can't be happening!
-Quiet! What's that sound?

179
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,011
Andy!

180
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,964
That's not trash. That's not trash!

181
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,221
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

182
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,567
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!

183
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,329
Okay, boy. To the curb!

184
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,075
No, Buster! No!

185
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,906
Get up. Buster!

186
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,917
-We're on the curb!
-l knew it would come to this!

187
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,586
Pull, everyone! Pull!

188
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,958
-It won't rip!
-Forget it!

189
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,589
It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene!

190
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,003
There's gotta be a way out!

191
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,646
Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

192
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,359
Point. Point. Point!

193
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,421
Push! Push!

194
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,998
I can hear the garbage truck!

195
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,834
It's getting closer.

196
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,721
Buzz! Jessie!

197
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,858
-Andy threw us out.
-Like we were garbage.

198
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,644
-Junk. He called us junk.
-How could he?

199
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,761
This doesn't make any sense.

200
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,086
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.

201
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,730
-Sarge was right.
-Yeah, and Woody was wrong.

202
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,371
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

203
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,251
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.

204
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,050
-Should we be hysterical?
-No!

205
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,882
-Yes!
-Maybe! But not right now!

206
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,415
Fellas, ! know what to do.

207
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,543
What the heck?

208
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,282
-We should've done this years ago.
-Jessie, wait. What about Woody?

209
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,517
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.

210
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,533
Now we need to go!

211
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,527
You're right. Come on.

212
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,899
-Buzz?
-Woody!

213
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,847
What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

214
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,057
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.

215
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,446
We're going to daycare!

216
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,047
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?

217
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,930
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.

218
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,418
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.

219
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,415
Attic? So how did we
end up on the curb?

220
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,053
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.

221
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,376
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.

222
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,114
And called us junk!

223
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,174
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.

224
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,320
Sure thing, college boy!

225
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,920
Andy's moving on, Woody.
It's time we did the same.

226
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,181
Andy's moving on, Woody.
It's time we did the same.

227
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,521
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

228
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,563
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.

229
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,739
Woody, wait. We need to figure out
what's best for everyone.

230
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,212
Great. Great! It's gonna take us
forever to get back here.

231
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,940
It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.

232
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:44,426
Well, Molly and I have been
growing apart for years.

233
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,841
It's just... 1 can't believe
she would throw me away!

234
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,186
-Welcome to the club, toots.
-Okay, everyone, listen up.

235
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,788
We can get back to Andy's,
but we gotta move fast.

236
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,691
We'll hide under the seats
till we get back home.

237
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,342
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.

238
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,628
Andy doesn't want us anymore.

239
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,982
He was putting you in the attic!

240
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,091
He left us on the curb!

241
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,843
-All right, calm down! Both of you!
-Okay, fine. Fine.

242
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,679
Just wait till you see
what daycare’'s like.

243
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,141
-Why? What's it like?
-Daycare is a sad, lonely place

244
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,435
for washed-up old toys
who have no owners.

245
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,395
-Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
-You'll see.

246
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,062
As soon as we get to daycare,
you'll be begging to go home.

247
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,678
Can anyone see anything?

248
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,713
-There's a playground!
-Wow!

249
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,779
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!

250
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,897
So much for sad and lonely, huh?

251
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,213
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.

252
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,228
Perspective? This place is perfect.

253
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,560
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.

254
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:55,701
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.

255
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,845
-Hey there!
-Wow!

256
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,567
Haven't seen you in ages.

257
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,947
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.

258
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,705
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.

259
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,696
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.

260
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,975
-Say hi, sweetie.
-Hi.

261
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,273
Hey, how are your kids?
Molly and Andy?

262
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,485
Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.

263
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,351
-What?
-Can you believe it?

264
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,751
-You sure they won't miss these?
-No, they never get played with.

265
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,558
-You see any kids?
-Where is she taking us?

266
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:26,639
-You see any kids?
-Where is she taking us?

267
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:35,654
-Look!
-Wow!

268
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,098
What? What is it?

269
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,781
No, no, no.

270
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,912
What's the matter with you?

271
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,790
I can't see!

272
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,498
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!

273
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,023
-So now what do we do?
-We go back to Andy's.

274
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,821
-Anyone see an exit?
-Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.

275
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,096
Careful. These toys might be jealous
of new arrivals.

276
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:05,117
Careful. These toys might be jealous
of new arrivals.

277
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,131
-I want to see!
-Hey!

278
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,355
-Rex!
-It's my turn!

279
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,185
New toys!

280
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,322
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.

281
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,242
Buzz Lightyear at your service.

282
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,659
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

283
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,982
Thank you. May I?

284
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,514
The claw!

285
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:48,156
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.

286
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:52,715
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I'm Lots-o'-Huggin’ Bear.

287
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,559
But please call me Lotso.

288
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,555
Buzz Lightyear. We come in...

289
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,504
First thing you gotta know about me,
I'm a hugger.

290
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,465
Look at you all. You've been through
a lot today, haven't ya?

291
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,385
It's been horrible.

292
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,303
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.

293
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,832
We been dumped, donated,
yard-saled, secondhanded

294
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,235
and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait,

295
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,866
you'll find being donated was the
best thing that ever happened to ya.

296
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:25,271
Mr. Lotso, do toys here
get played with every day?

297
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,165
All day long. Five days a week.

298
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,217
But what happens
when the kids grow up?

299
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,099
Well, now, I'll tell ya.

300
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:35,257
When the kids get old,
-
hew ones come In.

301
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,894
When they get old,
new ones replace them.

302
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:42,694
You'll never be outgrown or neglected,
never abandoned or forgotten.

303
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,379
No owners means no heartbreak.

304
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,357
-It's a miracle.
-And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

305
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,131
Because we're Andy's toys!

306
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,014
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

307
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,024
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.

308
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,318
-Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
-Now, let's get you all settled in.

309
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:05,454
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!

310
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,130
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.

311
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,405
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

312
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,048
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.

313
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,694
Folks, if you want to step
right this way...

314
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,088
Hi, I'm Ken.

315
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,163
Barbie. Have we ever met?

316
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,017
I would've remembered.

317
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,718
-Love your legwarmers.
-Nice ascot.

318
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,799
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.

319
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,831
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.

320
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:50,391
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

321
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,253
-What a nice bear.
-And he smells like strawberries.

322
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,468
Folks, if l can share,
here at Sunnyside, we've got,

323
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,544
well, just about anything
a toy could ask for.

324
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,423
Spare parts, superglue,

325
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,731
and enough fresh batteries
to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.

326
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,302
-Think you're gettin’ old?
-Wow.

327
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,919
Well, stop your worryin’.

328
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,695
Our repair spa will keep you stuffed,
puffed, and lightly buffed.

329
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,861
And this, well, this is where I live.

330
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,687
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.

331
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,113
And a whole room
just for trying on clothes.

332
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,054
You have everything!

333
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,923
Everything except
someone to share it with.

334
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:36,114
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me. Here we are.

335
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,472
Well, thank you, Big Baby.

336
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,484
Why don't you come meet
our new friends?

337
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,337
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together, me and him.

338
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,754
Abandoned by the same owner.

339
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,697
But we don't need owners
at Sunnyside.

340
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,963
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

341
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,273
We control our own destiny.

342
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,365
Watch out for puddles.

343
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,904
And here's where
you folks'Il be stayin’.

344
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,977
The Caterpillar Room.

345
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,277
-Look at this place.
-Wow!

346
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,359
Holy moly guacamole.

347
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,001
Jackpot, baby.

348
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,906
-Whoa, puppy!
-Hello.

349
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,051
-Hello.
-Hello.

350
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,771
It's so beautiful!

351
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,995
What the... Hey, little guy.

352
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,572
How long's it been
since you all got played with?

353
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:29,831
It's been years.

354
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,398
Well, just you wait. In a few minutes,
that bell's gonna ring,

355
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,158
Well, just you wait. In a few minutes,
that bell's gonna ring,

356
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,826
and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreamin’ of.

357
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,759
Play! Real play! I can't wait!

358
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,725
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be headin’ back.

359
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,925
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.

360
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,177
-Thank you.
-Take care, pinky.

361
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,752
-Goodbye, Mr. Lotso. Thank you.
-Thank you, buddy boy.

362
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,797
-Will l see you again?
-I'll see you tonight

363
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,572
in my dreams.

364
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:54,972
Ken, let's get a move on.

365
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,458
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

366
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,430
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.

367
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,308
Heck, you don't know me
from G.I. Joe,

368
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,437
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...

369
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,756
-Made for each other.
-...made for each other.

370
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,656
-Yay!
-Yes.

371
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,541
-Ken?
-Coming, Lotso.

372
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,591
This is so exciting!

373
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,779
Sounds like kids to me.

374
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,540
Sounds like kids to me.

375
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,768
I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?

376
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,595
How many you reckon are out there?

377
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,406
They sound so sweet.

378
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,995
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

379
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,668
But we need to go home.

380
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,930
We can have
a whole new life here, Woody.

381
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,956
A chance to make kids happy again.

382
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,772
-Why don't you stay?
-Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.

383
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,259
-Come on, Woodster!
-You'll get played with.

384
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,440
-I can't. No.
-Stay here.

385
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,408
-You can make a new kid happy.
-No, no. Guys, really. No!

386
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,644
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!

387
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:02,705
And if he wants us at college,
or in the attic,

388
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,682
well, then, our job is
to be there for him.

389
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,261
Now, I'm going home.

390
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,249
Anyone who wants to join me
is welcome. Come on, Buzz.

391
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:16,631
Buzz?

392
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,555
Our mission with Andy
is complete, Woody.

393
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,404
What?

394
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,422
And what's important now
is we stay together.

395
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,527
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

396
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,154
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.

397
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,600
Whose name is written there?

398
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,666
Maybe Andy doesn't
care about us anymore.

399
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,579
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!

400
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,452
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.

401
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,400
You can't just turn your back
on him now!

402
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:47,329
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!

403
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,502
Okay, fine. Perfect.

404
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:56,008
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

405
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:06,044
So this is it?
After all we've been through.

406
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,555
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.

407
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,874
Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"

408
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,195
Look,

409
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,770
I don't want you left alone
in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

410
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:44,612
Bonnie?

411
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,540
Bonnie?

412
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,716
I gotta go.

413
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,806
Bonnie, you in here?

414
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,030
Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.

415
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,333
What... What the heck?

416
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,350
Now, that's better.

417
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,959
-Bonnie!
-Bluebells, cockleshells...

418
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,947
There you are. Come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

419
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,105
No, no, no, no!

420
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,601
Reach for the sky!

421
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:22,878
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...

422
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,938
You're my favorite deputy.

423
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,435
-Bonnie!
-Coming!

424
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,453
Great.

425
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,483
It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.

426
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:56,212
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.

427
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,898
He's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.

428
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,747
Toys are for playtime.

429
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,719
Speaking of playtime,
they're lining up out there!

430
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:05,856
-How many?
-There must be dozens.

431
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,241
I can hardly wait!

432
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,722
Places, everyone!

433
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,375
At last! I'm gonna get played with!

434
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,254
-Rex?
-Come to papa.

435
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,735
There's a snake in my boot.

436
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:29,751
I'd like to join your posse, boys,
but first I'm gonna sing a little song.

437
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,225
A sheriff!

438
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,715
Move over, Mr. Pricklepants.

439
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,352
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?

440
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:43,134
It's good for you. But don't drink
too much, or you'll have to...

441
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,661
Be right back!

442
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,675
Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.

443
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:51,388
Can you tell me where I am?

444
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,926
The guy's just asking a question.

445
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,358
Well, excuse me.
I'm trying to stay in character.

446
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,466
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.

447
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,199
Hello, I'm Trixie.

448
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,508
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
I don't know where I am.

449
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,754
We're either in a café in Paris
or a coffee shop in New Jersey.

450
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,934
I'm pretty sure
] just came back from the doctor

451
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:12,888
with life-changing news.

452
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,027
We do a lot of improv here. Just
stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.

453
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,151
-No, no, no, no. I...
-Who wants lunch?

454
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,949
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.

455
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,293
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

456
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,737
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?

457
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,738
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!

458
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,130
“I Know where to hide."

459
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,054
She'll never find us in here.

460
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,481
What's wrong?

461
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,024
She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

462
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,991
-You're doing great!
-Are you classically-trained?

463
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,861
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here!

464
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,366
There is no way out.

465
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:04,972
Just kidding. Door's right over there.

466
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,895
Well, cowboy, you just
jumped right in, didn't ya? I'm Dolly.

467
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,483
-Woody.
-Woody?

468
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,248
Really? You're gonna stick with that?

469
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,823
‘Cause now's your chance
to change it, new room and all.

470
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,679
That's coming from a doll
named Dolly.

471
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:19,205
-Who's the new guy?
-Are you a real cowboy?

472
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,534
-Well, actually...
-'Course he's not, pea brain.

473
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,696
-He don't even have a hat.
-I do too have... My hat!

474
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,123
-Told ya.
-l found a spaceship!

475
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,649
Showtime.

476
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,033
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.

477
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,559
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.

478
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,034
Three, two, one, blastoff!

479
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,930
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.

480
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,363
I got a kink in my slink.

481
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,389
My tail! Where's my tail?

482
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,210
Someone need a hand?

483
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,699
-Where's my nose?
-Here it is.

484
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,051
-Here's your arm.
-Give me that. That's mine.

485
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,265
Honey, the mustache?

486
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,937
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

487
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,404
Andy never played with us like that.

488
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,450
We're just gonna have to
make the best of it.

489
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,302
But these toddlers,
they don't know how to play with us.

490
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,637
-They're too young!
-Yeah, they're sticky.

491
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,388
Well, we should be
in the Butterfly Room.

492
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,058
-With the big kids!
-That's right.

493
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,086
-Yeah, you said it.
-We'll get this straightened out.

494
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,765
I'll go talk to Lotso
about moving us to the other room.

495
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:41,328
Blast. Try that one.

496
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,587
It's locked!

497
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,625
-Same here.
-Try the windows.

498
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,521
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.

499
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,430
Finest childproof lock in the world.

500
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,522
-We're trapped!
-Wait.

501
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,017
Did anyone notice the transom?

502
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,517
Oh, great. How do we get up there?

503
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,844
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...

504
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,998
-Three!
-Whoa!

505
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,281
Let go!

506
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,241
Go!

507
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,861
-He did it!
-Yes, sir!

508
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,540
Way to go, Buzz!

509
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,577
Yeah, you think
they had a fun playtime?

510
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:36,984
They might hear you.

511
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,567
-Okay, now you start.
-l...

512
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,910
-Love...
-You.

513
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,181
See? That time, I said "love."
Okay, now me first.

514
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,463
-Okay, okay, okay.
-l...

515
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:47,687
-Love...
-You.

516
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,719
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.

517
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,494
You are so smart.

518
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,203
Come on, Romeo. We're late.

519
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,552
-I'll wait up for you.
-Kisses!

520
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:00,937
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.

521
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,259
-Come on. Any splits?
-Heya. Bring it here.

522
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,377
-All right.
-Here we go.

523
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,388
-Come on, horsey, come on!
-Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.

524
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,083
-Gobble, gobble, baby.
-Come on, horsey.

525
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,228
Come on, duck.

526
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,086
-All right, that's it. No more bets.
-Come on! Right here.

527
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,225
Let me have the duck, let me have
the duck, let me have the duck!

528
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:13,894
Here is a duck.

529
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,065
-l won!
-Ah, man!

530
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,308
-Well, Stretch takes the round.
-You lost!

531
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,124
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.

532
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,766
-Coyote's wild.
-Here, here.

533
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,337
-Two greens here.
-Changing two double A's.

534
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,469
Hey, what do you guys think
of the new recruits? Any keepers?

535
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,381
Oh, please! Landfill!

536
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,890
-Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
-Toddler fodder.

537
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,903
But that space guy, he could be useful.

538
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:33,954
But that space guy, he could be useful.

539
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,605
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

540
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,926
Neither are you, Chunk.

541
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,625
You got a little keeper yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

542
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,184
Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.

543
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,253
Aw, Mr. Softy over here.

544
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,365
What do you expect from a girl's toy?

545
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:53,411
I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?

546
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,425
All them toys are disposable.

547
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,244
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.

548
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:06,125
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

549
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:08,732
Let me go!

550
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,437
Take him to the libary.

551
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,775
No!

552
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,454
1225 Sycamore.

553
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,509
Woody, what are you doing?

554
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:48,582
I gotta get outta here.

555
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,430
-You're leaving?
-But didn't you have fun today?

556
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,399
Well, of course I did,
more than I've had in years,

557
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,558
but, you see,
I belong to someone else.

558
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,747
-Who's "Yid-nuh"?
-Il believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."

559
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,863
Guys, it says "Andy."

560
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,272
He's my Bonnie.

561
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,367
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.

562
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,069
-Where's home?
-Elm Street. 234 Elm.

563
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,432
-You guys have a map?
-We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?

564
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,062
I'll fire up the computer.

565
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,266
Unhand me, you cowards!
I demand to talk to Lotso!

566
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,316
Zip it, Buck Rogers.

567
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,924
You don't talk to Lotso
till we say you can...

568
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,612
Ken? What's goin’ on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

569
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,817
He got out, Lotso.

570
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:39,782
“Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.

571
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:44,531
F-A-Oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I'm so sorry.

572
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,433
-Lotso, there's been a mistake.
-A mistake?

573
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,734
The children in the Caterpillar Room
are not age-appropriate

574
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,188
for me and my friends.

575
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,022
We respectfully request
a transfer to the Butterfly Room.

576
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,058
Well, request granted!

577
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,497
-But, Lotso...
-Hush now, Kenneth.

578
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,783
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.

579
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,126
Why, I'd say
we've found ourselves a keeper.

580
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,079
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!

581
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,035
We're calling you up
to the big leagues, son.

582
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,924
From now on,
you'll have anything you want.

583
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,147
Excellent. I'll go get my friends.

584
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,753
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

585
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,252
Those Caterpillar kids
need someone to play with.

586
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,311
But my friends don't belong there.

587
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,423
None of us do, I agree.

588
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,769
Which is why,
for the good of our community,

589
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,452
we ask the newer toys,
the stronger ones,

590
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,071
to take on the hardships
the rest of us can't bear anymore.

591
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,726
Well, I guess that makes sense.

592
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,450
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

593
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,393
Family man, huh? I understand.

594
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:50,844
Put him back in the timeout chair.

595
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,210
What are ya... Unhand me!

596
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,414
Bring in the Bookworm.

597
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:02,916
Here it is.

598
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,450
It was filed under "Lightyear."

599
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:06,531
It was filed under "Lightyear."

600
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,315
Let's see here.

601
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:15,547
“Accessories. Maintenance.”
Here we go.

602
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,327
“Remove screws to access
battery compartment.”

603
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:20,851
What are you doing?

604
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,549
Stop!

605
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,097
Let go of me!

606
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:29,058
“To return your Buzz Lightyear action
figure to its original factory settings..."

607
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:30,656
No!

608
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,425
"Slide the switch from
Play to Demo.”

609
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:36,918
Stop! No! No! No!

610
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,833
-What was that?
-Sounds like it came from the hall.

611
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,589
I'll see what it was.

612
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:46,953
What do you see? Anything?

613
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:50,295
No, just a dark hallway and...
Wait. Wait!

614
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:52,301
I see Andy!

615
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,140
-What?
-That's impossible.

616
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:56,571
No, no, I really see him. In his room.

617
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,492
My other eye! The one I left behind.

618
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,631
This is so weird. He's packing up.

619
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:12,066
Here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!

620
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,464
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.

621
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,340
He's looking in the attic.

622
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:21,653
Wait, there's Mom.
Why is he so upset?

623
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,531
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

624
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,088
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!

625
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,891
He's looking for us?

626
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,660
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!

627
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:37,841
I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

628
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:37,922
I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

629
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,212
Well, then,
Woody was telling the truth.

630
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:41,277
-Holy cow!
-And you didn't believe him.

631
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,922
Hey, you didn't believe him first!

632
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,764
Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!

633
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,819
-Lotso!
-Hey, there.

634
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:52,218
How y'all doin’ this fine evenin'?

635
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:54,627
Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?

636
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,009
There's been a mistake.
We have to go.

637
00:44:57,395 --> 00:45:01,345
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.

638
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,578
We were runnin’ low on volunteers
for the little ones.

639
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,406
They just love new toys,
now, don't they?

640
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:10,462
“Love"? We've been chewed,
kicked, drooled on.

641
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,607
Just look at my pocketbook!

642
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,770
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin’ Sunnyside.

643
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:21,366
“Sweet potato"!
Who do you think you're talking to?

644
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:26,093
I have over 30 accessories,
and I deserve more respect...

645
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:29,022
That's better.

646
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,547
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth,
except me.

647
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,743
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

648
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,558
Come on, guys. We're goin’ home.

649
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:36,736
Whoa there, missy.

650
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:38,795
You're not goin’ anywhere.

651
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,503
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?

652
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,281
Buzz! You're back!

653
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:46,880
Buzz?

654
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:48,949
Hey!

655
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:51,291
Look out!

656
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:52,805
What are you, nuts?

657
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,087
Buzz!

658
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,005
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!

659
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,321
-Buzz, what are you doing?
-Silence, minions of Zurg!

660
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,503
You're in the custody
of the Galactic Alliance!

661
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,122
-"Zurg"?
-"Galactic Alliance"?

662
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:07,267
Oh, boy.

663
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,898
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!

664
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,203
Yes, sir!

665
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:23,301
Where do you think you're going?

666
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,409
Buzz! We're your friends!

667
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,417
Spare me your lies, temptress.

668
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:30,013
Your emperor's defeated,

669
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,008
and I'm immune to
your bewitching good looks.

670
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,801
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!

671
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:37,716
Hey! Let go of me,
you drooling doofus!

672
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:38,879
Not him.

673
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:42,196
I think this potato needs to
learn himself some manners.

674
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,253
Take him to the box.

675
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,938
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?

676
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,601
Bad baby! Bad baby!

677
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:50,213
Ken? What's going on?

678
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:53,435
Barbie! I told you to wait
in the Dream House.

679
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:54,991
What are you doing to my friends?

680
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,836
Get in there!

681
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,189
-Barbie, wait!
-Don't touch me.

682
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,688
-We're through!
-Barbie! I did...

683
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:06,472
And give me my scarf back!

684
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:11,183
Lightyear! Explain our
overnight accommodations.

685
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,486
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.

686
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:18,151
Any prisoner caught outside their cell
spends the night in the box.

687
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:20,623
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

688
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,615
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

689
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:27,843
Prisoners do not speak
unless spoken to.

690
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,269
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night...

691
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:31,908
In the box! We get it.

692
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:35,944
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.

693
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:39,427
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

694
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,096
Don't worry, Commander.

695
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,109
Any doubt I had got pounded
out of me at the academy.

696
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,538
Listen up, folks.

697
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,021
We got a way of doin’ things
here at Sunnyside.

698
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:52,144
If you start at the bottom,
pay your dues,

699
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,560
life here can be a dream come true!

700
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:58,332
But if you break our rules,
step outta line,

701
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:04,463
try to check out early,
well, you're just hurtin’ yourselves.

702
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,480
Woody! What did you do to him?

703
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,340
You all get a good night's rest.

704
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,659
You got a full day
of playtime tomorrow.

705
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,961
1225 Syca...

706
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,069
Who's Velocistar237?

707
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:27,891
Who's Velocistar237?

708
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,294
That's just a dinosaur toy
down the street.

709
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,754
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.

710
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,694
-Just a dinosaur.
-All right.

711
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,813
Sycamore. Okay, enter!

712
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,766
Please don't be far. Please, please!

713
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,455
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!

714
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:50,767
I'm going to college! Look at me!
I'm big toy on campus! Hello!

715
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,765
-Hey, I'll see you at the sock hop.
-Okay, Potsie.

716
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:57,328
Hey, listen. If any of you guys
ever get to Sunnyside Daycare,

717
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:58,768
you tell 'em Woody made it home.

718
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:01,813
-You came from Sunnyside?
-But how'd you escape?

719
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,886
Well, it wasn't easy.

720
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,192
What do you mean "escape"?

721
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,668
Sunnyside is a place
of ruin and despair.

722
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:14,248
Ruled by an evil bear
who smells of strawberries.

723
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:16,873
Lotso?

724
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,431
The guy may seem plush
and huggable on the outside,

725
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:21,346
but inside, he’s a monster.

726
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:23,729
But... How do you know that?

727
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,748
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

728
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:34,557
Yeah, I knew Lotso.

729
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,580
He was a good toy. A friend.

730
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:42,967
Me and him,
we had the same kid, Daisy.

731
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,502
1 was there
when Lotso got unwrapped.

732
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,810
Daisy loved us all.

733
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,550
But Lotso,

734
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,741
Lotso was special.

735
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,361
They did everything together.

736
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,391
You've never seen
a kid and a toy more in love.

737
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,365
One day, we took a drive.

738
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:10,485
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.

739
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,722
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

740
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,587
She never came back.

741
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,714
Lotso wouldn't give up.

742
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:38,763
it took forever,
but we finally made it back to Daisy's.

743
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,413
But by then, it was too late.

744
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,787
Something changed that day
inside Lotso.

745
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,231
Something snapped.

746
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,669
She replaced us. Come on!

747
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,555
-No, she only replaced you!
-She replaced all of us.

748
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:12,538
Didn't she?

749
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,241
She don't love you no more!

750
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:18,412
She don't love you no more!

751
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,741
Now come on!

752
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:29,738
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.

753
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,426
Then we found Sunnyside.

754
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:37,508
Then we found Sunnyside.

755
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,258
But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.

756
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,026
He wasn't anyone's friend.

757
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,657
He took over Sunnyside
and rigged the whole system.

758
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,391
So how'd you get out?

759
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,980
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.

760
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:08,871
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

761
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,960
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys,

762
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:16,299
they don't stand a chance.

763
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:16,440
they don't stand a chance.

764
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,437
-But my friends are in there.
-You can't go back.

765
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,882
Returning now would be suicide!

766
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:22,821
But what about your Andy?

767
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,690
Isn't he leaving for college?

768
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,685
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

769
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,730
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.

770
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,269
But he ain't ever comin’ back.

771
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,502
Rise and shine, campers!

772
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:23,269
Commander Lotso, sir!

773
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:25,661
All quiet, nothing to report.

774
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:29,036
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.

775
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,623
Wait! What've you done
with my husband?

776
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,393
Big Baby.

777
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,276
Sweetheart!

778
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:45,525
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of Lincoln Logs.

779
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:48,257
I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.

780
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,809
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!

781
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:15,548
Hello?

782
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,269
You shouldn't have
come back, cowboy.

783
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:21,391
They've cracked down hard since
you left. More guards, more patrols.

784
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,888
You and your friends
ain't ever getting out of here now.

785
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,334
I made it out once.

786
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:28,078
You got lucky once. Want my advice?

787
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,635
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.

788
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:32,428
Yeah, for how long?

789
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:33,808
I've been here years.

790
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,131
They'll never break me.

791
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,500
There's only one way
toys leave this place.

792
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,021
There's only one way
toys leave this place.

793
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,520
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.

794
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,950
Then it's off to the dump.

795
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,696
Look, I appreciate
your concern, old-timer.

796
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,798
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.

797
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:54,091
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I'd sure be grateful.

798
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,466
Well, if you're gonna get out,

799
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,376
first thing you gotta get through's
the doors.

800
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:05,008
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.

801
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:06,499
Got it. What else?

802
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,630
Lotso has trucks
patrolling all night long.

803
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:11,103
Hallway, lobby, playground.

804
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:12,395
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?

805
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:15,536
Eight-feet high. Cinder block.
No way through it.

806
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,119
You go over or under.

807
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,284
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.

808
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:21,923
it's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.

809
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,860
The monkey's the eye in the sky.

810
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,653
He sees everything.

811
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,919
Classrooms.

812
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,134
Hallways.

813
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:52,678
Even the playground.

814
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:04,097
You can unlock doors,
sneak past guards, climb the wall,

815
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,875
but if you don't take out that monkey,
you ain't going nowhere.

816
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,672
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!

817
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:14,967
Recess! Come on, kids!

818
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:22,598
Hey, guys.

819
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,029
-Woody?
-Woody!

820
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:26,526
Woody!

821
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,260
-Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
-Thank goodness!

822
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:31,606
-You're alive!
-Course I'm alive!

823
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,610
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?

824
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,482
Lotso did something to him!

825
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,658
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.

826
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,253
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

827
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,194
Return of the astro-nut.

828
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,680
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I was wrong.

829
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,678
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

830
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:53,908
No, no, it's my fault
for leaving you guys.

831
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,364
From now on, we stick together.

832
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,259
But Andy's leavin’ for college.

833
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,185
College? Hog-tie the mailman!

834
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,820
We gotta get you home
before Andy leaves tomorrow!

835
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,556
Tomorrow? But that means...

836
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,598
It means
we're busting out of here, tonight.

837
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,439
-What? Impossible!
-But there's no way out of here!

838
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,950
No, there is one way out.

839
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:13,639
One way.

840
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,966
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

841
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,574
-Springy dog.
-Present.

842
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,776
Green guys.

843
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,911
-Cowgirl.
-Here.

844
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,629
Horse.

845
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:34,203
-Piggy bank.
-Yo.

846
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,412
-Tyrannosaurus.
-Here.

847
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,657
-Barbie.
-Here.

848
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:40,649
Potato Head.

849
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,185
Potato Head?

850
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,954
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!

851
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:49,495
Impossible!

852
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:52,198
Hey!

853
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,486
Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?

854
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,111
That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
smoothie.

855
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:13,736
Well, well, well. You're turning out to
be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?

856
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,537
What did you think you were
gonna do? Waltz right out of here?

857
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,033
Yeah, and I would've got away
with it, too,

858
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,658
if it weren't for you meddling toys!

859
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,156
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!

860
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,535
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!

861
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,794
You're a purse with legs.

862
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:27,303
Take him back to the box.

863
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:31,371
No! No, not the box! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it! I like ascots.

864
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,165
Really. No, no, no!

865
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:35,968
Okay, check.

866
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:39,746
Good work, Lightyear. All right,
resume your space-guy-thingy.

867
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,393
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!

868
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,619
Ken! Ken?

869
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,191
What do you want?

870
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:52,442
I can't take it here, Ken. l wanna go
to the Butterfly Room. With you!

871
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,536
Yeah, well, you should've
thought of that yesterday.

872
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:56,105
I was wrong.

873
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,078
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.

874
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:02,523
Please take me away from this!
Take me away!

875
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:05,250
Darn it, Barbie!

876
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,106
Okay, but things
are complicated around here.

877
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,228
-You gotta do what I say.
-I will, Ken! I promise!

878
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:16,107
Wait. I'll do anything!
I'll change your diapers!

879
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,803
Go get the tape!

880
01:01:11,935 --> 01:01:14,105
And this is where the magic happens.

881
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:16,944
Look at all your clothes!

882
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:18,787
I can't believe
you never brought me up here!

883
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,312
-Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
-I know, I know, I know.

884
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,167
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.

885
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,230
Campus hero
with matching sports pennant, huh?

886
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,966
Flower power! Oh, Ken!

887
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:33,743
No one appreciates clothes
here, Barbie. No one.

888
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:38,675
Ken, would you
model a few outfits for me?

889
01:01:39,763 --> 01:01:40,993
Just a few?

890
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:12,795
Go get the key.

891
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,453
Where is it, where is it?

892
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:17,369
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!

893
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,951
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

894
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,830
I told you,
keep your hands off of my stuff!

895
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,813
Make a move, porky!

896
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,289
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!

897
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:42,757
-Hey! Hey!
-Take that, walnut-brain.

898
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,116
No wonder you're extinct.

899
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,234
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!

900
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:52,808
Help! Prison riot!

901
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,536
Get the tortilla.

902
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:39,404
-Ready?
-Ready.

903
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:48,490
Barbie?

904
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,200
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?

905
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:54,680
And how do we switch him back?

906
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,604
You can't make me talk. You can't!

907
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:00,001
But I'd like to see you try.

908
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:54,355
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.

909
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,335
Barbie! Those were vintage!

910
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,270
It's okay. All right, go ahead,
rip ‘em, I don't care.

911
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:00,886
They're a dime a dozen.

912
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:02,304
Glitter tux.

913
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,970
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?

914
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:09,478
A Nehru jacket.

915
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,093
Barbie! Not the Nehru.

916
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,711
This is from what, 1967?

917
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:15,513
The groovy formal collection, yes!

918
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:19,065
-What a shame.
-Oh, no, no, no! No!

919
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,429
There's an instruction manual!

920
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,775
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!

921
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,122
Where's that manual?

922
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:28,203
Where's that manual?

923
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,729
I don't know why
this couldn't wait until morning, Ken,

924
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:34,098
but here you go.

925
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:48,673
What's takin’ so doggone long?

926
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:54,817
So how do we fix Buzz?

927
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:54,898
So how do we fix Buzz?

928
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:13,932
What are you looking at, feathers?

929
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:17,306
Hey!

930
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,419
Yeah, fly away, you coward.

931
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,480
Well, that's just great.

932
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:37,135
Help! Prison riot!

933
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,299
-Mayday! Mayday!
-Give it up. No one can hear you.

934
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:42,676
-What?
-l said, "No one can hear you.”

935
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,793
-What?
-He said, "No one can..."

936
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:47,569
Shush! Will you be quiet?

937
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,238
Woody! You're back!

938
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,453
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

939
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:57,321
Star Command! I've been
taken hostage by my own prisoners.

940
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,332
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!

941
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,352
Unhand me, Zurg scum!

942
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:03,403
Unhand me, Zurg scum!

943
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,600
The Galactic Courts
will show you no mercy.

944
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:09,247
It's not working. Why is it
not working? Where's the manual?

945
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,846
Here we go! There should be
a little hole under the switch.

946
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:14,572
-Little hole, got it!
-"To reset your Buzz Lightyear,

947
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:16,808
-"insert paperclip...”
-Rex, use your finger!

948
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,016
What?

949
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,228
-Okay, now what?
-All right, let's see.

950
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,360
“Caution. Do not hold button
for more than five seconds."

951
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:28,083
It's not my fault!

952
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,200
Star Log...

953
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,608
I've awakened from hyper-sleep
on a strange planet.

954
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:40,071
-Now what did you do?
-[ just did what you told me!

955
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,916
I'm surrounded by alien creatures
of unknown intent.

956
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:45,344
Who goes there?

957
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,412
Friend?

958
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:47,479
Or foe?

959
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,851
Amigos! We're all amigos.

960
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,881
I must have crash-landed
and had my memory erased.

961
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,085
Anyone seen my spaceship?

962
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,720
We gotta switch him back.

963
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:01,665
-Well, how do we do that?
-I don't know. That part's in Spanish.

964
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:04,622
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El Buzzo.

965
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:06,348
My spaceship?
You know where it is?

966
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:07,578
Excellent!

967
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:10,919
Good luck, cowboy.

968
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,000
Good luck, cowboy.

969
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:17,763
Here they come.

970
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,620
Come on, Buzz!

971
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:24,893
What took you so long?

972
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,127
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?

973
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:28,702
We haven't seen him.

974
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:32,224
Buzz.

975
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:36,638
My desert flower!

976
01:08:37,412 --> 01:08:41,450
I have never seen true beauty
until this night!

977
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:41,560
I have never seen true beauty
until this night!

978
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:42,854
Did you fix Buzz?

979
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,116
-Sort of.
-Behind you.

980
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:46,764
Someone's coming.

981
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,106
You would not believe
what I've been through tonight.

982
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:55,053
Darling! Are you okay?

983
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:57,554
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.

984
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,687
You've lost weight. And so tall.

985
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,929
You're a sight for detachable eyes.

986
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:11,630
All clear.

987
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:16,761
Come on. Come on.

988
01:09:19,122 --> 01:09:19,992
We're almost there.

989
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:26,036
Back up. Back up!

990
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:33,985
Come on.

991
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,744
Come with me!

992
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,965
I will show you
the wonders of the galaxy...

993
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,161
..and we shall vanquish
all evil with our love!

994
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,315
Woody!

995
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:57,085
Come on. We're almost there.

996
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,940
The Cowboy!

997
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,282
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

998
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,268
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

999
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:13,379
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1000
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,058
It is open.

1001
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,180
Way to go, Buzz. Come on.

1002
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,369
-Is it safe?
-I guess I'll find out.

1003
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:37,862
-Woody? You okay?
-Yeah.

1004
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,804
Come on down. But not all at once.

1005
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:42,837
-What did he say?
-I think he said, "All at once."

1006
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,306
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

1007
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:45,767
-Geronimo!
-Look out!

1008
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:50,639
Thanks, Jess.

1009
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:50,720
Thanks, Jess.

1010
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,240
Where's my spaceship?

1011
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,809
Almost there, guys.

1012
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:53,890
Almost there, guys.

1013
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,980
Slink, you think you can make it?

1014
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,182
Well, I might be old,
but I still got a spring in my step.

1015
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,624
-He did it!
-All right, Slinkykins.

1016
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,413
Okay, climb across.

1017
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:09,924
You lost, little doggie?

1018
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:16,143
Well, well. Look who's back.

1019
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,900
I'm sorry, cowboy.

1020
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:28,883
They broke me.

1021
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:31,515
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

1022
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:34,327
He don't want you no more.

1023
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:35,704
-That's a lie.
-Is it?

1024
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:37,879
Tell me this, Sheriff.

1025
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,907
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

1026
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,371
You think you're special, cowboy?

1027
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:47,746
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.

1028
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:51,289
Speak of the devil.

1029
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,183
Now, we need toys
in our Caterpillar Room

1030
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:02,986
and you need to avoid that truck.

1031
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:06,812
Why don't you come on back,
join our family again?

1032
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,423
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!

1033
01:13:11,354 --> 01:13:14,814
And I'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours!

1034
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,641
Jessie's right! Authority should derive
from the consent of the governed,

1035
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,304
not from the threat of force.

1036
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,504
If that's what you want.

1037
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:28,361
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.

1038
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:32,468
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

1039
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:34,990
Not to me, there's not.

1040
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,999
Fine. Then why don't you join her!

1041
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:43,555
Oh, Ken!

1042
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:44,839
Everyone, listen!

1043
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,017
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy
if we treated each other fair.

1044
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,357
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid,

1045
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,254
and he put himself on top!

1046
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:55,291
Anyone concur with Ken?

1047
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:01,074
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.

1048
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:03,754
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.

1049
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,873
Chew on that
when you're at the dump.

1050
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,907
Wait! What about Daisy?

1051
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,936
I don't know what you're talking about.

1052
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:14,527
Daisy? You used to do
everything with her?

1053
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,681
-Yeah? Then she threw us out.
-No.

1054
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,503
-She lost you.
-She replaced us!

1055
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:21,469
She replaced you.

1056
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,491
And if you couldn't have her
then no one could.

1057
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:23,602
And if you couldn't have her
then no one could.

1058
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:25,946
You lied to Big Baby
and you've been lying ever since.

1059
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,780
-Where'd you get that?
-She loved you, Lotso.

1060
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,186
She never loved me.

1061
01:14:31,434 --> 01:14:33,044
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

1062
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,490
Mama.

1063
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:41,197
What? You want your mommy back?

1064
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:44,070
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!

1065
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:48,957
Push ‘em in. All of ‘em!

1066
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,849
This is what happens
when you dummies try to think.

1067
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:57,362
We're all just trash, waiting to be
thrown away! That's all a toy is!

1068
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:02,245
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

1069
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,904
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!

1070
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:12,236
-He's gone!
-Holy cow.

1071
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:18,696
Come on. Hurry!

1072
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:26,721
For crying out loud!

1073
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:27,806
Cowboy, hurry!

1074
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,310
Woody!

1075
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,519
Oh, boy. Incoming!

1076
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:42,036
Come on!

1077
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:44,541
Barbie, no!

1078
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:50,181
Woody!

1079
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,310
No!

1080
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:01,762
Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?

1081
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,554
Of course not, you imbecile.
We're doomed!

1082
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:08,222
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.

1083
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,663
We all here? Slinky? Rex?

1084
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,968
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!

1085
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,058
Miss! Where are you?!

1086
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,777
Buzz!

1087
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:22,828
Buzz!

1088
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:33,858
They'll never make it!

1089
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:44,769
Look out!

1090
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:50,635
Buzz!

1091
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,210
-Anyone see him?
-Over here, y'all. ! found him.

1092
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:05,593
Buzz, you okay?

1093
01:17:06,522 --> 01:17:08,662
Buzz! Buzz!

1094
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,398
That wasn't me, was it?

1095
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:24,146
Buzz, you're back! You're back,
you're back, you're back, you're back!

1096
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,960
Yes, I'm back. Where have I been?

1097
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:29,376
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.

1098
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:32,489
Woody! So where are we now?

1099
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,079
In a garbage truck
on the way to the dump!

1100
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,427
Hold on, we're going in!

1101
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:07,505
You got all your pieces?

1102
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,153
The claw!

1103
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,612
-My babies!
-Hey, guys! No! No!

1104
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,260
No!

1105
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,147
Hang on!

1106
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:37,678
Woody! What do we do?

1107
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:39,437
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...

1108
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,349
-Woody!
-Slinky!

1109
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,848
It's a magnet! Watch out!

1110
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,705
Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down.

1111
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:50,521
You might wanna take a look at this.

1112
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:56,137
Quick! Grab something metal!

1113
01:19:01,637 --> 01:19:02,837
You heard the guy.

1114
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:08,432
It's not working!

1115
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:15,131
Help! Help me. I'm stuck!

1116
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:18,088
Help, please! Help!

1117
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:20,058
Woody!

1118
01:19:22,825 --> 01:19:24,255
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me yet.

1119
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,279
Woody!

1120
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,170
Go, go!

1121
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,547
Thank you, Sheriff.

1122
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:47,835
We're all in this together.

1123
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:49,277
Right, guys?

1124
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:51,789
Guys?

1125
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,090
Woody! Down here!

1126
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:58,789
-Woody!
-Oh, boy.

1127
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,090
Woody, look. I can see daylight.

1128
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,985
We're gonna be okay!

1129
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:07,000
Hey!

1130
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:09,269
I don't think that's daylight.

1131
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:16,794
Run!

1132
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:36,439
Sheriff! The button! Help me!

1133
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:37,835
Come on!

1134
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,919
Go. Go! Hit the button!

1135
01:20:49,812 --> 01:20:50,742
Hurry!

1136
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:56,373
-Just push it! Push it!
-Push it!

1137
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:59,870
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?

1138
01:21:00,723 --> 01:21:01,683
No. No!

1139
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:02,927
Lotso!

1140
01:21:05,394 --> 01:21:06,384
No!

1141
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:24,596
Rex!

1142
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:32,623
Buzz! What do we do?

1143
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:54,885
The claw.

1144
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,551
You know all that bad stuff I said
about Andy's attic?

1145
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,081
I take it all back.

1146
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:29,089
-You're darn tootin’.
-You said it.

1147
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,174
Oh, darling. You were so brave.

1148
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,978
-You saved our lives.
-And we are eternally grateful.

1149
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:45,893
My boys!

1150
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:47,204
Daddy!

1151
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,633
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?

1152
01:23:49,992 --> 01:23:51,742
Yeah. I'd like to loosen his stitchin’.

1153
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:54,514
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.

1154
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,529
-Hey!
-What you got?

1155
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:08,087
I had me one of these
when I was a kid.

1156
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:10,504
Strawberries.

1157
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,530
Hey, buddy. You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

1158
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:26,232
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.

1159
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,737
-That's right, college boy.
-Wait.

1160
01:24:29,932 --> 01:24:30,982
What about you guys? I mean,

1161
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,517
maybe the attic's
not such a great idea.

1162
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:39,310
-We're Andy's toys, Woody.
-We'll be there for him, together.

1163
01:24:41,677 --> 01:24:43,666
-[ just hope he hasn't left yet.
-Wait a minute!

1164
01:24:44,046 --> 01:24:45,536
Wait, I'll check!

1165
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:49,307
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done!

1166
01:24:49,885 --> 01:24:53,195
-He lives halfway across town.
-We'll never get there in time!

1167
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,578
-Come on, Buster.
-Is that it, honey? You got everything?

1168
01:25:11,974 --> 01:25:13,434
Yeah. Just a few more boxes
-
In my room.

1169
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:14,592
Okay. Come on.

1170
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:19,363
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!

1171
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:21,285
All right. Go. Go, go!

1172
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:31,125
Okay. All clear.

1173
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:31,206
Okay. All clear.

1174
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:41,378
There you are.

1175
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:49,259
-There you go.
-Buzz.

1176
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:56,651
-This isn't goodbye.
-Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.

1177
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:56,912
-This isn't goodbye.
-Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.

1178
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:58,655
Yeah, but not too much fun.

1179
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:02,735
-Woody, take care of Andy.
-Yeah.

1180
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,438
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.

1181
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:07,478
Sure thing.

1182
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:11,327
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?

1183
01:26:12,134 --> 01:26:14,824
‘Course I will. Besides, 1 know about

1184
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:16,704
-Buzz's Spanish mode.
-My what?

1185
01:26:16,705 --> 01:26:17,725
-Buzz's Spanish mode.
-My what?

1186
01:26:17,973 --> 01:26:19,523
Honey, you want some food
for the road?

1187
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,271
I'll get something on the way.

1188
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:23,878
You know where to find us, cowboy.

1189
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:40,427
Did you say goodbye to Molly?

1190
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,506
Mom, we've said goodbye
like 10 times.

1191
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,115
Andy.

1192
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,217
Mon, it's okay.

1193
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:01,248
I know. It's just...

1194
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:01,329
I know. It's just...

1195
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:06,259
I wish I could always be with you.

1196
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:10,257
You will be, Mom.

1197
01:27:26,308 --> 01:27:27,768
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye
to Buster?

1198
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,976
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?

1199
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:32,867
Who's a good doggy? I'm gonna
miss you. I'm gonna miss you.

1200
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:40,522
-I'm gonna miss you.
-Don't, Andy.

1201
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:46,631
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.

1202
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:48,763
Come on. Get the rest of your things.

1203
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:48,874
Come on. Get the rest of your things.

1204
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,717
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

1205
01:27:58,573 --> 01:27:59,473
Hey.

1206
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:10,075
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
I should donate these?

1207
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,502
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.

1208
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,317
“Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"

1209
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,398
“Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"

1210
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:47,523
“Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts.”

1211
01:28:48,023 --> 01:28:50,163
“Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!"

1212
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:53,811
Mom.

1213
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,250
-Andy?
-Hi.

1214
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:57,984
Wow. Look at you.

1215
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,940
Well, I hear you're off to college.

1216
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:01,908
Yeah. Right now, actually.

1217
01:29:02,237 --> 01:29:04,077
So, what can we do for you?

1218
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,469
I have some toys here.

1219
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,515
You hear that, Bonnie?

1220
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,061
So, you're Bonnie?

1221
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,620
I'm Andy.

1222
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:17,202
Someone told me
you're really good with toys.

1223
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:21,090
These are mine,
but I'm going away now,

1224
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:24,724
so 1 need someone really special
to play with them.

1225
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:25,866
so 1 need someone really special
to play with them.

1226
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:35,561
This is Jessie, the roughest,
toughest cowgirl in the whole West.

1227
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:40,004
She loves critters, but none more
than her best pal, Bullseye.

1228
01:29:43,612 --> 01:29:44,482
Here.

1229
01:29:58,193 --> 01:30:02,293
This is Rex, the meanest, most
terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!

1230
01:30:08,837 --> 01:30:12,377
The Potato Heads. Mr. and Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,

1231
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:14,904
‘cause they're madly in love.

1232
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,799
Now Slinky here is
as loyal as any dog you could want.

1233
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:21,777
And Hamm,
he'll keep your money safe,

1234
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:26,837
but he’s also one of the most dastardly
villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop.

1235
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:33,279
These little dudes
are from a strange alien world.

1236
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,235
Pizza Planet.

1237
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,178
And this

1238
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:43,701
is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!

1239
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:46,938
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!

1240
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:50,621
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil Emperor Zurg.

1241
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:55,088
To infinity and beyond!

1242
01:30:56,685 --> 01:30:59,145
Now, you gotta promise
to take good care of these guys.

1243
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:04,849
They mean a lot to me.

1244
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,372
My cowboy!

1245
01:31:16,271 --> 01:31:18,291
Woody? What's he doing in there?

1246
01:31:19,741 --> 01:31:22,021
-"There's a snake in my boot."
-Wha...?

1247
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:26,252
There's a snake in my boot.

1248
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:44,384
Now, Woody, he's been my pal
for as long as I can remember.

1249
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:48,391
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.

1250
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:50,607
And kind. And smart.

1251
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:56,157
But the thing that makes Woody
special is he'll never give up on you.

1252
01:31:58,079 --> 01:31:59,039
Ever.

1253
01:32:00,115 --> 01:32:02,455
He'll be there for you, no matter what.

1254
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:09,084
You think you can
take care of him for me?

1255
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:11,388
Okay then.

1256
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:25,907
Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop's attacking
the haunted bakery!

1257
01:32:26,441 --> 01:32:28,811
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop ‘em!

1258
01:32:29,244 --> 01:32:30,554
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1259
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:33,402
And we'll actually need the rocket.

1260
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:36,272
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!

1261
01:32:39,187 --> 01:32:42,257
We need to get in the spaceship.
The volcano is gonna erupt.

1262
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:45,251
Look! They're being attacked
by a real dog!

1263
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:46,893
You can eat my poisonous scones!

1264
01:32:47,162 --> 01:32:49,032
Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head
are in trouble.

1265
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:50,707
Get on, Woody.

1266
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:54,197
It's my friend Woody.

1267
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:57,730
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.

1268
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:26,827
Thanks, guys.

1269
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,295
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.

1270
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:34,968
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

1271
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,820
So long, partner.

1272
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:58,990
Hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.

1273
01:33:59,501 --> 01:34:01,841
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.

1274
01:34:32,634 --> 01:34:33,864
New toys!

1275
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:47,504
Noses.

1276
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:10,574
“So Il guess you could say
Sunnyside is sunny once again!

1277
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:14,239
“Hope to hear from you soon. We're all
super excited about your new home.

1278
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,019
“Hugs and kisses to everyone."

1279
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:21,197
That Barbie has some
nice handwriting.

1280
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:24,610
Buzz, Barbie didn't write this.

1281
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:28,535
-Grab the sword!
-I got it!

1282
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:29,773
-Okay, go for the...
-Triple bonus!

1283
01:36:30,018 --> 01:36:30,978
-Watch out!
-We got the cloak of darkness!

1284
01:36:31,219 --> 01:36:33,589
-Run, run!
-My arms are never long enough!

1285
01:36:34,055 --> 01:36:36,105
I'll do it! This is it! This is it!

1286
01:36:37,058 --> 01:36:38,398
-Yes!
-We did it!

1287
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:40,393
High-five! Hold on.

1288
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:45,773
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.

1289
01:36:46,234 --> 01:36:48,894
-Look at this!
-Golly bob howdy! That's me!

1290
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:52,269
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, lookin’ good.

1291
01:36:52,774 --> 01:36:54,794
Yeah, she really got your smile.

1292
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,650
What the...

1293
01:37:05,753 --> 01:37:08,183
I told you kids! Stay out of my butt!

1294
01:37:09,624 --> 01:37:12,644
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

1295
01:37:13,428 --> 01:37:16,327
Romeo, o Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

1296
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:19,112
Next season, we're doing Cats.

1297
01:37:19,467 --> 01:37:21,777
Or might I suggest Hamlet?

1298
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:25,691
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.

1299
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:28,457
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.

1300
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,360
I don't know what came over me.

1301
01:37:42,924 --> 01:37:44,414
Just go with it, Buzz.
