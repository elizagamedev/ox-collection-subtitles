1
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:54,998
-There you go.
-Thanks.

2
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,729
I'm gonna be a dad!

3
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,987
Il just talked to my wife.
My baby’s gonna be delivered any minute.

4
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,978
-Hey, get out of the way.
-Hey, I'm gonna be a dad.

5
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,088
Congratulate me.

6
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,416
Good for you, Herb.

7
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,348
Don’t even think about it.

8
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,431
Hey!

9
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,804
Sorry. How are you?
Nice to see you. I'm gonna be a dad!

10
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,737
Congrats!

11
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,833
Hey, Mr. Nuts,
did you hear the news?

12
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,699
-Yeah.
-Beautiful day, isn’t it?

13
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,673
I'm here. I'm here.

14
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,955
-I’m here.
-Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,061
You missed the delivery.

16
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,431
But it's okay.

17
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,354
Making the baby’s the fun part.

18
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,602
Honey, I think
you've got the wrong....

19
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,218
No, I don't need to see the directions.

20
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,409
Push, push.

21
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,335
Push!

22
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,263
Twelve hours of labor.

23
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,332
Oh, but it was worth it.

24
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,677
Look at him. Look at him.

25
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,233
Rodney Copperbottom.

26
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,892
He’s got your mom's eyes
and my dad's nose.

27
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,408
I knew we were smart
to save those parts.

28
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,731
This Copperbottom will do great things
for the world, I can feel it.

29
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,466
-Honey?
-What?

30
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,609
What's that extra piece?

31
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,051
Oh, no, they always put in an extra--

32
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,099
We did want a boy, right?

33
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,204
This won't hurt a bit, son.

34
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,756
Got your nose. Got your nose.

35
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,649
Got your--

36
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,959
-Hi, son.
-Are those my big-boy parts?

37
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,811
They sure are.

38
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,328
They're not shiny.

39
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,037
Well, they’re not brand-new.
They're preowned. So--

40
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,911
They're hand-me-downs
from your cousin Jeffrey.

41
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,902
And they're only for a year.

42
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,463
Hey, Dad, who's that?

43
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,942
That, Rodney, is Bigweld.

44
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,298
The greatest robot in the world.

45
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,313
I thought you were
the greatest robot in the world.

46
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,263
No, besides me.

47
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,245
He’s the head of Bigweld Industries.

48
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,420
He invents things
that make everyone's life better.

49
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,680
-Could I meet him?
-Sure, maybe someday.

50
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,414
-Dad?
-Yeah?

51
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,085
-What do you do?
-Me? I work in a big, fancy restaurant.

52
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,799
I'm a dishwasher.

53
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,390
And now, live from Robot City,
it's The Bigweld Show.

54
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,242
Oh, yeah!

55
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,324
Come on, Dad, you're missing it.

56
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,034
All right, Rodney.
All right, I'm coming. I’m coming.

57
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,583
I had to bring work home
with me again, I’m sorry.

58
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,772
Mr. Gunk has really been piling it on.

59
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,664
And now, the host of our show,
Bigweld.

60
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,262
Welcome. This week I thought you'd like
to take a look around Bigweld Industries.

61
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,507
This here is the front gate.
Kind of cute, ain't it?

62
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,893
-Good morning, Tim.
-Good morning, Mr. Bigweld, sir.

63
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,273
Tim, who closed the front gate?

64
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,717
Well, I just thought since--

65
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,805
We never shut the gate, Tim.

66
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,081
Shutting this gate means
shutting out fresh ideas.

67
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,917
See, every day, robots come here
from hither and yon...

68
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,367
... bringing us new ideas.

69
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,530
And I listen to
every single one of them.

70
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:26,178
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

71
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,390
..-you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

72
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,736
He’s talking to me, Dad.

73
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,682
He sure is, son. He sure is.

74
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,218
Okay, folks, let's get to inventing.

75
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,352
You know, { love to tinker...

76
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:49,253
..-but all the tinkering in the world isn't
useful unless it starts with a good idea.

77
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:56,795
So look around for a need and start
coming up with ideas to fill that need.

78
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,904
One idea will lead to another,
and before you know it...

79
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,342
..-you've done it.
See a need, fill a need.

80
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,013
That's it, Dad. I have to look for...

81
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,530
..a need.

82
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,719
Easy, now.

83
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,094
-Hey there, sport.
-Oh, hi.

84
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,253
These are your 12-year-old parts.
They’re--

85
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,116
Hand-me-downs. I know, Dad.

86
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,330
-I don’t mind.
-They are from your cousin...

87
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,143
...Veronica.

88
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,791
You know how popular she is.

89
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,532
Thanks.

90
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,659
Oh, hey. Hey.

91
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,391
Soon as you reach the age where your
warranty expires, you start falling apart.

92
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,265
Pretty soon there’s gonna be
more duct tape than me.

93
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,728
-Can I try it now, Dad?
-Oh, Rodney--

94
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,848
-Have you worked all the kinks out of it?
-This is gonna make your job easy.

95
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,302
l invented it for you.

96
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,054
Okay. Let's try it.

97
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,853
Great. Okay, this is it.

98
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,452
Wonderbot, go to work.

99
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,029
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,044
Hey!

101
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,450
Copperbottom!

102
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,049
-Mr. Gunk.
-What is that?

103
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,901
-Oh, that. My son made it.
-What's it doing?

104
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,941
Mr. Gunk, please,
you're making it nervous.

105
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,641
It's wrecking my kitchen!

106
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,308
-l'll stop it.
-No!

107
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,504
Your son, huh?

108
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,978
It wasn’t his fault.
He had nothing to do with it.

109
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,635
Yes, sir, he’s a brilliant boy.
An inventor.

110
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,648
You, clean up this mess.
And, you, get out.

111
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,515
Inventor.

112
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,157
You're the hand-me-down son of a
dishwasher, and that’s all you'll ever be.

113
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,441
Somebody scrape this crud off of me.
And serve it to the customers.

114
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,622
Roundtrip or one-way?

115
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,658
One-way.

116
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,695
There you are. I told you I'd find him.

117
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,426
-It’s a mother’s instinct.
-Instinct? He left us a note:

118
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,203
"I'm leaving.
Pll be at the train station.”

119
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,012
Never mind. Pick up that suitcase.
You're coming home.

120
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:13,289
No, Mom. I have to do this.
I'm going to Robot City tonight.

121
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,556
I'm gonna get a job and I’m gonna
help Dad pay back Mr. Gunk.

122
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,283
Talk to him.

123
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,105
-Ro--
-Robot City? You're just a kid.

124
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,461
I'm never gonna be someone here.

125
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,290
l wanna be an inventor.
I wanna meet Bigweld.

126
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,019
l wanna be somebody.

127
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,684
You are somebody.

128
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,076
Somebody who's not
getting on that train.

129
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,692
-Yes, l am.
-Talk to him.

130
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,458
-One ticket for Robot City.
-Where are you going?

131
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,755
-Not me. Him.
-But....

132
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,411
Rodney, did you know that when I was
your age, I wanted to be a musician?

133
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,410
I played pretty well too...

134
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,489
...but my dad was worried
I wouldn't be able to make a living.

135
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,512
So I got refitted to be a dishwasher.
Now, I’m not complaining.

136
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,816
But I’ve always said to myself...

137
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,990
..if l could do it over again,
I would follow my dream.

138
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,596
You've got greatness in you, Rodney.

139
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,375
Never doubt it.

140
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,439
You go to Robot City.

141
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,648
You go meet Bigweld,
and you show him your big ideas.

142
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,513
And, Rodney...

143
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,214
.
.. Never, never give up.

144
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,367
All aboard.

145
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,890
Mom.

146
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,160
I won't let you down, Dad.

147
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,880
I'll make you proud.

148
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,911
I know you will.

149
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,141
Excuse me, I wonder if--

150
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,123
-Gave at the office.
-l wonder if you--

151
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,354
Could you direct me
to Bigweld Indust--?

152
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,863
-What?
-Perfect. That will be 50 bucks.

153
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,460
Fifty bucks? For what?

154
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,068
A beautiful picture
of your first moment in Robot City.

155
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,460
There. Your second moment.
That's another $50.

156
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,509
Are you keeping track?

157
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,084
Come on, work with me, work with me.
More pout, less pose.

158
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,245
Great. Inside of you is a fashion model
waiting to throw up.

159
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,732
Give me those eyes. Big eyes, big eyes.
Give me big anime eyes.

160
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,240
-Yeah! Loving it, loving it, loving it!
-l don’t want any pictures.

161
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,043
-You don’t?
-No.

162
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,778
That's all right. There's no film.
Would you like a map to the stars’ homes?

163
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,935
Where did he go?

164
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,712
-Buddy, wanna buy a watch?
-Don't buy us, we're fakes.

165
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,930
Next.

166
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,065
Excuse me, how do I get
to Bigweld Industries?

167
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,723
Oh, great--

168
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,576
Never mind.

169
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,343
Hi, excuse me.
How do I get to Bigweld Industries?

170
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,447
What?

171
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,622
Yeah, thanks.

172
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,384
Cross-town express
to Foundry District...

173
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,372
...with stops at Bigweld Industries
and Battery Park only.

174
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,427
Please tighten all spools, nuts, bolts
and detachable appendages.

175
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,668
Riders with high oil pressure
are advised to take the local.

176
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,915
Thank you, and have a nice day.

177
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,337
No, no.

178
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,896
-Say, are you following me?
-No.

179
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,852
-First time on the cross-town express?
-Well, actually, I--

180
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,564
Oh, boy.

181
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,064
Good luck in the big city. If you can
make it here, you can make it anywhere.

182
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,017
And if you can’t make it here,
welcome to the club.

183
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,530
-Oh, no.
-What? What is it?

184
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,555
We're going off the track.
We're gonna crash!

185
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,067
-What?
- don’t wanna die.

186
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:13,945
I was just kidding.
Just put your head between your legs.

187
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,737
Yeah!

188
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,569
There goes my stop.

189
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,181
I tell you, the things that fall off me....
It's embarrassing.

190
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,957
Sorry.

191
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,312
You know, it used to be a lot worse.
They had this giant hammer--

192
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,342
Oh, they brought it back.

193
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,241
Stick with me. I know this town
like the back of my hand.

194
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,723
Hey, that’s new.

195
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,134
Excuse me. Can I help you?

196
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,094
Sorry, I--

197
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,871
-Hey, you're Tim from the TV show.
-That’s me.

198
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,844
Well, hey, Tim.

199
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,695
Who closed the gate?
It's never supposed to be--

200
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,442
Yeah, okay, what do you want?

201
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,271
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

202
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,147
I'm an inventor.

203
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,921
Oh, why didn’t you say so?

204
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,267
Stand back.

205
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,657
Thanks.

206
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,399
What?

207
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,841
I got you. You see, because you were
all excited and then, boom!

208
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,658
All right, 1 had my laugh. Go on in.

209
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,891
Now, that’s funny.

210
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,807
The second time.

211
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,131
You really think I’m gonna let you in.
But I'm not.

212
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,360
Sorry, kid, nobody gets in.
Company rules.

213
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,687
Company ru--? Well, then
how do they hire new inventors?

214
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,327
They don't. Those days are over.

215
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:47,499
My advice: Come back two years ago.
Then the job is yours.

216
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:05,817
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

217
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,715
..-you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

218
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,289
My goodness,
what a remarkable legacy.

219
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,426
Concern for the common robot.

220
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,762
You don’t come across old-fashioned
values like that anymore, friends.

221
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,790
And for good reason.

222
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,852
There’s no money in it!

223
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,624
Hello? Memo to Bigweld:
We're not a charity.

224
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,011
That's why old fat face
no longer sits in the big chair.

225
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,880
He’s a relic.

226
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,013
So I don’t wanna hear another,
“Where's Bigweld?”

227
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:44,086
We'll see him next month at the
Bigweld Ball. He always goes to that.

228
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,433
Now, let’s get down to the business
of sucking every loose penny...

229
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,686
...out of
Mr. and Mrs. Average-Knucklehead.

230
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,787
What's our big-ticket item?

231
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,048
Upgrades, people. Upgrades.

232
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,921
That's how we make the dough.

233
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:11,453
Now, if we're telling robots that no matter
what they're made of, they're “fine”...

234
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:15,251
...-how can we expect them to feel
crummy enough about themselves...

235
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,148
...to buy our upgrades
and make themselves look better?

236
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,724
Therefore, I’ve come up
with a new slogan.

237
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,504
“Why be you when you can be new?"

238
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,053
I gotta tell you, I think it’s brilliant...

239
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:36,917
...but, honestly, I'd like to hear
what you employees think about this.

240
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,373
-Hear, hear.
-Out of the ballpark, Ratchet.

241
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,266
Just don't look down.

242
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:00,548
Hey.

243
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,011
Get off.

244
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,280
Go on, get off.

245
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,784
Get off of--

246
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,532
Cappy, you haven't said a word.

247
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,428
-It gave me chills.
-Thank you, thank you.

248
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,802
-But--
-But?

249
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,725
I'm just wondering,
why would robots buy new upgrades...

250
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,712
...if parts are so much cheaper?

251
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,228
Oh, right. Well, that's easy.

252
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:33,067
Because as of today,
we are no longer making spare parts.

253
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,513
Do you know what I call robots
who can't afford upgrades? Scrap metal.

254
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,997
You see them on the streets,
misshapen and rust-covered.

255
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,719
They turn your insides out.
You wanna run home and scrub yourself.

256
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:49,072
Now, Cappy, ! want your department
to push our new slogan.

257
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,125
In fact, I’m moving you
into the office right next to mine.

258
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,768
We'll be working very,
very closely together on this one.

259
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,182
-Won't that be fun?
-Oodles.

260
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,469
-Oh, so sorry, I--
-What the--?

261
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:18,524
Sir, 1 am a young inventor, and it has
been my dream to come to Robot City...

262
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:22,485
...and to present my ideas
to Mr. Bigweld.

263
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,525
Who doesn’t seem to be here.

264
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:28,944
Gee, no, no. But while he’s away,
he left me in charge.

265
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,104
Oh, well, then let me show you
what this can do.

266
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,678
l have a better idea. Why don't you
let me show you what it can do.

267
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,650
It can do this!

268
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,311
So how did it go?

269
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,558
What the heck
is going on around here?

270
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:14,185
Some highly polished jerk
is sitting in Bigweld’s chair.

271
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:19,007
And you're sitting
on the sidewalk, magnetized.

272
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,378
Listen, I'll be back,
and I’m gonna get to the bottom of this.

273
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,786
When you pick a lost cause,
you really commit.

274
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,579
Where do they make dreamers like you?
Get lost, freak!

275
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,226
All right, break time.

276
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,545
All right, break time’s over.

277
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,548
Chop-chop.

278
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,509
Look who's here.

279
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,310
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, sweetie. How’s my boy?

280
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,758
Great. I did just what you told me.
No more spare parts.

281
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:04,049
In a couple of weeks, those broken-down
losers out there will be scrap metal.

282
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,276
You will be up to your bloomers
in broken-elbow junk.

283
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,313
Such a good boy.

284
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,151
And after you finish off Bigweld...

285
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,427
...there will be nobody
out there to fix them.

286
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,689
Exactly!

287
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,891
You wanna swing that one
by me again?

288
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,233
Idiot! Those outmodes look up to him.

289
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,937
-Suppose he decides to come back?
-Oh, come on, Mom.

290
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,564
-He’s not gonna be trouble where he is.
-What are you afraid of?

291
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,314
Grow some bolts.

292
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,849
Or do you want to end up
like your father?

293
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,438
Hey, son. Good to see you.

294
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,211
Think what it would mean.

295
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:41,833
Not Bigweld Industries,
Ratchet Industries.

296
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:43,761
Keep talking.

297
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,402
Ratchet City!

298
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,555
Yes, everything shiny.

299
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,588
No more Bigweld, no more outmode.

300
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,846
Let's do it!

301
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,078
That's my boy!

302
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,161
Are you hungry?
Can I get you something?

303
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:12,044
-You look thin.
-No, no, no, Mom. I gotta go. Bye.

304
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:13,708
Bye, Pop.

305
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,696
So long, son.
Good luck with your dastardly plans.

306
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,740
Hey.

307
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,015
Hi there.

308
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:50,657
Listen, if 1 seem to be getting smaller,
it’s because I’m leaving.

309
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,117
Foot, don’t fail me now.

310
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,168
Stop! Hey, you got my foot!

311
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,271
Oh, great. Happy now?

312
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,620
Not until you give me back
my foot, you mugger.

313
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,524
lam not a mugger. I happen to be...

314
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,082
..-@ Scrounger.

315
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,503
I didn’t know you were
at the end of that foot.

316
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,004
Here, let me help you with that.

317
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,811
No, no, no, I'll do it myself.

318
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,030
I have my pride, you know. Over here.

319
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:03,562
Oh, no. No, not that close.
Hold on, hold on.

320
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,656
No. No, no.

321
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,300
What’s the use? There's nothing left.

322
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:15,027
Hey, Diesel, 1 found you a voice box.

323
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,260
Here’s another one.

324
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,103
That's no good. Give me that.

325
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,985
l can never find parts in my size.

326
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,877
What is it, boy?

327
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,077
Hey, Fender, have you lost weight?

328
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,319
Lost weight?

329
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,702
Look at where you're looking.
He’s a head in a basket.

330
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,268
We're doomed, I knew it.
We're doomed.

331
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:56,258
Yeah, will you shut up, you neurotic nut?
Why, I'd smack you if I had a hand.

332
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,223
Wow, speak of the devil, here 1 come.

333
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:02,657
Dang!

334
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,396
Check this out.

335
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,951
Who would throw away
such a cute little doodad?

336
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,063
-Don't be scared.
-Hey, that’s mine.

337
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,588
That's him. That's the guy.
I would know that face.

338
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,691
I know that face,
and I know that foot.

339
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,078
He's over there, moron.

340
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,493
That's the perpetrator.
He knocked my head off.

341
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,375
-You want another piece of me?
-All right, buster.

342
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:30,392
If you think you can mess with my
big brother, you’re-- You're kind of cute.

343
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,376
Piper, would you behave yourself.

344
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,282
Now, come on,
let’s get Fender fixed. Again.

345
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,034
Here’s your thingamabob.

346
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,484
By the way, the name’s Piper.

347
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,830
Rhymes with "viper."

348
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,853
See you around.

349
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,739
We've told you a hundred times:

350
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,139
"Don't talk to strange men.”
Thank you, Manuel.

351
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,331
Il talk to you.
Who's stranger than that?

352
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:09,625
I got good news, and I got bad news.

353
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,338
-What’'s the bad news?
-l checked the stock book.

354
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,724
And as of today, they are no longer
making parts for your model.

355
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,608
You have been officially outmoded.

356
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,474
Outmoded? Well, that’s fine.

357
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,235
What’s the good news?!

358
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,857
Well, when we had your parts,
they were on sale.

359
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:36,234
How could this happen to me?
I'm practically a kid.

360
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:40,382
Look, pull yourself together.
All you need is an upgrade.

361
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,730
That new-upgrade smell.

362
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,543
Just came in, fully loaded. Look.

363
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,823
It’s got cup-holders, standard.

364
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,528
Does it come in plus sizes?

365
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:55,966
Sure, take a look at the new
Bigweld spring collection.

366
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:01,956
Il can't afford that fancy stuff.
All l need is one stinking neck joint.

367
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,514
No. Why did this happen to me?

368
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,657
I'm hurting me. Idiot.

369
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:14,221
Sorry, pal, it’s either upgrade
or the chop shop for you.

370
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,346
The chop shop?

371
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,109
I'm fine, I’m fine. Look, no hands.

372
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,549
Ta-da! I'm back. Miss me?

373
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,438
-No one’s going to the chop shop.
-That’s right.

374
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,638
What do you think
we can get for him?

375
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,210
Will you stop? Listen, shiny pants...

376
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,909
... you get back there
and find a part for my brother.

377
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,329
We are not junk, we are not scrap,
and we will not be treated this way.

378
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,332
I'm sorry. I don’t have the parts.

379
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,409
Well, do you have two washers,
an S-spring and some Fastweld?

380
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,277
l can fix you easy.

381
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,641
The Force is strong with this one.

382
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,765
When was the last time
you got oiled?

383
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,334
I can’t answer that
with my kid sister here.

384
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,950
Can it, Fender.

385
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:15,428
Hold still. This might tickle.

386
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,614
We haven't been properly introduced.

387
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,753
I'm Fender. Used to be Bumper...

388
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,355
...but had to change it
when we came in to the country.

389
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,287
Copperbottom, Rodney Copperbottom.

390
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,415
Riddle me this:
Why did I meet you among the garbage?

391
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,245
Well, today I tried
to get in to see Bigweld.

392
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, if you find him, tell him
we really need him to come back.

393
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,189
He cared about bots like us.

394
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,416
l heard they've done him in
and left the rest of us to fall apart.

395
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,406
Well, that ought to do it.

396
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,067
Look at that! And he fixed my neck.

397
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,382
-Sweeper!
-Sweeper?

398
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,078
Make yourself scarce.

399
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,633
What's the big deal?

400
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,361
-Well, if you're an outmode like Fender--
-Hey.

401
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:06,051
They sweep you up
and take you to the chop shop.

402
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:10,571
Where they melt you down
and turn you into something else.

403
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,886
You mean...?

404
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,149
Yep.

405
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,677
Sweepers. Sweepers.

406
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,384
Help. Here’s one outmode
you're not gonna get.

407
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,056
Fender, run!

408
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:37,781
That was close.

409
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,386
When in Robot City,
guests of the Rusties-- That’s us.

410
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,299
--stay at Aunt Fanny's boarding house,
where our motto is:

411
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,945
“Beats rusting outside.”

412
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:50,181
Let me just let her know you're here.
Aunt Fanny!

413
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,159
-We brought someone.
-I’m in the kitchen.

414
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,308
-Are you sure your aunt won't mind?
-Relax, she’s not my aunt.

415
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,341
She just takes in bots who are broke.
Bless her little heart.

416
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,802
Well, then why is she called
Aunt Fanny?

417
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,654
We couldn't call her Aunt Booty.

418
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:09,883
Oh, crap.

419
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,691
She's a little artsy-fartsy.

420
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,677
The artsy’s okay,
but when she gets fartsy....

421
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,453
Look at-- Oh, right on my shoes.

422
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,312
I'm so clumsy.

423
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:22,364
Well, hello there. What's your name?

424
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,057
I'm Rodney Bigbottom--

425
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,099
No, I'm Rodney Copperbottom.
Copperbottom.

426
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,886
That's a wonderful name, Bigbottom.

427
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:34,841
Well, I just--

428
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,649
-What happened to your friend?
-He’s been rear-ended.

429
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,834
Oh, there you are.

430
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,471
Aunt Fanny, he needs a place to stay.

431
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,280
Well, just make yourself at home.

432
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,550
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

433
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,234
My pleasure.

434
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,077
See a need, fill a need.

435
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:55,879
Hey, just like Bigweld.

436
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,026
Bigweld. That's a lot of robot.

437
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,153
Come on. You can bunk with me.

438
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,226
We'll ignore the gossip.

439
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,437
You missed a spot.

440
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,706
Fender, get out of my room!

441
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,335
I'm not in your room.

442
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,625
lam now. Now I’m not.
lam. Not. Am--

443
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,829
Get out of my room.

444
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,237
Oh, man, this is my third oil change
today. Something's wrong with me.

445
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,938
Sorry.

446
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,741
Here we are. Home sweet home.

447
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,364
What's mine is yours.

448
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,220
-Oh, dear.
-l'll get them.

449
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,258
Look at that.
Now they're arm-wrestling.

450
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,930
Could you separate them?
Hurry, my backside itches.

451
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,165
I know that sounds bad,
but I’m just doing musical arm farts.

452
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,727
You know how to do those?

453
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,089
They're hard to do, because we're metal,
but that’s where the skill comes in.

454
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,246
I'm real close. Listen.

455
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,034
No, wait.

456
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,983
No, wait, wait.

457
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,819
You can't tell me that didn’t sound like a--
Like an old man.

458
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,240
You know, I'm a little tired.
Maybe tomorrow.

459
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,623
Kind of a rough day, huh?

460
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,425
Kind of. My dad's probably
sitting by the phone...

461
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,728
... Waiting for his brilliant son
to call...

462
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:49,144
..and tell him what a big success
my first day was.

463
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,348
I know it’s not your problem.

464
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,773
If you burden your friends,
you won't have any.

465
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:55,689
What are you, a fortune cookie?

466
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,434
“That's what friends--"

467
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,237
You consider me a friend?

468
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,305
Sure, what else would I consider you?

469
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,074
An embarrassment,
a way to rebel against your parents...

470
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,623
...a desperate cry for help.
The list is endless.

471
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:09,583
Let's just stick with friend.

472
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,524
You know, even though you had
a discouraging day, remember...

473
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,687
...there’s another one
coming tomorrow.

474
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,573
You know, my last roommate
jumped out that window.

475
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,346
Hey, Fender.

476
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,473
Yeah, baby. Let it rip!

477
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,497
Guys, come on,
what are you, 3 years old?

478
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,660
This is how a man does it.

479
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,878
You guys are so gross.

480
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,993
Besides, this is how you do it.

481
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,371
Hey, kids, get a load of this.

482
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:48,982
Aunt Fanny...

483
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,194
.
...we were using our arms.

484
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,929
Oh, excuse me.

485
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,942
Lady, please...

486
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,689
...see a doctor.

487
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:12,796
Breakfast.

488
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,467
This will perk everyone up.

489
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,859
Some of Aunt Fanny's
fresh-brewed grease.

490
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:18,542
Yummy!

491
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,023
Careful, it’s hot.

492
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,716
So, what are you guys doing today?

493
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,424
-We're doing it.
-What about you?

494
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,589
Bigweld’s disappeared,
and you're sitting here.

495
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,546
That's already been established.

496
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,714
-l gotta find out what happened to him.
-Hey, you want my advice?

497
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,877
-Sure.
-Forget it.

498
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,370
“Never try, never fail.”
Those are the words I live by.

499
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,667
Crank, the idol of millions is gone,
and no one seems to care.

500
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,267
There should be an angry mob
out there.

501
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:53,116
What the--?

502
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,311
Wow, that was great, psychic friend.

503
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,772
Now say, "Money should be
falling from the sky.”

504
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:04,557
Say it. Say it.

505
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,684
Sorry, folks, all sold out.

506
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,180
Nothing but upgrades from here on in.

507
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,031
But I like myself just the way I am.

508
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,735
-We can't afford upgrades!
-Let’s get him!

509
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,895
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
Don’t throw me.

510
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,985
Isn't that the guy
that fixed Fender’s neck?

511
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:24,870
Yeah, that guy fixes bots.

512
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,859
Yeah, that kid can help you.

513
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,245
Brace yourself.
You're about to get popular.

514
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:32,275
Only those with insurance.

515
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,293
Oh, I forgot. Everybody, come on.

516
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,209
Parts, man. I need parts.

517
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,058
You don’t look that...bad.

518
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:44,877
-Hey, everybody, spare parts!
-Yeah!

519
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,176
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What’s wrong with you robots?

520
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,733
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves.

521
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:52,492
Why do you have two noses?

522
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,560
One’s for showing, one’s for blowing.

523
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,100
-Sorry.
-Hey, could you look at my arm?

524
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,841
-Nice grip.
-Like iron.

525
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,070
-l can’t get rid of this spare tire.
-l am losing my mind.

526
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,440
Back off, back off.

527
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:10,192
He’s got his own dreams
that won't come true.

528
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,253
See a need, fill a need.

529
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,366
Wait.

530
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,176
Who wants to get fixed?

531
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,520
Thanks, Rodney. You’re number one.

532
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,289
Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!

533
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,298
Oh, yeah.

534
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:42,574
I have never felt so relaxed.

535
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:46,927
Say, do you mind giving me a little
scratch between the shoulder blades?

536
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:50,322
There you-- Easy, tiger.

537
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,285
Hey! Take it easy.

538
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,740
Hey, what are you trying to do,
kill me?

539
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,566
Relax. It's me, your mommy.

540
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,524
-How did you get in here?
-l came up the air shaft.

541
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,375
I know you don't like
anybody here to see me.

542
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,361
-Well, what do you want?
-Someone's fixing them.

543
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:09,601
-What?
-Someone is repairing outmodes...

544
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,484
-...and they are laughing at you.
-Who?

545
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,180
And are you sure they're not
laughing with me?

546
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,053
Yes.

547
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:20,785
So what if one crazy fanatic repairs
a few outmodes? Who cares?

548
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:24,585
Think. Use those brains
I stole for you. Today, it’s one.

549
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,833
What about tomorrow, when
everybody gets the idea this is okay?

550
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,821
“We can fix ourselves.
We don't need upgrades.

551
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:32,562
We want Bigweld.”

552
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,660
Then what happens to you?

553
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,802
Okay, okay. Take it easy.

554
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,845
We've got to find out
who this is and stop him.

555
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:43,658
Not stop him, crush him, destroy him.

556
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:48,028
And by the way, ! brought you
a little something for your desk.

557
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:58,866
-ls there anyone else waiting?
-Let me look.

558
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,129
-A few.
-"A few"?

559
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,314
What did you expect, Rodney?
Bigweld was gone.

560
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:10,967
Sweepers were on the loose,
but then came Copperbottom.

561
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,906
I'm getting all static-y
just thinking about it.

562
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,868
I'm not Bigweld.
These robots need parts.

563
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:19,748
Mail call. Mail call.

564
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,328
Copperbottom,
this one’s from your mom.

565
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,623
Oh, is there anything for me?

566
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,452
Oh, I got something for you.

567
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,505
That's from my sister.

568
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,210
l recognize the handwriting.

569
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,456
Is anything wrong?

570
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,878
I'll say. His father’s got
one foot in the junkyard...

571
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:40,685
...and if they can’t find new parts
for him, he’s only got a few miles left.

572
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:44,066
Rodney, are you really worried
about your dad?

573
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,975
Do you wanna go home?

574
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,167
Well, if 1 go home,
I still can’t help him.

575
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:50,826
We're out of parts.
We've gotta get to Bigweld.

576
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:54,032
He’s the only one that can fix this.

577
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:59,454
He’s trying to tell us something.
What is it, boy? What's wrong?

578
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,994
Bigweld is going...

579
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,697
.. dancing.

580
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:07,719
Of course, the Bigweld Ball.

581
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,852
You can’t have the Bigweld Ball
without Bigweld.

582
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:13,772
Well, that’s it, then.
I'm going to the Bigweld Ball.

583
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,167
What? That's the fanciest party
of the year.

584
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,064
You'll never get past the gate.

585
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,843
-Can I help you?
-l think maybe you can.

586
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,226
This is Count Roderick
von Brokenzipper.

587
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,570
Formerly Count Velcro.

588
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,166
Where are the trumpets?

589
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,024
We were promised trumpets
to announce the count'’s arrival.

590
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:46,401
Sorry, Your Grace.
Beat me until you're happy.

591
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,957
He’s happy. And I’m not feeling
too bad myself.

592
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,991
-Let me-- You're not on the list.
-We're what?

593
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,278
Once again.

594
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:59,951
Thank you. Fine, we will go.

595
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,973
You'll explain to your superiors...

596
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,130
...why we were not able to attend your
little luau, barn dance, whatever it is.

597
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,664
But we're leaving in a huff.

598
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:11,522
No, no. No. Please, go right in.

599
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,686
In fact, would the count
like to hit me?

600
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,902
The count hit you?
The arrogance of some people.

601
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:21,042
I will hit you on his behalf.

602
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,690
Thank you, Your Grace.

603
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,214
Okay, let's split up.

604
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:31,066
If you see Bigweld, come and find me.

605
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,099
If anything goes wrong,
we'll signal each other.

606
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:37,742
What kind of signal do you want?
You want something kind of subtle, like:

607
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,420
Or:

608
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:43,109
Oh, how about this:

609
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,194
Ricola!

610
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,076
Subtle. Let’s get to work.

611
00:48:54,899 --> 00:48:57,269
A screwdriver, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

612
00:48:57,802 --> 00:48:59,062
Yes, sir.

613
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,857
V'll have what he’s having.

614
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:24,124
You know, Cappy, it’s nice that you
can see me like this, away from work.

615
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:28,399
See my more casual, fun-loving side.

616
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:34,316
Now, where were we?

617
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:37,828
Well, there are never any
interesting men at these parties.

618
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,842
Hello, ladies.
Fender von Fender at your service.

619
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,795
Hi, I'm Loretta...

620
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,361
...Geargrinder.

621
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:49,669
Anyone dressed as badly as you are
must be an eccentric billionaire.

622
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,312
Ladies and gentlebots,
now coming to the stage...

623
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:56,669
...the top bot, the big bolt...

624
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,377
..-who's your daddy?
Mr. Phineas T. Ratchet.

625
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,881
Thank you. We now come
to the point of the evening...

626
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,428
...where I have the tremendous honor
of introducing...

627
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,788
-Excuse me. Sorry.
-...our beloved founder, Mr. Bigweld...

628
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,627
...who, unfortunately,
is unable to attend.

629
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,489
-What?
-He sends his apologies...

630
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,234
..-his love and a small box
of assorted cookies.

631
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:23,428
-Not coming?
-And what are you doing here?

632
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:25,477
What have you done with Bigweld?

633
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:29,685
How come we don’t see him
anymore, huh?

634
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,913
Okay. Security,
we have a party-crasher.

635
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:37,187
Yeah, that’s right, and I had to put
all this junk on in order to get in here...

636
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:41,682
...so that I could tell Bigweld
that you are outmoding millions of bots.

637
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,296
And I know because
I spend all day fixing them.

638
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,186
You.

639
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:10,687
Oh, my darling, that is the cry
of the deep-doo-doo bird.

640
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:12,945
I must fly.

641
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:15,868
Take him for a drive...

642
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,720
..and bring me back
his exact weight in paper clips.

643
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,605
-No!
-No?

644
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,398
Pll escort him out.

645
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,424
You don’t wanna look bad
in front of your people, do you?

646
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:31,244
-Good point.
-When I get back...

647
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,432
...['Il show you my casual,
fun-loving side.

648
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,321
Oh, you.

649
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,689
-Get moving.
-What? What are you doing?

650
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:39,832
Saving your life.

651
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:42,635
-Come on.
-Let him go.

652
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:44,497
Let him go. Let him go.

653
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:46,802
-Get out of here, you idiot.
-Get him!

654
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:48,854
-Fender, let’s go.
-You know him?

655
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,703
Fender, wait for me.

656
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,902
Wonderbot.

657
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,695
Get out of my way!

658
00:51:58,182 --> 00:51:59,991
Hey, Tim,
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

659
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,234
Oh, you again.

660
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,720
Oh, that was amazing.

661
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,085
-So where do we go now?
-I'm taking you to the train station.

662
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:14,542
-What? No way.
-You don't know what you're dealing with.

663
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,152
Ratchet will use your head
for a hood ornament.

664
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,805
I'm not leaving until I find Bigweld.

665
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:21,914
-That’s not--
-Can't you take me to him?

666
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:26,508
I must be out of my mind.

667
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,477
Au réservoir, my darling.

668
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:43,918
-Thanks for walking me home.
-Thanks for carrying me up that hill.

669
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,221
-Until tomorrow?
-[ shall count the seconds.

670
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:49,732
So far, I’m up to four.

671
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,901
You crazy nut boy.

672
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:55,337
Crazy about you.

673
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:11,105
I'm singing in the oif

674
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,625
I'm singing in the oif

675
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,685
After all that work and toil

676
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:21,598
I'm just slipping in the oil

677
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:25,226
i know where I've been sent

678
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:28,825
i'm covered in lubricant

679
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,256
My life has turned around.

680
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:35,169
From now on, I'm a winner!

681
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,660
Stop, you've made a mistake.
I'm alive. You can’t do this.

682
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,266
Help.

683
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,326
Okay, we tried. Let's get out of here.

684
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:53,072
No, no, no. Something's up.

685
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,196
Look at all these newspapers
and this mail.

686
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,092
Come on. They probably
stopped delivering these years ago.

687
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,035
Paper.

688
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:03,876
Late edition.

689
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:07,064
-You say something?
-Nice one of you.

690
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,013
Come on.
We gotta get you out of here.

691
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,011
Big, creaky door.

692
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:22,485
Perfect.

693
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,838
Look at this.

694
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:52,034
This is Bigweld’s actual workshop.

695
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,219
l recognize it from his old TV show.

696
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,728
Could you keep it down?
We're not supposed to be here.

697
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,624
Do you know what these are?

698
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:04,339
These are Bigweld’s
original invention designs.

699
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,558
-That’s his own writing.
-This is strange.

700
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,158
How come it just stops in the middle?

701
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,391
Look at this.

702
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:16,002
Remember, he used to have
these on his show?

703
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,697
Rodney, I don’t know
how to tell you this, but--

704
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:21,023
Why are they so dusty?

705
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,125
Wait, don’t.

706
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:51,993
This is much more elaborate
than the ones on his show.

707
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,481
Rodney, what do we do?

708
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:33,077
I don’t know.
This is kind of a first for me.

709
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,613
-Yeah!
-It’s him.

710
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,991
-Who’s the king of the beach?
-Are you all right?

711
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:58,118
Well, considering I’m an old fat guy
who just crashed to the floor...

712
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,215
...[’'m fantastic.
Now, who the heck are you?

713
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,862
I'm Rodney.

714
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,799
Oh, I thought you were
the dominoes delivery boy.

715
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:08,819
Come on, let’s set them up again,
only bigger.

716
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:11,913
Sir, is this what you've
been working on?

717
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:15,016
This is why no one sees you?

718
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:18,426
Young man,
nobody likes a chatterbox.

719
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,732
But there’s a terrible crisis,
Mr. Bigweld.

720
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:23,205
We need to talk.

721
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:28,264
Son, I’ve gotta tell you,
you're making a lousy first impression.

722
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:32,759
Please, sir, he is your biggest fan.
In fact, he’s an inventor just like you.

723
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,233
-Well....
-Show him that thing you made.

724
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,721
A device? A doohickey?
A thingamajig?

725
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,450
Now, don't be scared.
Show Mr. Bigweld what you can do.

726
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,116
Go on. It’s okay.

727
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,726
Is that what it's supposed to do?

728
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:56,241
It gets nervous under pressure--

729
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,863
Son, let me give you
a good piece of advice.

730
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:01,016
-Yes?
-Give up.

731
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:03,755
What? You're telling me to quit?

732
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,033
I said "give up,”
but "quit" works just as good.

733
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:11,423
Is that what you did?
Is that why you're sitting here...

734
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,728
.. letting Ratchet turn robots
like my father into outmodes?

735
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,845
Kid, sometimes you just gotta know
when you're licked.

736
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:21,495
But you're Bigweld.
You can fix anything.

737
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:23,422
l used to think so.

738
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,703
To me, having the company
was all about making life better.

739
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,997
With Ratchet, it was making money
that came first.

740
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:34,174
I became old-fashioned, an outmode.

741
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:38,208
Go home, kid.
If he beat me, he’s gonna beat you.

742
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,749
The world you're looking for
no longer exists. You missed it.

743
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,932
Find some other foolish dream.

744
00:58:44,388 --> 00:58:46,698
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm very, very...

745
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:49,774
..-very busy.

746
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,744
Yeah, I can see that.

747
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,058
All l ever wanted
was to grow up to be like him.

748
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,413
Help. Open the door.

749
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,628
Open the door.

750
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,192
Close the door. Close the door!

751
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,024
Wow, look at all these parts.
It’s a smorgasbord.

752
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,147
Look at that. So many things
I've wanted all my life.

753
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:34,997
Oh, that's pretty.

754
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:54,446
Okay, Mother, this way.

755
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,658
Let me look, please. I can’t bear it.

756
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,260
No peeking, now. It’s a surprise.

757
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:00,903
Oh, you are a wicked boy.

758
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,554
And look.

759
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,852
-For me?
-It’s got a full tank of gas.

760
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,069
If you're ready to mow,
she’s ready to go.

761
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:11,195
Has any mother ever had a better son?

762
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,115
By the way, I found out
who's been fixing those outmodes.

763
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:15,904
So tomorrow, these babies...

764
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,499
..are gonna chop him up
along with all his buddies...

765
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,975
..and every other walking pile of junk
I'm sick of looking at.

766
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,217
What's that?

767
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:57,759
This is so wrong. This is so wrong.

768
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,115
Help.

769
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,528
Help!

770
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,246
Rivet Town, please. One-way.

771
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:17,283
Hi, Mom.

772
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:20,421
Oh, I’m doing fine. How are you?

773
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,321
-And Dad?
-He’s right here. I'll put him on.

774
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,171
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

775
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,297
Hey, Dad. How are you feeling?

776
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:32,559
Oh, fine, fine. l....

777
01:01:33,957 --> 01:01:35,737
I've just been a little
under the weather.

778
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,943
No, we're just having a little trouble...

779
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:41,085
..finding your old man
a replacement part, that’s all.

780
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,067
But let’s talk about you.
What kind of work are you doing?

781
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,151
What's Bigweld like?
Did you meet him?

782
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,050
Yeah, I met him, but....

783
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:51,703
What’s wrong, son?

784
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:55,148
It's not how we thought it was, Dad.

785
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:58,239
It’s not.... l can’t....

786
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,719
I see.

787
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:03,107
-I'm really sorry I let you down.
-No, no, no.

788
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:06,017
You could never let me down, Rodney.

789
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,415
Listen, I know it isn’t easy, Rodney...

790
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:14,185
...but a dream
that you don’t fight for...

791
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:17,798
...can haunt you
for the rest of your life.

792
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:20,939
Yeah, Dad.

793
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:23,264
it's up to you, son.

794
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,980
-Your father loves you very much.
-l know.

795
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,040
With our Friends and Family plan, you
can talk to him 500 minutes a month.

796
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,058
Free nights and weekends.

797
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:38,563
Yoo-hoo, Rodney!

798
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,484
Wait.

799
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:44,108
-Your suitcase.
-Thanks, Aunt Fanny, but I’m--

800
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:46,941
The others wanted to come
and see you off too.

801
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:48,724
Well, why didn’t they?

802
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,649
Oh, they did.

803
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,400
Next time, let's split a cab.

804
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,121
Who the heck is she?

805
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,240
l used to have a figure like that.

806
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,803
Hurry, come on.
One ticket to anywhere.

807
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,759
Fender?

808
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,701
I have a sister.

809
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,163
An ugly sister.

810
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,932
Hey, guess what. It’s the sweepers.

811
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,558
They're rounding up outmodes
and taking them-- What "them"? Us.

812
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,775
--to Madame Gasket's chop shop.

813
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,597
-And guess who's really behind it all.
-Ratchet.

814
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,337
You don’t wanna guess?
l ran all this way in heels.

815
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,145
-Come on, take a stab.
-Ratchet.

816
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:31,155
Ratchet! Listen to me. Listen to me.

817
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:34,898
-We won't last a week.
-Okay, okay. Settle down. I got a plan.

818
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,628
-Let’s all get on that train.
-Come on.

819
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,338
Hey, wait a minute.
You're all giving up?

820
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,580
-You started it.
-Well, I'm ending it.

821
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:45,508
My mistake was hoping that Bigweld
would fight our battles.

822
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:47,869
Well, he won't. It’s up to us.

823
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:50,668
If we don’t do something
about Ratchet, no one will.

824
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,716
Come on, let’s fight back.

825
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,863
Fighting never solved anything.

826
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,612
Quitting isn’t so productive either.
I gotta tell you.

827
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,838
It’s the big boy.

828
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,053
Oh, be still, my pump.

829
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:04,969
Kid, if you're gonna fight,
I'm going in with you.

830
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,678
You-- You are?

831
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:09,763
Hey, who's the dame
with the sweet keister?

832
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,637
-But why?
-I don’t know.

833
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,795
I'm a big guy,
and I like women with large--

834
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,530
No, no, no.
Why are you gonna help us?

835
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,953
Because I wanna grow up
to be like you.

836
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,837
Then let’s do it.

837
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:30,772
Come on, gang. Let's give
that Ratchet an old-school fix-it!

838
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,619
Oh, what a man.

839
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,093
Someone get a crane.

840
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:47,309
Mother, I’m an adult, okay?

841
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,377
So stop telling me how to kill Bigweld.
I'm doing it today...

842
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:54,614
. how I want, where I want
and with whatever I want.

843
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,715
Okay, boardroom, 10 minutes.
l want you both there.

844
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,404
Mr. Bigweld, should we come too?

845
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:06,774
No, no. You stay here...

846
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,867
-...and watch Daddy's limo.
-Yes, sir.

847
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,053
I'm going inside to kick some booty.

848
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,404
Hey, you know,
your boyfriend here is a genius.

849
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,311
-What?
-Oh, he’s not my-- He is?

850
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:18,173
lam?

851
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,556
Thanks for still believing in me.

852
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,832
It’s good to be home. Toodley-oodley!

853
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:38,028
l use the Brazilian wax. It makes me
feel like every day's a fiesta.

854
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:40,365
Tell Mr. Ratchet his 10:00 is here.

855
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:42,034
I'm all over it. Yes, sir.

856
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:50,611
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

857
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:53,214
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

858
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,270
Oh, Mr. Bigweld.

859
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,096
No, no. Tell him I’m not here.

860
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,955
-Tell him anything, just don’t let him in.
-Ratchet!

861
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:09,534
-l'll cut to the point.
-What happened?

862
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,576
Run out of dominoes?
I'll send you more.

863
01:06:12,035 --> 01:06:14,205
-You're fired!
-Fired? On what grounds?

864
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,547
This company's
never been more profitable.

865
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,590
Profit, schmofit. Now, get out.

866
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,622
No, wait, please listen to me.
You can't do this to me.

867
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:24,728
This job is my life.
It means everything to me.

868
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,061
You don’t know
what I’ve done to get here.

869
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:31,680
The lies I've told. The lives I’ve ruined.
This isn't helping me.

870
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,752
-Get me security.
-Wait, please.

871
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,601
Can't I just make
one more heartfelt plea?

872
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:39,707
Okay, what did you wanna say?

873
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,469
That.

874
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,125
Oh, my gosh.
I'm as crazy as my mother.

875
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,890
Take that fish to the chop shop
and put my name on his parking space.

876
01:06:58,648 --> 01:06:59,878
Let go of him.

877
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,814
Sure. Listen, kid, it’s over. You lost.

878
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,260
Bigweld is gonna be melted down
into next season's upgrades...

879
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:11,367
.. along with you,
your moronic coffeepot and Cappy.

880
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,741
Such a waste.

881
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:51,839
Mr. Bigweld, are you okay?

882
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:54,698
I'm the prettiest girl
at the Harvest Moon Ball.

883
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,261
I'll take that as a “no.”

884
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,320
Out of the way!

885
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:16,158
Rodney.

886
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,778
Road trip! Road trip! Road trip!

887
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,706
You guys are so embarrassing.

888
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:36,447
Oh, that’s Rodney.
He's in some kind of trouble.

889
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,580
I've gotta repair him.

890
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:41,091
Okay, I got your back.

891
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:49,752
Come on, we've gotta help Rodney.

892
01:08:52,028 --> 01:08:54,338
-No, Piper, you stay here.
-No way.

893
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:57,557
Let's be honest. We're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

894
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,094
Whatever happens to us,
make something of yourself.

895
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,720
You're the only thing
I've got to leave behind. Goodbye!

896
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:05,567
He's right, Piper.

897
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:07,902
They're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

898
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,263
Okay, got it!

899
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,379
Rodney, what’s going on?
Where are we?

900
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:46,304
It's okay. You're all right.

901
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,253
Okay, boys, we got them
tight where they want us.

902
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:10,999
Boost me up.

903
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:13,878
Watch your hands down there.

904
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:18,072
Rodney! We're here to save you!

905
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,049
How do you think it’s going so far?

906
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,099
The plug.

907
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:41,131
Hold on, guys!
I gotta get to the other side.

908
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:14,095
We're out of here!

909
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:35,753
The chop shop.

910
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:39,322
-That’s it. Game over.
-The game is not over.

911
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:41,919
This is our moment to shine.

912
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,941
This is where you show
what you're really made of.

913
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,963
In my case, it’s a rare metal.
It’s called "afraidium.”

914
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:52,653
It’s yellow. It tastes like chicken.

915
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:56,267
I didn’t know I could do that.

916
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:57,912
Rodney's right.

917
01:11:58,281 --> 01:12:02,971
lam tired of just complaining
and never doing anything.

918
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,160
[-- [--

919
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:07,572
Il wanna try.

920
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:09,254
No. Forget it. I'm sorry. No.

921
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:12,465
Yes! I want to try.

922
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:14,739
Then you're first.

923
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,460
First for what?

924
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:22,208
They want us to upgrade?
Then let's upgrade.

925
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:31,751
Gasket, you're a sick, twisted,
evil robot.

926
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:33,471
I try.

927
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,361
Oh, good.

928
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:09,273
Company.

929
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:13,845
So you're the little glob of tin
who's been making all the trouble.

930
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,150
Who are these losers?

931
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:18,402
-We, sir--
-’m a woman.

932
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,155
Ouch.

933
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,869
We've come to rescue our friend,
you evil bag of bolts.

934
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,119
And you will be defeated
by the very outmodes...

935
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:29,512
...that you scorned and defaced.

936
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:33,272
Yeah, because there’s seven of us
and only one of you.

937
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,801
There’s seven of us and-- Eight, nine--

938
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,017
-Did you count that one?
-I think so.

939
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:45,946
Could you all stop moving around?!
It’s so frustrating!

940
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:48,039
I think 1 counted one of you twice!

941
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:51,301
While you're at it, count these.

942
01:13:56,799 --> 01:14:00,279
As soon as we're done with you,
these hit the streets.

943
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:05,364
This is the last day
any outmode will ever see.

944
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,607
Did I miss the butt-whupping?

945
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,701
-No.
-Matter of fact, you're a little bit early.

946
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:29,761
Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!

947
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:33,223
-Well, let’s get started.
-Testify, sister!

948
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,010
-Charge!
-Charge!

949
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:02,733
Oh, no! He's got a steel chair.

950
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:08,317
But he's back up into a neck-breaker.

951
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,705
He's up to the top rope.

952
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,333
-Look at the hang time!
-That's sure gonna leave a dent.

953
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,034
Say hello to my dimpled friend.

954
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:20,251
This is gonna get greasy!

955
01:17:24,907 --> 01:17:28,387
-Are you thinking what I’m thinking?
-l sure am.

956
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:45,475
See a need, fill a need!

957
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:47,871
This isn’t what 1 was thinking at all.

958
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:03,386
What are you doing? Get off me.

959
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:08,050
Let me go! Do as I say. Get off!

960
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,769
Ma!

961
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,667
My upgrades!

962
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:46,719
It’s all right, son.
You can shine no matter what you--

963
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:49,816
No! Just stop!

964
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,501
Come on, Rodney.

965
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:54,349
Let’s open the gates
of Bigweld Industries forever.

966
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:57,887
Wait a minute.
There's one thing I need to do first.

967
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,534
Herb!

968
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,549
-Herb!
-Honey, what are you doing here?

969
01:19:06,008 --> 01:19:08,117
-It's Rodney, honey.
-Rodney? Is he all right?

970
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:09,921
Come outside. Hurry.

971
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,242
Copperbottom, where are you going?

972
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:14,145
What about the dishes?

973
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,860
Hey, get back here!

974
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,590
You'll never wash in this town again.

975
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,527
What is all this?
The whole town is out here.

976
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,311
-Rodney?
-Dad!

977
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,354
There’s someone !I want you to meet.

978
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,776
-Is that--?
-That’s Bigweld, Dad...

979
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,138
...the greatest robot in the world.

980
01:19:38,641 --> 01:19:40,040
Besides you.

981
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:44,346
-l understand you need a few parts.
-Well, I'm not one to complain.

982
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,950
Well, then don't. I’ve brought
enough parts to make two of you.

983
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:53,188
Ladies and gentlebots...

984
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:56,222
...l came all this way--

985
01:19:56,759 --> 01:19:58,779
Would you cut that out?
It’s very distracting.

986
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:00,551
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

987
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,103
Where was I?

988
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,624
Mr. and Mrs. Copperbottom,
I came all this way...

989
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:09,368
...to tell you in person
that your son, Rodney...

990
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:13,172
...the man who got me
off my big titanium tochis...

991
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:18,232
..is now my right-hand bot
and my eventual successor.

992
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,097
Way to go, Rodney!

993
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:27,798
Oh, Mom.

994
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:30,668
Son.

995
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,151
Dad, I know you kind of felt bad
when I was growing up...

996
01:20:35,698 --> 01:20:38,248
...that you couldn't give me
a lot of stuff.

997
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,614
But you gave me
the most important thing:

998
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:42,746
You believed in me.

999
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,119
From the second you were born.

1000
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:49,065
Well, Dad, now I want your dream
to come true.

1001
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:53,053
Dad, you always wanted to be
noe
a musician.

1002
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:56,135
Now be one, for everyone to hear.

1003
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,515
Good for you, Herb!
You did good!

1004
01:21:10,132 --> 01:21:11,442
-Good job!
-Way to go.

1005
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,357
Now I’m sure I’ve got a heart,
because it’s aching.

1006
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:17,611
You'll have to forgive me.

1007
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,190
I'm a little rusty.

1008
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,340
Well, there goes our happy ending.

1009
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:39,372
No. It’s a fusion of jazz and funk.

1010
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,218
It’s called "junk."

1011
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,111
I love you, Herb!

1012
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,865
-Fender!
-Loretta, my darling.

1013
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:25,732
Sorry.

1014
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:33,123
I was on the list!
Don't you know who I am? Wait!
