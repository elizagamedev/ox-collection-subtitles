1
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,776
We come in peace
for cats and mice everywhere.

2
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,411
Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

3
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,146
ltchy.... Itchy...

4
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,771
Boring!

5
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,940
Dad, we can’t see the movie.

6
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,889
I can’t believe we're paying to see
something we get on TV for free.

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,880
If you ask me, everybody in this theater
is a giant sucker.

8
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,978
Especially you.

9
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,264
Movie on the big screen!

10
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,769
Excuse me. My heinie is dipping.

11
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,644
All right, well, thanks a lot for coming.

12
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,243
We've been playing
for three and a half hours.

13
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,549
Now we'd like just a minute of your time
to say something about the environment.

14
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,801
-You suck!
-Shut up and play!

15
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,452
-Preachy!
-We're not being preachy.

16
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,642
But the pollution in your lake,
it’s dissolving our barge.

17
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,226
I thought they touched on a vital issue.

18
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,391
I beg to differ.

19
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,468
Gentlemen, it’s been an honor
playing with you tonight.

20
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,410
For the latest rock band
to die in our town...

21
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,776
...Lord, hear our prayer.

22
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,575
Lord, hear our prayer.

23
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,889
I hate being late.

24
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,260
Well, I hate going.

25
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,385
Why can’t I worship the Lord
.
In my own way...

26
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,421
...by praying like hell on my deathbed?

27
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,332
Homer, they can hear you inside.

28
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:39,465
Relax. Those pious morons are too busy
talking to their phony-baloney God.

29
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,713
How you doing? Peace be with you.
Praise Jebus.

30
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,537
Today I'd like to try something
a little different.

31
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,025
I'm going to call on one of you!

32
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,107
Now, the word of God
dwells within everyone.

33
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,510
l want you to let that word out.
Let your spirit--

34
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,537
What is it, Ned?

35
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,053
The good Lord is telling me
to confess to something.

36
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,312
Gay, gay, gay.

37
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,504
An immodest sense of pride
in our community.

38
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,765
Somebody else?

39
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,883
Let the Lord's light shine upon you.

40
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,374
Feel the spirit.

41
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,834
Let it out!

42
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,139
Horrible, horrible things
are going to happen!

43
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,660
And they’re gonna happen to you!
And you! And you! And you.

44
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,574
Whoa, nelly!

45
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,927
People of Springfield, heed this warning:

46
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,570
Twisted tail!

47
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,034
A thousand eyes!

48
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,353
Trapped forever!

49
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,695
Dad, do something!

50
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,602
This book doesn't have any answers!

51
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,223
Beware! Beware! Time is short!

52
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,313
Believe me! Believe me!

53
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,429
Thanks for listening.

54
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,877
Okay, who wants waffles?

55
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,284
I do, I do, I do!

56
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,950
Wait a minute. What about Grampa?

57
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,732
-l want syrup!
-l want strawberries!

58
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,593
Something happened to that man.

59
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:43,132
Ill tell you what happened to him.
A certain someone had a senior moment.

60
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:49,037
But that’s okay, because we love him
and we got a free rug out of it.

61
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,120
What is the point of going to church
every Sunday...

62
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,336
...when if someone we love has a genuine
religious experience, we ignore it?

63
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,633
Right, Grampa?

64
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,984
l want bananas on my waffles.

65
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,948
l rest my case.

66
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,414
I'm not dropping this.

67
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,521
Wait a minute. I'm still in the car.

68
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,737
Oh, right.

69
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,958
“Take out hornets’ nest.”

70
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,599
Check. "Fix sinkhole.”

71
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,787
Check.

72
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,745
"Re-shingle roof"?

73
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,857
Steady.

74
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,816
Steady.

75
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,107
Why, you little--!

76
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,292
I'll teach you to laugh
at something that’s funny!

77
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,660
You know, we are on the roof.
We could have some fun.

78
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,847
What kind of fun?

79
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,489
How about a dare contest?

80
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,683
That sounds fun. I dare you to...

81
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,570
..climb the TV antenna!

82
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,994
-Piece of cake.
-Earthquake!

83
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,712
Aftershock!

84
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,554
Homer, I don’t mean
to be a Nervous Pervis...

85
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,454
...but if he falls, couldn’t that
make your boy a paraplege-arino?

86
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,525
Shut up, Flanders.

87
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,228
Yeah, shut up, Flanders.

88
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,474
Well said, boy.

89
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,341
Steady. Steady.

90
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,786
Steady....

91
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,543
Hello. Sorry to bother you on a Sunday...

92
00:08:56,069 --> 00:09:00,459
...but I'm sure you're as worried about
the pollution in Lake Springfield as I am.

93
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:10,166
Lake Springfield has higher levels
of mercury than ev--

94
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,310
Why, it’s the little girl who saved my cat.

95
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,160
Lake Springfield is--

96
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:22,549
1

97
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,902
Come on over, Lisa.

98
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,831
You can canvass me
as long as you want.

99
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,601
Milhouse, you don't care
about the environment.

100
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,457
Hey. I am very passionate
about the planet.

101
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,127
Say global warming is a myth.

102
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,508
It's a myth! Further study is needed!

103
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,875
That's for selling out your beliefs.

104
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,233
Oh, poor Milhouse.

105
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,059
Dream coming true.

106
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,700
Are you aware that a leaky faucet
can waste over--?

107
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,494
Two thousand gallons a year.

108
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,272
-Turning off lights can save--
-Enough energy to power Pittsburgh.

109
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,709
And if we kept our thermostats
at 68 in winter--

110
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,928
We'd be free from our dependency
on foreign oil in 17 years.

111
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,834
I'm Colin.

112
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,646
l haven't seen you at school.

113
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,721
Moved from Ireland. My dad's a musician.

114
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,523
-Is he...?
-He’s not Bono.

115
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,942
-l just thought, because you're Irish and--
-He’s not Bono.

116
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:23,876
Do you play?

117
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,954
Just piano, guitar, trumpet,
drums and bass.

118
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:30,383
He's pure gold.
For once in your life, be cool.

119
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,851
So is your name as pretty as your face?

120
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,828
You okay there?

121
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,569
Twisted tail! A thousand eyes!
Trapped forever!

122
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,135
What could that be?

123
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,573
I believe it’s the sound
the Green Lantern made...

124
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,746
...when Sinestro threw him
into a vat of acid.

125
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,221
Yeah. Thanks for coming over.

126
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,731
Thanks for giving me
your pregnancy pants.

127
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,160
Never known comfort like this.

128
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,102
Why did I suggest this?

129
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,468
All right, boy, time for the ultimate dare.

130
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:31,773
I dare you to skateboard
to Krusty Burger and back...

131
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,305
.. naked.

132
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,418
-How naked?
-Fourth base.

133
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:37,883
Girls might see my doodle.

134
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:42,604
Oh, I see. Then I hereby
declare you chicken for life.

135
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,896
Every morning, you'll wake up to
"Good morning, chicken.”

136
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,156
At your wedding, I'll sing:

137
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,400
Il like men now.

138
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,762
Don't look where I’m pointing!

139
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,193
Stop in the name of
American squeamishness!

140
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,698
Boys, before we eat, don’t forget
to thank the Lord for this bountiful--

141
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,299
Penis?!

142
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,364
-Bountiful penis.
-Bountiful penis.

143
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,793
Amen.

144
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,585
Listen, kid, nobody likes wearing clothes
in public, but, you know, it’s the law.

145
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,053
Lunchtime!

146
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,061
You can't just leave me out here.

147
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,504
Don't worry, we found
a friend for you to play with.

148
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,216
Nelson, honey, where have you been?

149
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,404
-Dad!
-What seems to be the problem, officers?

150
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,580
Tell him you dared me to do it.

151
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,199
If that’s true, then you should be
taking the rap here, not your son.

152
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,238
And what happens to me if it's my fault?

153
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,311
You'll have to attend
a one-hour parenting class.

154
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,105
It was all his idea!
He’s out of control, I tell you!

155
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,704
I'm at my wits’ end.

156
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,013
It’s so....

157
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,399
See you in court, kid.

158
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,670
Okay, son, let’s get some lunch.

159
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,624
Did you at least bring my clothes?

160
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,718
Shirt, socks, everything you need.

161
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,328
-You didn’t bring my pants.
-Who am I, Tommy Bahama?

162
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,592
This is the worst day of my life.

163
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,670
The worst day of your life so far.

164
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,970
-Say, Bart?
-What do you want, Flanders?

165
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,886
If you need pants, I carry an extra pair.

166
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,793
You know how boys are,
always praying through the knees.

167
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,316
Why are you helping me?
I'm not your kid.

168
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:22,285
We're neighbors. I’m sure your father
would do the same for my boys.

169
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,225
Thank you.

170
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,117
-Hey, what’s with you?
-You really wanna know?

171
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:35,814
Of course I do.

172
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,378
What kind of a father
wouldn't care about--?

173
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:39,930
A pig wearing a hat!

174
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,314
Action.

175
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:47,055
Hey, hey! It’s your old pal Krusty,
for my new pork sandwich, the Klogger.

176
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:52,164
If you can find a greasier sandwich,
you're in Mexico!

177
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,883
And we're clear.

178
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,039
Perfect. Cut, print, kill the pig.

179
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,063
What--?! You can’t kill him
if he’s wearing people clothes!

180
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,293
You're coming home with me.

181
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,771
"A thousand eyes.” What could that be?

182
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,629
I'm pretty sure a thousand is a number.

183
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,463
Hey, Marge. Isn't it great being married
to someone who's recklessly impulsive?

184
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,022
Actually, it's aged me horribly.

185
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,026
Then say hello to the newest Simpson.

186
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,780
Homer!

187
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,719
I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

188
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,274
Please, get rid of that pig.

189
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,100
Oh, you're gonna love him.
Look, he does an impression of you.

190
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,141
You nailed her.

191
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,185
He also does me.

192
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,447
You smiled. I'm off the hook.

193
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,448
Oh, you have so many looks.

194
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,555
So that’s what snug is.

195
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,967
Who's a good pig?

196
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,847
Who's a good pig?

197
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,622
Rough day, huh, son?

198
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,109
You don’t know what rough is, sister.

199
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,728
Bart, you know, whenever my boys bake up
a batch of frownies, I take them fishing.

200
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,427
Does your dad ever take you fishing?

201
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,998
Dad, it’s not fair to use a bug zapper
to catch the fish.

202
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,709
If you love fish like I do,
you want them to die with dignity.

203
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,078
I think I have a nibble.

204
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,379
I think fishing might be
more fun with you.

205
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,351
Oh, great. Now, how about
l fix you some cocoa?

206
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,538
No way. Cocoa’s for wusses.

207
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,486
Well, sir, if you change your mind,
it’s on the windowsill.

208
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,495
Oh, my God.

209
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,079
Oh, wait. I didn’t tell you the best part.
He loves the environment.

210
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,703
Oh, wait! I still didn’t tell you the best part.
He’s got an Irish brogue.

211
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,717
No, no, wait!
I still didn’t tell you the best part.

212
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,847
He’s not imaginary!

213
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,032
Oh, honey, that's great.

214
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,873
But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

215
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,445
Because nothing means more
than for a man to--

216
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,509
How did the pig tracks get on the ceiling?

217
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,952
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig

218
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,621
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

219
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,083
Can he swing from a web?

220
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,369
No, he can't, he's a pig

221
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,227
Look out
He is a Spider-Pig

222
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:55,994
Are we having fun yet?

223
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:57,922
We are now. You've got a bite.

224
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,391
Whoa, mama!

225
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,357
Oh, no, my good pole!

226
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,716
You're not strangling me.

227
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,258
What the--? Strangling’s only good for....

228
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,685
Well, it's not good for anything.

229
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,901
The only time you should
lay hands on a boy...

230
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,970
..jis to give him
a good pat on the back.

231
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,095
Hey, what the hell are you--?

232
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,757
One more time.

233
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,643
Honey, I’m home.

234
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,297
We are at the tipping point, people.

235
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,340
If we don’t do something now....

236
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,379
I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Isn’t he dreamy?

237
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,990
Agreed.

238
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,675
Okay, so here's the bottom line:

239
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,879
If we don’t change our ways right now...

240
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,678
...pollution in Lake Springfield
will be at this level.

241
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,247
That's not so bad.

242
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,132
No, the lift is stuck.

243
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,641
Am I getting through to anyone?

244
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,343
Hell, yeah.
We need a new one of those things.

245
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,879
All in favor of a new scissor lift,
say "aye."

246
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,912
-Aye.
-No!

247
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,891
This lake is just one piece of trash
away from a toxic nightmare.

248
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,862
But I knew you wouldn't listen.

249
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,547
So I took the liberty of pouring water
from the lake in all your drinking glasses.

250
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,850
This is why we should hate kids.

251
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,602
This is serious, people.

252
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,820
No more dumping in the lake.
I hereby declare a state of emergency.

253
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,752
Code black.

254
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,331
Black? That’s the worst color there is.

255
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,421
-No offense there, Carl.
-I get it all the time.

256
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,178
Sorry, sorry. No dumping in the lake.

257
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:23,811
Fine. I will put my yard trimmings
in a car compactor.

258
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,588
Chief, I think there was
a dead body in there.

259
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,927
I thought that too,
until he said "yard trimmings.”

260
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,017
You gotta learn to listen, Lou.

261
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,269
Let us now make sure
this barrier is completely idiot-proof.

262
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,760
-Cletus.
-Yessum?

263
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,012
Try to dump something in the lake.

264
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,961
Okay.

265
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,644
I can't. l simply can't.

266
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:56,644
-Brilliant.
-Very effective.

267
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,081
Don't get any ideas.

268
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:18,391
Maybe we should kiss,
just to break the tension.

269
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,741
What’s going on here?

270
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,107
Nothing. Nothing.

271
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,494
I'm not sure that pig
should be in the house.

272
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,520
And by the way,
what are you doing with his leavings?

273
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:32,558
Don't worry.
I've devised a most elegant solution.

274
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,511
It’s leaking.

275
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,992
It’s not leaking, it's overflowing.

276
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,119
He filled up the whole silo
in just two days?

277
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,679
Well, I helped.

278
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:50,691
Homer, stop! Stop.
I know it’s easy for your mind to wander...

279
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:56,832
...but want you to
really concentrate on me.

280
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,828
I can’t escape the feeling that this
is the crisis Grampa warned us about.

281
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,400
You have to dispose
of that waste properly.

282
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,090
Okay, Marge. I will.

283
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,226
You can take Spider-Pig with you.

284
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,621
He’s not Spider-Pig anymore,
he’s Harry Plopper.

285
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:30,662
Hello.

286
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,240
Homer, you gotta get over here.

287
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,775
Health inspector shut down the doughnut
store, they're giving out free doughnuts!

288
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,998
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I just got one thing I gotta do first.

289
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,625
Well, you better hurry. They’re going fast.

290
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,619
Whoa, that was close.

291
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,219
Evil!

292
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,016
Drive, drive, drive!

293
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,139
Oh, right.

294
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,764
Look at that. You can see
the four states that border Springfield:

295
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,594
Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

296
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,441
Oh, yeah.

297
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,709
And if you look real close,
you can almost--

298
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,572
Well, this certainly seems odd...

299
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,439
...but who am I to question
the work of the Almighty?

300
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,710
We thank you, Lord,
for this mighty fine intelligent design.

301
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,101
Good job.

302
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,964
Jabbity, jabbity, jab, jab, jab!

303
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,335
Hey! Jab one more eye
and it’s a federal crime.

304
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,273
-Who are you?
-Environmental Protection Agency.

305
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,611
Russ Cargill, head of the EPA,
here to see the president.

306
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:58,616
Mr. President.

307
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,279
Ja, that is me.

308
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,850
Pollution in Springfield
has reached crisis levels.

309
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,841
I hate this job. Everything's "crisis" this
and "end of the world” that.

310
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,059
Nobody opens with a joke.
I miss Danny DeVito.

311
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:16,829
You want a joke, huh?
Stop me if you've heard this one.

312
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,120
Look at those angry eyes and giant teeth.

313
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,413
It’s like Christmas
at the Kennedy compound.

314
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,606
You know, sir, when you
made me head of the EPA...

315
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:30,116
..-you appointed one of
the most successful men in America...

316
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,656
...to the least successful agency
in government.

317
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,828
And why did I take the job?

318
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:37,634
Because I’m a rich man
who wanted to give something back.

319
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,536
Not the money, but something.

320
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:43,595
So here is our chance to
kick some ass for Mother Earth.

321
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,676
-I'm listening.
-Well, I've narrowed your choices down...

322
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,939
...to five unthinkable options.

323
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,777
Each will cause untold misery--

324
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,500
l pick number three.

325
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,281
You don’t wanna read them first?

326
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,933
I was elected to lead, not to read.
Number three!

327
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:58,604
1

328
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,205
We're being sealed in a dome!

329
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,420
What do I do? I don’t know what to do!

330
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,675
If I stay, I'm trapped.
If l leave, I'm alone.

331
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,628
Oh, God. In, out, in, out!

332
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:51,969
I never saw Venice.

333
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,157
"Trapped forever.”

334
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,606
It’s all come true.

335
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:13,252
That crazy old man in church was right.

336
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:22,173
Dome!

337
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,084
All right, men, open fire.

338
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,074
Who's hurt? Raise your hands.

339
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,155
Without the attitude.

340
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,776
People, people.
Il have an important announcement.

341
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,152
l have just perfected
an acid-firing super-drill...

342
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,345
-...which can cut through anything.
-Hey, that’s cool.

343
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:57,925
It’s right there.

344
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,523
Just outside of the dome.

345
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:06,779
What ruthless madmen
could have done this to us?

346
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,785
The United States government.

347
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,700
My name is Russ Cargill
and I'm head of the EPA.

348
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:16,374
The what?

349
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:18,862
-Environmental Protection Agency.
-Come again?

350
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,441
Look, I'm a man ona big TV. Just listen.

351
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,206
-Springfield has become--
-Springfield!

352
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,936
--the most polluted city
in the history of the planet.

353
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,606
Drama queen!

354
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,828
To keep your poisons
from spreading...

355
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,080
...your government has sealed you
in this dome.

356
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,623
it's the last thing we wanted to do.

357
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,295
f own the company that makes the dome,
but that's beside the point.

358
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,305
You mean we're trapped like rats?

359
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:46,287
No, rats can't be trapped this easily.
You're trapped like carrots.

360
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,903
Wait. We couldn't be more polluted.
Everyone stopped dumping in the lake.

361
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,561
Apparently someone
didn't get the message.

362
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,462
Act natural.

363
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,970
Hey, buddy, sooner or later,
people are gonna discover this.

364
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,944
Don't worry about that.
We found a way to take you off the map.

365
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,040
Coming up on your right:

366
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,942
Nothing.

367
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:15,131
This is Kent Brockman,
reporting to you on a crisis so serious...

368
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,497
..it has its own name and theme music.

369
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,859
The dome has put an end
to life as we know it.

370
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:27,805
The town is running low on supplies of
everything from gasoline to Botox.

371
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,360
Moment, please.

372
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,568
Now, as always, we end our news
on "The Lighter Side.”

373
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,330
It's the time of year when
the swallows return to Springfield.

374
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:56,697
I think the thing I miss most
is a simple summer breeze.

375
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,711
Maggie?

376
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,355
We've got dome wax, dome polish,
dome freshener, all your dome needs...

377
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,058
.-.at Dome Depot,
located at the 105 and the dome.

378
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,440
Dome Depot!

379
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,670
Maggie got out! Maggie got out!

380
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:22,751
Maggie was right there,
just outside the dome.

381
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,408
Marge, she’s right here.

382
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,548
This dome can play tricks on you.
You just have to keep calm and--

383
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,309
Oh, my God.

384
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:36,791
I'm out of the dome. Fresh air! Freedom!

385
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,723
I'll write you. Lead good lives!

386
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,614
Good evening, this is Kent Brockman.

387
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:02,683
Efforts to find out whose selfish crime
caused our entrapment have been fruitless.

388
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,286
Until moments ago!

389
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:09,531
A shocking discovery has been made
here at Lake Springfield.

390
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,869
That could be anybody’s pig-crap silo.

391
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,485
Homer, it was you.

392
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,483
You single-handedly killed this town.

393
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,002
I know. It’s weird.

394
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,471
Just a reminder, this station does not
endorse vigilante justice.

395
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,395
Unless it gets results. Which it will.

396
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:38,126
You didn’t listen to me
after l warned you.

397
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,927
Don't worry,
nobody watches this stupid show.

398
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,524
What's that ominous glow
in the distance?

399
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,793
KGL Kill KiHE

400
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,240
Marge, look. Those idiots
don't even know where we live.

401
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,629
KGL Kill KiHE

402
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,679
We want Homer! We want Homer!

403
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,685
You monster. You monster!

404
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,512
Did you see the news?

405
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,563
Honey, come on,
we have bigger problems.

406
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,958
But I’m so angry.

407
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,484
You're a woman.
You can hold on to it forever.

408
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:25,646
Okay.

409
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:29,938
Homer, you have to go out there,
face that mob...

410
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,632
..and apologize for what you did.

411
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,984
I would, but I'm afraid if 1 open the door,
they'll take all of you.

412
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,345
No, we won't. We just want Homer!

413
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,747
Well, maybe not you,
but they'll kill Grampa.

414
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:42,713
I'm part of the mob!

415
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,357
Teeny! Take out the baby.

416
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,506
Here, let me get that for you.

417
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:12,884
Stay back. I got a chain saw.

418
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:25,446
Bart!

419
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,057
Crawl across. Hurry.

420
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,455
But if they see you helping us,
they'll kill you.

421
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,248
I'm sure your father would
do the same for--

422
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,895
Point taken. Now, hustle your bustles.

423
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,078
Archers.

424
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,130
I'm using a red arrow
so I know who L kill.

425
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:51,525
No, Plopper.
If you push that, Daddy will die.

426
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,991
Hey, my luck’s beginning to turn.

427
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:00,552
1

428
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,485
Wait! There’s something I have to get.

429
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,748
-What'd you get?
-Our wedding video.

430
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,288
-We have a wedding video?
-Torch his gas tank!

431
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,431
We lost them.

432
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,650
Up here.

433
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,153
Get them! Get them!

434
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,263
Little help?

435
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,464
You know, the word “apology”...

436
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:12,012
...is tossed around a lot these days,
but when it comes from in here--

437
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,775
Mom, what are we gonna do?

438
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,524
Maggie, not now.

439
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,413
We'll play later.

440
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,276
The sinkhole. Follow me, kids!

441
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,683
-Geronimo!
-Sacajawea!

442
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,560
So long, losers!

443
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,872
The top of his head is still showing.
Claw at it!

444
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:41,653
Well, they’re China’s problem now.

445
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,127
Colin!

446
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:01,955
I can’t hear you!

447
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:26,277
I never thought my life would have an
absolutely perfect moment, but this is--

448
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:31,018
Lisa’s got a boyfriend
that she'll never see again!

449
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,390
--perfect.

450
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,495
-What do we do?
-Now we run.

451
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,259
I'm afraid we lost them, sir.

452
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,837
Damn it!

453
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,783
Well, then, you find them
and you get them back in the dome.

454
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,569
And so nobody else gets out...

455
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:02,281
..[ want roving death squads
around the perimeter 24!7.

456
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:03,951
I want 10,000 tough guys...

457
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,152
..and I want 10,000 soft guys
to make the tough guys look tougher.

458
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,589
And here's how I want them arranged:
Tough, tough, soft, tough...

459
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:15,576
..- soft, soft, tough, tough,
soft, soft, tough, soft.

460
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,371
Sir, I'm afraid you've
gone mad with power.

461
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,438
Of course. Ever try going mad without
power? It’s boring. No one listens to you.

462
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,021
-Bart, are you drinking whiskey?
-I’m troubled.

463
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,558
-Bart.
-l promise, I'll stop tomorrow.

464
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,173
You'll stop right now.

465
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,063
You come back here, little man.

466
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,081
I miss Flanders. There, I said it!

467
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,789
-Where’s your father?
-He went out.

468
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,388
Let's quickly rebuild our lives
while he’s gone.

469
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,318
Hey, guys?

470
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,210
What's the secret knock, again?

471
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,445
Look, I know I screwed up. This is big.

472
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,174
It's huge! We’re homeless!

473
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,508
Our friends wanna kill us!

474
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,080
Before we can even stay
in the same room with you...

475
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,743
...[ need to know what was
going through your mind...

476
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,261
...when you didn't listen to me...

477
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,845
..-and dumped that silo in the lake.

478
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,579
Homer!

479
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,107
I don’t know what to tell you, Marge.
I don’t think about things.

480
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,624
l respect people who do...

481
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,949
...but I just try to make the days not hurt
until get to crawl in next to you again.

482
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,361
I mean, oh.

483
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,393
Look, I'm really sorry.
But I’m more than just sorry...

484
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,680
...[’m prepared with a solution.

485
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:15,196
I've always been afraid I'd screw up our
lives so badly we'd need a backup plan.

486
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,144
And that plan is right here!

487
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,700
No.

488
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:24,977
Nope.

489
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,720
Bingo.

490
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,761
Bear with me.

491
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:37,890
Alaska?

492
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,722
Alaska. A place where you can't be
too fat or too drunk.

493
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,863
Where no one says things like:

494
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:47,262
“Let's see your high school
equivalency certificate.”

495
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:49,806
I don’t know, Homie.

496
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,465
I'm not saying it right.

497
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,096
Look, the thing is,
I can’t start a new life alone.

498
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,181
And I’ve really come to like you guys.

499
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,602
I just don't see it.

500
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:11,209
Marge, in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

501
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,826
"I need you to do this with me.”

502
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,656
And there’s only one answer
when somebody says that.

503
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,413
Okay, Homie, I'm with you.

504
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,507
Thank you, my sweetheart.

505
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,862
-Mom?
-Yes, honey?

506
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:38,167
You just bought another load of crap
from the world’s fattest fertilizer salesman.

507
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,243
You'll pay for ruining
this golden family moment!

508
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:42,613
Homer!

509
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,830
How are we supposed to get to Alaska
without any money?

510
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:50,364
All right, son. If you don’t believe in me,
believe in America.

511
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:56,899
America. Where any man can make
quick money with no questions asked.

512
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,058
Step right up and win my truck!

513
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:05,417
All you have to do is conquer
the Ball of Death.

514
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,250
-What’s the catch?
-No catch.

515
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:11,052
Just ride the motorcycle
all the way around just one time.

516
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,566
Three tries for $10.

517
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,944
-Marge, how much money do we have?
-Ten dollars.

518
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,104
That counts as a try.

519
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,133
That's two.

520
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,727
And that's three.

521
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,509
Here’s what I'll do,
because I like seeing you hurt yourself:

522
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,338
I'll give you one on the house.

523
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,326
-You're the best.
-Dad!

524
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:41,002
When you get to the top,
don't slow down, speed up!

525
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,266
-But that’s when it’s the scariest.
-Just do it!

526
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,077
Yes!

527
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,044
Yay, Dad!

528
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:11,247
Pll take that truck now.

529
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,388
Oh, man. My wives are gonna kill me.

530
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:22,056
Next stop, Alaska!

531
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:30,029
Day 37 under the dome.

532
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,901
We are facing intermittent
power failures which--

533
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:40,352
Okay, very funny.
I'm gonna turn the lights off again.

534
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,788
When they come back on,
l want all my booze back the way it was.

535
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:45,303
1

536
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,443
Yeah, okay. Okay.

537
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:02,006
I'm very proud of you, Bart.
Over 24 hours sober.

538
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,693
-You are, aren't you?
-l'll prove it.

539
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:14,315
We're giving your father another chance,
and we owe it to him to--

540
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,470
-Oh, my God.
-Can I help you?

541
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,541
We need diapers.

542
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,853
-Okay.
-No. No, we don’t. We don't.

543
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,025
-Ladies’ razorblades.
-Right.

544
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,970
No! No. No, we don't.
I forgot, we’re European.

545
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,258
Just give us beef jerky.

546
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,063
Lots and lots of beef jerky.

547
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:38,122
That's right. That's what we need.
That's all we came in for.

548
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:39,873
Sure.

549
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,303
Oh, my God. There they are!

550
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:08,625
So you want some of my electricity,
do you?

551
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,270
Well, for once,
the rich white man is in control.

552
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,744
I have two buttons behind this desk.

553
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,279
One will supply your town with power,
the other releases the hounds.

554
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,518
Reach me. Make me your brother.

555
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,018
The hospital's generator
is about to give out.

556
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,567
Lives will be lost.

557
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:31,245
"Lives lost." Go on.

558
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,642
We got a convict we were gonna
fry tomorrow, but now we can’t.

559
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,339
Tempting. Tempting.

560
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:39,322
Look, all our reasons mean nothing.

561
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:43,014
Just look into your heart
and you'll find the answer.

562
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:49,397
-First door on the right.
-Thank you.

563
00:46:57,782 --> 00:47:01,122
What--? This isn’t the way
l pictured Alaska at all!

564
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,109
Oh, that’s better.

565
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,011
Homer!

566
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,151
Well, at least my poster didn’t get torn.

567
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,486
Welcome to Alaska. Here’s $1000.

568
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:31,363
Well, it's about time! But why?

569
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,616
We pay every resident $1000...

570
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:36,605
...to allow oil companies to ravage
our state’s natural beauty.

571
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,998
I'm home!

572
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,129
Oh, thanks.

573
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:00,393
What are you doing, Bart?

574
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,105
Just passing the time.

575
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,090
My boy loves Alaska so much,
he’s applauding it.

576
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:21,874
-Lisa, why aren't you clapping?
-But, Dad--

577
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,660
Clap for Alaska!

578
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:44,891
Well, Marge, we're separated
from the kids by a wall of snow.

579
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,906
All my dreams are coming true.

580
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,918
We're going to need more birds.

581
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,227
Day 93 under the dome.

582
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,673
With necessities growing
dangerously low...

583
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,735
...who knows what spark will set off
this powder keg?

584
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,450
-Let’s discuss Tuesdays with Morrie.
-Again?

585
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:57,269
If we don’t get a new book,
I'm going to puke.

586
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,048
You're the five people
I'm going to meet in hell!

587
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,197
We're out of coffee!

588
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,445
I can’t take another minute in this dome!

589
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,325
Take that.

590
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,214
Oh, no! Blowback!

591
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,322
Look what they’re doing to our dome.

592
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,250
You know what that is, sir?

593
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,100
-A crack?
-Exactly.

594
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,322
People got out of the dome before,
they're gonna get out again.

595
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:50,405
When they do, there’s gonna be
hearings, investigations....

596
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,423
I'll have to go back to
making family comedies.

597
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,910
Don't worry, I have a solution for you, sir.
In fact, l have five solutions.

598
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,865
You don’t have to read them.
You'll have deniability.

599
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,945
I'll take care of it. You know nothing.

600
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:08,931
No. I need to know what I’m approving.

601
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,830
Absolutely. But on the other hand,
knowing things is overrated.

602
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,587
Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is.

603
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:19,006
It takes real leadership to pick
something you're clueless about.

604
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,851
-Okay, I pick three.
-Try again.

605
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,799
-One. Five?
-Go higher. Too high.

606
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,208
-Three?
-You said three.

607
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,133
-Six? Two?
-There is no six. Double it.

608
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,755
-Four!
-As you wish, sir.

609
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:44,719
Are you tired of
the same old Grand Canyon?

610
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,859
Here we are, kids, the Grand Canyon.

611
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:52,249
It’s so old and boring.
I want a new one. Now!

612
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,850
Hello. I'm Tom Hanks.

613
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:57,336
The U.S. government
has lost its credibility...

614
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,278
...80 it’s borrowing some of mine.

615
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:00,887
Tousle my hair, Mr. Hanks.

616
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,015
Sure thing, son.

617
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:07,682
Now, I'm pleased to tell you all
about the New Grand Canyon.

618
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,510
This weekend. East of Shelbyville
and south of Capitol City.

619
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:13,669
That's where Springfield is!

620
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:16,178
It’s nowhere near where
anything is or ever was.

621
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,689
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

622
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,678
If you're going to pick a government
to trust, why not this one?

623
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,459
Did you see that?

624
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,176
Yes, they're going to destroy Springfield.

625
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,263
But we're going to stop them.

626
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,140
Homie, get your clothes on. Homie?

627
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,703
I'm happy here. Screw Springfield!

628
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,111
I can't believe you'd say
something so selfish.

629
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,471
Marge, those people chased us
with pitchforks and torches.

630
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,141
Torches! At 4 in the afternoon!

631
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,091
-It was 7 at night.
-It was during Access Hollywood.

632
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,274
Which is on at 4 and 7.

633
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:52,136
Dad, how can you turn your back
on everyone who loved us?

634
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,320
Flanders helped
when we were in trouble.

635
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:56,522
Who cares what he did?
He’s not your father.

636
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,027
I wish he was.

637
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,139
You don’t mean that. You worship me.

638
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:02,631
Oh, yeah?
Look what I did to your picture.

639
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:04,464
Look at it.

640
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,458
How-dilly-doo-dilly. How-dilly-doo-dilly.

641
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,177
Why, you little--!

642
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,696
I'll strangle-angle you!

643
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,231
Diddily-diddily.

644
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,643
Bart, stop it! Leave this to me.

645
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,813
Homer...

646
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:21,665
. .
. In every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

647
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,022
"I need you to do this with me.”

648
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,120
That is the stupidest thing
I’ve ever heard.

649
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:31,798
Homer Simpson!

650
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:33,516
We're saving Springfield!

651
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,814
Listen to me, all of you. We are staying.

652
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,623
We have a great life in Alaska...

653
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,888
..and we're never going
back to America again.

654
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,218
l have spoken!

655
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:07,622
Well, I guess I’ve let her
worry about me long enough.

656
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,627
Marge? Kids?

657
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,950
Okay, here goes.

658
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,607
Homer...

659
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,710
...1've always stood up for you.

660
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,899
When people point out your flaws...

661
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:47,066
...f always say:

662
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:51,938
"Well, sometimes you have to stand back
to appreciate a work of art."

663
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,147
Way back.

664
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,399
Lately, what's keeping us together...

665
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:02,749
...is my ability to overlook
everything you do.

666
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,750
And I overlook these things because....

667
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:08,651
Because?

668
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,710
Well, that's the thing.

669
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:15,899
f just don't know how to finish
that sentence anymore.

670
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,557
So I'm leaving with the kids
to help Springfield...

671
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,531
..and we're never coming back.

672
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:30,176
And to prove to myself
that this is the end...

673
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:35,265
...f taped this over our wedding video.

674
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,907
Goodbye, Homie.

675
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,953
f love you.

676
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:00,999
Marge? Kids?

677
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,264
-So, Mom, what's our plan?
-What are you doing up there?

678
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,307
Looking through people’s luggage.

679
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,299
I'm the mascot of an evil corporation.

680
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,925
Get down from there.
We have to keep a low profile...

681
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:09,159
...till we get to Seattle to tell the world
of the plot to destroy Springfield.

682
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,063
I don’t know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

683
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:16,346
Oh, Lisa, it's not like the government
is listening to everybody's conversation.

684
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,292
Hi, I'm calling about
your Meat Lover's pizza.

685
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,531
i like meat, but 1 don’t know
if {'m ready to love again.

686
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,958
-You hang up first.
-No, you hang up first.

687
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:35,754
Okay.

688
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:37,732
She hung up on mef

689
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:41,968
But we're fugitives. We should
just lay low till we get to Seattle.

690
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,348
Hey, everybody, I found one!

691
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,195
The government actually found
someone we're looking for!

692
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:50,479
Yeah, baby, yeah!

693
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,549
Homer Simpson...

694
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,256
...do you know why you are here?

695
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:01,108
Because my family cares more about
other people than they do about me.

696
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,892
Drink this liquid.

697
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:07,973
More, please.

698
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,762
Now we will cleanse your spirit...

699
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:14,034
...by the ancient Inuit art
of throat singing.

700
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,528
Throat singing?

701
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:28,711
How long are we doing this?

702
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:32,419
-Until you have an epiphany.
-Okay.

703
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,246
What's an epiphany?

704
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:40,304
Sudden realization of great truth.

705
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:41,737
Okay.

706
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:59,563
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig

707
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:03,167
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

708
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,767
Look out!

709
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:08,869
He's a Spider-Pig

710
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,750
Unless you have an epiphany...

711
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,650
...you will spend the remainder
of your days alone.

712
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:20,299
Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

713
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:24,211
Bananas are an excellent source
of potassium.

714
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,120
Americans will never embrace soccer?

715
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:34,155
More than two shakes
and it’s playing with yourself?

716
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:39,114
Hey, what are you doing?

717
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:47,106
Oh, do whatever you want to me.
I don't care about myself anymore.

718
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,609
Because...?

719
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:56,362
Because other people
are just as important as me.

720
00:59:57,294 --> 01:00:00,894
Without them, I’m nothing.

721
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,129
In order to save myself...

722
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,990
...[ have to save Springfield!

723
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:12,059
That's it! Isn't it?

724
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,541
That was the most
incredible experience of my life.

725
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:32,695
And now to find my family,
save my town and drop 10 pounds!

726
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:35,187
Thank you, boob lady.

727
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:43,171
1

728
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:45,892
This is it, kids. Seattle.

729
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:49,120
Russ Cargill! Do you think he saw us?

730
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,560
Yes, I did.

731
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:01,212
Run! Run!

732
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,488
Run! Run!

733
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:05,777
Run! Run!

734
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,430
Jump! Jump!

735
01:01:08,899 --> 01:01:10,629
Land! Land!

736
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:13,038
Rest! Rest!

737
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,207
Run! Run!

738
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,854
Now, I know we've had a rough day...

739
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,953
...but I'm sure we can put all that
behind us and--

740
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,846
That's my whipping arm!

741
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:34,408
Why does everything I whip leave me?

742
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:39,826
Must keep going. Must keep going.

743
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:44,024
No, I can’t. I can’t keep going.

744
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,514
Yes, you can.

745
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,553
No, I can’t!

746
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,435
Oh, shut up!

747
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,243
You shut up.

748
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:54,286
No, you. No, you.

749
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:57,174
No, you. Oh, real mature.

750
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,736
How could you say that?

751
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,980
Oh, what's the point?

752
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,472
It's hopeless.

753
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:15,862
Don’t give up, Homer.
You are closer than you think.

754
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:17,933
But which way do I go?

755
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:25,157
Much obliged.

756
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:41,563
Ten-hut!

757
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,000
Lisa! Knock off that racket.

758
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:50,348
Lisa!

759
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:55,955
They captured my family.
What do I do? What do I do?

760
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,069
There's something strange
about that "sop" sign.

761
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,406
-Did you hear something?
-Probably just a moth.

762
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,132
l hope it’s okay.

763
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,614
Look, we can't keep stopping at
every "sop," "yeld" or “one vay” sign.

764
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:56,285
Just move on.

765
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,035
Let us out! Let us out!

766
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,344
Stop that. You'll scratch your shackles.

767
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,623
l hope I do.

768
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,998
Oh, way to go, Bart.

769
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:19,821
You stink.

770
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,473
No, you stink.

771
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,732
Springfield.

772
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,331
I can't believe it,
but it got even crappier.

773
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,321
Oh, man.

774
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,162
Oh, hi, Midge.

775
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,340
Moe, what happened?

776
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:06,732
With the town sealed off from the rest of
the world, things got a little nutty here.

777
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:08,674
Why are you dressed like that?

778
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:12,942
Well, I don't like to brag,
but 1 am now the emperor of Springfield.

779
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:14,850
No, you're not!

780
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,234
Yes, 1 am!

781
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,998
Okay. Hail, emperor.

782
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:23,331
Attention, Springfield.

783
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:28,755
Your government has realized that putting
you inside this dome was a terrible mistake.

784
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,392
Therefore, we're commencing with
Operation Soaring Eagle.

785
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:35,841
Which involves killing you alt.

786
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,800
As ! speak, we're lowering a small
but powerful bomb into your midst.

787
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,747
Despite everything, I miss your father.

788
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,918
Me too.

789
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,669
His big, fat ass could shield us all.

790
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,450
Ten-hut!

791
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:16,236
At ease. I'm General Marriott Suites...

792
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,956
..and I have an urgent note
from the president.

793
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,556
It says to release this town immediately.

794
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,482
Why is it written on a leaf?

795
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:46,922
Perfect.

796
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:53,912
Now Homer Simpson’s gonna show
he has cojones!

797
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,761
Mom, I've gotta go find Colin.

798
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,920
Not now, sweetie.
Doomsday is family time.

799
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:27,356
Hey. If one of us distracts Cargill,
the rest of us can climb up that thing.

800
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:31,453
Who'd be dumb enough to stay behind
while we escape with our lives?

801
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,519
My time to shine.

802
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:38,161
Hey, Mr. Big TV Man, lookie here!

803
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,278
What do you want?

804
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,474
Look what I can do with my thumb.

805
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:47,402
You wanna know how I do it?

806
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:49,854
Four generations of inbreeding?

807
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,238
I can smell fresh air.

808
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,198
I can hear birds.

809
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:12,676
I taste freedom.

810
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,029
Excuse me! Watch out! Coming through!

811
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,492
! was tricked by an idiot.

812
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:29,821
Hey, I know how you feel.
l was beat in tic-tac-toe by a chicken.

813
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,000
Goodbye.

814
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:33,062
1

815
01:08:35,011 --> 01:08:36,151
Homer do good?

816
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:41,056
Actually, you doomed us all. Again.
Nice knowing you, Homer.

817
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,054
But l....

818
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:48,635
I can’t do anything right.

819
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:53,865
Get out of here!

820
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,897
I've spent my entire life doing nothing
but collecting comic books.

821
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,918
And now there's only time to say:

822
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,087
Life well spent!

823
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:19,448
Okay, boys. When you meet Jesus,
be sure to call him Mr. Christ.

824
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,806
Will Buddha be there too?

825
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:23,188
No.

826
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,210
-Hey, Flanders.
-Bart.

827
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:29,221
How good to see you.
And how terrible you're here.

828
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,398
Thanks.

829
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,733
Listen. 1 was just wondering if...

830
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,346
...before I died...

831
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,241
...l could pretend I had a father who...

832
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:44,174
...cared for me.

833
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,022
Come here, son.

834
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,319
There’s always room for one more
in the Flanders clan.

835
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:58,388
Come on, bomb-disarming robot.
You're our last hope.

836
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,978
Red wire. Blue wire.
Black is usually the ground.

837
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,191
So much pressure.

838
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:08,653
Pressure!

839
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:15,652
He'd been talking about it,
but I didn’t take him seriously.

840
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,071
Marge.

841
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,383
Marge! Marge!

842
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:28,556
Oh, no, the "epipha-tree"!

843
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:32,335
Hey, I tried my best.
What am I supposed to do?

844
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:36,907
But how am I supposed to get up there?

845
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,711
Here. Buy yourself something nice.

846
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,019
Homer? What the hell
are you doing now?

847
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,192
Risking my life to save people I hate...

848
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,929
...for reasons I don't quite understand.
Gotta go!

849
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,450
But first, one stop.

850
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:09,977
Bart? Son?

851
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:12,263
You think you could find it
in your heart...

852
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:15,014
...to give your foolish old man
one more chance?

853
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:18,168
Oh, I don’t know.

854
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,961
It seems to me, son,
that your father’s saying that...

855
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:24,321
...he wants to spend
his last minute with you.

856
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,123
No. I can’t do it.

857
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,246
l want a father who’s the same
in the morning as he is at night.

858
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,096
What's that word?

859
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:36,571
-Consistency.
-Consistency.

860
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,219
Thanks, losers.

861
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:39,588
Sorry, Homer.

862
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,290
I'll let you hold the bomb.

863
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,224
The man knows me.

864
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,927
l wish Homer was my father.

865
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,022
And I wish you didn’t have
the devil's curly hair.

866
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,860
I've been taking your crap all my life!

867
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:15,197
This feels good. No wonder you do it.

868
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,479
Okay, you've only got one shot
to throw that bomb through the hole.

869
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,125
Dad, in case I miss...

870
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,981
...[’m sorry I said 1 wished
you weren't my father.

871
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:31,294
I don't blame you, son.
l wasn’t much of a father.

872
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:34,224
Maybe it starts with the way
my dad raised me.

873
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:38,594
Yes. It’s clear to me.
It’s just been one long, unbroken cycle of--

874
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,695
Somebody throw the goddamn bomb!

875
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,009
What? What's going on?

876
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:31,915
We did it, boy!

877
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:33,765
Dad?

878
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,623
It’s amazing no one was hurt.

879
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,283
Bye, everybody.

880
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:35,872
Now, that was
a great father-son activity.

881
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,465
Hello, Homer.

882
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,858
So we meet at last, whoever you are.

883
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:46,176
There's two things they don’t teach you
at Harvard Business School.

884
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,152
How to cope with defeat,
and how to handle a shotgun.

885
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,889
I'm going to do both right now.

886
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,291
Wait! If you kill my dad...

887
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,750
..-you'll never know
where the treasure is buried.

888
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:58,129
What treasure?

889
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,132
The Treasure of Imawiener.

890
01:15:01,564 --> 01:15:02,464
I'm a wiener?

891
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,420
Classic.

892
01:15:05,768 --> 01:15:07,638
Well, always leave them laughing.

893
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:09,366
Goodbye, sir.

894
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:20,939
Maggie! What a great little accident
you turned out to be.

895
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,917
Colin? Colin!

896
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:30,187
Lisa? Colin’s dead.

897
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:33,968
But his last words were:

898
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:39,383
“Milhouse, take care of Lisa.
Hold her hand.”

899
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,045
I got her all warmed up for you.

900
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:47,563
Colin. Hi.

901
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:49,887
-Hey, you wanna go--?
-Clean up the lake?

902
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,719
Well, was gonna say
get some ice cream, but okay.

903
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,566
I like ice cream.

904
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:03,938
Kind of sweaty. Sorry.

905
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,291
Boy! You survived! How?

906
01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:23,424
I did things no dog should do.

907
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:25,579
They will haunt me forever.

908
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:27,304
l love you too.

909
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:45,679
Best kiss of my life.

910
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:48,634
Best kiss of your life so far.

911
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:08,576
Steady.

912
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,678
Steady.

913
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:15,132
Steady.

914
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,861
Dad?

915
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,490
Thanks, boy.

916
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:22,075
Steady.

917
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:37,248
1

918
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:11,771
They've taken everything, sir.

919
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:17,973
Smithers, I don’t believe in suicide...

920
01:18:18,661 --> 01:18:21,761
...but if you'd like to try it,
it might cheer me up to watch.

921
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:57,912
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

922
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,790
If you see me in person,
please, leave me be.

923
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:17,526
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig

924
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:21,864
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

925
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,327
Can he swing from a web?

926
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:29,932
No, he can't, he's a pig

927
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:31,675
Look out!

928
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:35,651
He is a Spider-Pig

929
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:40,017
Look out!

930
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:44,039
He is a Spider-Pig

931
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:16,835
Come on, Dad, let’s go. I’ve been holding it
since they put the dome over the town.

932
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:20,206
You can wait. A lot of people
worked really hard on this film...

933
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:24,446
...and all they ask is for you
to memorize their names.

934
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:30,047
Well, ! wanna make sure no animals were
harmed during the filming of this movie.

935
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,366
Okay.

936
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,388
Floor popcorn.

937
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,229
Wait, wait, wait! It looks like
Maggie has something to say.

938
01:20:43,806 --> 01:20:46,236
Oh, my God. Her first word.

939
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:49,016
Sequel?

940
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:30,956
Springfield doesn't have an anthem

941
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,000
We thought we had one
But we don't

942
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:39,044
We paid a short guy to write it

943
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:43,051
But we never saw him again

944
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:47,085
The tune we stole from the French

945
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:50,713
There's a few things they do well

946
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:54,893
Like making love, wine and cheese

947
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:59,084
Like Roqueforts, Camemberts and Bries

948
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:03,075
Springfield, we're going to die

949
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:07,925
Springfield, {'m scared, goodbye

950
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:22,876
Assistant manager
isn’t all it's cracked up to be.

951
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:32,387
Four years of film school for this?

952
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:37,179
1

953
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,396
