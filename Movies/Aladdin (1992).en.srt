1
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:33,634
Oh I come from a land,
From a faraway place

2
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,037
Where the caravan camels roam

3
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,843
Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,445
It's barbaric but hey, it's home

5
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,168
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west

6
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,402
And the sand in the glass is right

7
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,691
Come on down, stop on by,
Hop a carpet and fly

8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,070
To another Arabian night

9
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,851
Arabian nights

10
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,554
Like Arabian days

11
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,438
More often than not
Are hotter than hot

12
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:15,131
In a lot of good ways

13
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,741
Arabian nights

14
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,405
‘Neath Arabian moons

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,515
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,217
Out there on the dunes

17
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,739
Salaam and good evening to you,
worthy friend.

18
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,106
Please come closer.

19
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,019
A little too close.

20
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,598
There.

21
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,919
Welcome to Agrabah.

22
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,465
City of mystery.

23
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,423
Of enchantment.

24
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:56,223
And the finest merchandise,
this side of the Jordan. Come on down.

25
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,653
Look at this. Combination hookah
and coffee maker.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,260
Also makes julienne fries.

27
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,553
Will not break.

28
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,701
It broke.

29
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:11,558
Look at this. have never seen
one of these intact before.

30
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,382
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.

31
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,742
Still good.

32
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,181
Wait.

33
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,866
Il can see you're only interested in
the exceptionally rare.

34
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,070
I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

35
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,049
Do not be fooled by
its commonplace appearance.

36
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:36,531
It is not what is outside,
but what is inside that counts.

37
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,347
This is no ordinary lamp. It changed
the course of a young man's life.

38
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,655
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

39
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,513
A diamond in the rough.

40
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:54,205
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
It begins on a dark night.

41
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,680
Where a dark man waits
with a dark purpose.

42
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,628
You are late.

43
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,536
A thousand apologies, oh patient one.

44
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,619
- You have it, then?
- [had to slit a few throats.

45
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,873
But I got it.

46
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,806
The treasure.

47
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:29,941
Trust me, my pungent friend.
You'll get what's coming to you.

48
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,396
Quickly, follow the trail.

49
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,410
Faster.

50
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,254
At last, after all
my years of searching.

51
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,368
The cave of wonders.

52
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,110
By Allah.

53
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:23,123
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.

54
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,737
The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

55
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,945
The lamp.

56
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,027
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?

57
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:55,518
Who disturbs my slumber?

58
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,450
It is 1. Gazeem.

59
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,613
A humble thief.

60
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:06,095
Know this. Only one may enter here.

61
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,700
One whose worth lies far within.

62
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,697
The diamond in the rough.

63
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,186
What are you waiting for? Go on.

64
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,219
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.

65
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:50,057
I can't believe it.

66
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,470
We're never going to get ahold of
that stupid lamp. Just forget it.

67
00:05:56,223 --> 00:06:00,063
Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.

68
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,590
Patience, lago.

69
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:07,524
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.

70
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,527
There's a big surprise.

71
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,367
I'm going to have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.

72
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,478
What are we going to do?
We got a big problem here.

73
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,343
Yes.

74
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,368
Only one may enter.

75
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:29,448
l must find this one,
this diamond in the rough.

76
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,840
Stop, thief!

77
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:36,263
I'll have your hands
for a trophy, street rat.

78
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,203
All this for a loaf of bread?

79
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,151
- There he is.
- You won't get away so easy.

80
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,458
You think that was easy?

81
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:01,558
You two, over that way.
And you, follow me. We'll find him.

82
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,142
- Morning, ladies.
- Getting into trouble early today.

83
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,025
Aren't we?

84
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:10,164
Trouble? No way.
Only if you get caught.

85
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,290
- Gotcha. And this time...
- I'm in trouble.

86
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,522
Perfect timing, Abu. As usual.

87
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,311
Come on.

88
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,793
Got to keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line

89
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,986
One swing ahead of the sword

90
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,332
I'll steal only what I can't afford

91
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,941
That's everything.

92
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,702
One jump ahead of the lawman

93
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,823
That's all, and that's no joke

94
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,783
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

95
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,212
- Riffraff
- Street rat

96
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,228
- Scoundrel
- Take that

97
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:44,097
Just a little snack, guys

98
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,123
Rip him open, take it back, guys

99
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,308
1 can take a hint, got to face the facts

100
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,243
- You're my only friend, Abu
- Who?

101
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,878
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom

102
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,719
He's become a one-man rise in crime

103
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,556
I'd blame parents,
Except he hasn't go ‘em

104
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:08,064
Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got time

105
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,707
One jump ahead of the slowpokes,
One skip ahead of my doom

106
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,892
Next time, going to use a nom de plume

107
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,684
There he is.

108
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,092
One jump ahead of the hit men,
One hit ahead of the flock

109
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,319
[ think I'll take a stroll
Around the block

110
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,450
- Stop, thief.
- Vandal.

111
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,258
- Abu.
- Scandal.

112
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,200
Let's not be too hasty

113
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,318
Still ! think he's rather tasty

114
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,781
Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat,
Otherwise we'd get along

115
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,712
Wrong

116
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,688
Get him.

117
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,312
He's got a sword.

118
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,891
You idiot. We've all got swords.

119
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,072
One jump ahead of the hoof beats
One hop ahead of the hump

120
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,978
One trick ahead of disaster,
They're quick but I'm much faster

121
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,707
Here goes, better throw my hand in,
Wish me happy landing

122
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,489
Alf got to do is jump!

123
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,295
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.

124
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,094
Here.

125
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,141
Go on, take it.

126
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,089
Ah, don't.

127
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,508
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

128
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,934
Another suitor for the princess.

129
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,600
Out of my way, you filthy brats.

130
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,320
If l were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

131
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,275
I'll teach you some manners.

132
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:53,802
Look at that, Abu. It's not every day
you see a horse with two rear ends.

133
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,535
You are a worthless street rat.

134
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,964
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat

135
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,181
and only your fleas will mourn you.

136
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,427
I'm not worthless.
And I don't have fleas.

137
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,865
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.

138
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,571
Riffraff, street rat

139
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,207
! don't buy that

140
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,630
If only they'd look closer

141
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,131
Would they see a poor boy?

142
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,238
No siree

143
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,431
They‘d find out

144
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:51,175
There's so much more to me

145
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,791
Some day, Abu,
things are going to change.

146
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:06,712
We'll be rich, live in a palace
and never have any problems at all.

147
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,945
- I've never been so insulted.
- Prince Achmed.

148
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,648
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

149
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,877
Good luck marrying her off.

150
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,597
Jasmine.

151
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,190
Confound it, Rajah.

152
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,558
So this is why
Prince Achmed stormed out.

153
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,895
Oh, Father. Rajah was just playing
with him. Weren't you, Rajah?

154
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,856
You were just playing with that
overdressed, self-absorbed prince.

155
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,425
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

156
00:12:57,043 --> 00:13:02,233
The law says you must be married
to a prince by your next birthday.

157
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,386
- The law is wrong.
- You've only got three more days.

158
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,139
Father, I hate being forced into this.

159
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,557
If 1do marry,
I want it to be for love.

160
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:18,747
Jasmine, it's not only this law.

161
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,687
I'm not going to be
around forever, and...

162
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,519
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

163
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,646
- Provided for.
- Please try to understand.

164
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,933
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

165
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,906
Except you, Rajah.

166
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,128
I've never even been
outside the palace walls.

167
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,111
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

168
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,898
Then maybe I don't want to be
.
a princess anymore.

169
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,146
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

170
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:15,622
I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

171
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,695
Jafar, my most trusted advisor.

172
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,752
lam in desperate need of your wisdom.

173
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,824
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

174
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:33,018
It's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.

175
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,415
I'm at my wits' end.

176
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,152
Have a cracker, pretty polly.

177
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,179
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

178
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:53,658
Now, then. Perhaps I can divine
a solution to this thorny problem.

179
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,360
If anyone can help, it's you.

180
00:14:56,696 --> 00:15:00,886
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

181
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,198
My ring?

182
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:09,424
- But it's been in the family for years.
- Itis necessary to find a suitor.

183
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,816
Don't worry.

184
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,981
Everything will be fine.

185
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,324
The diamond.

186
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,703
Here, Jafar.

187
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,275
Whatever you need will be fine.

188
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,103
You are most gracious, my liege.

189
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,715
Now run along
and play with your little toys.

190
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,524
That will be pretty good.

191
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,912
I can't take it anymore.

192
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:47,511
If l got to choke down on one more of
those moldy, disgusting crackers...

193
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,273
Calm yourself, lago.

194
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,439
Soon I will be sultan.
Not that addle-pated twit.

195
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:02,244
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat.

196
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:26,584
I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

197
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,429
I'll miss you.

198
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,008
Goodbye.

199
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,234
Oranges from Jaffa.

200
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,618
OK, Abu. Go.

201
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:00,055
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

202
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,585
Get your paws off that.

203
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:09,314
Why, you... Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape.

204
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,819
Bye-bye.

205
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,908
Nice going Abu.

206
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,309
Breakfast is served.

207
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:26,341
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.

208
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:31,106
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.

209
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,411
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

210
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,388
Fresh fish. We catch 'em, you buy them.

211
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,981
No. I don't think so.

212
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,334
Excuse me.

213
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,244
I'm really very sorry.

214
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,671
Hello?

215
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,103
You must be hungry.

216
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,578
- Here you go.
- You'd better be able to pay for that.

217
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,246
- Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.

218
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,070
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.

219
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,805
- Thief!
- Please.

220
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,758
If you let me go
I can get some from the sultan.

221
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,014
Do you know what
the penalty is for stealing?

222
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,904
No, please.

223
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,366
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

224
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,748
- I've been looking for you.
- What?

225
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,152
- Just play along.
- You know this girl?

226
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,262
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

227
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,678
- She's a little crazy.
- She said she knew the sultan.

228
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,523
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

229
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:55,731
Oh wise sultan, how may I serve you?

230
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,681
Tragic, isn't it?

231
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,000
But no harm done.

232
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,712
Come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

233
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:10,122
- Hello, doctor. How are you?
- No, not that one.

234
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,590
Come on, sultan.

235
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,261
What is it?

236
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,956
Come back here, you little thieves.

237
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,973
With all due respect, Your Rottenness,

238
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,560
couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

239
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,820
Save your breath, lago. Faster.

240
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,590
Yes, oh mighty evil one.

241
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,066
Part, sands of time.

242
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,925
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

243
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,475
Yes.

244
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,095
There he is.

245
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,598
My diamond in the rough.

246
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,150
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waiting for?

247
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:03,114
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace.

248
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,523
- Shall we?
- Swell.

249
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,254
Almost there.

250
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,293
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

251
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,044
Forget it.

252
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,525
So this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

253
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,802
Is it that obvious?

254
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,384
Well, you do kind of stand out.

255
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,645
I mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

256
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,567
I'm a fast learner.

257
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,538
Come on. This way.

258
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:59,085
Watch your head there. Be careful.

259
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,018
- Is this where you live?
- Yep. Just me and Abu.

260
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,371
- Come and go as we please.
- That sounds fabulous.

261
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,762
Well, it's not much.

262
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,531
But it's got a great view.

263
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,516
The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

264
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,775
It's wonderful.

265
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:22,147
Wonder what it'd be like to live there.
And have servants and valets.

266
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,972
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

267
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,352
That's better than here. Scraping for
food and ducking the guards.

268
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,914
You're not free to make choices.

269
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,280
- You feel so...
- You're just...

270
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,299
trapped.

271
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,336
So where are you from?

272
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:50,381
What does it matter?
l ran away and l am not going back.

273
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,876
Really? How come?

274
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,142
Why, you thief.

275
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,679
My father's forcing me to get married.

276
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,292
That's awful.

277
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,586
What?

278
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,611
Abu says

279
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,634
that's not fair.

280
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,513
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah. Of course.

281
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:20,416
And does Abu have anything else to say?

282
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,842
He wishes there was something
he could do to help.

283
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,149
Oh, boy.

284
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,334
Tell him that's very sweet.

285
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,206
Here you are.

286
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,507
They're after me. They're after you?

287
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,877
- My father must have sent them to...
- Do you trust me?

288
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,924
- Yes.
- Then jump!

289
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:54,371
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat’?

290
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,574
Run. Get out of here.

291
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,315
It's the dungeon for you, boy.

292
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,227
- Get off.
- Let him go.

293
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,856
Looky here, men. A street mouse.

294
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,708
Unhand him.

295
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,720
By order of the princess.

296
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,907
- Princess Jasmine.
- The princess?

297
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,673
What are you doing here?
And with this street rat?

298
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,823
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

299
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,774
l would, Princess.
Except my orders come from Jafar.

300
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,768
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

301
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,094
Jafar?

302
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,027
Princess.

303
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:47,533
- Jafar, I'm stuck.
- How may I be of service to you?

304
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,083
The guards took a boy from the market.
On your orders.

305
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,991
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace.

306
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,014
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

307
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,806
- l can't breathe.
- Why...

308
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:05,275
- Kidnapping the princess, of course.
- If you could just...

309
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,051
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

310
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:11,314
Oh, dear.

311
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,534
How frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...

312
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,731
What do you mean?

313
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,683
The boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

314
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,406
- What sentence?
- Death.

315
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,750
- By beheading.
- No.

316
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,365
lam exceedingly sorry, Princess.

317
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,682
How could you?

318
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,165
So. How did it go?

319
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,764
I think she took it rather well.

320
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,476
It's all my fault.

321
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,149
I didn't even know his name.

322
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,006
She was the princess.

323
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,643
I can't believe it.

324
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,346
I must have sounded so stupid to her.

325
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,726
Abu, down here.

326
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,053
Help me out of these.

327
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,069
She was in trouble.

328
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,231
She was worth it.

329
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,801
Don't worry, I'll never see her again.

330
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,216
I'm a street rat, remember,
and there's a law.

331
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,540
She's got to marry a prince.

332
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,481
She deserves a prince.

333
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,953
I'm a fool.

334
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,819
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

335
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,390
- Who are you?
- A lowly prisoner like yourself.

336
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,798
But together perhaps we can be more.

337
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,684
- I'm listening.
- There is a cave, boy.

338
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,215
A cave of wonders,

339
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:39,511
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

340
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,976
Treasure enough to impress
even your princess, I'd wager.

341
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:48,434
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dying in here.

342
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:53,357
- But the law says that only a prince...
- Haven't you heard of the golden rule?

343
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,676
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.

344
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,536
So why would you share
this treasure with me?

345
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:05,643
I need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to go in after it.

346
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,378
One problem.
It's out there and we're in here.

347
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,786
Things aren't always what they seem.

348
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:19,214
So. Do we have a deal?

349
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,084
Who disturbs my slumber?

350
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,631
Itis 1. Aladdin.

351
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,678
Proceed.

352
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:49,544
Touch nothing but the lamp.

353
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,822
Remember, boy. First fetch me the lamp.

354
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:56,752
And then you shall have your reward.

355
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,149
Come on, Abu.

356
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,635
Would you look at that.

357
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:22,644
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the sultan.

358
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,485
Don't touch anything.

359
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,714
We got to find that lamp.

360
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,245
Will you knock it off?

361
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,891
Are you crazy?

362
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,065
A magic carpet.

363
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,288
Come on out.
We're not going to hurt you.

364
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,214
Take it easy. He's not going to bite.

365
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,501
Thanks.

366
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,057
Wait, don't go.

367
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,213
Maybe you can help us.

368
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,393
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.

369
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,023
I think he knows where it is.

370
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,405
Wait here.

371
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:13,281
This is it? This is what we came
all the way down here to...

372
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,037
No.

373
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,735
Infidels.

374
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:24,595
You have touched the forbidden treasure.

375
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:31,988
Now you will never again
see the light of day.

376
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,273
Carpet, let's move.

377
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,329
This is no time to panic.

378
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,158
Start panicking.

379
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,645
- Help me up.
- Throw me the lamp.

380
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,204
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

381
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,227
First give me the lamp.

382
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,265
Yes!

383
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,903
At last.

384
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,646
- What are you doing?
- Giving you your reward.

385
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,723
Your eternal reward.

386
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,679
It's mine. It's all mine.

387
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,465
Why, where is it?

388
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,134
No.

389
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:22,046
Oh, dearest. What's wrong?

390
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:28,942
Jafar has done something terrible.

391
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,094
There, there, my dear.

392
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,404
We'll set it right.

393
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,168
Now, tell me everything.

394
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,991
Wake up.

395
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,759
My head.

396
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:56,677
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal.

397
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:01,142
Well, whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

398
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,523
Why, you hairy little thief.

399
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,069
It looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

400
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,946
I think there's something written here,

401
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,287
but it's hard to make out.

402
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:38,168
Ten thousand years
will give you such a crick in the neck.

403
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,060
Hang on a second.

404
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,054
Wow, does it feel good
to be out of there.

405
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:50,077
Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.
Where are you from? What's your name?

406
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,152
Aladdin.

407
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:56,047
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you Al? Or maybe just Din?

408
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,871
How about Laddie? Sounds like
"Here, boy." Come on, Laddie.

409
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,773
I hit my head harder than I thought.

410
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,002
Do you smoke? Mind if l do?

411
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,795
Sorry, Cheetah,
l hope I didn't singe your fur.

412
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:14,185
Rugman, haven't seen you
in a few millennia. Give me some tassel.

413
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:20,591
You're smaller than my last master.
Either that or I'm getting bigger.

414
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,176
Do I look different to you?

415
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,915
Wait a minute. I'm your master?

416
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,487
That's right. He can be taught.

417
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,543
What would you wish of me?
The ever-impressive,

418
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,649
the long-contained,

419
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:38,933
often imitated but never duplicated

420
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:44,062
Genie of the Lamp.

421
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:48,412
Right here from the lamp.
Right here for your wish-fulfillment.

422
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,967
- Thank you.
- Whoa.

423
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,619
- Wish-fulfillment?
- Three, to be exact.

424
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,182
Ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes.

425
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,127
That's it. Three.

426
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,540
No exchanges or refunds.

427
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,026
- Now I know I'm dreaming.
- You don't realize what you got here.

428
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:11,651
So why don't you just ruminate
whilst I illuminate the possibilities?

429
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,491
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves

430
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,823
Scheherazade had a thousand tales

431
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,419
But, master, you're in luck
‘Cause up your sleeves

432
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,884
You got a brand of magic never fails

433
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,381
You got some power in your corner now

434
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,084
Some heavy ammunition in your camp

435
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,380
You got some punch, pizzazz,
Yahoo and how

436
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,295
See, all you got to do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say

437
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,618
Mr. Aladdin, sir,
What will your pleasure be?

438
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,363
Let me take your order, jot it down

439
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,714
You ain't never had a friend like me

440
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:47,482
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'

441
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,906
Come on, whisper what it is you want

442
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,195
You ain't never had a friend like me

443
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,846
Yes, sir, we pride ourselves on service

444
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,379
You're the boss, the king, the shah

445
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,822
Say what you wish,
It's yours, true dish

446
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,988
How ‘bout a little more baklava?

447
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:07,258
Have some of column A,
Try all of column B

448
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,692
I'm in the mood to help you, dude

449
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,361
You ain't never had a friend like me

450
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,816
Can your friends do this?

451
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,245
Can your friends do that?

452
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,743
Can your friends pull this

453
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,217
Out their little hat?

454
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,746
Can your friends go...

455
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,722
Hey, looky here

456
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,228
Can your friends go
Abracadabra, let her rip

457
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,731
And then make the sucker disappear?

458
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,366
So don't just sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed

459
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,566
I'm here to answer
Alf your midnight prayers

460
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,791
You got me bona fide, certified

461
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,267
You got a genie for a chargé d'affaires

462
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,739
! got a powerful urge to help you out

463
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,938
So what's your wish?
really want to know

464
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,256
You got a list that's
Three miles long, no doubt

465
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,353
Well, all you got to do is rub like so

466
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:05,376
Mr. Aladdin, sir,
Have a wish or two or three

467
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,964
I'm on the job, you big nabob

468
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:10,153
You ain't never had a friend

469
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,774
You ain't never had a friend

470
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,635
Like me

471
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,096
So what'll it be?

472
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,683
You're going to grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

473
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,261
Almost.

474
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,319
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

475
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,892
Like?

476
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,107
Rule one. I can't kill anybody.

477
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,233
So don't ask.

478
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:55,245
Rule two. I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

479
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,834
You little punim there.

480
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:01,942
Rule three.
I can't bring people back from the dead.

481
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,553
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

482
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,116
Other than that, you got it.

483
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,223
Provisos? You mean limitations?
On wishes?

484
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:20,748
Some all-powerful genie! Can't even
bring people back from the dead.

485
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,422
He probably can't even
get us out of this cave.

486
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,033
Looks like we'll have to find a way out.

487
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,031
Excuse me.

488
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,847
Are you looking at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

489
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,923
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

490
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,406
And you're walking out on me?
I don't think so.

491
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,303
Not right now. You're getting
your wishes, so sit down.

492
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,768
In case of emergency,
the exits are here.

493
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:50,140
Anywhere. Keep your hands
and arms inside the carpet.

494
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,365
We're...

495
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,124
out of here.

496
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,191
Jafar, this is an outrage.

497
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,307
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

498
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,600
From now on you're to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me.

499
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,417
Before they are beheaded.

500
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,381
l assure you it won't happen again.

501
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:18,074
Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this
whole messy business behind us.

502
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,136
Please.

503
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:24,328
My most abject and humblest
apologies to you as well, Princess.

504
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,609
Some good will come of
my being forced to marry.

505
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:31,712
When I am queen,
I will have the power to get rid of you.

506
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,038
That's nice. All settled, then.

507
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:39,464
Now, Jasmine,
getting back to this suitor business...

508
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:47,509
If only I had gotten that lamp.

509
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,486
I will have the power to get rid of you.

510
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:57,313
To think we got to keep kissing up to
that chump and his chump daughter

511
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,986
for the rest of our lives.

512
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,298
No, lago. Only until she finds
a chump husband.

513
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,202
Then she'll have us banished.

514
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,402
Or beheaded.

515
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,017
Wait a minute.

516
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:17,078
What if you were the chump husband?

517
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,904
What?

518
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,630
You marry the princess, right?

519
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,500
And then you become the sultan.

520
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,702
Marry the shrew.

521
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,828
l become the sultan.

522
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,990
The idea has merit.

523
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,658
Yes, merit.

524
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,190
And then we drop poppa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

525
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:51,072
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

526
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:03,841
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

527
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,725
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

528
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,092
Thank you. Goodbye, now.

529
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:15,126
Well, how about that,
Mr Doubting Mustafa?

530
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,570
You sure showed me.

531
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,339
Now about my three wishes...

532
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,395
Dost mine ears deceive me?

533
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,830
Three? You are down by one, boy.

534
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,357
No, I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

535
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,651
You did that on your own.

536
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,618
I feel sheepish.

537
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,817
All right, you bad boy.
But no more freebies.

538
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,833
Fair deal.

539
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,249
Three wishes. I want them to be good.

540
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,305
What would you wish for?

541
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,371
Me?

542
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,563
No one's asked me that before.

543
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:52,595
Well, in my case...

544
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:54,477
- Forget it.
- What?

545
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,545
- [can't tell you.
- Come on.

546
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,982
Freedom.

547
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,324
- You're a prisoner?
- It's part of the whole genie gig.

548
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,388
Phenomenal cosmic powers.

549
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:10,919
- ltty-bitty living space.
- That's terrible.

550
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,045
But oh, to be free.

551
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,475
Not to have to go, "What do you need?"

552
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,866
To be my own master.

553
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:26,462
Such a thing would be greater than all
the magic and treasures in the world.

554
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:30,634
But what am I talking about?
It's not going to happen.

555
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,538
- Wake up and smell the hummus.
- Why not?

556
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:38,412
The only way I get out of this
is if my master wishes me out.

557
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:41,253
So you can guess
how often that's happened.

558
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:43,346
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

559
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,488
Yeah, right.

560
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:50,824
I promise. After my first two wishes,
I'll use my third wish to set you free.

561
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,730
Well, here's hoping.

562
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,172
Let's make some magic.

563
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,897
So how about it?
What is it you want most?

564
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:03,667
Well, there's this girl.

565
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:07,702
Wrong. I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

566
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:12,156
But, Genie, she's smart and fun and...

567
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,507
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

568
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,592
She's got these eyes that just...
and this hair.

569
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,239
And her smile...

570
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:28,168
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance, I'd have to be...

571
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,577
- Can you make me a prince?
- Let's see.

572
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:34,837
Chicken a fa King.

573
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,476
No. Alaskan king crab.

574
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,978
I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad.

575
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:42,508
Et tu, Brute? No.

576
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,833
"To make a prince."

577
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:47,226
Is that official?
Say the magic words.

578
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,158
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

579
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,251
All right!

580
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,811
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third-century.

581
00:45:57,355 --> 00:46:01,365
These patches. What are we trying to
say, beggar? No. Work with me here.

582
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:04,894
I like it.

583
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,886
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say?

584
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,732
It says, "Mode of transportation."

585
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,825
Excuse me. Monkey boy.
Over here.

586
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,749
Here he comes. And what better way
to make your grand entrance

587
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,620
than riding your very own
brand-new camel?

588
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,927
Watch out. They spit.

589
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,299
Not enough.

590
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,762
Still not enough. What do you need?

591
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,752
Yes. Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

592
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,839
Talk about your trunk space.

593
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:50,293
You look good.

594
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:54,474
He's got the outfit, he's got the
elephant, but we're not through yet.

595
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,209
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're going to make you a star.

596
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,493
Now, let's see.

597
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:11,795
Sire, 1 have found a solution to
the problem with your daughter.

598
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:15,146
The problem with your daughter.

599
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,589
- Really?
- Right here.

600
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:21,685
If the princess has not chosen a husband
by the appointed time,

601
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:24,933
then the sultan shall choose for her.

602
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:30,006
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.
How could I choose someone she hates?

603
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:32,855
Not to worry, my liege. There is more.

604
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:38,185
If in the event a suitable prince
cannot be found,

605
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,539
a princess must then be wed to...

606
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:47,359
- Interesting.
- What? Who?

607
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:49,638
The royal vizier.

608
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,697
That would be

609
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,052
me.

610
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:58,945
But I thought only a prince
can marry a princess. I'm quite sure.

611
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:03,273
Desperate times call for
desperate measures, my lord.

612
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,849
Desperate measures.

613
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:10,844
You will order the princess to marry me.

614
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:15,372
I will order the princess to...

615
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:18,604
But you're so old.

616
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:22,239
The princess will marry me.

617
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,196
The princess will marry...

618
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:28,263
What is that? That music?

619
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,712
Jafar, you must come and see this.

620
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:42,332
Make way for Prince Ali

621
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:47,661
Say hey, it's Prince Ali

622
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,143
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar

623
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:53,652
Hey you, let us through,
It's a bright new star

624
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:57,951
Oh come, be the first
On your block to meet his eye

625
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:01,603
Make way, here he comes,
Ring bells, bang the drums

626
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:03,616
You're going to love this guy

627
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:08,388
Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa

628
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,499
Genuflect, show some respect,
Down on one knee

629
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,295
Now try your best to stay calm

630
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:18,434
Brush up your Sunday salaam

631
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:22,266
Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie

632
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:27,487
Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa

633
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:32,389
Strong as ten regular men definitely

634
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:34,846
He faced the galloping hordes

635
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,192
A hundred bad guys with swords

636
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:41,051
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

637
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,942
He's got 75 golden camels

638
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,226
Don't they look lovely, June?

639
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,250
Purple peacocks he's got 53

640
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,283
Fabulous. I love the feathers.

641
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:55,459
When it comes to exotic-type mammals

642
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,670
Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you

643
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:00,072
It's a world-class menagerie

644
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:04,271
Prince Ali, handsome is he, Ali Ababwa

645
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:08,709
That physique, how can! speak?
Weak at the knees

646
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,496
Well, get on out in that square

647
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,516
Adjust your veil and prepare

648
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:17,941
To gawk and grovel
And stare at Prince Ali

649
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:22,622
He's got 95 white Persian monkeys

650
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:27,203
To view them he charges no fee

651
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,814
He's got slaves,
He's got servants and flunkeys

652
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,755
Proud to work for him,
They bow to his whim, love serving him

653
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:37,534
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali

654
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,758
Prince Ali

655
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:46,475
Prince Ali, amorous he, Ali Ababwa

656
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:51,788
Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see

657
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:53,973
And that, good people, is why

658
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,271
He got dolled up and dropped by

659
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,200
With 60 elephants, llamas galore

660
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,269
With his bears and lions,
A brass band and more

661
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:02,290
With his 40 fakirs,
His cooks, his bakers

662
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:03,853
His birds that warble on key

663
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,934
Make way

664
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,833
For Prince Ali

665
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:16,491
Splendid. Absolutely marvelous.

666
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:22,846
Your Majesty, I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

667
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,960
Prince Ali Ababwa. Of course.
I'm delighted to meet you.

668
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:32,252
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted too.

669
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,223
Ecstatic.

670
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,271
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.

671
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:41,448
Whatever. You cannot just parade
in here uninvited and expect to...

672
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:45,192
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.

673
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:50,511
I don't suppose I might...

674
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,761
Why certainly, Your Majesty. Allow me.

675
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,565
Sire. must advise against this.

676
00:51:57,982 --> 00:52:00,702
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

677
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,910
Just where did you say you were from?

678
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:18,586
Much farther than
you've traveled, I'm sure.

679
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,969
- Try me.
- Duck, polly.

680
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,854
Watch it, you dumb rug.

681
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,205
Have a cracker.

682
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:40,711
Out the way, I'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.

683
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:44,245
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- It was lovely.

684
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,358
Yes, ! do seem to have a knack for it.

685
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:52,852
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.

686
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,629
If we're lucky, you won't have to
marry Jasmine after all.

687
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:59,191
- 1 don't trust him, sire.
- Nonsense.

688
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:03,903
One thing I pride myself on.
I'm an excellent judge of character.

689
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,251
Oh, excellent judge, yes.

690
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,330
Not.

691
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,612
Jasmine will like this one.

692
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,174
And I'm sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.

693
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,926
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

694
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:19,330
He is no different from the others.

695
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:22,093
What makes him think he is worthy?

696
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,339
Your Majesty, l am Prince Ali Ababwa.

697
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:28,353
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

698
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,432
How dare you? All of you.

699
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:37,145
Standing around deciding my future?
lam not a prize to be won.

700
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,198
Oh, dear.

701
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:44,533
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

702
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:49,845
I think it's time to
say goodbye to Prince Abubu.

703
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:57,961
What am I going to do?
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

704
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:02,042
I should have known I couldn't pull off
the stupid prince wish.

705
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,215
So move.

706
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:14,855
That's a good move.
I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

707
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,759
- Genie, I need help.
- All right, sparky, here's the deal.

708
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:24,224
If you want to court the lady, you got
to be a straight shooter. Got it?

709
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:25,758
What?

710
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:28,773
Tell her the truth.

711
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:34,503
No way. If Jasmine found out l was some
crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.

712
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:38,964
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

713
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:43,383
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

714
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,001
That's the last thing I want to be.

715
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,160
OK, I'm going to go see her.

716
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:53,055
I got to be smooth, cool, confident.

717
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:55,567
How do I look?

718
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:58,757
Like a prince.

719
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,825
Princess Jasmine?

720
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,674
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

721
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:21,373
Prince Ali Ababwa.

722
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:25,672
- [do not want to see you.
- Please, Princess. Give me a chance.

723
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,370
- Leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

724
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,745
So how's our little beau doing?

725
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,776
Good kitty. Take off.

726
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,445
- Down, kitty.
- Wait.

727
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,675
Do I know you?

728
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:42,521
No.

729
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,650
Your remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

730
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:49,384
The marketplace?

731
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:52,356
l have servants who go to
the marketplace for me.

732
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:56,502
Why, I even have servants who
go to the marketplace for my servants.

733
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,987
So it couldn't have been me you met.

734
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:01,103
No.

735
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:05,115
- [guess not.
- Enough about you. Talk about her.

736
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,066
She's smart, fun. The hair, the eyes.

737
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,515
Anything. Pick a feature.

738
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,798
Princess Jasmine, you're very...

739
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,276
Wonderful. Magnificent. Punctual.

740
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,479
- Punctual.
- Sorry.

741
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,858
- Beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

742
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:24,351
- I'm rich too, you know.
- Yeah.

743
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,868
- The daughter of a sultan.
- l know.

744
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:32,042
A fine prize for any prince to marry.

745
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:35,053
Right. A prince like me.

746
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:38,939
- Warning.
- Right. A prince like you.

747
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:42,956
And every other stuffed-shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

748
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,140
Mayday.

749
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:48,543
Just go jump off a balcony.

750
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:52,633
- Stop her. Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

751
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,743
OK, fine. But remember, bee yourself.

752
00:56:57,314 --> 00:56:58,834
- Yeah, right.
- What?

753
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:02,427
You're right.

754
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,297
You aren't just some prize to be won.

755
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,277
You should be free
to make your own choice.

756
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:10,833
I'll go.

757
00:57:11,061 --> 00:57:12,701
- No.
- What?

758
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:14,106
How...

759
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:17,401
- How are you doing that?
- It's a magic carpet.

760
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,181
It's lovely.

761
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,247
You...

762
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,032
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?

763
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,992
We could get out of the palace.
See the world.

764
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:31,162
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

765
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:35,042
- What?
- Do you trust me?

766
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:38,881
Yes.

767
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:57,438
} can show you the world

768
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:01,748
Shining, shimmering, splendid

769
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:07,616
Tell me, Princess, now when
Did you last let your heart decide?

770
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:13,553
! can open your eyes

771
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:17,084
Take you wonder by wonder

772
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:20,021
Over, sideways and under

773
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,799
On a magic-carpet ride

774
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,734
A whole new world

775
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,551
A new fantastic point of view

776
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:36,174
No one to tell us no or where to go

777
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,243
Or say we're only dreaming

778
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,959
A whole new world

779
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:47,057
A dazzling place I never knew

780
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:51,433
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear

781
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,899
That now I'm in
A whole new world with you

782
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,690
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

783
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,513
Unbelievable sights

784
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,201
Indescribable feeling

785
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,341
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

786
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:13,531
Through an endless diamond sky

787
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:17,324
- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes

788
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:21,283
- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better

789
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:23,875
I'm like a shooting star

790
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,926
I've come so far

791
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:30,388
- 1 can't go back to where I used to be
- A whole new world

792
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:34,464
- Every turn a surprise
- With new horizons to pursue

793
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:37,115
Every moment red-letter

794
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:40,984
I'll chase them anywhere,
There's time to spare

795
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:46,345
Let me share this
Whole new world with you

796
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:51,425
A whole new world

797
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,872
That's where we'll be

798
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:59,863
- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place

799
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:04,647
For you and me

800
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,038
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

801
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,123
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

802
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:30,273
Nah. He hates fireworks.
He doesn't really like flying either.

803
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,571
That is...

804
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:36,587
- Oh, no.
- You are the boy from the market.

805
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,873
- Why did you lie to me?
- I'm sorry.

806
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,242
Did you think I was stupid?
That I wouldn't figure it out?

807
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,349
No, I mean... hoped you wouldn't.

808
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:49,055
- That's not what I meant.
- Who are you? Tell me the truth.

809
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,219
The truth?

810
01:00:56,786 --> 01:01:00,656
The truth is, l sometimes
dress as a commoner.

811
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:03,598
To escape the pressures of palace life.

812
01:01:05,629 --> 01:01:08,239
But I really am a prince.

813
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,915
Why didn't you just tell me?

814
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:13,520
Well, you know.

815
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:18,824
Royalty going out in disguise. It sounds
a little strange, don't you think?

816
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,921
Not that strange.

817
01:01:45,502 --> 01:01:47,932
Good night, my handsome prince.

818
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,888
Sleep well, Princess.

819
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,627
Yes!

820
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:24,122
For the first time in my life
things are starting to go right.

821
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,594
Hold him.

822
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,962
I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome,
Prince Abubu.

823
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,763
- Why you dirty, rotten...
- Make sure he's never found.

824
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:31,117
Never fails. Get in the bath and
there's a rub at the lamp. Hello?

825
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,305
Al?

826
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:36,991
Kid, snap out of it.

827
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:39,694
I can't help you unless you make a wish.

828
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:43,013
You have to say,
"Genie, I want you to save my life." OK?

829
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,326
Come on, Aladdin.

830
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:48,399
I'l take that as a yes.

831
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,332
Up scope.

832
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,047
Don't you scare me like that.

833
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:05,686
Genie, I...

834
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,666
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

835
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,265
I'm getting kind of fond of you, kid.

836
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:16,821
Not that I want to pick out curtains.

837
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:28,445
Oh, Father.
I just had the most wonderful time.

838
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:32,185
- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

839
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,482
l have chosen a husband for you.

840
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:38,779
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.

841
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,363
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.

842
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:45,577
I will never marry you.

843
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,872
- Father, l choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

844
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,571
Better check your crystal ball again.

845
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:54,475
- Prince Ali.
- How in the...

846
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:59,678
Tell him the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

847
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,856
What ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness.

848
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,349
He's obviously lying.

849
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:11,134
- Father, what's wrong with you?
- [know what's wrong.

850
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:14,756
Oh, my.

851
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:17,608
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

852
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:20,507
What? Jafar?

853
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,817
You low traitor.

854
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:26,173
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

855
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:28,875
- Guards.
- Well, that's it. We're dead.

856
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,159
Just dig a grave for both of us.

857
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,424
Arrest Jafar at once.

858
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:37,118
This is not done yet, boy.

859
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,257
Find him. Search everywhere.

860
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,881
- Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.

861
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:51,433
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,
plotting against me all this time.

862
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:55,711
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will I ever...

863
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:03,625
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?

864
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,435
Praise Allah.

865
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:11,088
You brilliant boy. l could kiss you.

866
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,748
I won't. I'll leave that to my...

867
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,797
But you two will be wed at once.

868
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,490
Yes, and you'll be happy and prosperous.

869
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:22,896
And then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

870
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,449
- Sultan?
- Yes. A fine youth such as yourself.

871
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:32,220
A person of your unimpeachable character
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

872
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:35,802
We got to get out of here.
I got to start packing.

873
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:39,539
Only essentials.
We got to bring the guns, the knives...

874
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:43,873
And how about this picture?
I don't know. I'm making a weird face.

875
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:48,232
Oh, boy.

876
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,555
He's cracked. He's gone nuts.

877
01:06:53,076 --> 01:06:54,716
Get a grip.

878
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:56,728
Good grip.

879
01:06:56,946 --> 01:07:00,076
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that urchin Aladdin.

880
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,283
He has the lamp, lago.

881
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:05,955
- Why, that miserable...
- But you will relieve him of it.

882
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:07,539
Me?

883
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:13,270
Sultan?

884
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,406
They want me to be sultan?

885
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,297
Hail the conquering hero

886
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,924
You've just won
the heart of the princess.

887
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,187
What are you going to do next?

888
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:43,982
Your line is,
"I'm going to free the genie."

889
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,677
- Any time.
- Genie...

890
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,730
- lL can't.
- Sure you can.

891
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:52,162
You just go, "Genie, I wish you free."

892
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:53,979
I'm serious.

893
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,167
Look, I'm sorry, I really am.

894
01:07:56,506 --> 01:08:00,455
But they want to make me sultan.
No, they want to make Prince Ali sultan.

895
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,567
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

896
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,790
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.

897
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:09,274
People only think I'm worth anything
because of you.

898
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:13,446
What if they find out I'm not a prince?
What if Jasmine finds out?

899
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,423
I'd lose her.

900
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,935
I can't keep this up on my own.

901
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,694
I can't wish you free.

902
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:26,356
l understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

903
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:28,598
l was beginning to feel left out.

904
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:32,064
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

905
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:38,091
Genie, I'm really sorry.

906
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:42,795
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.

907
01:08:44,921 --> 01:08:46,761
What are you guys looking at?

908
01:08:50,225 --> 01:08:52,005
Look, l...

909
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,258
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

910
01:08:54,596 --> 01:08:56,437
Wait. Come on.

911
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,111
What am I doing?

912
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,345
Genie's right.

913
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,731
I got to tell Jasmine the truth.

914
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,040
Ali, will you come here?

915
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,645
Here goes.

916
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,940
Jasmine, where are you?

917
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:23,643
- Out in the menagerie. Hurry.
- I'm coming.

918
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:31,140
You got a problem, pinky?

919
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:32,617
Jerk.

920
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,051
Jafar's going to be happy to see you.

921
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:40,988
- Excellent work, lago.
- Ah, go on.

922
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:44,781
No, really. On a scale of one to ten,
you are an eleven.

923
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,364
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

924
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,857
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

925
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,969
People of Agrabah,

926
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:57,763
my daughter
has finally chosen a suitor.

927
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:00,598
- He is a man of integrity.
- Jasmine?

928
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,692
Ali, where you have you been?

929
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:04,809
I've got to tell you something.

930
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:08,474
The whole kingdom has turned out
for Father's announcement.

931
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:11,525
Jasmine, listen to me.
You don't understand.

932
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,630
- Good luck.
- Prince Ali Ababwa.

933
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:23,862
Look at them.
Cheering that little pipsqueak.

934
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,724
Let them cheer.

935
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:30,004
You know, Al, I'm getting really...

936
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,139
I don't think you're him.

937
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:36,242
Tonight the part of Al will be played
by a tall, dark and ugly man.

938
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:39,263
- 1am your master now.
- l was afraid of that.

939
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:42,539
Genie, grant me my first wish.

940
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:46,255
I wish to rule on high. As sultan.

941
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:53,854
Bless my soul.

942
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,381
What is this? What's going on?

943
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,330
- Oh, my goodness. What's happened?
- Father!

944
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:06,202
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

945
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,272
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

946
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:11,749
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.

947
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:17,581
- The lamp.
- Finders keepers, Abubu.

948
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:34,949
Genie, no!

949
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:37,944
Sorry, kid. got a new master now.

950
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,715
Jafar, l order you to stop.

951
01:11:42,098 --> 01:11:45,378
But there's a new order now. My order.

952
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:48,892
Finally you will bow to me.

953
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:51,072
We will never bow to you.

954
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:53,184
Why am I not surprised?

955
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:55,649
If you won't bow before a sultan,

956
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,882
then you will cower before a sorcerer.

957
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:01,368
Genie, my second wish.

958
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:05,527
I wish to be the most powerful
sorcerer in the world.

959
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:09,944
Genie, stop.

960
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:12,572
Ladies and gentlemen,

961
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:17,302
a warm Agrabah welcome
for sorcerer Jafar.

962
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:20,665
Now, where were we?

963
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,540
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

964
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:28,816
Down, boy.

965
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,549
Oh, Princess. There's someone
I'm dying to introduce you to.

966
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,697
Get your hands off her.

967
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:40,706
Prince Ali, yes it is he
But not as you know him

968
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:45,360
Read my lips
And come to grips with reality

969
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,412
Yes, meet a blast from your past

970
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,951
Whose lies were too good to last

971
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:54,404
Say hello to your precious Prince Ali

972
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:57,154
Or should we say Aladdin?

973
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,582
I tried to tell you. I'm just...

974
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:05,811
So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin

975
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:10,365
Just acon, need 1 go on?
Take it from me

976
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:14,887
His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause

977
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,191
To send him packing on a one-way trip

978
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:19,483
So his prospects take a terminal dip

979
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:21,969
His assets frozen, the venue chosen

980
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:25,351
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!

981
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:28,205
- So long
- Goodbye. See ya.

982
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:33,144
Ex-Prince Ali

983
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:09,637
This is all my fault.

984
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:12,849
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance.

985
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:16,557
Are you OK?

986
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,493
I'm sorry, Abu.

987
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:23,282
l made a mess of everything. Somehow.

988
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,786
Got to go back and set things right.

989
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,653
Carpet.

990
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:41,392
Abu, start digging.

991
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,023
That's it.

992
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,422
Yeah! All right.

993
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:14,054
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

994
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:20,299
Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here. Here's your cracker.

995
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:23,836
Shove 'em down your throat.
Here, have lots of crackers.

996
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,040
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.

997
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:33,302
It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

998
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:38,218
A beautiful bloom such as yourself

999
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:41,941
should be on the arm of
the most powerful man in the world.

1000
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,141
What do you say, my dear?

1001
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,870
Why, with you as my queen...

1002
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:48,616
Never.

1003
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:53,001
I'll teach you some respect.

1004
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,849
No. Genie.

1005
01:15:58,254 --> 01:16:00,394
l have decided to make my final wish.

1006
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:06,026
I wish for Princess Jasmine
to fall desperately in love with me.

1007
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:15,821
Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quos.

1008
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:18,327
Don't talk back, you big blue lout.

1009
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:23,184
You will do what I order
you to do, slave.

1010
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:32,146
I never realized how
incredibly handsome you are.

1011
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,531
That's better.

1012
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,730
Now, pussycat,

1013
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:43,760
tell me more about myself.

1014
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,040
You're tall, dark.

1015
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:51,505
Well-dressed.

1016
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,827
Al. Little buddy.

1017
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:58,216
My love.

1018
01:16:58,848 --> 01:17:02,218
Al, l can't help you.
I work for xeno-psychopath now.

1019
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:05,711
- What are you going to do?
- I'm a street rat, remember?

1020
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:10,638
- I'll improvise.
- Cute little gaps between your teeth.

1021
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:13,027
Go on.

1022
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:17,549
And your beard is so

1023
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,070
twisted.

1024
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,862
You've stolen my heart.

1025
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:27,820
And the street rat?

1026
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,714
What street rat?

1027
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,001
That was...

1028
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:47,885
You.

1029
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:52,276
How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?

1030
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:58,407
Get the lamp.

1031
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,206
No.

1032
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,875
Princess, your time is up.

1033
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:11,562
Nice shot, Jafar.

1034
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,295
Don't toy with me.

1035
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:21,240
Things are unraveling fast now, boy.

1036
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,217
Get the point?

1037
01:18:32,408 --> 01:18:34,748
I'm just getting warmed up.

1038
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:40,402
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1039
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,440
A snake, am I?

1040
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:48,386
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

1041
01:19:06,008 --> 01:19:07,938
Stick that sword into that snake.

1042
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:09,707
You stay out of this.

1043
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:12,409
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it...

1044
01:19:12,815 --> 01:19:13,955
Great!

1045
01:19:29,665 --> 01:19:31,475
Jasmine, hang on.

1046
01:19:34,003 --> 01:19:36,933
You little fool.

1047
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:42,156
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on earth.

1048
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,748
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a...

1049
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:49,815
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.

1050
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:52,726
The genie.

1051
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,129
The genie has more power than you.

1052
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:58,332
- What?
- He gave you your power.

1053
01:19:58,661 --> 01:20:02,291
- He can take it away.
- Al, why are you bringing me into this?

1054
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:06,205
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second-best.

1055
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:12,180
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.

1056
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,831
But not for long.

1057
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:17,897
The boy's crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

1058
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:22,387
- One too many hits with the snake.
- Slave, l make my third wish.

1059
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:26,768
I wish to be an all-powerful genie.

1060
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:33,343
All right. Your wish is my command.

1061
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:35,629
Way to go, Al.

1062
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,172
Yes.

1063
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,597
The power.

1064
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:53,128
The absolute power.

1065
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:56,933
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1066
01:20:58,287 --> 01:21:02,947
The universe is mine to command.
To control.

1067
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:06,969
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1068
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:09,836
You wanted to be a genie? You got it.

1069
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,422
- What?
- And everything that goes with it.

1070
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:16,186
No.

1071
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:19,672
- I'm getting out of here.
- Phenomenal cosmic powers.

1072
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,897
Itty-bitty living space.

1073
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,135
Al, you little genius, you.

1074
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,294
Get your beak out of my face.

1075
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:47,822
- Shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1076
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:53,407
Allow me. Ten thousand years in a cave
of wonders ought to chill him out.

1077
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,254
Shut up.

1078
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:08,710
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1079
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,934
I know why you did.

1080
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:16,971
Well, l guess this is goodbye.

1081
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,446
That stupid law. This isn't fair.

1082
01:22:20,903 --> 01:22:22,453
I love you.

1083
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,086
Al, no problem.
You still got one wish left.

1084
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:29,649
Say the word and you're a prince again.

1085
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:31,762
But what about your freedom?

1086
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,800
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.

1087
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,000
This is love.

1088
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:41,159
Al, you're not going to find another
girl like her in a million years.

1089
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:43,946
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

1090
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:48,004
Jasmine, I do love you.

1091
01:22:48,397 --> 01:22:51,237
But I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1092
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,510
l understand.

1093
01:22:55,904 --> 01:23:00,034
- Genie, I wish for your freedom.
- One prince pedigree coming up.

1094
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,486
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

1095
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:27,297
I'm free.

1096
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:31,953
Quick, wish for something outrageous.
Say, "I want the Nile." Try that.

1097
01:23:33,242 --> 01:23:35,052
- L wish for the Nile.
- No way.

1098
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:39,192
Does that feel good.

1099
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:42,451
I'm free. I'm free at last.

1100
01:23:42,918 --> 01:23:45,527
I'm hitting the road.
I'm off to see the world.

1101
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:58,935
I'm going to miss you.

1102
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:01,141
Me too, Al.

1103
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:05,444
No matter what anybody says,

1104
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:07,958
you'll always be a prince to me.

1105
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:14,105
That's right. You've certainly proven
your worth as far as I'm concerned.

1106
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:17,183
It's that law that's the problem.

1107
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:20,576
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1108
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:26,326
From this day forth, the princess
shall marry whoever she deems worthy.

1109
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:29,632
Him. I choose...

1110
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:34,098
I choose you, Aladdin.

1111
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,447
Call me Al.

1112
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:42,604
All of you, come over here.
Big group hug.

1113
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:46,879
Do you mind if I kiss the monkey?
Hairball.

1114
01:24:47,349 --> 01:24:51,919
Well, l can't do any more damage around
this Popsicle stand. I'm out of here.

1115
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,764
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds.

1116
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:57,583
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

1117
01:24:57,993 --> 01:24:59,543
No, I'm mythology.

1118
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:02,288
I don't care what I am. I'm free.

1119
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:07,874
A whole new world

1120
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:10,516
A whole new life

1121
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:14,826
For you and me

1122
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:35,402
Made you look.

1123
01:26:24,413 --> 01:26:28,133
} can show you the world

1124
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:33,196
Shining, shimmering, splendid

1125
01:26:33,889 --> 01:26:39,159
Tell me, Princess, now when
Did you last let your heart decide?

1126
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:45,824
! can open your eyes

1127
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:50,380
Take you wonder by wonder

1128
01:26:51,006 --> 01:26:54,376
Over, sideways and under

1129
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:58,010
On a magic-carpet ride

1130
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:02,383
A whole new world

1131
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:06,764
A new fantastic point of view

1132
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:12,245
No one to tell us no or where to go

1133
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:16,014
Or say we're only dreaming

1134
01:27:16,498 --> 01:27:20,218
A whole new world

1135
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:24,871
A dazzling place I never knew

1136
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:30,137
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear

1137
01:27:30,846 --> 01:27:36,116
That now I'm in
A whole new world with you

1138
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:43,895
Unbelievable sights

1139
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:48,273
Indescribable feeling

1140
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:52,114
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

1141
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:55,854
Through an endless diamond sky

1142
01:27:56,371 --> 01:28:00,291
- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes

1143
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:04,949
- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better

1144
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,269
I'm like a shooting star

1145
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:10,527
I've come so far

1146
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:16,122
- 1 can't go back to where I used to be
- A whole new world

1147
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:22,853
With new horizons to pursue

1148
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:28,218
I'll chase them anywhere,
There's time to spare

1149
01:28:28,937 --> 01:28:34,177
Let me share
This whole new world with you

1150
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:53,898
A whole new world

1151
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:58,479
A new fantastic point of view

1152
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:03,850
No one to tell us no or where to go

1153
01:29:04,573 --> 01:29:07,473
Or say we're only dreaming

1154
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:11,663
- A whole new world
- Every turn a surprise

1155
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:16,317
- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment red-letter

1156
01:29:16,952 --> 01:29:21,752
I'll chase them anywhere,
There's time to spare

1157
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:26,500
- Anywhere
- There's time to spare

1158
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:32,398
Let me share
This whole new world with you

1159
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:44,922
A whole new world

1160
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:49,413
That's where we'll be

1161
01:29:50,018 --> 01:29:54,268
- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place

1162
01:29:54,923 --> 01:30:00,193
For you and me
