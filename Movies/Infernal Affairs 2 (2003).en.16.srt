1
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:09,106
The Infernal Affairs screenplay
is rich in content,

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:13,926
so we could have many,
many sequels if we wanted.

3
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,725
But that all depends on the box office,

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,400
since that's what lets you
go on making sequels.

5
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,279
ANTHONY WONG:
It's very seldom

6
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:34,059
that you get to do
a monologue for over a minute.

7
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:41,232
You talk to yourself like a fool.
That actually takes a lot of skill.

8
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,819
Because...
you want the audience to see--

9
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:49,379
you want a kind of intensity.

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:56,349
I'm talking to this other guy, describing
something I saw the other day.

11
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:02,391
I'm speaking calmly,
but what I'm saying needs to be scary.

12
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:08,963
To make the audience feel
that scariness is a real skill.

13
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,506
Anybody can speak.
You just spit out the words.

14
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,008
You can just read
whatever's on the page.

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,490
SIU FAI MAK: In the beginning,

16
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,629
Wong Chi Shing and Han Sam
are good friends.

17
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,869
Han Sam is a polite man.

18
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:26,202
Sure, he's a gang leader,
but he's content, not too ambitious,

19
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:33,057
and he never worried much about
committing atrocities in his line of work.

20
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,944
He pretty much joined the triad
just to make a living.

21
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,379
It is his destiny.

22
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:50,414
As for Mr. Wong, everyone thinks
of him as a loyal father figure.

23
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:56,085
He hates bad guys,
and he stays pretty calm.

24
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:05,983
By contrast, we wonder why
Officer Wong changed so drastically.

25
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,717
He never used to be calm
by any means.

26
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,634
In fact, he was downright
cruel in the past.

27
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,787
Actually, he always meant
to be a good man,

28
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:24,278
but he chose to ignore proper procedure,
to do things his own way.

29
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:34,228
ERIC TSANG: Sam is the least
ambitious one in infernal Affairs.

30
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:41,708
He is a person with a traditional mindset,
a common person in the world.

31
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,447
A gang leader is always
a gang leader, period.

32
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,390
He should never have considered
usurping the gang leader's position.

33
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,652
SIU FAI MAK:
We don't learn everything there is

34
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,101
to know about Sam in Infernal Affairs.

35
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:08,143
Sam is a very emotionally reserved
character in Infernal Affairs.

36
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,475
Whenever he appears, he presents
himself strictly as a gang leader.

37
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:17,255
He shows authority, gives orders,
and breaks a few eggshells when needed.

38
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,884
At one point,
I thought of having a scene

39
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,613
where Sam has to pick up the eggshells!

40
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,258
When you finish a meal,
somebody has to clean up the mess!

41
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:39,955
As an audience member, ! want to
find out what kind of person he is.

42
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:45,938
Not just as an audience member--
I myself want to know too!

43
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:53,771
In real life,
there are real gang leaders,

44
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,094
and it's understandable we would be
curious how they behave.

45
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:05,765
Does he do his own laundry?
You know, that kind of mundane stuff.

46
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:41,570
CARINA LAU: Mary is a clever lady,
but she's also very traditional.

47
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:46,526
She always follows her husband.

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,630
She takes it for granted that if
her husband is good, she will be happy.

49
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:59,168
For any such lady, her life typically
revolves around her husband.

50
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,599
She does whatever her husband says.

51
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,092
She concludes that, since her husband
is so great, "Why should he be a follower?

52
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,659
My husband should
be the gang leader."

53
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,671
In my opinion,
that's what you'd expect of a woman.

54
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,796
In infernal Affairs tl,
I pictured the first scene

55
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,263
showing Lau Kin Ming walking
down the street

56
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,739
from Monkok to Tsimshatsui.

57
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,785
Then he shoots.

58
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:41,252
I don't know why, but for the whole movie,
it's the first scene I always remember.

59
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:49,635
We have Lau Kin Ming taking Mary's
clothes--Mary being played by Carina Lau.

60
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:56,700
Ngai Kun, gang leader in Ngai families.

61
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:04,951
This whole circuit that Edison Chen
walked, I wanted it perfect.

62
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:13,772
Whatever he was doing--walking,
making expressions, holding a gun--

63
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:21,618
l wanted Lau Kin Ming to do
everything perfectly.

64
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,312
The manner of firing the gun,
the manner of walking--

65
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,833
both needed to be perfect.

66
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:40,303
I feel every scene has a characteristic.

67
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:45,541
EDISON CHEN:
I feel Lau Kin Ming had

68
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:51,036
many good scenes to perform
in this second installment.

69
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,035
I can't say no one ever cared
for my character,

70
00:06:55,548 --> 00:07:04,518
but he had the feeling of being
a lone wolf during his childhood.

71
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:11,275
After talking with Felix,
the screenwriter,

72
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,852
l would go home
and ponder these things.

73
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:22,012
was thinking how I could incorporate
my own experiences into the role,

74
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,323
so that I would remember
the feeling when I was acting--

75
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:33,303
I could feel the emotions
and invest them into the performance.

76
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,714
I find that really helped me a lot.

77
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:43,238
Before I ever read the script,
I made a point of telling myself

78
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:53,000
everyone considers Mary to be
someone with authority and presence.

79
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,497
But after seeing the script,
I concluded that

80
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:05,104
Mary should be a person
who is graceful and polite.

81
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:13,308
She would speak differently
when facing different people.

82
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,781
She is a woman of taste.

83
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,378
Since she runs her own
music and electronics store,

84
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,847
she knows a great deal
about music and about stereos.

85
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,772
She's a woman who knows
a thing or two about life.

86
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,370
I think that Mary's attitude towards
Lau Kin Ming is pure and direct.

87
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:41,217
She just appreciates
this boy very much.

88
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:46,355
She felt that he was clever,
ambitious, and loyal.

89
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:55,899
Carina Lau is a nice lady.

90
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:07,126
Most of the girls
l know are young and lovely.

91
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,231
Working with Carina Lau,
I cannot just be myself

92
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,669
because the feeling is different.

93
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:25,775
The way Carina Lau smokes,
the way she carries herself--

94
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,290
all she has to do is look at you,

95
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,482
and you want to sit up straight
and speak clearly.

96
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,434
So even walking should not be done
the normal way Edison Chen does it.

97
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:43,275
He should be more mature,
to match her mode of conduct.

98
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,617
CHAPMAN TO:
In infernal Affairs lil,

99
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,487
we assume that Crazy Keung
is in his 30s.

100
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:10,415
That puts Crazy Keung in his 20s
in Infernal Affairs It.

101
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,084
At the beginning,
the director of movie thought that

102
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,751
I needed to look like
a young Crazy Keung,

103
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,459
so he wanted me to lose weight.

104
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:23,366
Then I lost about 20 pounds
for the part.

105
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,793
I lost weight and took care
of the outward appearance,

106
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:32,453
but now I had to take care
of my internal state, my behavior.

107
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:37,986
We had in mind from the start
the sort of person who never grows up,

108
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,955
who never grows in his intelligence.

109
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,103
No matter what he goes through,
he never learns anything.

110
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,644
We took Crazy Keung
to be such a person.

111
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:54,236
So we let Crazy Keung
be the kind of guy

112
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,671
who never polishes his behavior,

113
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,902
who never grows in his understanding.

114
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,569
In fact, Chan Wing Yan and I
had a complex relationship,

115
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,341
because many people don't realize

116
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,986
that Crazy Keung was a show-off
who liked to flash his stuff.

117
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,254
You can tell by his constantly
changing styles during the movie.

118
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:29,007
Maybe you can pick up on the fact
that this ordinary valet

119
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,446
has a very flashy ponytail.

120
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,665
If anything, he's overdressed,

121
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:40,259
probably because Crazy Keung
is obsessed with looking handsome.

122
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,274
And you do realize,
Chen really is handsome.

123
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,209
Crazy Keung wants to look good,
and he sees that Chen looks good,

124
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:55,933
so he naturally feels good about that
and becomes good friends with him.

125
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:03,939
Chan Wing Yan is a complex person.
How can we say that?

126
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:12,174
Because there are many things
he refused to do.

127
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,516
But he has no choice--
he has to do it.

128
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,622
In fact, it's very simple--
he's undercover.

129
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:25,446
He pretty much hates the gangs,
but he has to rub shoulders with them.

130
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,859
That's the heart of the conflict--

131
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,295
"Il don't like you,
but I can't let you know that."

132
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,550
JUN HU:
Shawn Yue, he was my subordinate.

133
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:43,377
He was just a student who
hasn't graduated from police school.

134
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,743
I like him very much.

135
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,935
But once I know the relationship

136
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,641
between Ngai Wing-Hau,
played by Francis Ng, and him,

137
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,665
I start to be cautious of him.

138
00:12:55,108 --> 00:13:01,818
Wong Sir just took advantage
of this relationship to help Yu

139
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,452
to get into Ngai Wing-Hau's "family."

140
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:11,533
Shawn Yue was very studious.

141
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:18,878
Whenever we were setting up lights,
or whenever he was free,

142
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,649
he would ask me questions like
what should he do as an actor,

143
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:30,156
what should he study,
should he go to school?

144
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:35,264
He asked me about that kind of thing--
what should he be paying attention to.

145
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:42,812
We had good communication,
so I didn't treat him like an idol.

146
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,516
I still think he is
a hard-working person.

147
00:13:48,127 --> 00:14:02,817
In fact, Chan Wing Yan's background
is very complex. He's a gang member.

148
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:10,894
But he followed his mother's name

149
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,704
because he didn't want to have
any relationship with the triads.

150
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,516
So he came out with his mother
and became a policeman

151
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:26,786
because he wanted
to escape from the triads.

152
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,370
However, he is a triad,
unfortunately, so he could not do it.

153
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:44,180
Moreover, he had blood ties
with these people in the triads,

154
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:52,948
which was beyond his control.

155
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,649
FRANCIS NG:
Wing-Hau was a nice person,

156
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:11,569
but he was a member of the triad.

157
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:16,248
Members of triads
fall into two categories--

158
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,399
people with family ties to the triad,
and people without family ties.

159
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,932
He had a blood relationship
with these people.

160
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:27,068
He was graceful,
calm, peaceful, and generous.

161
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,050
I think he could easily have been
an entrepreneur or a politician,

162
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:42,125
but he was tied to the triads.

163
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:48,905
I guess it was a sensitive matter
in society.

164
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:53,599
We wanted Francis Ng for
the first picture, but he couldn't do it.

165
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,620
But we got him for the second.

166
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,181
But then, if we had used
Francis Ng in the first picture,

167
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,184
he would have had no place
in the second.

168
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:10,200
Francis Ng is very much
a recognizable actor.

169
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:19,343
This time, I expressly wanted him
to play a second-generation triad.

170
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:28,239
He used to be an accountant,
but the family has changed.

171
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:33,648
His father died. There was no one
to take over the family business.

172
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:42,348
So he had to take it, but he faced
a lot of pressure from everyone else,

173
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:51,139
because the family business
had many branches.

174
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:57,342
To put it simply, it's a big family.

175
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,597
Sam looks after a certain branch,
and others look after other branches.

176
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,358
When Ngai, the old gang leader, died,

177
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:10,226
the four leading families wouldn't
necessarily toe Ngai Wing-Hau's line.

178
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,986
Not so Sam, who was very loyal.

179
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:21,890
When Ngai Wing-Hau took over
the business, he had to consider

180
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:34,339
how to use strategy and his own
intelligence, and how to face the triads.

181
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:46,938
We needed just the right person
for the role of Ngai Wing-Hau.

182
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:57,776
In fact, Francis was our best choice.
I knew he could handle this role.

183
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:05,665
This role was unusual
in the annals of Hong Kong cinema.

184
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:12,015
For example,
he was a real intellectual,

185
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,605
and he had a lot of plans in mind,

186
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,505
but he never got nervous
in the face of emergencies.

187
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,693
He knew how to persuade
several other gang leaders

188
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,934
in a phone call
at the beginning of the movie.

189
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,947
How many things did he have in mind?
Hard to tell.

190
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:43,553
So we needed an enigmatic person
to take the role,

191
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:51,731
and Francis Ng was
Ngai Wing-Hau in the movie.

192
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:56,635
l would use him to indicate
what kind of person Ngai Wing-Hau is,

193
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:06,743
and how he could possibly persuade
all the triad members in one night.

194
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:19,407
And then came the second phase,
when he finally annihilated them.

195
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:28,470
We see him play both ends
against the middle--

196
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,848
the police versus the Ngai family--

197
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:36,374
and how he balances them
one at a time.

198
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:40,553
Francis Ng had prepared for that.

199
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,547
In fact, he was
an easily excited person,

200
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:51,174
but he had to establish
the proper pitch for the role,

201
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:56,190
and therefore he tried to be a person
who never got too excited.

202
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,612
For him, it was a challenge
with a certain degree of difficulty.

203
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:04,928
He always kept an even keel.

204
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:14,081
He always gave us
a pitch-perfect leader, every time.

205
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:23,633
He wanted to read the script
before deciding how to play the part.

206
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:29,337
"You guys need to start shooting fast,
or else I'll forget what I've prepared!"

207
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:34,601
Actually, Francis Ng
is a supremely capable actor.

208
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,781
He's very selective.
He doesn't take just any role.

209
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:44,105
A poorly qualified actor always talks
about how he should play his role well.

210
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:49,294
But Francis Ng--

211
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,445
and Andy Lau, and Tony Leung,
and Anthony Wong--

212
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,119
I never heard any such thing
from them.

213
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,765
They just talked
about making choices.

214
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,319
This refers to the fact that they have
their own little corner on the role.

215
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,672
They didn't worry about the role,
just that little corner.

216
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:18,452
Take Francis Ng's role, for example--

217
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:23,628
"l want to be a leader
in the triad from now on."

218
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,592
It'd be easy to fall back on the same
old approach, talking very authoritatively.

219
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,760
And that is a true fact.

220
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:35,889
It's very easy--there are ways
of getting things done.

221
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:42,366
He speaks with absolute authority.

222
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:48,019
At his word, ten thousand people
are ready to act.

223
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,761
But he didn't want to act that way,
and I didn't want it either.

224
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:56,374
But it was the same as always
in the script.

225
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,089
He would stop and think,
"Where was my choice?"

226
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,880
Ngai Wing-Hau's still learning
to take on these huge responsibilities.

227
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,676
That is his choice.

228
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:14,841
He insisted on acting it this way,
right down to the line readings.

229
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:22,691
l admire one of his sayings very much.
He said, "I play the role by ‘subtracting.’

230
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:27,496
"We actors often say
we act by ‘adding'--

231
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:32,973
that is, you find out the way
of speaking of this role,

232
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,652
then you add the body actions
of another role--

233
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,372
for instance, hand gestures,
holding a cigarette. That's typical.

234
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:47,851
But Francis Ng said, "No, I can't
do it that way. I'll do it by subtraction."

235
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,337
Take his lines, for example.

236
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,548
He spoke the lines in a reserved tone,

237
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:04,872
perhaps even a bit shy
and modest tone, which was unusual.

238
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:10,425
That is to say, he even issues orders
in a shy and modest tone.

239
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,383
What does it look like in the end?

240
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:19,335
This is what actors of Francis Ng's
caliber bring to a role.

241
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,899
It's very unusual.

242
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,432
If an actor of lower caliber
played the role,

243
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,279
he would speak the lines out loud,

244
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,668
open his eyes wide,
and say, "Very good."

245
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,547
He's a new edition.

246
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,688
I think it's really unique.

247
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:43,620
After l watched it,
after ! and Wai Keung Lau watched it,

248
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:48,533
we wondered,
is this the leader of a sinister gang?

249
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,854
Not hardly. However, if he plays
the leader of a sinister gang this way,

250
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:55,168
he's making it something special,
something unique.

251
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:58,187
He's a good guy, basically.

252
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:03,206
FRANCIS NG:
I don't think I calculated the role this way.

253
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,073
I just delivered the performance
the script called for.

254
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,603
To me, it's meaningless.

255
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:13,081
l imagine other people
would play it another way.

256
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:20,329
But to me, that's the only method
that would allow me to take the role.

257
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:28,643
l accepted the role for the challenge,
because it doesn't fit my usual image.

258
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:36,766
l was interested, and I think
other people were also interested.

259
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:46,276
I don't think that everyone
would play the role in this way.

260
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:56,906
l felt a bit worried when I was acting,
because ! would not revise his lines.

261
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:01,287
It's like looking at a famous painting.

262
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,520
You look at it for a while, then you can
close your eyes and trace it mentally.

263
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:11,331
Other people will trace it
accordingly. It's different.

264
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,697
For me, I watch it and think that,

265
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,364
"Oh God, I'm afraid I can't trace out
the things in my mind."

266
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:22,322
So basically, I didn't create anything.

267
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:26,745
I just projected the images
in my mind literally,

268
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:30,803
and ran them over to the audience.

269
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:35,477
After we began shooting, they asked me

270
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:40,475
how I could decrease the vigor
of the role to such a degree.

271
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,606
A cultured man would not put all
his energy or talent on constant display.

272
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,250
As for "adding," I didn't add anything.
But there were some scenes

273
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:58,490
where suddenly, like gifts from heaven,
l felt very happy about them.

274
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:05,920
Like the toast. It wasn't in the script
and would not be very interesting to read.

275
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:12,085
Wai Keung Lau's way of shooting
is quite open too.

276
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:17,595
Towards the end of shooting,
there arose a kind of mood

277
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,370
which affected
every single actor on the set.

278
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:32,829
Even bit players and extras
could feel the sad atmosphere.

279
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:39,016
It was like a funeral.

280
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:45,722
It's interesting that usually
we toast and shout hooray--

281
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:50,558
"Long live Big Brother"--
a group of fellow sufferers.

282
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:57,868
But I remember that day,
after I raised my toast,

283
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:02,524
the man opposite me raised his,
and then everyone raised theirs, slowly.

284
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,885
They were all invested in the moment,
not just wandering souls before a camera.

285
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:14,985
So it was very moving to record
this scene on film, and very unusual.

286
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:21,884
Usually, those bit players
will not act until you ask them to.

287
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:27,625
But this time they communicated
such feeling, which is very uncommon.

288
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,310
Wai Keung Lau, shooting a film--

289
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:04,236
I think I'll act according to
the script for the first time.

290
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:15,220
In infernal Affairs, there was a scene
about my drilling in the Cadet School.

291
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:25,668
He thought I didn't drill well enough
to be a convincing cop, so he beat me.

292
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:31,575
I thought he was being too strict.

293
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:36,587
He beat me, so ! said to him,

294
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:43,199
"You beat me one more time,
and I'll beat you back."

295
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,658
I'm pleased to accept his advice,

296
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,010
because he has shot
even longer than Andy Lau,

297
00:28:53,765 --> 00:29:01,005
and he has known more players
than others.

298
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,917
So I respect his opinions.

299
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:08,436
Nevertheless, I think he should
also listen to my opinions,

300
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,117
since I'm the one playing the role.

301
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:16,538
Even if I didn't follow his directions,
he couldn't do anything about me.

302
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:24,779
But I respect both of them,
because they're very experienced.

303
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:30,291
You can see from Infernal Affairs
that they've written and directed the film.

304
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:06,221
WAI KEUNG LAU: Keung, since
he himself liked the role very much,

305
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,459
I didn't have to give much input.

306
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:14,415
He could emote
and act it naturally from his heart.

307
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,547
He had already caught the sense.

308
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,233
Before the second picture,

309
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,263
I let him know I had no doubts
about his acting,

310
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,437
but I did have my doubts
about his physique.

311
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,139
"If you can't lose 20 pounds,
I'll drop this role."

312
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:41,988
He certainly met my requirements.

313
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:48,354
It was like seeing Chapman To
ten years ago.

314
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:56,322
SIU FAI MAK: I've planned
SP Wong to be such a bad guy.

315
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,475
Actually, I felt like planning
a guardian angel around SP Wong.

316
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,891
We believe there is an angel
around everybody.

317
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,336
The problem is whether
you pay attention to it or not.

318
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,351
SP Luk is the angel around SP Wong.

319
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,725
The difference between
SP Luk and SP Wong

320
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,368
is that SP Luk believes in the law,

321
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,077
while SP Wong is a cop
who does not believe in the law.

322
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:23,166
SP Wong will do anything,
by fair means or foul, to arrest criminals.

323
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,411
However, SP Luk believes
in "live and let live."

324
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:29,425
If you don't break the law, no problem,
but if you do, he's ready to pounce.

325
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:33,391
He's such an upright cop.

326
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,294
In the beginning, we didn't
specify which actor would play him,

327
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,876
until one day
someone mentioned Jun Hu.

328
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:46,618
I thought that was a good idea,
because I quite like him.

329
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,178
Then I began to talk it over with Jun Hu

330
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,279
and showed him the script.
He liked it very much too.

331
00:32:53,772 --> 00:33:00,861
So it was done,
and we began to shoot.

332
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,768
SIU FAI MAK:
As for Shawn Yue's performance,

333
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,795
I didn't want to talk much with him.

334
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,366
It's terrible to talk through the creation
of a role from beginning to end.

335
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:52,644
It'll take you three months
to explain it clearly.

336
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:59,566
So Wai Keung Lau and !
found an easy way for him--

337
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,335
Why not start with imitation?

338
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:07,397
That is, imitating the performance
of Leung, CW Tony in Infernal Affairs,

339
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:20,362
including his way of walking, speaking,
even the expressions in his eyes.

340
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,757
Leung's eye expressions
were the most difficult part to learn.

341
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:33,699
This method is doable,
but it may be not a good one.

342
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:41,333
But after watching Infernal Affairs
about 100 times,

343
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:48,674
he gradually formed an image
of Chan Wing Yan in his mind.

344
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,049
SHAWN YUE: I started to cooperate
with Francis just from this film.

345
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,768
Honestly speaking,

346
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,467
in the beginning when we were
not very familiar with each other,

347
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,521
I found it a bit daunting,

348
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:11,451
because I thought it would be
hard to get to know him,

349
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:16,557
while at the same time
I knew very clearly

350
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:21,465
that we had an intimate
relationship in this film.

351
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,342
What was I to do?

352
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:30,185
So, during shooting,
whenever we'd take a break,

353
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:37,215
I'd sit beside them off-camera
and listen to them talking.

354
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:51,191
By being near them, I hoped I could
muster more feelings during shooting.

355
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,569
CARINA LAU: In fact, I already
knew Edison Chen personally.

356
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:47,522
I've known him for several years,
because knew his dad.

357
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,470
I think he's changed
a lot during these last few years.

358
00:36:51,976 --> 00:37:00,736
He used to play around a lot.
He was a bit of a wild boy.

359
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,683
After these years of working,
he's become more mature.

360
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:11,117
During shooting, he'd like to find
chances to be close with me,

361
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,740
just chatting.

362
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:20,202
He said he's watched all my films.
I said, "Stop exaggerating!"

363
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:24,509
He said he would find an angle
to love me.

364
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,473
I discovered my young friend
was serious about his craft.

365
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:58,061
WAI KEUNG LAU: Ever since we wrote
the script, there were many characters.

366
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:05,691
How can we help the audience
distinguish the family members

367
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,723
from the bodyguards?

368
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,600
Take Roy Cheung,
for example, in the role of Law.

369
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,184
It's clear to see he's the bodyguard
for Ngai Wing-Hau, and very special.

370
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:21,324
He has no dialogue,
which makes him even more special.

371
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,763
Let me borrow an expression
from SARS--

372
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,835
Why should we select
such atypical characters?

373
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:32,091
Because the selection of the cast
is very important for the film.

374
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:37,871
The selection of the cast
is very helpful for the film.

375
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,870
Is it really necessary for us
to select such atypical actors?

376
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,649
Atypical actors
are not the usual players.

377
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,109
We thought,
why don't we find some directors?

378
00:38:53,932 --> 00:39:02,341
We happened to have a list of
directors on the table.

379
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:07,648
We had a list of directors
in the meeting.

380
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,299
Many of these directors
have acted before.

381
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:15,071
Why don't we use their experience
and acting skills?

382
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:22,143
So we picked out four famous directors.

383
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:27,467
Arthur Wong plays Wah,
Henry Fong plays Gandhi,

384
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:34,286
Peter Ngor plays Negro,
and Teddy Chan plays Ching.

385
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:41,066
It's suitable to place them in the film,
perhaps even according to age.

386
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:46,113
Some of them are elder,
while others are young,

387
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:50,474
and this gave the film some texture.

388
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,719
Of course, we showed them the script,

389
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,265
for a movie that might be
a little pricier than others.

390
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,375
We asked them whether they wanted
to accept the challenge or not.

391
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:07,024
l exaggerated to them
that Peter Ngor is my master,

392
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,782
and Arthur Wong
is Peter Ngor's master,

393
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:11,778
so Arthur Wong
is my master's master.

394
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:16,876
That's subtle, and very intimate--
the master and the master's master.

395
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:22,154
Teddy Chan and Henry Fong are
directors of two different generations.

396
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:29,337
Such a combination is funny
even in real-life.

397
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:35,805
When you see it in the film,
it will be just wonderful.

398
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:39,158
As soon as he sat down, Francis said,

399
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:44,323
"This is bad.
How can I out-act these guys?"

400
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,109
SHAWN YUE: In fact, SP Wong,
that is Anthony Wong,

401
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,259
has a significant impact on me.

402
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,276
I'm not sure whether it's
because our personal relationship is...

403
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:28,357
From my first meeting with him
to our collaboration on this film,

404
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,963
it's been really wonderful.

405
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:35,872
I've already worked with him on my
first film, and here we are together again.

406
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:44,497
He he's very kind to me.
He teaches me a lot of things.

407
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:50,236
So he plays the part
of SP Wong in the film,

408
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:56,207
which makes me feel really,
really intimate.

409
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:03,184
I'm so familiar with him, I don't have to
give communication a second thought.

410
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:08,814
Our relationship
has long since been established.

411
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:14,945
On this film, I feel
we are very well-acquainted indeed.

412
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:16,393
ERIC TSANG: In my opinion, Carina's
role epitomizes most of the female race,

413
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:24,298
since women cannot do
many of the things men can.

414
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,963
Therefore they pin their hope
on their husbands.

415
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:31,223
So, if someone's looking to find
what makes a woman tick,

416
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:35,162
look for something
she's hoping to achieve.

417
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:39,486
Let's say she can't be an executive,
but she has hope her husband can.

418
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:44,437
She can't be the leader of a sinister gang,
but, hey, maybe her boyfriend can.

419
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,399
Carina is a such person.

420
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,714
To some degree, she's
pushing me to achieve something

421
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,952
without me knowing it.

422
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:57,507
Carina and I are lovers
who love each other deeply.

423
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:01,672
In fact, she's the one
who changes my whole life.

424
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,780
My growth, my life process,
is split into two phases.

425
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:12,394
Sam has had a character arc
from one picture to the next.

426
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:20,281
Sam is transformed
because of Carina's character.

427
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:54,705
CARINA LAU:
What's fun is when you act,

428
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,379
especially with really professional
actors like Anthony Wong.

429
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,096
It was quite a challenge.

430
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:07,968
There was no problem
with rehearsing the script,

431
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:11,416
but when it actually came time
to perform the scene,

432
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:17,959
he suddenly goes like this, and my
first thought is, do I need to stop?

433
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,279
Do I go on playing like this?

434
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:24,846
Because at that time there were
too many things on my mind.

435
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,419
There were many ways
l could have played this moment,

436
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:29,892
but I hadn't thought it through carefully.

437
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:33,624
I gave an in-between response.

438
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,817
I thought I could do better...

439
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:43,214
and later on, I realized
I could have responded differently.

440
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:50,391
Like, when I stand up, I needn't
go away and shy away from him.

441
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,582
Because we're equal.
We're just using each other.

442
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:59,272
I needn't go away. I can just look
at you and see if you agree or not.

443
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,287
That's exactly my purpose today.

444
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,029
Everyone has his own idea.

445
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:10,355
The director wants it his way--

446
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:15,221
is there any possibility that Mr. Wong
and I have a love affair?

447
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,743
This is for the audience to guess.

448
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,170
Actually, this is good.
The charm of cinema lies in the fact

449
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:26,798
that everyone sees it
from his own perspective.

450
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,481
If you see it, you see it.
If you don't, you don't.

451
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,810
ANTHONY WONG: In that scene,
the relationship between the two

452
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,424
is very ambiguous,
and you can think of it any way you like.

453
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,596
This kind of relationship is
for the audience to imagine--

454
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,400
how are those two connected?

455
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,355
Because Carina and I have
only one scene where we meet.

456
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:16,435
WAI KEUNG LAU: Ever since
the first draft of the script appeared,

457
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:21,604
the approach to the character
of Luo Ji has been tricky.

458
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:31,375
The first draft gave him only one line.

459
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:38,497
How could we find an actor willing
to do one line and one line only?

460
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:45,763
This role was supremely hard to cast.

461
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:56,159
We thought long and hard
and decided we needed a special actor.

462
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:03,891
And we finally picked Roy Cheung.

463
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:09,185
Originally when we were
presenting the script to him,

464
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,130
he felt strange and went,
“Are you sure you want me?"

465
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:19,509
To put it bluntly, it's a walk-on.

466
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:23,327
It's just kind of set in place.

467
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:26,790
There isn't a lot of leeway
for him to bring out anything.

468
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:31,107
He listened to my explanation

469
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:36,955
that sometimes an actor doesn't need
any lines to show off his charm.

470
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:44,631
"l want you for this role because
I think you've got what it calls for."

471
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:51,500
1 don't know whether he knows it or not,
and he said, "I'll follow you."

472
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:57,516
I think this is a sign of trust
between actors and directors.

473
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:04,709
When the film was halfway finished,
I cut his one and only line.

474
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:10,939
And he accepted that.
All he said was, "Okay, take it out."

475
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:20,032
But this film let his characteristics
have their full play.

476
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:48,557
SIU FAI MAK:
The character of Lu Qichang

477
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:55,982
is actually like the role played by
Wong in Infernal Affairs 1.

478
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:01,394
We need a character like that.

479
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:08,396
When you're first watching the film,
you won't foresee this.

480
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,813
You won't think that he's gonna die,

481
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:16,426
and you don't imagine
any accident will befall him.

482
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,827
This guy must be a good man,
a lovely man.

483
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:24,261
Actually, if you ask me,
l wouldn't think it was fair,

484
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:30,045
that for no good reason you must
sacrifice in order to change another man.

485
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:34,283
The man who has changed
is Wong Chi Shing.

486
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:41,571
Hu Jun has worked with Wong Chi Shing

487
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,200
for many years in the police station,
on the same team.

488
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:54,044
He is much more direct than Wong.

489
00:51:55,112 --> 00:52:02,642
He thought the best way to treat
criminals is to arrest them directly,

490
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:10,674
and this is the way
that a policeman should be.

491
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:15,979
Wong does not agree
with him on this point.

492
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:28,395
During his career, Lu Qichang has risen
through the ranks faster than Wong,

493
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:36,933
but he doesn't look down on
or give up on Wong for what he is.

494
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:43,182
He keeps supporting Wong,
keeps working with him,

495
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:47,560
hoping he can change
his thinking one day.

496
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,035
At least he would never kill
his own brother for no good reason,

497
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,750
like those gangsters!

498
00:52:55,139 --> 00:53:02,169
Such a person, if he hasn't died,
can be promoted to assistant general,

499
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:10,517
or commander, or things like that.

500
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:28,195
FRANCIS NG: There are
no 100% righteous people,

501
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,956
but there are 100% evil ones.

502
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:41,362
It's hard to say, but I don't believe
people know how to look

503
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,536
through others' appearance.

504
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:50,503
Good or bad is just
the superficial packaging.

505
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:58,121
Anyway, anything that is helpful
for the family is right.

506
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:10,841
So I have been strange,
a gentle, refined, and calm person

507
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:16,562
who can put away his hatred
for ten years.

508
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,834
Revenge is a dish best eaten cold.

509
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:28,454
But for Ngai Wing-Hau,
right or wrong is always so simple.

510
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,509
In the film there are many
conflicts among the four big families.

511
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:37,580
In real life, you have rivalries
with bona fide actors

512
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:42,498
like Anthony Wong,
Eric Tsang, and Hu Jun.

513
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:47,961
It's much the same, since in the film
I have to beat the big families,

514
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:55,915
and in real life ! have to rival
these three award-winning actors.

515
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:01,067
It's very much the same
in and out of the movie.

516
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:07,502
We think of a method--

517
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:15,279
he read the first script
and saw how Anthony and Eric acted

518
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,440
so he could take the advantage.

519
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,759
At the same time,
he has done a lot of preparation.

520
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:34,106
Look at his glasses.
Look at his hair--does it need pomade?

521
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,986
We have checked
the make-up carefully.

522
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:45,993
As for acting, there are interior
and exterior aspects.

523
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:53,324
The actors use body language
to express themselves.

524
00:55:55,986 --> 00:56:04,806
Every expression of the eye,
from the stern look to the weak gaze--

525
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:10,229
we consider every detail.

526
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:19,401
Actually, we spent
a lot of time on Francis.

527
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:30,180
SIU FAI MAK: This time Uncle Chi
is in it, and I really appreciate that.

528
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:35,008
There is one scene about killing people,

529
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:41,896
which is rather long
and involves a lot of killing.

530
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:47,343
Uncle Chi is responsible for killing
the leader of one of the families.

531
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:52,378
Once this person is killed,
the cycle of assassinations is finished.

532
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:59,693
There is not much special depiction,
except for some actions and plots.

533
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:05,028
When we were shooting
the scene that night,

534
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:12,149
Uncle Chi was playing
the harmonica on the set all night long.

535
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,383
When we were filming,
we felt a little strange.

536
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,894
We looked at him
and called Wai Keung Lau.

537
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,439
Lau asked me what was going on,

538
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,298
and I said, Chi was able
to play the harmonica.

539
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:30,386
I figured he was hinting we shoot
footage of him playing the harmonica

540
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,194
after he killed those people.

541
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:38,380
And I went to ask Uncle Chi,
"Do you often play the harmonica?"

542
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,841
And he didn't say anything!

543
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:44,566
So we went on shooting.

544
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:49,810
After finishing the scene of the killing,
Uncle Chi watches that person die.

545
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:55,900
And I said, "Uncle Chi, how about
playing the harmonica now?"

546
00:57:56,707 --> 00:58:00,987
Actually, this is very interesting.

547
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:04,607
This is a kind of atmosphere,
and [ want to say just now

548
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:08,075
how to create
an atmosphere for a character.

549
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:13,805
He won't come to you and say,
"l will play the harmonica after the killing.

550
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:16,584
I will play ‘Friends Forever."

551
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,240
won't say it out, but he will do it,

552
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,799
and it creates an atmosphere
at the scene.

553
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:27,832
This is a kind of soft promotion
of atmosphere, which is very interesting,

554
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:35,125
with the playing of
"Friends Forever" at his own pace.

555
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,709
In the end we filmed two versions,
one with "Friends Forever"

556
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:42,944
and the other without.

557
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:47,127
The one with "Friends Forever"
is really fantastic.

558
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:52,034
And this is an actor.
He does a lot of preparation

559
00:58:52,763 --> 00:59:03,723
and chooses the suitable role,
and he keeps on adding things.

560
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:07,729
This is a good actor
who cooperates with others.

561
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,852
SIU FAI MAK: We were
looking for a bodyguard character

562
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:46,645
beside Ngai Wing-Hau.

563
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:51,609
This bodyguard
has been working for years,

564
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:56,469
and he has to be strongly built,

565
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:09,812
the kind of guy who can take you
by the throat with or without guns.

566
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:19,631
When we were designing this role,
we tried to give him a few lines,

567
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:27,181
but they turned out to be
almost always the same--

568
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:33,837
"Luo Ji has a covetous eye."

569
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:38,544
After having written this same line
maybe five times,

570
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:42,269
you'd finally just go,
"Just give him a line!"

571
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,556
Like when Ngai Wing-Hau
asks him, "How about that?"

572
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,502
He says, "Okay!"
Things like that.

573
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:53,671
Later on, when we approached
Yiu-Yeung Cheung, we said,

574
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:58,681
"We have this role. Do you want it?"

575
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,269
Of course the role has its appeal.

576
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:13,752
He is an undercover cop,
undercover for many years.

577
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:20,289
When we cast
it with Yiu-Yeung Cheung,

578
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,734
after the first day's shoot,
Yiu-Yeung Cheung stood there quietly,

579
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:28,194
which was a little scary
and made me kind of worried.

580
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,345
Wai Keung Lau knows him well,
so he didn't care a bit.

581
01:01:30,654 --> 01:01:34,284
He just kept saying, "You stay here.
Don't move, and no talking.”

582
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:43,455
And he kept saying this all day long.

583
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,981
When we saw him standing there
motionlessly looking at us,

584
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:48,941
we wondered if he was getting mad.

585
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:50,636
Do we need to write more lines for him?

586
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:53,491
If he cannot stand it and decides
to beat us, there would be problems.

587
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,520
We declined to add any lines for him,

588
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:58,677
but we found
this role really needs no talk.

589
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,654
When Yiu-Yeung Cheung is playing it,

590
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,614
there is no need for him to talk
throughout the movie.

591
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:08,367
This is when you begin thinking about
why this person is so strange.

592
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:13,572
What the hell does he do?

593
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:21,037
When we reach the middle part
of the movie, we all know who he is.

594
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,322
At some point,
the expression in his eyes

595
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:28,248
tells us there is something
he wants to tell Chan Wing Yan,

596
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,865
whose undercover identity he knows.

597
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:34,174
He wants to caution his young friend
about the danger.

598
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:38,964
On the other hand, this character
wants Chan Wing Yan to know

599
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:42,433
this is the fate of those
who go deep undercover.

600
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,979
WAI KEUNG LAU:
If were to tell some professional actors

601
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:51,647
l had a character for them,
but without so much as a single line,

602
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,182
I think most of them would take this
as a formidable challenge.

603
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:58,599
Yiu-Yeung Cheung thought so too.

604
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,449
At first he actually had one line,

605
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:06,232
and he asked us if we could add another.

606
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,593
I said yes, with much thought.

607
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:13,868
Actually, I didn't want there to be
any lines for him.

608
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,024
But this seemed unfair to him.
With just one line, we had him in.

609
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:24,774
Later on, he kept asking for lines,
and I gave him one that was absurd.

610
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:29,195
That is, right before his death, he says,

611
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,669
"Mr. Ngai, you are not
like this, are you?"

612
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:36,456
He said, "I can't do this."

613
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:40,113
I said, "I know, so why don't you just
try not speaking when you play it.”

614
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,380
And in the end,
he even didn't say this line.

615
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,062
CARINA LAU: Actually, for Mary,

616
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,310
she doesn't need to look at
Lau Kin Ming when talking with him.

617
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:06,888
They are boss and underling,
senior and junior.

618
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:12,507
When talking to him,
she will treat him like a child

619
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:17,883
and not care much
what his inner feelings may be.

620
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:22,191
Because she brings him up,
she never thinks

621
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:27,011
about the possibility of
a love affair occurring between them.

622
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:35,637
But when Lau Kin Ming grows up,
he begins to take notice of her,

623
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,830
which goes totally unnoticed by Mary.

624
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,719
Whenever Mary looks at
Lau Kin Ming, he shies away.

625
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,299
ERIC TSANG: Actually,
from the character Crazy Keung,

626
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,618
you can see, as [ have mentioned,
that lam a very traditional man.

627
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:32,722
Besides, there is always
one person like Crazy Keung

628
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,776
standing by the blood brother,
who is loyal but lacks moral sense.

629
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:40,086
He acts on the gang leader's orders.

630
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,803
If the leader tells him to hit
his head against the wall, he will hit it.

631
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,347
If he is told to smash his head,
he will smash it.

632
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:49,984
His only thought
is what he's ordered to do.

633
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:52,507
That's the nature of Crazy Keung.

634
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:59,622
But he is very happy, because
he doesn't need to think. Why bother?

635
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:05,140
If all l think about is waiting
for orders, then why think at all?

636
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:07,532
If l don't think, ! can be happy.

637
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:08,731
This is why he is called Crazy Keung,
because he is stupid.

638
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,305
He doesn't need to think.

639
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:17,723
The scene where
he and I go to Thailand,

640
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:22,915
he only says he wants a threesome,
a massage, and some shark's fin soup.

641
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:26,363
He is so simple.

642
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:30,250
When there is an accident,
he takes a potshot with two guns.

643
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,720
And he says, "Brother,
you go and I'll handle it.”

644
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,868
He doesn't think of
whether he can actually handle it.

645
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:41,723
I think, on some level,
in the gangster movies,

646
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,758
there are some people
who just give suggestions

647
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:47,568
and are always
planning things for you.

648
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,874
These people
will always remain in the background.

649
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,486
In the front,
there will always be a person

650
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:54,839
who blocks the bullet
for you with his body,

651
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,471
as if he is your shield.

652
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,577
Moreover, the assault is done
by his own gun.

653
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:04,196
The gang leader is always
planning things behind the scenes.

654
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:11,721
There are many soldiers,
vehicles, and guns at his disposal.

655
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,872
Crazy Keung is one such foot soldier.

656
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,626
SIU FAI MAK: Because every action
is initiated by somebody,

657
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:26,602
I think there should be a game for
them to decide who takes the initiative.

658
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:31,120
And I thought of drawing lots
using playing cards.

659
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:35,051
Jun Hu lost the game
almost every time,

660
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:38,192
so it's Mak who has been
in charge all these years.

661
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:42,484
Even after Jun Hu has been promoted,

662
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,261
when Mak has to
follow his orders, if there are any,

663
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,962
he keeps on
playing the card game with Mak.

664
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:51,566
This involves the brotherhood
between the two.

665
01:08:52,261 --> 01:09:01,081
And we hope everyone can see
the love between them.

666
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:30,848
JUN HU:
That scene impressed me deeply.

667
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:37,319
I finished shooting early that day.
My part was in the can.

668
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:42,344
Then I was waiting to see
how Anthony Wong

669
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:48,282
would act out his feelings,
his crazed grief when he sees me dead.

670
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:52,335
And he acted well, really well,
and it was worth waiting.

671
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:54,499
You know what?

672
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:57,631
l had been waiting a long time,
and it wouldn't stop raining.

673
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,527
And in the end, Wai Keung Lau said,
"We have to shoot it in the rain.

674
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:05,242
When the bomb killed Lu Qichang,
even the sky cried."

675
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:07,652
It was very funny.

676
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:14,744
During the whole process, I think
Anthony Wong performed very well--

677
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:17,448
that kind of passion,

678
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:21,997
that feeling when you are so helpless
and cannot turn to anyone.

679
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,265
And the feelings between brothers--

680
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:29,062
one minute you had your brother,
the next minute he's gone.

681
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,375
This made a significantly
deep impression.

682
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:35,711
Another deep impression is,
Wai Keung Lau has very good technique.

683
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,342
Consider the scene
where Anthony Wong

684
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:41,157
goes about
in a very special barnyard.

685
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,651
He fetches a fire extinguisher
and cloth to smother the fire.

686
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,470
And he goes down to the ground,
kneels down,

687
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:49,566
keeps going about, goes for
the cell phone but cannot reach it.

688
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:50,976
It's that kind of feeling again.

689
01:10:51,214 --> 01:10:54,144
And everything was shot
handheld by Wai Keung Lau,

690
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,580
from beginning to end, and there
were no shots blowing the cover.

691
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,957
And there are all
the necessary shots,

692
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:02,483
which cover the scene
from far and near.

693
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:05,439
I think this impression, and the two
impressions I have are most...

694
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:35,588
CARINA LAU: My first scene is when
my husband Sam is in Thailand.

695
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:44,086
The underworld was in disorder.
I got hijacked and he rescued me.

696
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:47,338
Then when we are taking sanctuary
in a village which is safe,

697
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:56,974
Lau Kin Ming confesses his feelings
to Mary in word and deed.

698
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:03,315
"Has it ever occurred to you
that you would be with me?"

699
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,296
"Since we don't know
if Sam is alive or not,

700
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:11,724
why don't you consider
our relationship?"

701
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,625
Then Mary is totally freaked out,
because this is impossible.

702
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,468
EDISON CHEN:
I know that scene is very important,

703
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,900
so [ read the script
many times beforehand--

704
01:13:20,296 --> 01:13:25,076
to know what to say,
and with what kind of expression.

705
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:28,855
What my expression
should be when I am hit by her.

706
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,758
There's no shame in her hitting me,

707
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:39,644
because it proves that she cares
and that she is upset.

708
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:48,203
CARINA LAU: Actually,
in the movie I have told him clearly.

709
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:53,315
I told him seriously,
"Don't even think about it.”

710
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:56,576
I think she will give him a chance,

711
01:13:56,999 --> 01:14:01,389
after returning from Thailand,
but that's not in the script.

712
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,384
Because at that time they were
in such a hurry, rushing to Thailand.

713
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:09,192
She said that to Lau Kin Ming
and then went away.

714
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:13,052
Lau Kin Ming
was heartbroken, of course.

715
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,480
Edison is a born actor.

716
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:29,217
For an actor, the most important
part of his body is the eyes,

717
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:33,705
and Edison has this kind of talent.

718
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:40,423
Whenever his eyes appear in front
of the cameras, they project his charm.

719
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,666
Even in silence,
there are words in his eyes.

720
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:49,114
I think this is a very uncommon talent.

721
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:19,742
CARINA LAU: At the airport,

722
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:25,076
Lau Kin Ming
watches the woman he loves.

723
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:30,300
He knows what will happen,
but he can do nothing to save her.

724
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,247
Actually he is willing to save her,

725
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:35,379
and he has gone to the airport
and has called her.

726
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,508
But Mary won't answer the phone.

727
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:42,087
Maybe Mary doesn't know
what to say to him at that time.

728
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:44,732
What needs to be said has been said.

729
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:48,114
What remains can be left for
when they have returned from Thailand.

730
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:26,714
WAI KEUNG LAU:
When it comes to 1997,

731
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,852
the story undergoes
a great change,

732
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:35,628
because of an important character,
Ngai Wing-Hau,

733
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:41,095
played by Francis Ng.

734
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:47,187
In 1997 he makes a great decision,

735
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:54,330
that's when Hong Kong
returns to China,

736
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:58,584
the history of his family
can be changed too--

737
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:02,300
change from black to white.

738
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:08,265
Keeping this in mind,
he tries to do many things.

739
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:19,468
He doesn't realize, however, that
he's about to reap what he has sown.

740
01:18:20,963 --> 01:18:26,973
This includes Sam, Wong Chi Shing,
even Chan Wing Yan and Lau Kin Ming.

741
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:29,920
Before the dawn of a new era,

742
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:34,056
people are eager
for the promise of the future.

743
01:18:34,677 --> 01:18:37,607
But this story takes place
in the darkest part of the society.

744
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:43,157
After all, at that time,
a big change of the era

745
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:47,993
has made everyone realizes his wish.

746
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:52,637
Now Lau Kin Ming and Chan Wing Yan
know that their work hasn't been done.

747
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:56,725
Hong Kong has returned to China,
but everything is sill going on.

748
01:18:57,299 --> 01:19:01,109
Their work is continuing,
but they cannot be turned into

749
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:03,544
what they were before
because of the change of this era.

750
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,132
Impossible.

751
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:56,004
ERIC TSANG: Actually, friends are
mutually making use of each other,

752
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:59,399
though it's a win-win situation.

753
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:09,815
Police and gangsters, they are
like movie stars and paparazzi.

754
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,357
The paparazzi
covers the star's story,

755
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:16,318
and the star needs the paparazzo's
report for exposure.

756
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:20,059
The star says he won't be cooperative,
but the paparazzi still follows him.

757
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:26,099
Stars often say that
the paparazzi are problematic,

758
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:31,142
but some stars are good
friends with individual paparazzi.

759
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:36,864
They even touch base: "I'll give you
photos to print after my vacation!

760
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,190
Hey, my news is on the front page!
Tell me how to respond!"

761
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:46,420
Hence this is someone who tail him,
but also one who solve problems.

762
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:50,279
This is what it's like between me
and Mister Wong.

763
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:56,035
When I have troubles,
he will handle it for me.

764
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:00,632
But sometimes there are occasions
where it's not convenient for him

765
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:06,826
to show up among the gangsters,
I will handle it for him, and vice versa.

766
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:11,446
These two are watching each other,
and they discover this only in the end--

767
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:20,917
using others is not a help,
it's taking advantage of the other.

768
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:30,014
And naturally they break up
as soon as they realize that.

769
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:35,200
This is how they became hostile
towards each other in the first picture.

770
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,313
Actually, this is inevitable.

771
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:44,986
Not a few things in this world are like
this kind of police-civilian cooperation,

772
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:51,231
and in the entertainment circle there
are always some people

773
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,760
with an underworld background
supporting behind.

774
01:21:55,244 --> 01:22:01,334
In The Godfather, that's how
they describe Frank Sinatra.

775
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:09,143
In Japanese movie, the Yakuza
is controlling many actors’ lives

776
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:13,232
in the world of entertainment.

777
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:21,791
Gangsters cannot broadcast
their fame in the "normal" way,

778
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:26,225
so they have to promote their fame
by other, crooked methods.

779
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,735
They figure this way they can
make a quick buck,

780
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:33,061
and among this milieu
they can launder money.

781
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:38,405
So even in civilized, open areas,

782
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:46,151
there will be corruption
and red-light districts.

783
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:44,616
FRANCIS NG: Shawn Yue
is very interesting.

784
01:23:45,087 --> 01:23:48,657
He does things in very direct ways.

785
01:23:49,258 --> 01:23:54,327
He would ask Anthony Wong,
Jun Hu, Eric Tsang, me--

786
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:57,440
he would ask anybody how to act.

787
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,356
He cannot wait to possess
the acting skill.

788
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:10,458
I think many have been astonished
by his performance in this film,

789
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:14,146
but I think even after the movie hits,

790
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:19,313
he should be thinking of
how to improve, and that's only right.

791
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:26,585
Because when I think about a film
that has been finished,

792
01:24:27,596 --> 01:24:30,205
l always believe I didn't do well enough.

793
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:33,386
l keep on thinking, and I come to
an understanding at some point.

794
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,505
But there is no chance of doing it again.

795
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,737
This is how people should be--

796
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:41,096
even though the facts
of a given circumstance are established,

797
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:45,937
if there's even a chance you can
spin it in your mind, take the chance.

798
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:51,978
This is the only way
you can improve your skills.

799
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:56,101
Or several years from now,
when I see Ngai Wing-Hau again,

800
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:57,795
I may decide my performance
wasn't just right.

801
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:01,100
But on second thought,
l only played Ngai Wing-Hau once.

802
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:04,440
So this method is always the right one.

803
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:09,273
l only photocopy
what I can see in my mind.

804
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:13,105
If anything, several years from now
I may better understand my performance.

805
01:25:13,642 --> 01:25:15,812
When you're first starting out,

806
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:19,778
you should watch your films
and improve yourself.

807
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:22,449
Even if it has become fact,

808
01:25:22,818 --> 01:25:27,328
you should try looking it
from a mature perspective.

809
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:34,266
SHAWN YUE: I think all actors,
when watching their own performance,

810
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:40,030
would surely start to see things
that were left undone.

811
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:45,371
This is how acting is.
It is doomed to be imperfect.

812
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:51,114
The director also says
there are imperfections in every film.

813
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:54,522
Every time you complete one,
you go,

814
01:25:55,017 --> 01:25:57,647
"l could do better.
Why didn't I do well enough?"

815
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:02,536
This is how things go a lot of times.

816
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:09,617
When you sit down and think carefully
and get your mind clear,

817
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:15,319
you watch the film and you catch
some error in an otherwise perfect show.

818
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:25,711
But should I beat myself up over this?

819
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:38,492
For me, knowing where I need
to improve is at least a step forward.

820
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,148
I naturally assume that,
after seeing this film,

821
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:47,705
I will think of many areas
where I could do better.

822
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:53,192
Even before a film is released,
Il can see it in my mind, and I can know.

823
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:57,388
I did do better, sure,
but I can do better still.

824
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:06,663
At least I will know,
which is better than being ignorant.

825
01:27:07,923 --> 01:27:11,673
And this time around, I have
collaborated with some excellent actors.

826
01:27:12,294 --> 01:27:16,544
That's already a valuable experience.

827
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:23,178
I've gained a lot. 1 had to acquire
experience and act well at the same time.

828
01:27:24,106 --> 01:27:26,686
You can't attain every single wish,
after all.

829
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:44,523
WAI KEUNG LAU: One is set in '91,
one in ‘93, one in '95, and one in '97.

830
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:51,884
Actually, they play out in real time.

831
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:57,114
‘95 and '97 are considered
the most wonderful times in Hong Kong.

832
01:27:57,806 --> 01:28:02,995
There was peace and prosperity,
and everything just glittered,

833
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:09,885
so we tend to think everything
was abundant during this period.

834
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:14,326
Speaking of color for a moment,
a golden yellow tint

835
01:28:14,923 --> 01:28:20,282
makes everything look better
if you take the time to look.

836
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:24,759
‘95 and '97 make me feel this way.

837
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:33,240
The color of '95
is a little lighter than that of '97.

838
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:40,756
So things are lighter in color,
maybe even kind of washed out.

839
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:46,876
For '91 and '93, I didn't use much color.

840
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:53,019
The difference is very evident.

841
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:59,222
And this time
I tried another innovation.

842
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:07,215
On the first picture, ! had the film
developed without bleaching it,

843
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:14,990
but this time I would input
the entire picture into a computer,

844
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:20,907
adjust its color,
and get a brand-new film.

845
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:25,730
I think this is
a basic requirement for us--

846
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:28,641
innovations to give the audience
.
new experiences.

847
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:35,297
For the soundtrack,
l have used a new system to adjust it,

848
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:41,871
and hopefully there
can be some special sounds.

849
01:30:19,047 --> 01:30:20,826
ANTHONY WONG:
I don't know how I can play this role,

850
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:25,751
because I always
think l am kind of childish.

851
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:31,994
But this guy, I don't know
how I can play him.

852
01:30:32,861 --> 01:30:36,171
After finishing the first film,
l was astonished myself.

853
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:38,691
Maybe I'm just getting old.

854
01:30:39,067 --> 01:30:45,157
This role is very mature and sober,
unlike me. ] am playful.

855
01:30:46,074 --> 01:30:49,263
lam playful and childish.

856
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:54,154
I don't know
how I could play Wong Chi Shing.

857
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,746
WAI KEUNG LAU:
l remember one scene

858
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:23,126
when Eric and Edison Chen
were in a small room.

859
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:28,105
Eric kept saying, "Sit down.

860
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:35,751
"l don't think you are Lau Kin Ming.
You do it again.

861
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:38,244
Lau Kin Ming didn't talk to me this way."

862
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:42,986
After redoing it, he still said,

863
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:45,855
"It's still not right.
We need some more feelings here."

864
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:51,947
We set this kind of requirement for
young actors.

865
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,621
I think they are poor boys.

866
01:31:56,111 --> 01:32:02,061
But we have to set the bar pretty high,
because we expect a lot from them.

867
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:08,255
The success of our film industry depends
on whether they can succeed this time.

868
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:14,047
Everybody knows
that they are our successors.

869
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:17,489
We hone their skills
and foster their talent,

870
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:20,746
letting them know
how filmmaking works.

871
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:26,032
It's not only a matter
of dress and appearance.

872
01:32:26,775 --> 01:32:30,205
Looks do count,
but the inner responses

873
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:38,629
and interactions with other
actors are also very important.

874
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:27,768
SIU FAI MAK: I remember that scene
where Shawn walked up to Anthony.

875
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:33,057
He snapped at him and left.

876
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:38,928
There were two cameras,
and only one take.

877
01:33:41,216 --> 01:33:43,646
I knew that I had finished.
l was confident, because I knew ! did it.

878
01:33:44,085 --> 01:34:02,115
Perhaps when I
put on that black jacket, I got it.

879
01:34:04,706 --> 01:34:08,216
I devoted myself to this scene,
and I was confident.

880
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:13,500
There were a lot of scenes where

881
01:34:14,249 --> 01:34:25,509
Anthony Wong and Tony Leung
were alone together.

882
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:34,308
It brought me back to Infernal Affairs 1,
and they were so intimate.

883
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:37,849
Not intimate--
they knew each other so well.

884
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:42,489
So at that moment, ! felt that
l had become the role I played.

885
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:51,134
SIU FAI MAK:
Just imagine you were Shawn Yue

886
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:54,373
and you were expected to play Yan.

887
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:57,688
You were in his shoes.
What would you do?

888
01:34:58,193 --> 01:35:03,763
He did a lot of homework,
did a lot of thinking,

889
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:12,602
and then he gradually grasped the idea.

890
01:35:13,841 --> 01:35:17,031
l was already aware
that he had prepared very well.

891
01:35:17,612 --> 01:35:19,572
As he stepped out,
I knew that he could totally do this.

892
01:35:19,948 --> 01:35:24,078
There was no problem whatsoever.

893
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:33,012
For audiences who had seen Shawn
before, it comes as a big surprise.

894
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:38,331
They would think that Shawn
knows how to act now.

895
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,830
In the first days of shooting,
he couldn't help coming over asking,

896
01:35:46,874 --> 01:35:48,514
"How am I doing?"

897
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:51,593
l answered,
"It's not bad, it's very good."

898
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,420
And he said,
"] just don't think that guy is like me."

899
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:59,039
Il said, "You are acting. When you act,
you have to be like Yan, not Shawn.

900
01:35:59,721 --> 01:36:02,681
Yan is unlike you, and that proves
that you've done a good job."

901
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:35,477
WAI KEUNG LAU:
The first day of shooting,

902
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:37,670
Il sent the script to Kwong Wing Chan.

903
01:36:38,026 --> 01:36:39,755
l wanted him to think about the music,

904
01:36:40,094 --> 01:36:50,144
to feel the atmosphere generated
by the screenplay and the footage.

905
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,979
Having Chan doing the score
spared me any worries.

906
01:36:56,477 --> 01:37:00,107
We had achieved
a mutual understanding

907
01:37:00,715 --> 01:37:04,085
about the movie and my intentions.

908
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:10,799
Whatever you do,
you should endeavor to have the music

909
01:37:12,627 --> 01:37:23,117
complement and amplify
every scene in the film.

910
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:28,482
We had known each other so well
after years of cooperation.

911
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:43,674
Say I wanted a piano
or a symphony,

912
01:37:45,226 --> 01:37:49,326
I would talk with him
before we ever shot that scene.

913
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:51,714
That way he would have a better grasp.

914
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:53,275
SIU FAI MAK:
Here we see the sparkle

915
01:38:53,628 --> 01:38:55,527
between Eric Tsang and Francis Ng.

916
01:38:55,897 --> 01:39:03,637
When we were doing it the first time,
everybody's timing was just right.

917
01:39:04,806 --> 01:39:07,875
Because Wai Keung Lau is a director
who doesn't like rehearsals.

918
01:39:08,543 --> 01:39:15,133
He wanted the rehearsal over with
before the lighting was done.

919
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:24,150
Sometimes once the set was lit,
he wanted no rehearsal. "Let's shoot!"

920
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:30,654
Eric and Francis
were servant and master.

921
01:39:31,499 --> 01:39:38,358
You could see that from their costumes.

922
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:46,193
You take a look at them, and you know
that Eric is Francis’ servant.

923
01:39:47,215 --> 01:39:53,665
When they walk together,
it just feels right.

924
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:57,405
Their physical appearance,
their costumes--all very natural.

925
01:39:57,892 --> 01:40:02,312
It's all so natural,
and they even had chemistry.

926
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:11,620
Especially in that last scene,
where Francis invited Eric for a drink.

927
01:40:12,874 --> 01:40:18,264
We didn't have that in the script,
but they acted it out.

928
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,780
That's amazing.

929
01:40:21,082 --> 01:40:22,982
For example, Francis poured wine
for Eric, but Eric pushed the glass away.

930
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:25,688
Then Francis handed the phone to Eric.

931
01:40:26,087 --> 01:40:32,207
Those things happen at the table, but
the tension ripples to Hawaii and Thailand.

932
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:39,747
I think what they brought to their roles
was greater than what was in the script.

933
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:47,332
ERIC TSANG: I love that scene too.

934
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:49,945
The rhythm of acting is important.

935
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:53,121
I do not necessarily respond
to a line at once.

936
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:54,947
Take that scene.

937
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:59,966
He raised the glass, but I silently
watched him, then pushed the glass away.

938
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:05,550
Actually, by pushing away the glass,
I was letting him know I didn't agree.

939
01:41:06,294 --> 01:41:16,144
Then he handed me the phone,
suggesting I'm under his thumb.

940
01:41:17,638 --> 01:41:20,388
But what he didn't know
was that I had him well in hand.

941
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:24,355
When we exchanged the phone,
we had made everything clear.

942
01:41:24,946 --> 01:41:34,706
Just like I said,
I enjoyed the interaction between us.

943
01:41:36,157 --> 01:41:46,737
Actually from infernal Affairs !
to internal Affairs Il,

944
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:57,621
l had been enjoying the process
of collaborating with fine actors.

945
01:41:59,013 --> 01:42:05,813
l had been going around saying
l regained my acting bug last year.

946
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:08,784
l had fun, so now I'm producing.

947
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:12,692
Everybody is waiting for a good story.

948
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:16,314
A good cast of actors.
Everybody worked well together.

949
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,547
What we used to do
were mostly comedies.

950
01:42:18,866 --> 01:42:24,086
The comedians got together
to play something funny.

951
01:42:24,905 --> 01:42:28,184
This time it's a serious movie,

952
01:42:28,743 --> 01:42:31,373
and we were serious about details,
about eye contact, about mannerisms.

953
01:42:31,846 --> 01:42:36,236
You gave me this role,
so [ had to bring my best into play.

954
01:42:36,951 --> 01:42:41,841
Francis wanted to talk about the scene
where he died at the hawker stand.

955
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:45,250
Actually, we wanted to do
a trial before that.

956
01:42:45,726 --> 01:42:51,816
See what each of us
has brought to the movie.

957
01:42:52,733 --> 01:42:57,593
Put everybody's performance together,
and you have a good movie.

958
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:04,369
Everybody had different ideas.
We saw what's best.

959
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:09,939
Francis felt that way too.
Everyone shared their ideas.

960
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:14,605
Everyone got new ideas for acting.

961
01:43:15,256 --> 01:43:21,736
It may be different from
what you came up with.

962
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:28,677
You just act it out.
And it is different from a stereotype.

963
01:43:36,544 --> 01:43:39,174
FRANCIS WOO:
l have tremendous respect for Eric.

964
01:43:39,647 --> 01:43:41,077
As a matter of fact...

965
01:43:44,752 --> 01:43:49,062
One day we had a few drinks,
and he said something

966
01:43:49,757 --> 01:43:54,826
that gave me the confidence
and determination to portray this role

967
01:43:55,629 --> 01:43:58,559
without "acting" that much.

968
01:43:59,033 --> 01:44:01,753
He told me, "You look
quite aggressive yourself.

969
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:07,016
Don't act. Get another day job."

970
01:44:07,775 --> 01:44:13,424
So I didn't act.
I dealt with him in my own way.

971
01:44:14,482 --> 01:44:16,062
It's interesting, I think.

972
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:25,580
It's a rare thing to have such intimate
acting with a male actor.

973
01:44:29,063 --> 01:44:37,793
We had a tacit understanding,
and it's terrific.

974
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:44,060
It's like we fell in love
with each other,

975
01:44:44,879 --> 01:44:51,029
since we had
such good communication.

976
01:44:51,986 --> 01:44:53,766
ERIC TSANG:
Il told him not to act,

977
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:58,101
because his role was already
in the right place.

978
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:03,149
He didn't have to deepen the role.

979
01:45:03,864 --> 01:45:11,254
This character was already very
dramatic, so he just played it casually.

980
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:18,870
If you portrayed a dramatic
character in a dramatic way,

981
01:45:19,847 --> 01:45:22,567
it'd become a stage play.

982
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:25,270
You can't play too hard.

983
01:45:25,686 --> 01:45:31,456
What pleases me most
is that we talk everything over.

984
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:36,393
l offer some advice,
which you could just ignore.

985
01:45:37,031 --> 01:45:39,871
But for me, I speak it out, ! am happy.

986
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:42,081
You don't have to accept that.

987
01:45:42,536 --> 01:45:48,926
We exchanged our opinions,
but we didn't impose ourselves.

988
01:45:49,944 --> 01:45:51,674
Everybody was willing to offer advice.

989
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:55,552
It's not like we hid what we had

990
01:45:56,150 --> 01:46:01,480
and pulled it out to show
only during the performance itself.

991
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:08,379
People did that in times past,

992
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:13,366
but in this movie, we were
all open and willing to share.

993
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:42,360
Even in the last scene,
between Anthony and me,

994
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:56,113
he said, "You have screwed up
everything I have tried to do."

995
01:46:58,045 --> 01:47:01,235
He's supposed
to act out his inner world.

996
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:06,228
I think he should take
the credit for that scene.

997
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:12,931
l wanted him to succeed
in ways I never could.

998
01:47:13,827 --> 01:47:20,097
Acting is like playing football.
You have to pass the ball.

999
01:47:21,035 --> 01:47:24,075
If l can't score,
at least I can pass the ball

1000
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:26,791
to a teammate who has a chance.

1001
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:29,787
I'd rather do this.
After all, it's a game.

1002
01:47:30,244 --> 01:47:33,554
It's a matter of teamwork,
not individualism.

1003
01:47:34,081 --> 01:47:36,801
I think that infernal Affairs
is that kind of a movie--

1004
01:47:37,251 --> 01:47:42,491
a great piece of teamwork,
not a showcase for loners.

1005
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:45,950
The audiences just love the movie.

1006
01:49:11,912 --> 01:49:13,552
SIU FAI MAK: Why end the story

1007
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:16,191
on the night of Hong Kong's
return in 1997?

1008
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:18,312
It's an important historical moment,

1009
01:49:18,652 --> 01:49:22,222
for every person in Hong Kong.

1010
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:25,600
Since that night,
everything has changed.

1011
01:49:26,093 --> 01:49:32,603
That moment fits this story.

1012
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:41,070
A background befitting the theme
of the movie was selected.

1013
01:49:42,209 --> 01:49:43,438
We were attracted to this.

1014
01:49:43,677 --> 01:49:49,826
After the script was finished,
I told everyone about the actors.

1015
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:57,901
I said that Infernal Affairs Il
was a stand-alone script.

1016
01:49:58,959 --> 01:50:02,769
It would be a wonderful script
even without Internal Affairs I.

1017
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:07,690
But it might never have been shot.

1018
01:50:08,502 --> 01:50:12,132
There are many elements

1019
01:50:12,739 --> 01:50:23,409
that you can't just weave
into a sequel that easily.

1020
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:27,822
lam not talking about
the commercial elements.

1021
01:50:28,489 --> 01:50:29,829
I don't think so.

1022
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:37,920
It's a really long story, and a lot
of people are concerned about this.

1023
01:50:39,133 --> 01:50:42,673
Then you can put these things
in the story.

1024
01:50:44,838 --> 01:50:46,388
That's the way it is.

1025
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:49,785
Without infernal Affairs 1,

1026
01:50:50,077 --> 01:50:53,267
Infernal Affairs tl
would ignore the times for sure.

1027
01:50:53,814 --> 01:51:01,494
It would only deal with changed people,
a simple story of people.

1028
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:09,956
Being able to do this
has made me grateful.
