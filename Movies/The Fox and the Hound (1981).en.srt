00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,405
You poor little fella.

2
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,609
It's all right.

3
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,664
Big Mama's here.

4
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,989
You know, you're gonna
need some caring for.

5
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,234
Now... Now, let's see, darlin’.

6
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,294

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

8
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,051
Not me. Not Big Mama, now.

9
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,912
Now I'm thinkin’, though.

10
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,505
Now... Now don't...
Don't you move, honey.

11
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,849
Big Mama's gonna be right back.

12
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,527
Good work, Boomer.
We'll get him this time.

13
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,027
I think he's in there.

14
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,378
Am I glad I found you boys.

15
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,434
There's no time to lose.
I need your help. Now come on.

16
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,927
- Come on.
- Let's go, Boomer. Come on.

17
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,969
Yeah, but... Oh, shucks.

18
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,294
Oh, poor little guy.

19
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,563
Don't you worry now. We're going
to find someone to look after you.

20
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,429
Hey, I think I got an idea.

21
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,366
OK, Boomer,
now you know what to do.

22
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,336
Yeah, leave it to me.
Leave it to me.

23
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,294
Who is it?

24
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,885
Well, l was sure
l heard someone knocking.

25
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,270
Oh, dear! My laundry!

26
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,428
Oh, here! Stop it!

27
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,118
Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?

28
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,332
Oh, stop!

29
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,684
Well, 1 wonder what
got into those birds.

30
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,661
Well, bless my soul!

31
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,315
Why, it's...

32
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,727
It's a baby fox.

33
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,199
Hello, little fella.

34
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,762
l wonder where its mother is.

35
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,631
Come on, now.
I'm not going to harm you.

36
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,847
Now, now. Oh, isn't that...?

37
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,050
Oh, my, my. You're a feisty
little rascal, aren't you?

38
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:02,178
There, there, now. Calm down.

39
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,112
No, I just can't leave you
out here all alone.

40
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,665
Oh, isn't he darling?

41
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,717
Now, not so fast.

42
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,979
Now, now, not so fast.

43
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:23,116
Oh, my. You're such a little toddler.

44
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,064
Say, that's what
I'm going to call you.

45
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,717
Tod.

46
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,939
You know, Tod,

47
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,175
I'm not going to be
so lonesome anymore.

48
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,067
I got a surprise for you,
Chief, old boy.

49
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,708
I got a surprise for you,
Chief, old boy.

50
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,209
Now, now, now, take it easy.

51
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,070
Well, how's this for a huntin' dog?

52
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,164
He's just a little runt now,
but he'll grow.

53
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,266
You may as well
get used to him, Chief.

54
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,785
He's for you
to look after from now on.

55
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,213
Tod, stop pestering Abigail.

56
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,541
Abigail, you're going
to have to be patient with Tod.

57
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,131
He's one of the family now.

58
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,662
Oh, of course. Now I know.

59
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,056
I declare,
I never will get my chores done.

60
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,987
Oh, mercy!

61
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,492
Tod! Tod, stop it!

62
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,661
Abigail! Abigail!

63
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:35,175
Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no!

64
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,923
Easy, easy, Abigail.

65
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,039
Steady, old girl. Steady.

66
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,135
There, there.

67
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,620
Tod, you come here.

68
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,564
Il said come here!

69
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,249
Just look what you've done.

70
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,699
Now, don't try to butter me up.

71
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,944
Oh, Tod, I just can't
stay angry with you.

72
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,692
You little imp.
Now run along and play.

73
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,602
Go on.

74
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,040
And try to stay out of mischief.

75
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,515
Hey, it's Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.

76
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,739
Is this it, Boomer?

77
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,547
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.

78
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,968
I never forget a tree.
I never forget a tree.

79
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,267
He won't get away this time.

80
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,427
Hold it, Boomer.
I think I hear somethin’.

81
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,363
That's him, all right, Dinky.
That's him, all right.

82
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,081
Get ready, Boomer.

83
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:13,893
Hey, I can hear him movin’. Listen.

84
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,154
That's funny. I don't hear nothin’.

85
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,617
Quiet.

86
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,506
That's him, Dinky.
That's him, all right.

87
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,005
Button your beak, will ya?

88
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,978
I'll check it out.

89
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,949
Would you look at that?

90
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,382
OK, Boomer, he's right... there.

91
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,680
Yikes! Watch it!

92
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,440
Why, you...

93
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,122
Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!

94
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,741
Hiya, fellas.

95
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,632
What ya doin’? Wanna play?

96
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,942
Stay outta this, kid.
This don't concern you.

97
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,336
Let him have it!

98
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,574
Don't let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!

99
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,426
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!

100
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,769
- Which way did he go?
- This way.

101
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,172
There he is!

102
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,345
What happened to ya? Golly!

103
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,915
Oh, shucks!
I think I bent my beak.

104
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,005
Now see what you done?
You cost us our breakfast.

105
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,418
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.

106
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,924
- What are you talkin’, my fault?
- Yeah, yeah.

107
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,834
A worm? For breakfast?

108
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,272
Hey, there, Copper,
what ya sniffin' at?

109
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,798
Somethin’... l never smelled...

110
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,474
... before, Chief.

111
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,211
Let me see.

112
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,112
Shucks, that's easy.

113
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,874
The master's just cookin’ grits
and fatback. You oughta know that.

114
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,316
That's not what I smell.

115
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,838
I don't know, Chief.

116
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:07,243
It's something else.

117
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:11,493
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin' to do
about a-sniffin' and a-smellin’.

118
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,358
Hey, where you goin’?

119
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,469
I want to find out
what that smell is.

120
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,536
OK, Copper, but the master
ain't gonna like you wanderin'’ off.

121
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,568
I won't get lost, Chief.
Il can smell my way back.

122
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,605
Can't tell these young
whippersnappers anything.

123
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,301
What ya smellin'?

124
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,437
I'm on the trail of somethin’.

125
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,641
Trail of what?

126
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,217
I don't know yet.

127
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,228
Why, it's... it's you!

128
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,488
What do you do that for?

129
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,480
We're supposed to do that
when we find what we've been trackin'.

130
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,648
I'm a fox.

131
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,956
My name's Tod.
What's your name, kid?

132
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,765
Mine's Copper. I'm a hound dog.

133
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,829
Gee, I bet you'd be good
playin’ hide-and-seek.

134
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,945
Wanna try it, Copper?

135
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,027
Can l use my nose?

136
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,304
Sure. OK.

137
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,666
Now go ahead
and close your eyes and count.

138
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,740
One, two, three...

139
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,794
No, Copper! You can't peek!

140
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,651
Now start again.

141
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,683
One, two, three, four,

142
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,610
five, six, seven...

143
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:04,047
My, my. Look at that.

144
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,852
A fox and a hound, playin’ together.

145
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,541
When you're the best of friends

146
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,958
Having so much fun together

147
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,306
You're not even aware
you're such a funny pair

148
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,940
You're the best of friends

149
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,657
Life's a happy game

150
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,901
You could clown around forever

151
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:43,345
Neither one of you sees
your natural boundaries

152
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,439
Life's one happy game

153
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,110
Copper!

154
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,189
Gee, I've gotta go.

155
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,912
If only the world
wouldn't get in the way

156
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,496
If only people
would just let you play

157
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,193
They say you're both being fools

158
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,807
You're breaking aif the rules

159
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,958
They can't understand

160
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,779
The magic of your wonderland

161
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,600
When you're the best of friends

162
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,433
Copper!

163
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,110
Sharing aif that you discover

164
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:39,888
When these moments have passed
Will that friendship last?

165
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,289
Who can say?

166
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,358
There's a way

167
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,667
Oh, I hope

168
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,292
! hope it never ends

169
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,382
Come on, Copper!

170
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:56,874
‘Cause you're the best of friends

171
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:13,076
Copper, you're my very best friend.

172
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,349
And you're mine too, Tod.

173
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,394
And we'll always
be friends forever, won't we?

174
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,559
Yeah, forever.

175
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,815
Hey, let's go swimmin'!

176
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,257
Give me a head start
and I can beat ya!

177
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,572
Dagnabit! That Copper pup's gone
and strayed off again.

178
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,503
Come on, Chief.

179
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,615
If that little rascal's
gonna make me a good huntin' dog,

180
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,598
he's gotta learn to mind.

181
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:02,598
Copper! Get over here!

182
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,417
Copper!

183
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,710
I gotta go home.

184
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,425
Do ya have to?
We're havin' too much fun.

185
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,446
I gotta. He sounds awful mad.

186
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,670
I'll see ya tomorrow!

187
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,962
- And don't forget!
- L won't!

188
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,268
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?

189
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,297
Why didn't you...?

190
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,933
Golly! You're all tied up.

191
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,259
Yeah, and it's no fun either.

192
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,648
The master says I gotta stay home.

193
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,580
Well, we can play around here then.

194
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,518
Oh, no.
Not with old Chief over there.

195
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,354
Is that him making that awful noise?

196
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,899
He keeps me awake at night.

197
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:09,257
Oh, don't go in there!
He can get awful mean!

198
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,048
He's cranky.

199
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,491
Gee-whillikers, is he ever big.

200
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,513
His ears isn't as big as yours, Copper.

201
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,543
That's not the part
you gotta worry about.

202
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,127
Wow! Look at those teeth.

203
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,917
That's the part
you gotta worry about!

204
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,284
I'm gainin' on him.

205
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,637
- He won't get away now.
- He's wakin' up!

206
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,076
Get out, Tod!

207
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:43,218
No. He's havin' a dream.
He's chasin' somethin’.

208
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,522
When I get him cornered...

209
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,575
It's... It's... It's a big old badger.

210
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,323
Copper, he's chasin' a badger.

211
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,113
No, no, it ain't a badger.

212
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,313
Iisa... Itsaf...

213
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,771
It's a fox. A fox?

214
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,489
Run, Tod! Run!

215
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,533
Tod!

216
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:38,071
Amos Slade,
you trigger-happy lunatic!

217
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,137
Give me that gun!

218
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,031
My radiator!

219
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,366
Why, you blasted female.

220
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,962
- Hold it right there!

221
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,703
Watch it! That thing's loaded!

222
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,789
Now it ain't loaded!

223
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:11,533
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin' fox
was after my chickens!

224
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,214
Rubbish and poppycock!

225
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,146
I don't believe it.
He wouldn't hurt a thing.

226
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,699
You callin’ me a liar,
you muddleheaded female?

227
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,785
- l saw it happen!
- Amos Slade, that temper of yours

228
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,229
is going to get you
into a lot of trouble.

229
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:27,687
Temper?

230
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:30,633
Temper, woman?
You ain't seen my temper!

231
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,297
If lever catch that fox
on my property again, Ill blast him!

232
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,582
And next time, I won't miss!

233
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,684
Poor little tyke.

234
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,723
It's a shame I have
to keep him cooped up.

235
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,932
Tod, stop looking at me like that.

236
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,451
It's not my fault, you know.

237
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,126
You caused a lot
of trouble yesterday.

238
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,299
Oh, now what are they up to?

239
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,974
Why, it looks like Amos
is going on a hunting trip.

240
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,581
A long one, from the looks of it.

241
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,617
Well, good riddance!

242
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,899
Doggone meddlin' female,

243
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,341
shootin’ up my radiator!

244
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,971
Dad blame it. Get goin'!

245
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,399
There. Well, that's more like it.
Keep runnin’, old girl.

246
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,753
Well, Copper, me and old Chief
are gonna teach you all about huntin’.

247
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,238
Yes, sir. It's about time too.

248
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,819
Attaboy.

249
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,091
Yeah, you're gonna like
trackin' down those varmints for me.

250
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,267
Get in the back, half-pint.

251
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,222
You gotta earn your right
to sit up front.

252
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:37,392
Well, boys, we're gettin’
outta here till next spring.

253
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:11,093
Tod, honey,
what are you doin' over here?

254
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,010
Gee, I just wanted
to say goodbye to Copper,

255
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,007
but I'm too late.

256
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,861
Well, what did you plan to do
if you ran into old Chief?

257
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:26,387
Chief. I can outfox
that dumb old dog anytime.

258
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,112
Tod, now hold it just one minute.

259
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,831
Didn't you learn anything yesterday?

260
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,980
Now you listen good, Tod,

261
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,879
because it's either education
or elimination.

262
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:41,204
Now if you're so foxy
and old Chief's so dumb,

263
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,886
then why does that hound
get the fox on the run?

264
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,266
‘Cause he's got the hunter,
and the hunter's got the gun.

265
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,796
Elimination. Lack of education.

266
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,371
If you pal around
with that Copper hound

267
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,930
You'll wind up hangin’ on the wall

268
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,659
Keep your nose to the wind
You'll keep your skin

269
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,869
‘Cause you won't be home
when the hunter comes to calf

270
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:09,474
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper
would never track me down.

271
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,968
Why, old Copper,
he's my best friend.

272
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,138
Your best friend.

273
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,630
Now, Copper's gonna
do what he's been told.

274
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,639
Supposed to chase the little old fox
into the old foxhole,

275
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,829
then along comes the hunter
with a buckshot load.

276
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,344
Elimination.

277
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,623
Lack of education.

278
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,795
You better believe it, Tod.

279
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,795
Yes, sirree!

280
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,753
You mean Copper
is gonna be my enemy?

281
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,596
Hey!

282
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:43,325
Kid, you better step over here
and take a good look.

283
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,956
Why... Why, that's awful.

284
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,350
Those poor things.

285
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,841
I'm sorry, Tod.

286
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:06,496
Honey, Copper's gonna come back
a trained huntin' dog.

287
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,379
A real killer.

288
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,571
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.

289
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,761
He won't ever change.

290
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,056
l hope you're right, Tod.

291
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,562
And we'll keep on
being friends forever.

292
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,351
Won't we, Big Mama?

293
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:28,081
Darlin’, forever is a long, long time,

294
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,707
and time has a way
of changin’ things.

295
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,889
Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.

296
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,257
- I'm freezin' my b...
- Hey!

297
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,167
It's that fuzzy worm! Let's get him!

298
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,551
Charge!

299
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:55,184
Hey, Dinky! Dinky, quick! Over here!

300
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,300
I got him! I got him!

301
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:04,182
Do I look like a worm?
That's who we're after.

302
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,704
Come on!

303
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,179
Look at that little creep,

304
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:17,328
warm and cozy by the fire.

305
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,899
Let me take a look.

306
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:22,687
Now how do you like that guy?

307
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,114
Snug as a bug,

308
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,714
while we're out here
freezin' our beaks off.

309
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:34,033
Yackin' and shiverin'
ain't gettin’ us anywhere.

310
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,504
We'll get that no-good worm
when we come back.

311
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,216
Oh, shucks.

312
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,678
So long, Big Mama.

313
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,469
Yeah, we're goin’ south for the winter.

314
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,579
Goodbye, boys.
See ya next spring.

315
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,589
Well, look who's here.

316
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,852
Oh, my goodness.

317
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,388
I'm sorry, Tod, honey.

318
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,546
- [hope...
- Hiya, Big Mama.

319
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,758
We're back. We flew all the way.

320
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:20,797
Yeah, we did. We did.

321
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,589
Welcome home, boys!

322
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,297
It's been kind of lonesome
around here without you little rascals.

323
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,249
Hi, fellas!

324
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,151
Hey, who's that? Who's that?

325
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,582
This can't be
that scrawny little squirt

326
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,965
we found by the fence post,
can it? Come on.

327
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,728
I can't believe my eyes.

328
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,872
Oh, it's me, all right.

329
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:46,701
Hey, looky there.
He's got himself a real fancy collar.

330
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,477
Hey, hey, hey.
Just look at this bushy tail.

331
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,773
Beautiful.

332
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,201
Come on. Cut it out.
You guys are always teasin' me.

333
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,644
Hey, it's him, it's him. Squeeks.

334
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,710
We'll see ya later, kid.

335
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,565
We gotta take care
of some unfinished business.

336
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,327
I can't understand.

337
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,650
It was so healthy.

338
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,955
There. That oughta perk it up.

339
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,281
Now, where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

340
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,650
He's goin' up the drainpipe!
I'll head him off.

341
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,866
OK, Boomer, we got him trapped!
Let him have it!

342
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,618
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.

343
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,223
Neither did I.

344
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,196
Come on! Look!

345
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,066
A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy!

346
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,962
- Holy!
- Smoke!

347
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,346
Hey, hey, how's he do that, Dinky?
How's he do that?

348
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,640
ain't got no job
I'ma huntin' man

349
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,726
And I'd rather have a dog
than a dollar

350
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:52,678
So let's go banjo
ring-a-ling-a-ding-ho

351
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,547
Give a little hoot and a holler

352
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,261
Come on, Chief.

353
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:04,225
Just 'cause you're not sittin’ up front,
that ain't no reason to be a sorehead.

354
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,136
Shucks, if it weren't for you,

355
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,947
Copper'd never have turned
into a good huntin' dog.

356
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,051
Yes, sirree.

357
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:15,617
Now I got me
the best two dogs there is.

358
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,600
Right, Copper?

359
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,245
Isn't he somethin’, Chief?

360
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,343
Look, Big Mama! Copper's back!

361
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,240
Boy, has he grown big.

362
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,162
And look at that big pile of skins
he helped track down.

363
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,856
I know, Big Mama.
He's a huntin' dog now.

364
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,992
You're right. And you're a fox.

365
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,986
That won't make any difference.
Copper's gonna be glad to see me.

366
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,107
Well, honey,
just don't get your hopes too high.

367
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,680
Look, don't worry. I'll be careful.

368
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,770
I'll go tonight when Chief
and the hunter are asleep.

369
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,589
Boy, it's great to be back home,
isn't it, Chief?

370
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,655
Come on, Chief.
You aren't still sore, are ya?

371
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,909
Hey, hey, come on. Let's scuffle.

372
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,203
We ain't scuffled in a long time.

373
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,800
Come on, Chief!
Let's have some fun!

374
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:38,666
Oh, lay off, Copper,
you overgrown pup, you.

375
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,861
Oh, let go!

376
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,773
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!

377
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,965
Oh, OK, OK.

378
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,000
That was your trouble on the hunt.

379
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,672
Come on, old-timer.

380
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,062
You treat me like a pup,
you know that?

381
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,447
Why, I think I done real good
trackin' down them varmints for ya.

382
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,964
Smellin' and trackin' ain't enough.

383
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,528
You gotta think nasty.

384
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,703
OK, OK, I know.

385
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,414
I know.

386
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:28,888
Copper.

387
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:30,906
Hey, Copper.

388
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,229
It's me, Tod.

389
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:37,038
I thought that was you, Tod.
l heard ya comin’.

390
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,281
Boy, you've really grown.

391
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:41,394
You have too, Copper.

392
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,299
Il saw you comin' back
with Chief and the hunter.

393
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,697
It's great to see ya, Tod.

394
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:52,082
But, you know, you...
You shouldn't be over here.

395
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,873
You're gonna get us both
into a lot of trouble.

396
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:58,256
Hey, look, I...
I just wanted to see ya.

397
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,196
We're...
We're still friends, aren't we?

398
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,131
Tod, those days are over.

399
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,602
I'm a huntin' dog now.

400
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,931
You'd better get outta here
before old Chief wakes up.

401
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,952
Chief. He doesn't worry me.

402
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,196
Tod, I'm serious. You're...

403
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,078
You're fair game
as far as he's concerned.

404
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,857
It's that fox again!

405
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,694
Oh, no! No!

406
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,685
They're after Tod!

407
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,127
After him, boys! Go get him!

408
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,547
Copper!

409
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,870
Copper! Copper!

410
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,388
Tod, I...

411
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,858
I don't wanna see you get killed.

412
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,877
Track him down, boy!

413
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:19,812
I'll let you go this one time.

414
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,569
Don't lose him!

415
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,482
There they are!
Old Chief's got him on the run!

416
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,267
Jump, Chief! Jump!

417
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,689
Chief!

418
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,564
Chief?

419
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,785
Oh, no!

420
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,481
No!

421
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,121
Tod, if it's
the last thing I do, I'll...

422
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,998
I'll get you for this!

423
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:58,805
Tod!

424
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:01,677
Tod? Tod!

425
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,582
Oh, Tod!

426
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,991
Thank heaven you're safe.

427
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,408
Oh, poor Chief.

428
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,343
And it's all my fault.

429
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,191
I shouldn't have let Tod go.

430
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,747
Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up!

431
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:51,924
There's trouble!

432
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,414
Tod! Well, what is it?

433
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,004
What on earth?

434
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:12,404
Widow, get out here!

435
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:14,717
Why, Amos! What are you...?

436
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,512
Where is he? Where is he?

437
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:19,622
I know he's in there.

438
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:21,474
Now just a minute.

439
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:25,159
You can't come bargin
onto my property, Amos Slade!

440
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,476
That fox of yours
almost killed Chief,

441
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:30,863
and I'm gonna get him!

442
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:35,223
You can't keep him locked up forever!

443
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:55,854
We met, it seems

444
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,180
Such a short time ago

445
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,830
You looked at me

446
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:04,993
Needing me so

447
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,470
Yet from your sadness

448
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:12,514
Our happiness grew

449
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:16,627
And I found out I needed you too

450
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:22,726
! remember how we used to play

451
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:30,233
! recall those rainy days

452
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:35,183
The fire's glow

453
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,676
That kept us warm

454
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,874
And now I find

455
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,486
We're both alone

456
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:49,379
Goodbye may seem forever

457
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,840
Farewell is like the end

458
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,455
But in my heart's the memory

459
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:03,368
And there... you'll always be

460
00:52:56,373 --> 00:53:00,683
Goodbye may seem forever

461
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,805
Farewell is like the end

462
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:09,359
But in my heart's the memory

463
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:14,907
And there you'll always be

464
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:56,247
Hold it, sonny! Back off!

465
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,663
Consanrn it! Where...?
Where do you think you're goin'?

466
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:03,034
Oh, excuse me, I...
I was just trying to...

467
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,080
You barge in on somebody's house
like you own it.

468
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,203
Tarryhootin' around them woods,

469
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:11,085
wakin' up folks
in the middle of the night.

470
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:14,988
l honestly didn't know
anybody lived here, and I...

471
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:18,265
Well, you know it now.
Now get off my property!

472
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,265
Go on! Beat it!

473
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:26,437
I've been watching you, sir.
You can stay with me if you want to.

474
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:29,767
- That's very nice of you.
- Come with me.

475
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,979
She dropped that fox off
at the game preserve.

476
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,069
We'll get him. We'll get him.

477
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,741
Well, now, if you
gotta have a busted leg,

478
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:26,171
this is the way to do it.

479
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:29,886
Good food, soft pillow,

480
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,500
warm stove.

481
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,846
Sure beats sleepin’ in that barrel.

482
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:44,153
Well, now, here comes visitors
to see the invalid.

483
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:59,015
How do you like that?
They didn't even ask how I'm feelin’.

484
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:11,064
Chief, get back in there
before I break your other leg.

485
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,662
Copper, Copper, lookit here.

486
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,569
Now, when that fox
comes traipsin' along,

487
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:25,774
suspectin' nothin’...

488
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,220
Tod?

489
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:46,699
Tod?

490
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,969
Oh, boy. These old wings
ain't what they used to be.

491
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:59,202
Big Mama,
you better lose a few pounds.

492
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,417
There he is, there he is.

493
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,890
Tod!

494
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,870
Tod!

495
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,850
Oh, hi, Big Mama.

496
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,823
Oh, it's you, Vixey.

497
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:13,821
Hey, what brings you way out here?

498
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:16,493
I'm lookin’ for a fox named Tod.

499
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,823
- He's new here in the forest.
- Oh, new?

500
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,197
Well, what does he look like?

501
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,410
Oh, he's young. About your age.

502
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,366
And handsome.

503
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,237
Handsome? Oh, say.

504
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,367
Gee, he sure sounds nice.

505
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,123
I'm not doing anything.

506
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,266
I'll help you find him.

507
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,899
Come on.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

508
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,055
Wha...?

509
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,503
What happened? Where am I?

510
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,517
So, it's you again?

511
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,277
You barged in on me last night,
and now you...

512
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:34,630
I didn't mean to.

513
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:38,148
Just look at the mess you made.

514
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,321
Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!

515
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,561
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

516
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:48,663
Excuses, excuses.

517
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,385
Mr. Digger, sir?
It was so too an accident.

518
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,278
You keep out of this,
you walkin’ pincushion.

519
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:59,212
You shouldn't be so grumpy to
someone who's new in the neighborhood.

520
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,948
A stranger?

521
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,642
Why don't you go back
where you came from?

522
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:07,763
Wha...?

523
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:16,098
Well, go on.

524
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,339
Get goin’. Git!

525
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:48,584
Gosh, he seems so... ! don't know,
so downhearted, Big Mama.

526
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:52,139
Well, you can't blame him, honey.

527
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:56,276
He was dropped out here and left
all alone without a friend in the world.

528
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,873
Well, maybe there's
something I could do.

529
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,922
You know, cheer him up.

530
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:04,354
Honey, you just said
the magic words.

531
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,093
Now...

532
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,205
What? But Big Mama, I don't...

533
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:19,072
Darlin’, don't move.
You look beautiful.

534
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:20,869
Thank you.

535
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,600
Mornin’, Tod.

536
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,837
Hello, Big Mama.

537
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:28,926
Last night was pretty miserable
for you, wasn't it, honey?

538
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:30,556
Just terrible.

539
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,687
Cheer up and look around.

540
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,527
The forest is beautiful this morning.

541
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:39,537
After last night,
nothin' looks beautiful.

542
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:45,804
Wow!

543
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,116
Who...? Who is that?

544
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:51,786
Oh, just another fox.

545
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:55,997
A lady fox.

546
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:57,746
Golly!

547
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:00,909
Is she beautiful!

548
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:04,386
l wonder what her name is.

549
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:08,438
Well, why don't you go ask her?

550
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:12,535
Yeah. Yeah, guess...
Guess I will.

551
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:17,764
I'll... I'll. go up to her and I'll say,
"You're the most gorgeous...

552
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,171
The most beautiful...

553
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:26,022
Never seen anyone, anywhere...”
I'll say...

554
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:29,988
Hi.

555
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:31,987
Hello.

556
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,735
- Big Mama told me, you know...
- [just happened to be...

557
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:39,623
May I call you by your first name?

558
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:43,083
Oh, sure. Why not?

559
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:48,041
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?

560
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:50,705
- Vixey.
- Vixey.

561
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:56,029
My name is... is... Tod.

562
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:58,062
Tod?

563
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:03,046
That's a... That's a nice name, Tod.

564
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,540
It looks like that farm boy
is makin’ it big with her.

565
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:09,783
Now just keep it down.

566
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:12,395
Well, Tod, you know something?

567
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,899
This stream is just full of trout.

568
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,158
Do you think you could catch one?

569
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:20,894
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!

570
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:23,421
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.

571
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:26,547
My dear young lady...

572
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:31,668
.. you happen to be looking
at an expert... fisher fox.

573
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:35,722
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don't overdo it.

574
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:40,029
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... ! never miss.

575
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,727
Please let him catch a fish.

576
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:45,455
Here comes a whopper!

577
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,905
Now, watch closely.

578
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,165
Tod, do you need help?

579
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:03,089
No. No, I do it this way

580
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:05,716
all... all the... all the time!

581
01:04:09,746 --> 01:04:11,116
I got him.

582
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:15,575
Oh, that farm boy,
he don't know nothin’ about fishin’.

583
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:18,046
He ain't gonna hook her that way.

584
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:20,138
Oh, gosh!

585
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:23,997
Tod, you're the
funniest thing I ever saw!

586
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:28,071
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!

587
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,911
You're like everyone else around here.

588
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:35,895
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You are so funny.

589
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,129
So I can't fish!

590
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:41,326
You're a silly,

591
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:44,484
empty-headed... female!

592
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:46,208
Now just a minute.

593
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,909
I mean, you've got a nerve.
Why don't you grow up?

594
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:53,913
Tod, that's no way
to talk to Vixey.

595
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:58,729
Oh, raspberries! I've had it.

596
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,895
Honey, don't stay mad.

597
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:04,750
You gotta be natural. That's the trick.

598
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:06,461
Can't you see?

599
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:11,773
When you have a natural attraction

600
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:17,022
You deserve a mutual reaction

601
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:20,144
You're gonna get a whole lot

602
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:23,270
Of satisfaction

603
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:28,354
Here's all you gotta do

604
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:30,591
When you feel that

605
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:34,933
Natural affection

606
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:39,925
Leads you in the positive direction

607
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,293
You gotta stop showin’ off

608
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,850
Start showin' up

609
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:49,549
With little old natural you

610
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:55,948
Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady

611
01:05:57,854 --> 01:06:01,544
And now that is a natural fact

612
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:06,692
‘Cause when you be yourself

613
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:11,667
With the lady, yeah

614
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:17,753
You gonna get appreciated

615
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:20,928
Right back

616
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:37,858
- But Big Mama...
- It's just getting interesting.

617
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:51,406
Tod, I...

618
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,518
I just know you're
gonna love the forest.

619
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:57,058
Listen, come on.
Let me show you around.

620
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,813
Sure.

621
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:01,156
Come on.

622
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:19,241
Look. One, two,
three, four, five, six.

623
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,274
Seven.

624
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:29,042
I think six would be just right.

625
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:31,690
Six?

626
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:36,817
Six what?

627
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:20,531
"No hunting."

628
01:08:20,897 --> 01:08:25,586
Well, now, we ain't gonna
do none of that, are we, Copper?

629
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:29,432
We're just gonna
get us a no-good fox.

630
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,482
All right, boy, get trackin’.

631
01:08:35,877 --> 01:08:37,277
Smell him out.

632
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:43,163
What ya got there, Copper?

633
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,700
Good work, boy.

634
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:51,825
He'll be comin’ right through here,
headin’ for water.

635
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:54,962
But he won't be drinkin’ any.

636
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:10,383
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.

637
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,890
You know, I've never been happier.

638
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:15,052
Oh, Tod, me too.

639
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,728
That does it.

640
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,197
Amos, you crafty old coot.

641
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,521
The devil himself
couldn't have done no better.

642
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:41,896
Tod?

643
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,161
- Tod, wait a minute.
- What is it, Vixey?

644
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:47,347
I don't wanna go in there.
It's too quiet.

645
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,450
Vixey.

646
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:58,385
What?

647
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:03,023
Tod, be careful.

648
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,516
Dad blast it! He's gettin’ away!

649
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:51,429
Quick, Vixey!

650
01:11:58,181 --> 01:12:00,170
Go on, head for the burrow.

651
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,289
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.

652
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:46,765
Tod!

653
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,670
Oh, no, Tod.

654
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:15,799
Copper! Copper!

655
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,818
We got 'em now for sure.
This is their only way out.

656
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,146
Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.

657
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:24,859
Tod!

658
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:27,221
We're trapped!

659
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,451
Tod, I'm scared.

660
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:36,675
Quick, Vixey!
This is our only chance!

661
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:40,521
Whoa! No! I don't believe it!

662
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:29,967
Copper, we've trapped him now!

663
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:01,355
Copper!

664
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,050
Tod!

665
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:44,018
Tod?

666
01:18:05,648 --> 01:18:08,748
Come on, Copper.
Get outta the way.

667
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,286
Well...

668
01:18:53,362 --> 01:18:55,292
..come on, boy.

669
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:57,471
Let's go home.

670
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:15,492
This is it.

671
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,561
We got him for sure now.

672
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,239
Oh, my gosh!

673
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:26,871
What happened?

674
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:31,565
Hey, there's somethin'

675
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:35,387
very familiar about those eyes, Dinky.

676
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:41,715
Nah, it couldn't be.

677
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:45,189
Could it?

678
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:55,165
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.

679
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:57,251
Good luck, honey.

680
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,943
Ouch! You're killin' me! Ouch!

681
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:12,408
Amos Slade, will you hold still?

682
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,508
You're behaving like a child.

683
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,702
Well, for gosh sakes,
you're hurtin' my foot, woman!

684
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:21,483
Nonsense! Your foot is mendin' fine.

685
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,710
You'll soon be yourself.

686
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:27,472
Oh, land sakes.
I don't know if I like that.

687
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:32,508
Be careful! Ouch!

688
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:38,532
He's sure makin’ a big fuss
over a little old hurt leg.

689
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,644
Copper?

690
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,208
You're my very best friend.

691
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:04,614
And you're mine too, Tod.

692
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:08,553
And we'll always
be friends forever, won't we?

693
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,733
Yeah, forever.
