1
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,209
Are you one of the patrol?

2
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,620
Yes

3
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,970
Good.

4
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,250
One of Ritai’ s men?

5
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,260
Yeah.

6
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,090
Fine, then cut him loose.

7
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,240
What are you looking at!
Don’ t stop.

8
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,310
Hold the leg up.

9
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,170
Turn the head a bit.

10
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,070
Give me the knife.

11
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,510
Kekexili,

12
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,750
the last virgin
wilderness of China.

13
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,359
This plain nearly
four miles high,

14
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,280
is the only remaining habitat
of the Tibetan antelope.

15
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,030
In 1985

16
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,010
Poachers began hunting
antelopes for their fine wool

17
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,210
which was prized in
foreign markets.

18
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,980
Within a few years,

19
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,220
the number of antelopes plunged
from one million to
under ten thousand.

20
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,660
To fight the poachers, a volunteer
civilian patrol was formed in 1993.

21
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,729
It was led by Ritai
a retired Tibetan army officer.

22
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,000
The patrol fought fierce
battles with the poachers

23
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,400
and aroused the attention
of the outside world.

24
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,070
In the winter of 1996,

25
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,120
Poachers murdered
one of the patrolmen.

26
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,000
My newspaper quickly
sent me to cover the story.

27
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,790
(Tibetan) Hey Mister.
Take our picture. Good morning.

28
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,190

32
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,480

34
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,460
1’ d like to interview you.

35
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,950
Who are you?

36
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,530
What?

37
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,020
Do you have some 1D?

38
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,520
1’ ma reporter from Beijing.

39
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,800
I don’ t have time.

40
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,150
Wait a second!

41
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,360
You want this place to be
declared as a nature preserve area

42
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,530
Maybe I can help.

43
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,750
(Tibetan) Dawa Dawa

44
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,940
Yes

45
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,169
Take him upstairs.

46
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,520
Your bag, follow me.

47
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,630

48
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,329

51
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,439
Are you Ritai’ s daughter?

52
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,819
(Tibetan) Yes

53
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,830
What are you reading?

54
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,910
Just some documents.

55
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,890
Oh

57
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,940
Where’ s Liu Dong?

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,140

59
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,550
Here, have some meat.

60
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,400
(Tibetan) You’ re cutting
in the wrong direction.

61
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,730
You understand Tibetan?

62
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,250
(Tibetan)My father’ s a Tibetan.

63
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,090
Tibetan always point
knives toward themselves.

64
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,370
(Tibetan) Samba Cha Cha Cha---

65
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,130

Liu Dong, drink up!

70
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,810

72
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,180

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,120
What’ s wrong? Where are you going?

74
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,680
(Tibetan)None of your business!

75
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,310
Honey, where are you going?
Liu Dong!

76
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,230

77
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:20,869

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,710

Give me a hand.

81
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,390
Ok

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,150

84

Take care yourself!

85
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,970
Midnight of November 1st, 1996

86
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,199
Here is a truck.

87
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,170
We have a check point here.

88
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,910
Gan you catch poachers here?

89
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,839
Maybe.

90
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,480
We’ re close to the
antelope breeding grounds.

91
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,060
They often pass by this road.

92
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,170
Where are you coming from?

93
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,330

94
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,090

No.

100
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,050

101
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:05,819
It’ s cotton!

Let him go.

107
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,410
He’ s just a carrier.

108
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,980
We don’ t have the power
to arrest anybody,

109
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,120
just to confiscate the pelts.

110
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,420
Day 2: Budong springs

Yes, he has been

135
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,730
He keeps the poachers away.

136
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,670
Three years:

137
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,380
We are short of hands.

138
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,800

139
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,300

Don’ t lie to us!

157
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,189
We closed our eyes
when they started shooting.

158
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,070
It was too dark,
we saw nothing.

159
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,120
Do you have a
fishing permit?

160
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,740

His leg.

182
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,850
There’ s no hope.

183
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,919
It’ s the artery.

184
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,980

00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,840
Hua long.

189
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,540
How old are you?

190
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,689
Have you ever
killed any antelopes?

191
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,659
Please help me!

192
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,330
(Tibetan prayer)

193
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,210
Take them across the river.

194
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,879
Hurry! Kneel down!

195
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,190
Ma Zhanlin, do you have
anything to say this time?

196
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,440
Let me have another coat...

197
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,260
1’ m freezing cold.

198
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,340
Where’ s your boss?

199
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,360
We just skin them.

200
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,430
Don’ t lie!

201
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,980
That’ s all I do...

202
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:18,949
Tell us the truth.

203
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,470
1 don’ t know anything...

204
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,060
re you the gunman?

205
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,080
No!

206
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,740
You’ re the gunman!

207
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,490
No, I’ m not.

208
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,189
Then what do you do?

209
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,030
1? m a driver.

210
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,909
Who’ s the gunman?

211
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,220
I don’ t know

212
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,950
Who knows?

213
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,740
My son is not the gunman!

214
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,450
Who is the gunman?

215
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,060
l really don’ t know.

216
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,090
Who knows?

217
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,479
He knew! He hired us.

218
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,050
Ma Zhanlin , cut the crap!

219
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,420
1’? m just a driver...

220
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,310
You’ re the gunman?

221
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,080
No! I’ m the driver!

222
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,900
Then tell us who
the gunman is?

223
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,810
I don’ t know.
They’ re lying .

224
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,140
l really don’ t know.

225
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,580
They say you’ re in charge.

226
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,120
They’ re lying to
save themselves.

227
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,150
Why are you still
here if you’ re the driver?

228
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,720
The truck broke down,
I couldn’ t fix it.

229
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,530
They can’ t see you now.
Talk!

230
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,860
l really don’ t
know anything.

231
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,240
This is your last chance...

232
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,160
l really can’ t help.

233
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,770
Talk!

234
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,700
I Know nothing...

235
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,810
I just drive the truck...

236
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,160
1 don’ t know. I really don’ t...

237
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,050
Talk to us!

238
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,560
1 don’ t know anything...

239
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,250
Talk!

240
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,740
I Know nothing...

241
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,000
Talk to us!

242
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:41,870
I Know nothing...

243
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,199
Let me go

244
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,590
Talk to us!

245
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,429
Talk now or
1’ Il shoot you!

246
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,050
1 don’ t know anything...

247
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,980
I Know nothing...

248
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,680
Talk now or I’ II shoot you!

249
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,590
Alright I’ II tell you.
Don’ t kill me.

250
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,040
The pelts are here..

251
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,540
Dig!

252
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,750
They’ re all here.
There are more underneath...

253
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,929
How many do we have?

254
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,130
547, mostly female.

255
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,580
Now it’ s the breeding season.
What a shame.

256
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,090
The gunman got away.

257
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,770
What about the
men you captured?

258
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,080
They were from
small caliber rifles.

259
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,770
The real gunmen
use machine guns.

260
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,540
l ’ ve been chasing
them for years.

261
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,740
Can I have one?

262
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,540
Thanks.

263
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,960
What do you do?

264
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,940
I skin the animals.

265
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,010
How much do they pay you?

266
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,140
Five Yuan for each pelt.

267
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,360
1’? m the fastest
skinner in Ge’ ermu.

268
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,120
All my children
are here too.

269
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,050
He’ s my oldest,
the middle one and the youngest.

270
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,240
They’ re all skinners.

271
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,490
In the past,
I was a shepherd.

272
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,890
l herded sheep,
cattle and camels.

273
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,350
Now the grasslands
have turned into desert.

274
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,259
The sheep and cattle are
all gone dead or sold off.

275
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,580
It’ s tough to survive here.

276
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,820
I need to pee.

277
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,290
Me too.

278
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,420
Alright stop yelling.

279
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,040
Gayu hand me the bucket.

280
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,480
I want to pee.

281
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,970
Take your turn.

282
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,180
The gunman had to
cross this river...

283
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,200
if they’ re heading north.

284
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:10,940
It’ s crossable.

285
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,230
(Tibetan)1, 2 ,3

286
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,370
Get up and help!

287
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,980
Who wants a drink?

288
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,580
Day 9

289
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,000
Rope.

290
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,000
Everyone gets a half.

291
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,380
I want more!
l haven’ t had anything in days!

292
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,070
We are sharing our food
with you! That’ s all you got!

293
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,560
Thank you.

294
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,299
(Tibetan song) Like
flowing water...

295
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:16,010
Oh, dear mother...
no matter how far I travel...

296
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,600
I shall return...
no matter how far I travel...

297
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,430
Clouds of brilliant white
please deliver my message,

298
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,410
I long for home...

299
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,580
l pray for you
in my heart...

300
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,730
Get inside! Turn around!

301
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,589
Can’ t sleep?

302
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,940
Air is thin up here.
It’ s better outside the car.

303
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,730
Your nose is
bleeding again.

304
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,090
It’? s alright.

305
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,710
It’ s beautiful!

306
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,090
Isn’? t it.

307
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,440
I get homesick every time
I go out on patrol.

308
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,040
Even the lights in the
highway remind me of home.

309
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,020
But when I’ m home
I start thinking of Kekexili.

310
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,820
Do you know what does
Kekexili mean in Tibetan?

311
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,870
It means beautiful
mountains and girls.

312
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,819
Isn’? t it.

313
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,759
In Kekexili,

314
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,090
each step may be the
first human footprint ever,

315
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,540
ever in that spot
since the world began.

316
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,540
Those are not my words.

317
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,200
Two years ago a geologist
came from Bei jing.

318
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,720
I took him to Kekexili
and he said that to me.

319
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,660
Later the geologist
- -
was missing.

320
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,280
No one has seen him since then.

321
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,110
There’ s a lot of
quicksand around here.

322
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,260
(Tibetan) You idiot!

323
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,180
Where are the poachers?

324
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,780
Where are they?

325
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,850
Ma Zhanlin escaped with his sons.

326
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,090
When did you fall asleep?

327
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,170
Around 5 AM.

328
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,049
Captain...

329
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,400
Let go of me!

330
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,250
Hunt them down!

331
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,730
Stop!

332
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,450
Stop! Did you hear me.

333
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,110
Get down! Down!

334
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,620
Watch him!

335
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,600
Get up!

336
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,560
Where’ s the key?

337
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,819
I don’ t have it.

338
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,410
l really don’ t have it.

339
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,089
What’ s this?

340
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,880
What’ s wrong?

341
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,440
Pulmonary edema.

342
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,490
Water?

343
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,680
There isn’ t any.

344
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,330
I can help...

345
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,460
Let him try, he was
a vet in Ge’ ermu.

346
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,160
Hold his arm.

347
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,620
(Tibetan)Liu Dong, you take
Dawa back to see the doctor.

348
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,520
(Tibetan) Ping Cuo,
you should go back too.

349
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,569
(Tibetan) My shoulder
wound isn’ t that bad.

350
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,480
(Tibetan) 1 can help
watch the prisoners.

351
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,130
(Tibetan) Alright.

352
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,450
(Tibetan) We need money
for the doctor.

353
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,629
Give him some money.

354
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,120
It’? s not enough.

355
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,360
Do we have more?

356
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,640
One the fine for the county.

357
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,840
Give it to him.

358
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,430
Still not enough.

359
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,520
Sell the pelts.

360
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,120
1’ m going after the gunman,

361
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,730
you take the route
through Huatugou.

362
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,300
(Tibetan) 0K

363
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,710
(Tibetan) Good Luck.
Good Luck.

364
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,230
(Tibetan) Goodbye.
Goodbye.

365
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,820
(Tibetan) Be safe.

366
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,460
Captain,
we’ re almost out of food.

367
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,620
How many supplies
do we have left?

368
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,850
Two days.

369
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,600
not counting the prisoners.

370
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,710
Fuel’ s nearly gone too.

371
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,080
We should turn back...

372
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,160
No way!

373
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,660
How much fuel left ?

374
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,860
Four days if we
give up the truck.

375
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,680
That should be
enough to catch them.

376
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,040
Step back.

377
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,360
Remove the handcuffs

378
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,670
Ma Zhanlin, every time
I catch you, you pay a fine.

379
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,670
This time I am
letting you go without a fine.

380
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,390
Real ly?

381
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,750
Yes.

382
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,120
I can’ t make it back
from here, I’ m too old.

383
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,710
1 don’ t have food for you,
1? m short of fuel too.

384
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,030
1’ m going after your boss.
Il can’ t take care of you.

385
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,240
I can’ t make it.

386
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,069
Yes, you can.

387
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,250
There are 200 kilometers
to the Al Mountain.

388
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,200
And 100 more to
the Kunlun Pass.

389
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,860
You can make it.

390
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,140
If you can’ t make
it then it’ s your fate.

391
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,240
Good luck.

392
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,580
May God be with you!

393
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,910
Day 10 Bugedaban Peak.

394
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,110
What’ s wrong?

395
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:47,970
The engine’ s gone.

396
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,130
Out of oil.

397
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,700
Why didn’ t you
check the oil before?

398
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,800
We’ ve been going
non-stop for two days...

399
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,730
Gan you fix it?

400
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,410
Wait here for Liu Dong.

401
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,319
Let’ s go.

402
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,400

00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,310
(Tibetan) Good luck!

404
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,290
Gan Liu Dong find them?

405
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,080
If it doesn’ t snow...

406
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,290
Day 12

407
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,690
Day 15

408
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,990

00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,410
(Tibetan) Doctor. Doctor.

411
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,049
(Tibetan) Get up, Get up.

412
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,870
(Tibetan) This bench is for
patients, Your friend is alright.

413
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,770
What do you want?
1’ m still working.

414
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,440
Where have you
been for so long?

415
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,880
You’ re a mess.

416
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,590
1’ m working. Let go of me.

417
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,660
Aren’ t you cold in
those fishing net.

418
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,910
It’? s my working outfit.

419
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,590
What do you want
from me anyway?

420
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,080
You look like a lunatic.

421
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,010
Are you playing deaf now?

422
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,340
I miss you!

423
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,879
You miss me but you
didn’ t come to see me.

424
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,210
I went patrolling.

425
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,950
I thought you were dead.

426
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,230
I need some money.

427
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,609
You pull this shit
every time I see you!

428
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,430
Lengxue.

429
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,640
Do you think I own a bank?

430
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,720
Did you spend my money
on other women?

431
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,960
1 don’ t know how you can
live that crazy life.

432
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,700
I just want to be with you

433
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,400
1’ m leaving...

434
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,480
You’ II forget me soon.

435
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,120
And find yourself
another girl...

436
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:27,710
Lengxue. .

437
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,210
Can Ma Zhanlin make
it out alive?

438
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,440
What about your men?

439
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,430
l hope it doesn’ t snow!

440
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:33,710
What’ s wrong?

441
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,720
They’ I1 never find us.
We’ re going to die here.

442
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:40,840
Shut up!

443
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,950
Your whole situation
looks pretty desperate.

444
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,280
We’ re short of money,
short of men, short of guns.

445
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,320
My guys haven’ t got
paid for almost a year.

446
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,980
Gan the county help?

447
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,240
We’ re not officially employed.

448
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,730
How do you pay for the patrol?

449
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,460
We have to come up
with the money ourselves.

450
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:55,230
What do you do with the pelts?

451
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,570
We hand most of them
to the authorities.

452
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,470
Do you sell some to
raise the money?

453
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,670
Selling the pelts is illegal.

454
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,530
How should I write
the article?

455
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,460
l always thought
1’? ma good journalist...

456
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,750
I know you’ re a reporter.

457
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,850
You think Kekexili is
protected by you reporters?

458
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,750
1’ Il go to prison if
I have to.

459
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,490
I know selling
pelts is illegal.

460
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:29,270
But I can’ t worry
about that now.

461
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,090
Ever seen prostrators
on a pilgrimage?

462
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,790
Their faces and
hands are filthy.

463
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,690
But their hearts are pure.

464
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,740
I sold pelts before,
1 had no choice.

465
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,290
It’ s highway on the other
side of the mountains.

466
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,120
We have to catch them
before they get there.

467
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:30,850
(Tibetan) Look around
for something to eat.

468
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:42,939
How much bullets do we have?

469
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,710
A few dozen.

470
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,450
Yixi ,what did you do
before this?

471
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,590
I was a student.

472
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,520
Where?

473
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,580
Qinghai Normal University.

474
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,100
You should be a teacher.

475
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,620
This job is more interesting

476
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:09,269
Gayu, are you married?

477
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,310
No.

478
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,270
Girlfriend?

479
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,770
We broke up right before
1 came here.

480
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,500
Just like my patrol,

481
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,350
each time they go out their
girlfriends leave them.

482
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,820
There are plenty nice girls
out there.

483
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:25,309
Isn’ t that right, Yixi?

484
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,350
Right.

485
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,170
What did Bading do before?

486
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,770
A professional rabbits hunter.

487
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:35,840
Nonsense.

488
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:38,960
He worked at a
highway checkpoint.

489
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,820
For logging trucks.

490
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,930
They worked all kind of
jobs before joined the team.

491
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,090
Liu Dong was a Taxi driver,
AWang was a soldier,

492
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:50,419
Songji was a herder.

493
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,530
For you.

494
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,110
Have some!

495
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,459
Up in those mountains,
there’ s nothing to eat .

496
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,750
Day 17

497
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,590
Gan Yixi and Bading
find their way out?

498
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,599
I think so.

499
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,170
Should we wait for them here?

500
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,990
Ma Zhanlin, you’ re still alive.

501
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,200
l am. But many died
on the way out.

502
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,799
My team got separated too.

503
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,120
This is captain Ritai,

504
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,040
This is our boss.

505
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,470
Captain, have a smoke.

506
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,769
1’ ve been chasing you
for years.

507
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,100
Why?

508
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,890
You killed my antelope.

509
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,770
So did a lot of people.

510
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,139
That’ s no excuse.

511
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,090
So what do you want?

512
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,450
You come with me.

513
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,179
Captain,
if you let me off the hook.

514
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,719
1’ Il buy you two cars,

515
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,019
And 1’ II build you
a new house too.

516
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:31,610
Our boss is kind,

517
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,309
And he’ s rich--s Shut up!

518
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,650
Surrender your guns
and come with me.

519
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,570
Sure! Let’ s give the
Captain our guns.

520
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,240
We’ II join his
mountains patrol ...

521
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,360
Who fired ?

522
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,190
Who fired the gun?

523
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,170
I did.

524
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,240
Fuck you.
You almost hit me.

525
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,490
He’ s still alive.

526
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,460
Are you a patrolmen?

527
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,940
No, he’ s not Ritai’ s guy.

528
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,790
You’ re a dead man if you are!

529
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,240
He’ s not.

530
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,969
Follow our footprints for five
kilometers to find the highway
