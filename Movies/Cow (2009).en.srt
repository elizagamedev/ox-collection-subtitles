1
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,700
Chief!

2
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,670
Where is everyone?

3
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,340
Jiu

4
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,180
Anybody alive here?

5
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,400
lam Niu Er!

6
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,409
Everybody...

7
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,510
Everybody...

8
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,820
It can't be...

9
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,860
All dead..

10
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,920
“Judging from this cow's size,the bulls must be really big!"

11
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,640
Shame on you!

12
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,900
Let me see!

13
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,500
What some grass?

14
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,620
What grass?

15
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,640
Foreign cattle eat grain.

16
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,260
Chief

17
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,500
"Uncle,"

18
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,550
the 8th Route Army offers him the first taste.

19
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,270
Already two buckets...

20
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,359
The milk flows like a river.

21
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,620
Chief!

22
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,929
Do cows have parents?

23
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,720
Idiot!

24
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,860
It's the law of nature!

25
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,330
Think you were born out of a stone?

26
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,860
Impossible!

27
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,270
Animals make milk only if they can reproduce.

28
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,760
“Niu Er, why are you here?"

29
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,640
Aren't you embarrassed? Look!

30
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,310
"See how big the foreign cow is? Next to it,"

31
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
yours is nothing.

32
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,470
Go to hell!

33
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,780
My cow is good!

34
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,210
That thing... It's a monster.

35
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,210
She's still going! What a cow!

36
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,990
So much milk.

37
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,730
This cow is worth more than us!

38
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,530
Absolutely.

39
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,010
It only gives milk for a few months each year.

40
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,500
We milk it with restraint.

41
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,320
“Comrade, could 1 have some milk?"

42
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,690
My baby is hungry.

43
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,780
Sure! Children shouldn't go hungry.

44
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,790
What are you doing?

45
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Hard work never did anyone any harm

46
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,449
People from other villages

47
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,110
are overrunning us!

48
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,670
"As a newcomer, you don't understand!"

49
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,330
Milk is needed for the wounded of the 8th Army.

50
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,620
So newcomers should starve

51
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,810
It hasn't been easy for m to marry into your village.

52
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,310
Widows should keep quiet!

53
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,650
"Chief, 1 want justice!"

54
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,660
Must newcomers starve in your village?

55
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,020
The old saying goes...

56
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,110
“Women who bring bad luck to their husbands"

57
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,790
Severe punishment

58
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,240
Nonsense!

59
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,970
Your wife

60
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,010
is not from this village!

61
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,990
Let her bring you bad luck!

62
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,770
He wants me to die!

63
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
"See, Niu.."

64
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,260
That girl Jiu needs discipline.

65
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,760
Then she'll be as tame as a cow.

66
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Have you ever touched udders?

67
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
Not such big ones.

68
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,729
Big talker! Not even small ones.

69
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,510
“If you dare touch those udders,
then you can look at my gun sight."

70
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,330
I rarely show it to anyone.

71
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,940
Silence!

72
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,060
Silence!

73
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,920
Japanese troops are coming!

74
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,220
Run!

75
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,930
Hide the grain and run!

76
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,510
Those demons are coming!

77
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,490
Hurry!

78
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,830
Listen! An approaching plane!

79
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
It trips me every time!

80
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,920
What are you doing?

81
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,670
You want to die?

82
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,120
You could detonate that bomb!

83
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,819
It's been here for two years.
Can a kick make it explode?

84
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,720
Can't you read the sign

85
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,060
“Men and Animals, Keep Away."

86
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,160
Can't you read?

87
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,760
“l was told this was ""eight""."

88
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,490
"You're 8th Army, didn't you know?"

89
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,950
You're funny!

90
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,180
I'll show you...

91
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,590
“Two separate strokes make "eight""."

92
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,060
“Two connected strokes make "man"™."

93
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,890
“Add one stroke to make ""big""."

94
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,790
“Add two to make "'sky""."

95
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,410
"What happens to "eight" now?"

96
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,100
I don't know.

97
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,520
“Anyway, separate strokes make "man",
connected strokes make ""eight""."

98
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,610
That's wrong.

99
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,670
“Separate stokes make “"eight"",
connected strokes make "man"™"."

100
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,069
“See, you don't know either."

101
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,840
Wow!

102
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,360
Your breakfast is much richer than mine.

103
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,830
Here you go.

104
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,580
What a big cow!

105
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,210
Hide in the cellars what we can't take.

106
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,610
The cow is a real problem.

107
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,930
Let's leave it in the village.

108
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,760
The army will give you funds to feed it special grain.

109
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,849
“Comrade, give me a hand."

110
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,300
“In a couple of weeks, our army will strike back."

111
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,070
I'll return for the cow.

112
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,790
We must make a contract.

113
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,290
"You know, the cow is a donation from foreign friends."

114
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,520
The milk is for our wounded.

115
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,410
Hiding the wounded is easy.

116
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,440
But the cow is too big.
It's different from our local cows.

117
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,960
"The village is a "stronghold". You'll manage.”

118
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,900
We'll do our best

119
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,330
The cow will be returned to you unharmed.

120
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,320
Not to me .

121
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,820
To the Army.

122
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,520
How could this happen?

123
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,930
“Everyone dead, except the cow. "

124
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,670
Move!

125
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,040
What are you doing?

126
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,700
Damn you

127
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,060
Who do you think you are?

128
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,620
You should have been roasted long ago!

129
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,690
What?

130
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,280
Let me see.

131
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,200
Are you mute?

132
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,630
Line up!

133
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,050
Time for bean lottery!

134
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,610
We follow the rules of our ancestors.

135
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,510
He who picks the red bean tends to the cow.

136
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,550
Patience to those who pick green beans.

137
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,430
Heaven will determine who will bear this duty.

138
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,810
Understand?

139
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,020
So?

140
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,200
Exactly 128 beans.

141
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,630
Fine.

142
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,319
Here's the red bean.

143
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,410
Pour them in.

144
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,600
One bean per man!

145
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,020
No women!

146
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,080
Why not?

147
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,280
Aren't we liberated now?

148
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,330
Women are free!

149
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,640
Keep quiet!

150
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,830
This is a dangerous task!

151
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,600
How can you hide such a big cow?
So conspicuously foreign!

152
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,980
The Japanese are not stupid.

153
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,570
Loan me your cow for grinding.

154
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,900
No!

155
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:47,980
Everything clear?

156
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,770
I have an idea.

157
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,930
I have lots of dyes.

158
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,230
I can turn this cow yellow

159
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,440
to resemble a Chinese cow.

160
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,069
The Japanese would not notice.

161
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,570
No!
Why not?

162
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,170
I'll do it myself.

163
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,010
I would give my life for the cow!

164
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,320
I have an idea.

165
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,690
I have been a doctor for many ears.

166
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,050
I have a potion to make it mute

167
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,150
without harming it.

168
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,220
Niu Er!

169
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,490
Why are you with the women? Come here!

170
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,819
He is busy!

171
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,710
l already have a cow. Leave me out.

172
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,330
You're not a woman!

173
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,180
Come here!

174
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,290
I'l do it!

175
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,190
What are you doing?

176
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,940
Here lam.

177
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,060
Not you.

178
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,510
You'll take all the milk for yourself!

179
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,040
I'll take Niu's place

180
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,400
“Niu Er, tell them"

181
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,950
Don't look.

182
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,180
Eat this.

183
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,110
It tastes bad because it's good for you.

184
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,460
Then do what you want.

185
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,879
Stay mute.

186
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,530
You're very contrary.

187
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,790
Just like Jiu.

188
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,570
Jiu?

189
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,100
"Call me "dear."

190
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,300
Eat up and moo for me.

191
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,820
Go on.

192
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,600
Niu dear!

193
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,290
Niu dear!

194
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:34,920
Here you are.

195
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,280
You pest!

196
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,820
You want to kill me?

197
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,160
“Jiu, what bean did you get?"

198
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,080
No bean at all!

199
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,719
Who got the red bean?

200
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,590
Show your hands

201
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,199
Let's see!

202
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,010
Who is hiding it?

203
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,430
Niu Er has it!

204
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
Let me see.

205
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,820
It's in hs mouth!

206
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,250
That's a lie!

207
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,690
Spit it out!

208
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,300
He swallowed it!

209
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,500
Don't listen to their nonsense!

210
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,870
What?

211
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,200
Jiu...

212
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,710
l wanted children and a happy life with you.

213
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,890
All clear.

214
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,410
One of our units passed here already.

215
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,520
Exactly.

216
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,340
This is a stronghold.
Anti-Japanese.

217
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,660
Our troops already cleared the area.

218
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,419
A big favor... We should thank them.

219
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,380
"Check the village, eliminate any danger."

220
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,250
We'll head out tomorrow morning.

221
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,330
"Yes, sir."

222
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,870
Forward march!

223
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,949
I heard you... It worked.

224
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,990
The antidote was good.

225
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,790
Let's go.

226
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,970
We can't stay here.

227
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,570
A wolf is a bad sign. What will happen now?

228
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,250
What's your problem?

229
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,440
Don't start...

230
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,180
I'll show you.

231
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,250
So many wounded...

232
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,620
What now?

233
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,860
Sir!

234
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,650
All clear ahead.

235
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,590
Good. Get some rest.

236
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,330
So?

237
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,400
No sign of the enemy in the village.

238
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,160
Good. Get some rest

239
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,530
“Excuse me, Captain."

240
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,570
I want to fight with the others.

241
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,670
Stay and take care of the wounded.

242
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,040
But I can fight!

243
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,610
That's an order. Understand?

244
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,110
"Yes, sir."

245
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,290
Commander...

246
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,670
We must advance...

247
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,810
The torches!

248
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,230
Otsuka

249
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,350
Go and see!

250
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,730
“It's your fault.
By leaving, we could have avoided this."

251
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,330
I'll roast you yet!

252
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,120
"OK,1 won't."

253
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,230
The torches!

254
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:00,980
Otsuka!

255
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,010
Go and see!

256
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,000
Where is the noise from?

257
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,900
Over there.

258
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,070
Damn cow!

259
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,560
Trying to get me killed?

260
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,060
Then stay there.

261
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,120
I won't come back.

262
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,940
l almost forgot...

263
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,669
"l lost my old cow and my home,
deserve this money."

264
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,790
Over and done

265
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,790
Heaven's will.

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,320
Where could this foreign cow have come from?

267
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,690
Really strange.

268
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,840
They aren't native to China.

269
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,040
It's not a Chinese cow.

270
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,040
Anybody know how to milk a cow?

271
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,430
Excuse me...

272
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,270
We raised cattle back home.

273
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,700
Really?

274
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,460
Can you milk a cow?

275
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,390
Let's sing for the cow!

276
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,169
"We will win"

277
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,040
Without far of death!

278
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,600
“A pretty girl in the orchard"

279
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,500
Picking pretty peaches

280
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,660
"Sees tomcat doing tabby"

281
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,550
Meow meow here

282
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,149
Meow meow there

283
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,470
“Squad Three, assemble!"

284
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,929
Conserve the rations.

285
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,159
We return in two days.

286
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,100
Wait here for us.

287
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,690
Your mission is to protect the wounded and the cow.

288
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,740
Don't worry

289
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,879
The Chinese are sneaky.

290
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,810
Don't retaliate in case of attack.

291
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,380
Understand?

292
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,230
Drink.

293
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,140
Be strong.

294
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,580
They return in two days.

295
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,620
The pain!

296
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,930
Ikeda!

297
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,530
Hold on!

298
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,630
Let's go home alive!

299
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,090
“Kuroki, your post is crucial!"

300
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,130
Defend it with your life!

301
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,750
“Shibuya, did you feed the cow"

302
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,110
Do it!

303
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,770
Shibya! Enough!

304
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,990
Watch the gate!

305
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,460
So cunning!

306
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,900
Damned Chinese!

307
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,370
“Shibuya, the gate!"

308
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,740
The cow is gone!

309
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,500
Dumb-ass!

310
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,420
What are you doing?

311
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,220
"Sorry, sir!"

312
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,580
What destroys a country?

313
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,118
I don't know.

314
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,420
Frivolity and irresponsibility

315
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,310
I stumbled on it by accident

316
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,370
The war isn't in that jar!

317
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,710
Be serious.

318
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,259
Could you see?
Yes.

319
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,090
All wounded. Three still standing.

320
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,049
Let's go.

321
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,170
Where are you going

322
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,250
To report To Captain.
Why?

323
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,000
They have a machine gun.

324
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,520
“If we get it, we'll be heroes. "

325
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,120
Damned Chinese!

326
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,240
Come out!

327
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,100
What are you waiting for?

328
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,000
Save your ammunition

329
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,000
“Shibuya, watch the door!"

330
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,600
It's only an ambush!

331
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,610
No use mooing. I won't go back.

332
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,950
“You want me dead, killer cow!"

333
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,180
Everyone is dead. You know it.

334
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,890
! did what 1 promised.

335
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,970
Two people... Pow! Pow! Killed.

336
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,500
“If 1 go back, the village would become extinct."

337
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,060
Enough with your damned moos!

338
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,350
Go to hell!

339
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,930
I don't care

340
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,190
I must have eaten it in a past life.

341
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,930
So

342
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,230
Place these land mines around and bury them well.

343
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,710
“Shibuya, not too far fram the entry.”

344
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,340
Remember the positions.

345
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,410
“Protect me, bodhisattva Guanyin."

346
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,509
“Bodhisattva of Mercy, protect me. "

347
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,350
How strange

348
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,860
l remember stealing grain this way as a child...

349
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,410
the tunnel seemed wider.

350
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,490
Don't make noise.

351
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,590
Keep quiet.

352
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,920
I'm back

353
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,140
Come here!

354
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,740
There' no one here.

355
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,410
No fooling around.

356
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,340
Stop eating.

357
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,580
Otsuka!

358
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,340
Someone's there!

359
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,700
We're not armed!

360
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,460
Beast!

361
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,810
He's running away!

362
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,100
“Kamada, where did he go?"

363
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,790
In the well!

364
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,970
Step back!

365
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,390
The Chief was right: it takes is discipline!

366
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,620
VIL Kill it

367
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,180
That treasonous cow!

368
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,920
TI kill you right now!

369
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,090
The cow seems hungry. Feed it.

370
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,170
“Kuroki, keep watch. 1 need sleep."

371
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,060
Damn!

372
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,440
“Otsuka, what did you do in Japan?"

373
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,860
“Anything I could, to make a living."

374
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,880
l was a student.

375
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,709
I don't know much about life.

376
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,670
A clear shot.

377
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,190
I can't miss.

378
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,210
You still have a lot to learn.

379
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,000
Your fingerprint is a promise.

380
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,960
Niu Er swears on his life...

381
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,460
Yours is the last remaining cow.

382
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,450
Protected from the Japanese.

383
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,820
Where did he hide it?

384
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,220
I know where!

385
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,540
That bastard dug a big cave in the mountains.

386
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,970
I discovered it

387
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,140
when I was hunting

388
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,020
Always
0:46:35:05 00:46:40:10 keep their
promise. I didn't promise anything!

389
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,130
You must!

390
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,630
Everyone must sacrifice for the revolution.

391
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,930
"Fine, he'll do it."

392
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,029
Your fingerprint now!

393
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,670
I don't want to!

394
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,259
Niu Er is stronger than you!

395
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,860
Whoever loses takes the cow!

396
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,080
"l say that first,"

397
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,350
we must find a man to train you!

398
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:44,810
Fine.

399
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,120
Let's do as the Chief says

400
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,230
“Niu takes care of the cow,
the village appoints Jiu as his wife."

401
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,810
Why?

402
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,279
These are two totally different things.

403
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,410
“Today, marriage is a personal choice."

404
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,660
Nonsense!

405
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:05,880
I decide!

406
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,620
Let it be done!

407
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,680
I won't!

408
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,160
Heaven knows that I already have a grandfather!

409
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,550
I deserve a real marriage!

410
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,240
“I'm your grandfather's grandfather,"

411
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,870
lam Heaven here!

412
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,580
"Who would marry you, widow"

413
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,590
“Refuse, and we'll banish you."

414
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,480
You'll get three bucket of grain as dowry.

415
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,130
Convince Niu Er to accept the cow.

416
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,480
That's not enough.

417
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,340
I want his silver bracelet.

418
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,460
As a memento.

419
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,260
Or l won't marry him.

420
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:56,770
Fine.

421
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,030
No!

422
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,780
It's a family heirloom!

423
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,319
Too bad

424
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,000
Everyone bear witness!

425
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,279
Everyone bear witness!

426
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,610
No!

427
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,740
“Good morning, Otsuka."

428
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,710
I told you not to go out.

429
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,800
"Sorry, but a healthy cow needs to walk."

430
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,830
Don't be long.

431
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,040
"1: Loyalty is second nature for a soldier."

432
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,350
2: A soldier respects the rules of proper etiquette.

433
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,150
3: A soldier cultivates the art of weaponry.

434
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,670
Who are you?

435
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,670
What's going on?

436
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,170
It's the enemy!

437
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,660
How many are you?

438
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,840
“How many are you?
Speak up, damned Chinese!"

439
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,340
Bastard!

440
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,700
What happened?

441
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,049
He attacked me from behind.

442
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,770
Who is he?

443
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,190
The enemy!

444
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,510
Should I stab him?

445
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,660
Consider him target practice

446
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,810
Stab him

447
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,780
“Stand up, Shibuya!"

448
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,040
You are not a student!

449
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,630
You are a soldier of the Empire!

450
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,629
That's an order!

451
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:19,980
Go!

452
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,600
Call Otsuka!

453
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,770
“Shibuya, water!"

454
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,020
It's just a flesh wound.

455
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,690
Shut up and look at me.

456
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,700
"You oaf... And you, act like a man!"

457
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,740
Lower your head.

458
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,920
VIL kill you

459
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,390
Don't shoot

460
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,540
“Shibuya, the rifle."

461
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,620
I'll show you how to use a bayonet.

462
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,270
Watch!

463
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,569
“Come on, Chinaman!"

464
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,520
NIL kill you!

465
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,190
“Captain, here's a dead villager."

466
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,490
Jiu...

467
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,220
Jiu...

468
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,100
"Oh Momma..."

469
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,340
Let's head south

470
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,220
"Where roads are wide"

471
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,800
And money is high

472
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,020
Oh Momma

473
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,630
The village has decided. So we'll obey.

474
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,620
“Such a good life, you have."

475
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,790
Easy and plentiful. That's why you're so big.

476
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,340
You've never had grain before.

477
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,020
Life with me is tough.

478
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,220
Communist cows are so lucky!

479
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,700
"This is home. We eat what we want, nothing to fear."

480
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,638
What are you looking at?

481
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,220
You are a cow of the 8th Army.

482
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,940
You should act like one

483
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,620
The Communists stress quality for all men.

484
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,420
But not for cows

485
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,940
“I'm poor, so you'll have to eat hay."

486
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,500
Peasant food.

487
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,140
"Yellow Cow, eat up."

488
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,020
But net so much that they'll notice.

489
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,460
Wow...

490
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,720
How did they get so big?

491
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,580
What's wrong?

492
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,700
Don't 1 have the right to some milk?

493
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,060
“Like Jiu, you need discipline."

494
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,270
Be good or I'll give the rest of your grain to Yellow Cow.

495
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,180
“l can't touch Jiu's, but 1 can touch yours."

496
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,780
"See, how I'm touching them."

497
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,800
“Of course, 1 can touch them."

498
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,640
What's up?

499
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,300
Shame on you!

500
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,910
Scratches to your face!

501
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,350
And slaps to the mouth!

502
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,860
Aren't you ashamed?

503
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,540
Give me the silver bracelet.

504
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,900
You'll get it

505
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,100
after we're married.

506
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,120
Give it to me or I'll report you.

507
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,360
You fed the village grain

508
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,140
to your yellow cow

509
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,718
And you're abusing the Communist cow!

510
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,350
I'm not!

511
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:58,839
"Yes, you are!"

512
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,879
No!

513
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,320
You touched her udders!

514
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,140
Stop and listen to me!

515
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,380
"Villagers, come out and hear!"

516
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,660
Disgusting news!

517
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,450
Don't believe this nonsense!

518
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,540
He fed the village grain to his own cow

519
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,790
and let the Communist cow go hungry!

520
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,660
The very cow entrusted to us

521
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,020
And he even touched her udders!

522
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,970
Only the 8th Army has that right!

523
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,540
Jiu...

524
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,830
Go away!

525
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,540
Leave me alone!

526
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,620
Go away!

527
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,620
Where are you going?

528
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,299
Don't come back if you run away.

529
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,839
“A pretty girl in the orchard"

530
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,650
“Picking pretty peaches"

531
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,900
Sees tomcat doing tabby

532
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,820
“Meow meow her"

533
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,100
"Meow meow there!"

534
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,620
Shameful cow!

535
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,470
“If l were you, I would kill myself."

536
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,900
So insolent!

537
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,779
“From now on,"

538
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,020
you will obey me.

539
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,450
Do as I tell you and give me milk.

540
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,540
OK?

541
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,370
Don't I feed you right?

542
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,340
Enjoy yourself while you can.

543
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,140
Refugee?

544
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,620
From where

545
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,420
The smell brought you here...

546
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,500
Have some.

547
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,900
A real mother...

548
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,060
Milk again!

549
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,640
Where're from the other valley. I'm a doctor.

550
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,900
"Well, you know how to remove corns.”

551
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,760
“treat diseases, too."

552
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,870
Our village was raided and burnt down by the Japanese.

553
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,370
We fled for our lives.

554
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,250
We haven't eaten for days.

555
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,690
Human life isn't worth much

556
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,460
“Thank goodness, your cow saved us."

557
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,420
“It's like our mother, right?"

558
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,850
The poor beast is doing badly.

559
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,660
It eats very little grass

560
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,279
and it gives too much milk.
It's no surprise that it's sick.

561
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,560
We won't be able to milk it for a while.

562
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,390
Don't worry.

563
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,190
It can give you one last bucket.

564
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,299
No one will milk her anymore!

565
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,500
Look at her!
Feeding you made her this way. Go away!

566
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,450
Where to?

567
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,259
We'll slaughter it.

568
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,840
“Big as it is, there will be enough meat"

569
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,520
for 20 days.

570
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,270
Go to hell

571
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,718
You're re a beast!

572
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,419
Why?

573
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,510
Why?

574
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,260
Tell me!

575
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,330
Did you kill your mother after she breast-fed you?

576
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,660
Tell me!

577
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,370
lll kill you first!

578
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,299
It's not his fault.

579
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,300
We all need to eat.

580
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,900
"Go, all of you."

581
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,100
You can see what's left of the cow.

582
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,500
! did what I could for you.

583
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,100
Don't ask for more

584
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,779
“Please, just go"

585
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,610
“Listen up, everyone..."

586
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:28,090
Maybe we'll meet people in the next village.

587
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,700
Let's go.

588
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,810
"If we find food, children eat first!"

589
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,390
Think of our hungry children!

590
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,930
That poor man nearly killed his cow for us.

591
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:50,309
I'll stay and try to cure it with some kind of medicine.

592
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,610
Blood is clogging its heart and lungs.

593
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,839
High internal temperature.

594
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,940
It will take the right kind of herb.

595
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,690
“Please, you must cure her"

596
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,560
“l want to, but 1 don't have the medicine."

597
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:49,189
Come with me. The Chief had all kinds of medicine!

598
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,490
The cow shouldn't be left alone! You go!

599
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,509
What?

600
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,550
What?

601
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,640
You're up to something bad!

602
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,630
Is this how you thank me for feeding you?

603
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,780
Bad people!

604
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,660
I'll be back!

605
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,820
I'll get you!

606
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,470
Can a corn-removing scalpel be used to slay a cow?

607
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,420
To protect the cowhide

608
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,620
you must start from the muzzle.

609
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,290
Bastard

610
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,140
You don't have a heart!

611
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,059
Think to kill the cook after the meal?

612
01:11:59,280 --> 01:11:59,800
Come here!

613
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,680
“Don't touch that cow,"

614
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,060
or I'll skin you alive!

615
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,710
Fight like a man!

616
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,900
Enough!

617
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,269
"Once it is done, we'll calm him with some meat."

618
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,050
Everyone

619
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:16,600
happy!

620
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,940
The cow's gone mad

621
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,580
Bad-tempered like Jiu.

622
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,710
Where have you been hiding?

623
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,220
I've been looking for hours!

624
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,510
What did they do to you? Those bastards...

625
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,350
How did you get up here?

626
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,540
Can you fly too?

627
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,900
It's fine. Those bastards won't come here.

628
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,590
That son of a bitch!

629
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,740
He wants to kill us.

630
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,200
The cow must be inside.

631
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,220
Of course.

632
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,959
“Gousheng,”

633
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,210
“Er Qiang, capture him now"

634
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,019
Go away

635
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,500
The place is covered with Japanese land mines! Stop it!

636
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,700
Or you'll all end up dead!

637
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,660
Coward!

638
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,110
We only wanted to eat your cow.

639
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,540
And you killed my two brothers!

640
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,360
NIL kill you!

641
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,330
There's another one!

642
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,540
Go away...

643
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,780
There are land mines!

644
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,410
Leave my cow alone!

645
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,500
You can't come in.

646
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,570
The explosions will attract bandits.

647
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,900
Save yourself

648
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,970
“The mines are everywhere,
I don't know exactly where!"

649
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,260
Just go!

650
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,700
“Doctor, just hurry and go!"

651
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,230
Liar!

652
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,709
Why would I lie?

653
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,239
Are you blind?

654
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,780
You're trying to trick me!

655
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,940
Mangy mongrel!

656
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,299
You're crazy!

657
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,180
People aren't for eating!

658
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,550
Bastard!

659
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:25,860
Go away

660
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,950
Let's et out of here.

661
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,630
Man ad beast have gone mad.

662
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,530
“Let's go to the mountains, to the cave."

663
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,500
We'll never return.

664
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,370
What do you say?

665
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,599
Tell me.

666
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,100
“Niu Er, dear!"

667
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,519
I need your help!

668
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,250
Go away!

669
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,060
Come here!

670
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,460
You broke your promise.

671
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:20,900
Come here

672
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:24,180
Hurry and dig the hole.
The Japanese are coming.

673
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,600
I'll feed your cow.

674
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,059
I will send it back to you soon.

675
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,570
“If the mountain bandits come, we're finished."

676
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,180
Just give them the yellow cow.

677
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,580
Save yourself.

678
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,130
Come on.

679
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,900
Who's there?

680
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,420
"So you like killing, you Japanese dog?"

681
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,010
Don't want to kill anymore?

682
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,099
Didn't you kill everyone here?

683
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:06,190
"We were living peacefully, without harming you. "

684
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,660
Come here!

685
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:18,900
and you? Not unruly anymore?

686
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,160
“l was a student. I just arrived, I never killed anyone.”

687
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,250
This Japanese knows some Chinese!

688
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,860
He writes well.

689
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:31,790
Eight.

690
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,110
I'm 8th Route Army.

691
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,230
You're a dead man!

692
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,460
There's no reason to kill each other!

693
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,389
What kind of gun is this?

694
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:39,820
Almost forgot...

695
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,460
Open your eyes.

696
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,019
I'll do this your way.

697
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,330
My mother...

698
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,950
My younger brother

699
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,370
They are waiting or me.

700
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,620
Give me my photo

701
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,000
Don't show me that.

702
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:13,760
It won't work.

703
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,220
Your family?

704
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,969
I used to have a family too!

705
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:28,349
You murdered my pregnant aunt with a bayonet.

706
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,830
So shut up! You must pay.

707
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,740
For everything.

708
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,210
"Uncle,"

709
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:40,820
Chief!

710
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,299
Help me!

711
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:45,220
“Today, 1 avenge you all!"

712
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,599
"Oh Momma"

713
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,180
Let's head south

714
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,980
“Where roads are wide And money is high"

715
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,190
“So many mountains to climb..."""

716
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:54,490
Wait here. I'll check out the cave.

717
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,380
Halt!

718
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,280
Who are you?

719
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,660
You scared me. Where are you from?

720
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,090
Are you 8th Army

721
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,050
I'm from the Nationalist Army. Who are you?

722
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,200
I found that stuff on the way.

723
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,410
I'm not a soldier. Stop threatening me!

724
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,019
What's that?

725
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,290
You were smart to hide here. This is my cave.

726
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,420
That cow...

727
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,250
It's so big!

728
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,870
“Careful, she's very bad-tempered!"

729
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,210
Fraternizing with the Japanese? Traitor!

730
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,170
They're killing the Chinese

731
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,740
Put that gun down

732
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,019
Do you want to get killed?

733
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,320
My brothers...

734
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,100
What kind of gun is this?

735
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,980
I will avenge them!

736
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,440
It's not how it looks!

737
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,330
Listen to me!

738
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,900
“Uncle, Chief..."

739
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,559
Help me!

740
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,170
“Today, I will avenge you!"

741
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,360
Don't touch her!

742
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,250
Crazy Japanese

743
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:22,040
Bullshit

744
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,140
Don't take me for a fool!

745
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,559
He cured my cow!

746
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,430
Collaborator!

747
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,540
Tell him to put the gun down!

748
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,950
Or I'll shoot you too!

749
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,650
Guns down both of you!

750
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:44,820
What kind of gun is this?

751
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:46,940
Two...

752
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,620
Three!

753
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,630
Get down!

754
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,410
Get down!

755
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,280
Jiu

756
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,180
Where are you?

757
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,400
Everything's fine.

758
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,200
We're lucky.

759
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,660
All together!

760
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,860
Push!

761
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,850
What is this about?

762
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,260
A foreign cow mating with a Chinese cow?

763
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,719
Sure it can! They're both cows.

764
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,130
Reproduction is possible.

765
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,580
I'll get you all!

766
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:19,099
We'll never go down again.

767
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,490
Men till the land and women weave cloth.

768
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,889
This is how life should be

769
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:42,740
So you wanted to kill me

770
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,389
Then we'll all die together.

771
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,290
lL kill you all!

772
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,740
Jiu!

773
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,100
Momma!

774
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,420
“Picking pretty peaches"

775
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:17,980
“Sees tomcat doing tabby"

776
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,540
Get up

777
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:58,559
I forbid you to die

778
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,559
Get up

779
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,220
Do you want to freeze to death?

780
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,460
Then get up!

781
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,660
Listen...

782
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,480
I want to know something.

783
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,450
You...

784
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,190
In your foreign country...

785
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,600
How are you called?

786
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:01,960
Do they call you Jiu?

787
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:10,120
What's the name of your village?

788
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,980
Do you miss your parents?

789
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,410
“Captain, land mines ahead!"

790
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,550
We can't advance

791
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,690
How could there be landmine here?

792
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,639
Query headquarters.

793
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:11,940
Are you the 8th Route Army?

794
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:15,259
Yes. We're now called the People's Liberation Army

795
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:19,560
Have you come for the cow?

796
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,170
I don't understand.

797
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:27,840
"You were supposed to return in 10 days,
seven years ago."

798
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:29,980
Wait a minute.

799
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,500
She belongs to you.

800
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,460
We are the People's army.

801
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,340
We don't take from the people!

802
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:43,339
Hold on!

803
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,340
What is it?

804
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:54,179
This was written when the troops evacuated.

805
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,010
All the villagers died.
1 brought the cow to the mountains.

806
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,420
And there's this...

807
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:08,300
I don't know who wrote this.

808
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,170
My unit can't take this cow.

809
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:18,219
“Listen, I'll make a military decision."

810
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:20,850
The cow now belongs to you.

811
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:27,080
The cow... She's mine?

812
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,620
And the seal?

813
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:30,880
What kind of gun is this?

814
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:34,160
Your seal of agreement.

815
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:37,280
How about a fingerprint?

816
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,020
I'll give you my fingerprint.

817
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,679
How's that?

818
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:50,390
Let's go.

819
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:58,840
What now?

820
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,610
The cow and I...

821
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:10,110
We'll stay in the mountains.
We'll never go back down.

822
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,420
You... do me a favor.

823
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,490
Write something for me.

824
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:19,450
What?

825
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,580
Some characters...

826
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,500
“For a tombstone, on a grave."

827
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:31,980
“In memory of Niu "Er" (two)"

828
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,879
Which is which?

829
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,940
“In memory of Two "Niu" (Cow)"

830
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:19,220
It's the same.

831
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,900
Don't be afraid.

832
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,980
Everything will be alright.
