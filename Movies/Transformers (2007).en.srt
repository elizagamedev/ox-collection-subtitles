1
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,720
Before time began, there was the Cube.

2
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,580
We know not where it comes from,

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,190
only that it holds the power to
create worlds and fill them with life.

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,030
That is how our race was born.

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,550
For a time, we lived in harmony,

6
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,470
but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.

7
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,030
And so began the war,

8
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,690
a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,

9
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,760
and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,770
We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,

11
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,350
searching every star, every world.

12
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,380
And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,920
to an unknown planet called Earth.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,030
But we were already too late.

15
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,990
Oh, God, five months of this.

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,420
I can't wait to
get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,550
A plate of mama's alligators étouffée.

18
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,700
You've been talking about
barbecued ‘gators and crickets

19
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,709
for the last two weeks. I'm never
going to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

20
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,970
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,350
I understand.

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,850
English, please. English.

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,320
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,700
Why you got to ruin it
for me, man? That's my heritage.

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,690
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,170
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,120
-Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
-Perfect day.

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,960
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,989
I just can't wait to hold
my baby girl for the first time.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,590
-He's adorable.
-That's too...

31
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,780
Shut up!

32
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,530
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,859
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,960
Watch this crossover, baby.

36
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,869
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,859
-Step aside, ladies.
-Oh, man. What?

38
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,130
-Lennox!
-Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,690
-Water?
-Thank you.

40
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,429
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,090
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

42
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,950
Unidentified aircraft, you are in
restricted US military airspace.

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,910
Squawk ident and proceed
east out of the area.

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,520
Raptors one and two, snap to
heading two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,429
Bogie is in the weeds
ten miles out, not squawking.

46
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,419
Unidentified aircraft, we will
escort you to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,750
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,110
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,530
Tail 4500 X-ray.

50
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,020
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,940
-Afghanistan.
-That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,990
-Check again, then recheck.
-I did, sir.

53
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
A friend of mine
was on that chopper.

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,190
Unidentified aircraft, we will
escort you to US SOCCENT airbase.

55
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,460
-Radar, where's the inbound?
-Bogie's five miles out, sir.

56
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,670
-My wife on?
-Yes, Captain.

57
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,520
-My ladies!
-Look.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,510
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,470
Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.

60
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,409
Baby, we made a good-looking kid.

61
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,500
I know that
people say that all the time,

62
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.

63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,710
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,170
-She laughed?
-Her first one, yeah.

65
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,050
You sure she didn't just fart?

66
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,020
No, she's a lady.

67
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,420
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

68
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,660
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,200
Bogie's on the deck.

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

71
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,530
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,050
-Will?
-Sarah?

73
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,630
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

74
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,250
-To the right. Go to the right.
-Check fire.

75
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,969
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,140
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

77
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,469
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

78
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,580
My God.

79
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,729
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

80
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,840
Go! Move! Move!

81
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,230
It's going after the files!

82
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,680
Cut the hard lines!

83
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,570
I need a key! It's locked!

84
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,960
Move! Move!

85
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,270
Here, come here! Come here!

86
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,710
Here, hide in here!

87
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,810
Oh, my God. Okay.

88
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,510
No!

89
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,190
Oh!

90
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,340
What the...

91
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,620
Epps, let's go!

92
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,120
Okay, Mr Witwicky, you're up.

93
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,780
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

94
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,090
Watch.

95
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,270
Okay.

96
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,760
For my family...

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,720
Who did...Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

98
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,310
Okay.

99
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,170
So, for my family genealogy report,

100
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,070
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

101
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,290
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

102
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,949
Very famous explorer.

103
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,600
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

104
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,720
In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.

105
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,790
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

106
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,930
The ice is freezing faster
than it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

107
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,729
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

108
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

109
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,490
So that's the story, right?

110
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,700
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

111
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,620
used by 19th-century seamen.

112
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,770
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

113
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,160
It's all for sale, by the way.

114
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

115
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

116
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,800
l haven't quite gotten them appraised yet,
but they've seen many cool things.

117
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,090
Are you going to
sell me his liver?

118
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,650
Mr Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

119
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,980
I don't think
your grandfather would be

120
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,250
particularly proud of
what you're doing.

121
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,220
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

122
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,430
You can tell your folks.
It's on eBay. I take PayPal.

123
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,880
Cold hard cash works, too.

124
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,080
And the compass makes
a great gift for Columbus Day.

125
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,560
-Sam!
-Sorry.

126
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,390
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

127
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,750
the genius that he was, wound up going blind
and crazy in a psycho ward,

128
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,380
drawing these strange symbols

129
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,700
and babbling on
about some giant ice man

130
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,480
that he thought he'd discovered.

131
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,020
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

132
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,489
-Sleep in fear tonight.
-Here, you want? Here, 50. 407 307

133
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
-Sam?
-Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

134
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,370
Okay. Pretty good, right?

135
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,490
I'd say a solid B-.

136
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,300
AB-?

137
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,240
You were hawking your
great-grandfather's crap

138
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,540
-in my classroom.
-No, kids enjoy...

139
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,810
-Look, can you do me a favour?
-What?

140
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

141
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,730
-He's the guy in the green car.
-Yeah.

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,210
Okay, I wanna tell you
about a dream. A boy's dream.

143
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,110
And a man's promise to that boy.

144
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,790
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

145
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,130
"But I want you to bring me
$2,000 and three As."

146
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,300
Okay? I got the 2,000
and I got two As.

147
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,080
Okay? Here's the dream.
Your B-. Dream gone. Kaput.

148
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,770
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

149
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,720
Yes! Yes, yes.

150
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,230
So?

151
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,380
A-. It's an A, though.

152
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,110
Wait, wait, wait. l can't see. It's an A.

153
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
-So I'm good?
-You're good.

154
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,500
-I got a little surprise for you, son.
-What kind of...

155
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,880
Yeah, a little surprise.

156
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,130
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

157
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,780
-Oh, you got to be kidding me.
-See?

158
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,500
Yeah. l am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

159
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,740
-You think that's funny?
-Yeah, I think it's funny.

160
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,340
-What's wrong with you?
-You think I'd really get you

161
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,850
a Porsche for your first car?

162
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,100
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

163
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,420
-Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
-It's not a funny joke.

164
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,000
-Manny!
-What?

165
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,520
Get your cousin out
of that damn clown suit.

166
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,849
He's having a heat stroke again.

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,110
Scaring white folks.

168
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

169
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,890
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

170
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,610
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

171
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
When I was your age, I'd have been happy
with four wheels and an engine.

172
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,500
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

173
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,880
-You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
-Yeah.

174
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,750
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

175
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,710
-Okay.
-You want me to live that life?

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,860
-No sacrifice, no victory.
-Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

177
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,280
-The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
-Right.

178
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,430
Gentlemen.

179
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,790
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

180
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,230
How can I help you?

181
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,790
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

182
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,750
-You come to see me?
-I had to.

183
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,770
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

184
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,390
-Sam.
-Sam, let me talk to you.

185
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,900
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom awaits
underneath one of those hoods.

186
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,960
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

187
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,120
The car'll pick the driver.

188
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,790
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

189
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,660
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

190
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,910
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

191
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,640
Don't be like that. If 1 had a rock,
I'd bust your head, bitch.

192
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,830
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

193
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,810
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

194
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,710
This ain't bad.

195
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,830
-This one's got racing stripes.
-Yeah.

196
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,280
It got racing...

197
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,620
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

198
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,430
I don't know nothing about this car.

199
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,770
-Manny!
-What?

200
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,210
What is this? This car! Check it out!

201
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,700
I don't know, boss!
I've never seen it! That's loco!

202
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,220
Don't go Ricky Ricardo
on me, Manny! Find out!

203
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,900
Feels good.

204
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,280
-How much?
-Well,

205
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,870
considering the semi-classic
nature of the vehicle,

206
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,830
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

207
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,560
-Yeah, but the paint's faded.
-Yeah, but it's custom.

208
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,030
It's custom faded?

209
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,560
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

210
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,350
-Five grand.
-No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

211
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,410
Kid, come on, get out.
Get out the car.

212
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,010
No, no, no. You said
cars pick their drivers.

213
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,980
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

214
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,140
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

215
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,390
There's a Fiesta
with racing stripes over there.

216
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,930
No, I don't want
a Fiesta with racing stripes.

217
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,040
This is a classic engine right here.

218
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
I sold a car the other day...

219
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,790
Gee. Holy cow.

220
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,270
-No, no, no. No worries.
-You all right?

221
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,680
I'll get a sledgehammer and
knock this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

222
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,640
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

223
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,709
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

224
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,780
.. greater than man...

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,630
That one's my favourite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

226
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,189
$4,000.

227
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,580
Steve.

228
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,410
Hello, Mr Secretary.

229
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,890
They're so young.

230
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,980
They're the
top subject matter experts, sir.

231
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,250
NSA's recruiting right
out of high school these days.

232
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,440
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defence.

233
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,590
lam so underdressed.

234
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,439
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defence.

235
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
Please be seated.

236
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,880
I'm John Keller.

237
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,930
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

238
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,250
At 1900 local time yesterday,

239
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,260
the SOCCENT Forward Operations Base
in Qatar was attacked.

240
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,569
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

241
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,120
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

242
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,439
We're not sure exactly
what they're after,

243
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,630
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

244
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,380
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

245
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,770
Now, no one's taken
responsibility for the attack.

246
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,570
And the only real lead
we have so far is this sound.

247
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,650
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

248
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,950
NSA's working at
full capacity to analyse it

249
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,660
and intercept further communications,

250
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,310
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

251
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,270
Now, you've all shown considerable ability
in the area of signals analysis.

252
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,089
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

253
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,660
The President has
dispatched battle groups

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,550
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.

255
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,490
Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.

256
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,220
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

257
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,970
Good luck to us all.

258
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,069
All right, Mojo.
I got the car. Now I need the girl.

259
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,610
I need money to take out
the girl is what I need.

260
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,990
Zero bids.

261
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,480
Great. Broke.

262
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

263
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,159
No. Premature.

264
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,520
Good. What's up?

265
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,150
Nothing. You know,
just driving my car. Driving my car.

266
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,700
It's like clockwork.

267
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,290
All right, 1 know
you get wasted on these things,

268
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,159
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

269
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,560
That's it for today.
No more. Crackhead.

270
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,400
-Ron, this one is uneven.
-Yeah. Probably.

271
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,970
This one is wobbly.

272
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,680
-Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
-Couldn't we have hired a professional?

273
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,180
-Sam...
-What?

274
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,570
I do not like
footprints on my grass.

275
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,820
-What foot... There's no footprints.
-That's why I built my path.

276
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,600
So why don't you go from
my grass onto my path, okay?

277
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,700
-It's family grass, Dad.
-Well, when you own your own grass,

278
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,720
-you'll understand.
-This...I can't do it any more.

279
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,980
You're putting
girl jewellery on a boy dog.

280
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,070
What?

281
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,070
He's got enough
self-esteem issues as a Chihuahua, Mom.

282
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,630
That's his bling.

283
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,929
Il want you home at 11:00!

284
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,820
-Yeah, all right.
-11:00!

285
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,939
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

286
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,330
Seat belt on!

287
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,679
Wow. You are so cheap.

288
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,660
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

289
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,310
At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.

290
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,260
Oh, my God.

291
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,900
Our bases worldwide are,
as of now, at DEFCON Delta,

292
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,110
our highest readiness level.

293
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,070
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

294
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
that we have not come across before.

295
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,140
But our prayers are with the
families of the brave men and women...

296
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,000
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

297
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,450
I've never seen
a weapons system like this.

298
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,120
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

299
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,080
like it's cloaked by some
kind of invisible force field.

300
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,410
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

301
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,580
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

302
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,040
-Man, I don't know.
-What is that?

303
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,070
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

304
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,890
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

305
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,649
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

306
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,390
How about you
use those magic voodoo powers

307
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,050
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

308
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,970
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

309
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,080
It looked right at me.

310
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

311
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,470
They got to know
what we're dealing with here.

312
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
My radio's fried.

313
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,690
-1 got no communication with aerial.
-Hey, Mahfouz.

314
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,570
-How far do you live from here?
-Not far. Just up that mountain.

315
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,330
-Do they have a phone?
-Yes.

316
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,000
All right, let's hit it.

317
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,440
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

318
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,100
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

319
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,220
Oh, my God.

320
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,460
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

321
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,250
-I'm good, right?
-Yeah, you're good.

322
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,430
Okay.

323
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,550
Hey, guys, check it out.

324
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,140
Oh, hi.

325
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,840
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

326
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,990
So, what are you guys doing here?

327
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,490
We're here to climb this tree.

328
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,980
I see that. It looks...It looks fun.

329
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,540
-Yeah.
-You know,
I thought I recognised you.

330
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,330
You tried out for
the football team last year, right?

331
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,239
Let's go call your mom.

332
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,780
Oh, no, no, that...No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

333
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,639
l was researching a book
l was writing.

334
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,120
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

335
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

336
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,169
No, it's about the link
between brain damage and football.

337
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,570
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

338
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,590
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little colouring areas,

339
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,210
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

340
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,090
That's funny.

341
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,659
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

342
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,530
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

343
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,630
You got to get out of
the tree right now. Get...

344
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,170
Just get out of
the tree right now, please.

345
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,370
What are you doing?

346
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,350
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

347
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,750
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

348
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,889
-Hey, how about you let me drive?
-Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

349
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,850
These 22s,
I don't want you grinding them. No.

350
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,840
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

351
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,960
God, I can't even tell you
how much I'm not your little bunny.

352
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,790
Okay.

353
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,460
You'll call me.

354
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,210
Who's gonna
drive you home, tonight?

355
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,900
Hey, man,
what's wrong with your radio?

356
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,770
-I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
-What?

357
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,330
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

358
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,090
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

359
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,439
You got to be
understanding here, all right?

360
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,870
All right. We'll put her
in the back. I'll be quiet.

361
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,520
-Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
-I called shotgun.

362
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,310
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

363
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,760
-That's a party foul.
-What rules?

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,010
Bros before hos.

365
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,750
Miles, I'm begging you
to get out of my car. Okay?

366
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,950
You can't do this to me.

367
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,460
You got to
get out of my car right now.

368
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,670
Who's gonna
come around when you break?

369
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,580
Mikaela! It's Sam.

370
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,910
Witwicky.

371
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,200
I hope I didn't
get you stranded or anything.

372
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,460
You sure?

373
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,190
So, listen, 1 was wondering
if l could ride you home.

374
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,430
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

375
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,810
There you go.

376
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,710
So...

377
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,470
I can't believe that
I'm here right now.

378
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,370
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

379
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,480
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

380
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,220
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

381
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,450
‘Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

382
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,860
for tight abs and really big arms.

383
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,730
Big arms?

384
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,110
Well, there's a couple
new additions in the car.

385
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,620
Like, I just put in that light there.

386
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,810
And that disco ball. And so
the light reflects off the disco ball.

387
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,990
Yeah.

388
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,000
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

389
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,060
Oh, no, no.

390
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,969
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

391
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,360
-Really?
-Yeah.

392
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,040
Yeah, a long time.

393
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,889
Well, do we have
any classes together?

394
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,530
-Yeah, yeah.
-Really? Which?

395
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,750
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

396
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,320
-Sam.
-Sam. Yeah.

397
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,470
-Sam Wilkicky.
-Witwicky.

398
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,360
God, you know what?
I'm so sorry. I just...

399
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,080
-No, it's cool.
-I just didn't recognise you.

400
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,429
Yeah, well, 1 mean,
that's understandable.

401
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,230
No, no, no. No. Come on.

402
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,909
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

403
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,330
When I get that feeling
l want sexual healing

404
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,040
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

405
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,880
Sexual healing

406
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,050
Look, this isn't
something that I, you know...

407
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,930
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

408
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,389
‘Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

409
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

410
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,600
-No, of course not.
-I'm a friend of yours.

411
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

412
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,800
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we...1 could be.

413
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,530
I feel good

414
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,950
Just pop the hood.

415
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,230
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

416
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,970
Whoa, nice headers.

417
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,530
You've got a
high-rise double-pump carburetor.

418
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,830
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

419
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,250
Double-pump?

420
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,800
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

421
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,510
I like to go faster.

422
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,140
And it looks like your
distributor cap's a little loose.

423
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,200
Yeah? How'd you know that?

424
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,850
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

425
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,310
I could take it all apart,
clean it, put it back together.

426
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,590
That's weird. I just wouldn't
peg you for mechanical.

427
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,860
Oh, my God.

428
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,409
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

429
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,240
Guys don't like it when you
know more about cars than they do.

430
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,930
Especially not Trent.
He hates it.

431
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,740
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

432
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,490
I prefer it, actually.

433
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,240
-Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

434
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,459
-Thanks.
-You know, I was thinking.

435
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,710
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

436
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,490
You know what?
I'm just...I'm gonna walk.

437
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,280
Good luck with your car.

438
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,660
All right.

439
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,530
Walking's healthy, right?

440
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,730
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

441
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,290
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

442
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,030
Don't let her walk away.
Come on, come on, come on. Please, please.

443
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,250
Baby come back
any kind of fool could see

444
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,930
Hey!

445
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,370
There was something
in everything about you

446
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,620
Baby come back
you can blame it all on me

447
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,160
Hey!

448
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,200
Wait a second!

449
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,470
l was wrong and
I just can't live without you

450
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,730
There it is.

451
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,780
l had fun. So, you know,
thanks for listening.

452
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,270
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-You... You think I'm shallow?

453
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,520
I think you're...
No, no, no. I think...

454
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,899
I think there's a lot more than
meets the eye with you.

455
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,190
Okay.

456
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,980
Yeah.

457
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,340
All right, I'll see you at school.

458
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,630
All right.

459
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,660
That's stupid.

460
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,980
That was a stupid line.

461
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,590
"There's a lot more than
meets the eye with you." Stupid.

462
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,360
Oh, God.

463
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,210
Oh, my God. I love my car.

464
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,630
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Terrorists.

465
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,479
Come on, man. This is way
too smart for their scientists.

466
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,160
-Think about it.
-What do you think, kid?

467
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,780
No way. This is nothing like
what they are using.

468
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,260
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

469
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,310
We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,

470
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,500
we'll know
just what to do with them.

471
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,100
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

472
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,850
Apparently,
there are very few survivors.

473
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,129
Yes, Mr President?

474
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,850
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

475
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,280
I joined the Air Force to bring
the man Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

476
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,020
Shoot.

477
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,889
Gross.

478
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,560
Do you hear that?

479
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,889
Are you getting this?

480
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,000
I think
they're hacking the network again.

481
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,870
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

482
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,860
-Are you running a diagnostic?
-Should I be?

483
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,840
-Yes, you should.
-So lam.

484
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,670
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

485
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,340
We need a senior analyst.

486
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,179
-I think they're planting a virus.
-A virus?

487
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,650
-It's streaming right now.
-They are planting a virus

488
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,740
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

489
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,500
Code Red. We have a breach.

490
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,080
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

491
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,830
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

492
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,750
-You got to cut the hard lines.
-What?

493
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,630
-Whatever they want, they are getting it.
-Sir?

494
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,399
Permission to take down
the Defence Network.

495
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,169
-Cut all server hard lines now.
-Cut all server hard lines now.

496
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,750
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

497
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,390
What the...

498
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,830
Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.

499
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,590
Crew, prepare for emergency descent.

500
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,960
l want our President in that bunker.

501
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,690
And I don't want to discuss
a damn thing other till that becomes reality.

502
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,870
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

503
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,300
Air Force One is on the ground.

504
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,120
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

505
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,530
That's my car!

506
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,240
No!

507
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,340
No, no, no, no.

508
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,470
Dad, call the cops!

509
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,070
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

510
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,680
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

511
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,150
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

512
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,990
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

513
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,680
My father's the head of
the neighbourhood watch!

514
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,610
Oh, my God.

515
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,710
My name is Sam Witwicky.

516
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,290
Whoever finds this,
my car is alive, okay? You saw that?

517
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,159
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

518
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,560
and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.

519
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,600
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

520
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,170
Okay, that's not true.
It's mine and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

521
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,240
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

522
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,460
No! No! No! No!

523
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,239
Oh, my God.

524
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,090
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

525
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,500
Oh, my God.

526
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!
All right! Oh! No! No!

527
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,239
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

528
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,320
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

529
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,470
Listen, listen, listen.

530
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,000
-Good, you're here.
-Let me see your hands!

531
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,569
-No, no, no! It's not me!
-Let me see your hands.

532
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,440
-The guy's inside.
-Shut up! Walk towards the car.

533
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,110
Put your head on the hood.

534
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,350
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defence network,

535
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,900
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

536
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,680
-What did they get?
-We still don't know.

537
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,590
-Talk to me about the virus.
-It's a Spider-bot virus.

538
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,290
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

539
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,359
-Can we stop it?
-Every time we try an antivirus,

540
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,819
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus any more.

541
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,109
It's become the system.

542
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,020
Obviously the first phase of
a major attack against the US.

543
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,850
The number of countries with
this kind of capability

544
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,049
is very limited.

545
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,890
-I'm sorry, that's not correct.
-Excuse me, young lady.

546
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,210
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

547
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,100
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

548
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,070
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

549
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,110
-Her team.
-Sir, l was just trying to say,

550
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,770
they hacked your firewall
in 10 seconds.

551
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,410
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

552
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,270
would take 20 years to do that.

553
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,660
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

554
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,000
shows them doubling
its naval activity.

555
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,340
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

556
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,680
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

557
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,089
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

558
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,300
and start
considering quantum mechanics.

559
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,600
There is nothing
on Earth that complex.

560
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,100
What about an organism?
A living organism?

561
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,510
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

562
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,970
-And I know that that sounds crazy...
-That's enough. That's enough.

563
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,010
We have six floors of
analysts working on this thing.

564
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,360
Now, if you can find proof
to back up your theory,

565
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,859
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

566
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,540
on that brain-mouth thing, you're
gonna be off the team. You understand?

567
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,149
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear am being.

568
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
-It just stood up.
-It just stood up.

569
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,589
Wow. That's really neat.

570
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,799
Okay, chiefie.

571
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,670
Time to fill her up.
And no drippy-drippy.

572
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,640
What are you rolling?

573
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

574
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
-No, I'm not on any drugs.
-What's these?

575
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,629
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

576
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,370
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

577
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,850
-Those are my dog's pain pills.
-You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

578
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,120
What was that?

579
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,540
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

580
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,950
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

581
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,180
‘Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

582
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,920
Are you on drugs?

583
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,170
Let's hope this telephone line works.

584
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,940
Hey, heads up!

585
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,410
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

586
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,200
What the heck was that?

587
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
English, dude. English.

588
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,260
Whoa!

589
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,300
Watch out!

590
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,580
-Open fire!
-Contact! Contact!

591
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,870
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

592
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,870
Whoa, mother...What the hell is...

593
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,870
Get up! Get up! Come on!

594
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,540
Go! Move it!

595
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,300
Take cover!

596
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,520
Fig! Cover the rear!

597
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,500
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

598
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,720
Come on! Give me a mag!

599
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,609
Where's your papa? Where's your papa?

600
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,820
Papa!

601
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,450
Sir, we need...I need a telephone.

602
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
-Telephone, telephone, yes!
-Telephone!

603
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,529
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

604
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,880
-Cell phone!
-I don't know how to thank you.

605
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,029
Fire!

606
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,370
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to...Do you understand?

607
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,900
It's an emergency Pentagon...

608
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,780
I don't have a credit card!

609
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,630
Sir, the attitude is not going to
speed things up any bit at all.

610
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,440
I'm going to ask you to
speak into the mouthpiece very clearly.

611
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,460
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

612
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,359
Ammo!

613
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,860
I need a credit card!

614
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,350
-Epps! Where's your wallet?
-Pocket!

615
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,600
-Which pocket?
-My back pocket!

616
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,550
-You got 10 back pockets!
-Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

617
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,660
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

618
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,680
Okay, it's Visa.

619
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,200
Also, sir, have you heard about

620
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,230
.
our premium
plus world-service gold package?

621
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,910
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!

622
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,440
Give me a status.

623
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,130
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

624
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,960
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

625
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,149
Survivors?

626
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,280
l ain't never seen this in my life!

627
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,029
Need gunships on station ASAP!

628
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,330
Predator's coming up in a minute.

629
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,750
We're linking the call
to the nearest AWACS.

630
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,450
Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...

631
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,330
Predator ETA two minutes.

632
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,690
Hey! Make way!

633
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,310
-What is that?
-I don't know.

634
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,069
We need air support
and we need it now.

635
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,960
Roll in strike package
Bravo on unknown target.

636
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,450
l authenticate Tango Whiskey
at time 0300 Zulu.

637
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,380
Attention, all aircraft.
This will be a danger close-fire mission.

638
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,100
Weapons, I just got a call
from Falcon Ops.

639
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,800
Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha?

640
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,380
-Send the Hogs, sir.
-Okay, send the Hogs over

641
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,080
to Kill Box One Alpha.
It's a danger close...

642
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,530
Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha,
300 feet danger close.

643
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,530
Friendlies in the area.

644
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,400
Seven-man team north of orange smoke!

645
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,580
Received Kill Box One Alpha. Engage hostile.

646
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,970
Attack direction west!
You're clear and hot!

647
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,590
Strike, tell me status
of Hog right now.

648
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,420
Hog One-One Dark Star status.

649
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,510
-Lennox! The heat's coming!
-Laze the target!

650
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,130
We got a beam-rider incoming! Laze target!

651
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,690
-Ready! Heat's coming!
-What? Bring it!

652
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,290
Receiving radar jamming in vicinity of target.

653
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,779
No frigging way
that thing's still not down.

654
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,850
Spooky Three Two,
use 105 shells. Bring the rain.

655
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,230
Be advised, ground team
is requesting 105 sabot rounds.

656
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,629
Did we lose them?

657
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,010
Warthog One confirm visual on friendlies.

658
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,220
Where's Fig?

659
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,609
-Fig? Fig?
-Oh, God!

660
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,220
-God damn it!
-Get a medic!

661
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,460
Get a medic!

662
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,629
-I'm sorry.
-Black Hawk...

663
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,850
We'll get a medic.
Just hold on. He's got a pulse.

664
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,660
We need a medevac. One man down.
Patient care category urgent.

665
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,830
Bring them home.

666
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,350
You get those men stateside right now.

667
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,450
I want them debriefed in 10 hours.

668
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,080
There's only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.

669
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,760
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!

670
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,480
lam sorry to bother you.

671
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,360
-Maggie?
-Listen, ! need your help.

672
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,009
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.

673
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,000
-Listen to me.
-Glen! Who is it?

674
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,070
Shut up, Grandma!

675
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,470
-What are you doing here?
-Just give me a break, will you, please?

676
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,630
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

677
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,740
-What level are you on, man?
-Six.

678
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,000
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

679
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,150
Glen, seriously, don't you want
to see something classified?

680
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,140
Yeah. Get low.

681
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,970
-Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
-Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

682
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,100
Hey. I need a moment.

683
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,399
-Please.
-Sorry.

684
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,440
Hey, man, save my game.

685
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,299
How classified?

686
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,200
Like "I will go to jail for the rest
of my life for showing you" classified.

687
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,600
Yes! One quick peek.

688
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,259
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

689
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,859
-l want to see it.
-Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

690
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,569
The rangers are en route with the imager,

691
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,450
but we also have a security issue.

692
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,690
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

693
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,480
of the network intrusion signal.

694
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,330
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

695
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,760
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

696
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,450
in less than a minute.

697
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,580
-No way.
-Yeah.

698
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,959
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

699
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,730
"Project Iceman"?

700
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,880
-What's Sector Seven?
-Who is Captain Witwicky?

701
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,720
Are you playing
those video games again?

702
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,839
Cops! Cops!

703
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,480
FBI! Clear right!

704
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,300
Lock it down! Lock it down!

705
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,069
Cops!

706
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,340
Lock it down.

707
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,540
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

708
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,010
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

709
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,890
Especially police!

710
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,990
It was an
awesome spectacle here an hour ago

711
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,660
when over 40 C-17s
lifted off of this very base.

712
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,439
We're not told where they're going.

713
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,670
Morning, Mo.

714
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,770
The government has been very quiet
about what's going on but in our...

715
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,520
-Mojo. Mojo.
-They were headed directly

716
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,100
towards secret targets.

717
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,780
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

718
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,070
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

719
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,920
-My car, it stole itself, okay?
-What are you talking about, man?

720
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,820
Satan's Camaro.
In my yard. It's stalking me.

721
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,589
Stop!

722
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,270
No, no, no, no, no, no.

723
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,660
Oh, my God!

724
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,500
Sam?

725
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,390
Hi.

726
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,490
That was...That was really awesome.

727
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,710
-Well, it felt awesome.
-Are you okay?

728
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,759
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

729
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,660
I'm getting chased by my car
tight now. I got to go.

730
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,850
You know what? I'm gonna
catch up with you guys later.

731
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,009
Oh, great. Cops.

732
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,090
Officer!

733
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,270
Listen!

734
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,790
Oh, that hurt.

735
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,780
Listen to me!

736
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,460
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!

737
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,000
I've been...I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?

738
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,690
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!

739
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:00,560
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

740
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,390
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

741
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,420
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

742
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,230
Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?

743
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,950
Okay.

744
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,660
Oh, God, no! No!

745
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,279
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

746
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,310
It's a bad dream.

747
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,790
Are you username LadiesMan217?

748
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,090
I don't know
what you're talking about!

749
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,320
Are you username LadiesMan217?

750
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,660
Yeah.

751
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,910
Where is eBay item 211537

752
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,750
Where are the glasses?

753
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,120
Get back!

754
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,990
Stop!

755
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,950
God!

756
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,350
What is your problem, Sam?

757
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,319
Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

758
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,400
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

759
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,149
Sam, what is that thing?

760
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,520
-You have to get in the car. Get in.
-I don't want to.

761
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,550
-Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
-Sam.

762
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,570
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

763
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,319
Go, go, go, go!

764
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,420
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

765
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,049
No, we're not.
No, we're not gonna die.

766
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,280
-Oh, my God!
-Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

767
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,310
Oh, my God! No!

768
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,680
We're gonna die!

769
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,790
Oh, my God!

770
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,580
We're locked in.

771
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,029
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

772
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,020
Okay.

773
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,900
Time to start.

774
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,880
He's got me! Oh, God!

775
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,890
He's going to kill me!

776
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,520
No. No, no, no!

777
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,690
Get off!

778
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,750
Kill it! Kill it!

779
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,290
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

780
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,680
Not so tough without a head, are you?

781
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,870
Here, come on.

782
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,500
What is it?

783
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,230
It's a robot.

784
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,839
But like a...

785
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,060
Like a different... You know,
like a super-advanced robot.

786
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,990
It's probably Japanese.

787
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,270
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

788
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,549
What are you doing?

789
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,020
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

790
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,410
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

791
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,640
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

792
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,020
-I think it wants something from me.
-What?

793
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,620
Well, 'cause the other one
was talking about my eBay page.

794
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,069
You are the strangest boy
l have ever met.

795
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,700
-Can you talk?
-XM Satellite Radio...

796
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,060
Digital cable brings you...
Columbia Broadcasting System...

797
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,070
So you...
You talk through the radio?

798
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,820
Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.

799
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,919
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

800
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,500
Message from Starfleet, Captain...

801
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,510
Throughout the
inanimate vastness of space...

802
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,490
Angels will rain down like visitors
from heaven! Hallelujah!

803
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,620
Visitors from heaven? What...

804
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,750
What are you, like,
an alien or something?

805
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,700
Any more questions you want to ask?

806
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,460
He wants us to get in the car.

807
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,940
And go where?

808
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,550
Fifty years from now, when you're
looking back at your life,

809
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,470
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

810
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,549
This car's a pretty good driver.

811
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,820
I know.

812
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,200
Why don't you go sit
in that seat, there?

813
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,380
I'm not going to sit
in that seat. He's driving.

814
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,629
Yeah.

815
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,340
You're right.

816
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,490
-Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
-Why?

817
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,150
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

818
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,750
-Yeah, all right.
-Right?

819
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,330
-Yeah.
-Okay.

820
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,560
There, see? That's better.

821
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,270
-Okay.
-Okay.

822
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,840
You know, that seat belt thing
was a pretty smooth move.

823
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,109
Thank you.

824
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,980
You know what I don't understand?

825
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,920
Why, if he's supposed to be,
like, this super-advanced robot,

826
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,570
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

827
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,359
Whoa! Whoa!

828
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,920
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

829
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,230
Move it, you moron!

830
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,190
Great, now...See?

831
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,700
Fantastic.

832
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,530
Now you pissed him off.

833
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,260
That car is sensitive.

834
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,380
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

835
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,180
What?

836
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,600
This is you...

837
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,290
Oh, my God!

838
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,880
Come on, let's go.

839
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,500
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

840
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,870
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!

841
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,260
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

842
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,320
Whoa! Sweet!

843
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,390
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's
got asteroid insurance,

844
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,799
‘cause he is so boned!

845
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,839
What is that?

846
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,850
There's something in the tree, dude.

847
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,910
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

848
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,399
Could you guys
just give me a space rock?

849
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,620
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

850
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,920
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

851
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,500
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

852
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,100
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

853
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,190
They know your name.

854
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,109
Yeah.

855
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,350
My name is Optimus Prime.

856
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,160
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

857
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,600
-But you can call us Autobots for short.
-Autobots.

858
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,620
-What's cracking, little bitches?
-My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

859
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,300
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

860
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,819
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

861
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,170
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

862
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,100
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

863
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,290
-You feeling lucky, punk?
-Easy, Ironhide.

864
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,540
Just kidding. I just wanted
to show him my cannons.

865
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,900
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

866
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,750
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

867
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,330
You already
know your guardian, Bumblebee.

868
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,360
Bumblebee, right?

869
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,080
Check on the rep Yep, second to none

870
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,360
So you're my guardian, huh?

871
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,140
His vocal processors were damaged in battle.
I'm still working on them.

872
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,520
Why are you here?

873
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,180
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

874
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,340
Mega-what?

875
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:54,420
Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,

876
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,150
until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.

877
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,530
All who defied them were destroyed.

878
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,160
Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.

879
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,850
Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.

880
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,109
My grandfather.

881
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,950
It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.

882
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,810
Come back!

883
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,610
I think the dogs have found something.

884
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,430
The ice is cracking!

885
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,160
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

886
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,919
I'm all right, lads!

887
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,490
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

888
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:06,160
Megatron crash-landed before
he could retrieve the Cube.

889
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,109
Men! We've made a discovery!

890
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,319
He accidentally activated his
navigation system.

891
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:35,790
The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.

892
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,279
How'd you know about his glasses?

893
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,490
-eBay.
-eBay.

894
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,510
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

895
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,920
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

896
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,560
And the human race will be extinguished.

897
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:57,640
Sam Witwicky, you hold
the key to Earth's survival.

898
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,640
Please tell me that
you have those glasses.

899
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,870
It's like a
self-regenerating molecular armour.

900
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,080
Look at the scorch mark
here the sabot round hit.

901
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,450
Melted right through.

902
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,419
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for,
like, a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

903
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,770
Close to it. It melts tank armour.

904
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,980
So this metal skin
must react to extreme heat.

905
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,279
-Heads up!
-Oh!

906
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,480
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

907
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,319
Strap it down!
Strap it! This thing is wicked.

908
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,000
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

909
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,129
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

910
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,670
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

911
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,360
You want that piece?

912
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,450
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break it down
to you how it's gonna happen.

913
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,670
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

914
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,810
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

915
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,450
See, they put the plate of doughnuts
out here to test your guilt.

916
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,940
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

917
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,550
l ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

918
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,090
It's me and you.

919
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,710
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

920
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,080
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

921
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,890
l was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

922
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,770
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

923
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,020
-And then...
-Glen, you freak.

924
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,100
Hey! 1 am not going to jail
for you or anybody else!

925
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,340
l have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

926
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,870
Okay, so what?

927
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,870
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

928
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,640
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

929
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,830
-I promise!
-Glen, shut up!

930
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,270
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

931
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,620
-Oh, sugar rush.
-This is... This is not his fault.

932
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,290
See? So can I go home now?

933
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,450
-Oh, okay. I won't.
-But just listen to me.

934
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,960
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

935
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,440
It was something
about someone named Witwicky

936
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,850
and some government group,
tight? Named Sector Seven.

937
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,830
You have to let me talk
to Defence Secretary Keller

938
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,049
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

939
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,820
Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...

940
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,609
-What did he say?
-What?

941
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,110
-Did he hear it, too?
-Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

942
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,530
-What does he think it is?
-He thinks it's a military experiment.

943
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,110
-What a knucklehead.
-Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

944
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,980
Still no official word
as to what happened. You can see...

945
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,290
-Yeah!
-Call Sam.

946
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,850
-Yeah. Why?
-He should be home in 15 minutes.

947
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,240
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

948
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,620
If you wait 15 minutes,
he'll be late and you'll have to ground him.

949
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,400
Well, l can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

950
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,830
I need you to stay here, all right?

951
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:36,990
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

952
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,109
-Okay, okay.
-All of them.

953
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,190
-Do you hear what I'm saying?
-Yeah, okay, okay.

954
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,310
Five minutes, all right?

955
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,490
-Thanks for staying on my path.
-Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

956
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,600
The...Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

957
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,320
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
tight now. How about that?

958
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,529
-You know, I buy half your car...
-Yeah.

959
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,000
..then I bail you out of jail
and then I just decided to do all your chores.

960
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,850
-The chores.
-Yeah. Life is great, huh?

961
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,540
Life...Life is fantastic,
is how good it is.

962
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,130
It's so...Oh, the trash cans. Sorry,
Dad. I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

963
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,460
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

964
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,910
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

965
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,420
-I'll do it.
-It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

966
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,839
-You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
-I promise...

967
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,130
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

968
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,970
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

969
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,540
and I'm gonna...I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

970
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,080
-Tonight, right now?
-Right now.

971
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,350
The...

972
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,339
I love you. God, I love you

973
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,189
just so much right now.

974
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,710
You know, Mom wanted me to ground you.

975
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,260
-You're three minutes late.
-Right?

976
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,100
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

977
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,560
because you're such a swell guy.

978
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,780
One more thing, huh?

979
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,600
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

980
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,900
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

981
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,930
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the...Please, please, please.

982
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,820
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

983
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,310
-Sorry. My bad.
-Oh, I... You couldn't...

984
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,359
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

985
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,069
I told you to just stay!
Just stay! God!

986
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,200
-I told you to watch them. I told you.
-Okay, you know what?

987
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,930
-They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
-Oh, this is bad. No!

988
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,630
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

989
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,610
-Oh, wet.
-No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

990
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,350
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

991
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,110
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

992
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,050
-Put the...Put them away. Please.
-You have a rodent infestation.

993
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,490
-A what?
-Shall 1 terminate?

994
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,580
No, no, no, no. He's not a rodent,
he's a Chihuahua.

995
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,620
This is my...This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

996
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,359
He's leaked lubricants
all over my foot.

997
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,630
-He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
-Bad Mojo!

998
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,460
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

999
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,050
That's all it is.

1000
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,710
-My foot's gonna rust.
-All right.

1001
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,189
Okay, okay.

1002
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,729
-Shut up and go hide!
-Just hurry.

1003
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,410
Autobots, recon.

1004
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,649
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1005
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,510
Got some ice on his nose.

1006
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,870
l had to slap him around a little bit.

1007
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,399
You did not.

1008
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,480
-You didn't even ground him.
-Almost, almost.

1009
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,690
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1010
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,359
Come on, come on.

1011
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,790
-What? What is this?
-Time is short.

1012
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,410
-They really want those glasses.
-Come on. What are you doing?

1013
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,240
-I'm gonna help you.
-Okay.

1014
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,200
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

1015
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,440
-Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
-What do you mean?

1016
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,630
My glasses were in the bag.

1017
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,420
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1018
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,050
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1019
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:26,229
So what I think you should do is you should...

1020
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:28,299
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1021
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,130
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1022
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,590
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1023
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,080
-Sorry. That's nothing.
-You just...

1024
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:36,259
-You just told me to look...
-I know,

1025
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:37,639
but I didn't mean to look
inside of my treasure chest.

1026
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,160
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1027
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,210
I'm already stressed out enough.

1028
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,780
Okay. What now?

1029
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:49,149
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1030
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,870
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1031
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:54,379
Oh, God. Oh!

1032
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,110
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
tight here and now it's gone.

1033
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,640
My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?

1034
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,750
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1035
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,530
-He's back here.
-I can't deal with this. I can't...

1036
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,330
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1037
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,510
-This is my mother's flower...
-Oops.

1038
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,770
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1039
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,680
If my parents come out here and see you,
they're gonna freak out.

1040
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,260
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1041
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,850
We must have the glasses.

1042
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,450
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1043
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,610
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1044
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:20,900
Keep searching.

1045
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,519
I need you to be quiet
for five minutes.

1046
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,850
Ten minutes. Okay?

1047
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,590
Please, I'm begging you.
You got to... You're making a racket.

1048
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,560
I can't concentrate.
you want me to look and I'm hearing...

1049
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,790
Calm down, calm down.

1050
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,440
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1051
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,970
-Autobots, fall back.
-Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1052
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,870
Good? Good? Okay.

1053
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,240
-Move!
-Get away!

1054
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,919
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1055
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,809
He wants us to be quiet.

1056
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,910
Earthquake! Move, move, move,
move, move! Earthquake!

1057
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,700
Judy! Judy, get under the table!
Move it! Duck and cover right now!

1058
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,820
How did you
get over there so fast?

1059
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,550
Wow! That was tingly!

1060
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,780
-You got to try that!
-Yeah, that looks fun.

1061
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,480
-Sam?
-Sammy?

1062
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,280
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know.

1063
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,870
-Sam?
-That's weird.

1064
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,630
-Sam!
-Ratchet, point the light.

1065
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,090
-Come on, hurry.
-Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1066
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,389
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1067
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,210
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1068
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,500
-Shut it off.
-Sam, are you in there?

1069
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,630
How come the door's locked?

1070
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,930
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1071
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,450
You know he'll start counting

1072
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,760
-if you don't open the door!
-One more chance. Five...

1073
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,940
Oh, dear.

1074
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,630
-Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
-He's counting!

1075
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,040
-Sam, just open the door.
-Three.

1076
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,190
-Oh, my.
-Two.

1077
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,150
-He's counting.
-Stand back.

1078
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,960
-What's up? What's with the bat?
-Who were you talking to?

1079
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,009
-I'm talking to you.
-Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1080
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,809
I'm a child.
You know, I'm a teenager.

1081
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,970
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1082
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,900
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1083
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,740
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1084
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,300
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1085
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,640
-Maybe it bounced...
-There was light under the door.

1086
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,600
Look, you can't... You can't
just bounce into my room like that.

1087
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,080
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1088
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,230
-We knocked for five minutes.
-I'm a teenager.

1089
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,599
-We knocked.
-You didn't knock.

1090
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,070
-You were screaming at me, okay?
-No.

1091
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,549
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1092
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,800
-You're ruining my youth, okay?
-Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1093
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,950
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1094
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,059
-Judy.
-Was l...

1095
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,190
-No, Mom.
-Zip it, okay?

1096
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,519
-It's okay.
-No, I don't masturbate!

1097
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,670
That's not something
for you to bring up.

1098
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,180
-That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
-Father-son thing.

1099
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,830
I mean, you don't have to call it that word
if that makes you uncomfortable.

1100
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,330
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1101
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,380
-Happy time?
-...my special alone time...

1102
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,590
-Stop.
-Mom.

1103
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,710
-Judy, stop.
-...with myself.

1104
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,790
-Mom, you can't come in and...
-I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,960
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1106
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,040
-No, no, Dad.
-Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1107
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,870
Oh, parents.

1108
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,310
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1109
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,700
Earthquake! It's another one!
Another earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1110
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,340
-Okay!
-Aftershock! Aftershock!

1111
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,660
Oh, I hate these.

1112
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,960
-Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
-Quick, hide.

1113
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,070
-Hey, the lights are back on.
-Hide? What?

1114
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,610
-Where?
-Come on, get out of that tub.

1115
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,000
Can't you take safety seriously?

1116
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,010
-Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
-Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1117
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,940
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1118
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,099
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1119
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,740
Power pole's
sparking all over the place!

1120
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,010
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1121
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,799
Trashed. Gone.

1122
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,500
-It's a wash. The whole yard.
-You're kidding.

1123
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,480
The parents are very irritating.

1124
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,270
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Can I take them out?

1125
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,880
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1126
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,290
What is with you?

1127
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,330
Well, I'm just saying
we could. It's an option.

1128
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,240
We heard you talking to somebody, Sam.

1129
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,550
-We wanna know who.
-Mom, I told...

1130
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,430
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1131
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,290
I'm a...I'm a friend of Sam's.

1132
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,270
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1133
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,100
-She can hear you talking, Mom.
-Thank you.

1134
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,120
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1135
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,820
-Sorry that we're bugging you.
-Do you have my backpack?

1136
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,090
-Come on, hon. Let's go.
-Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1137
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,720
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1138
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,740
-Yeah.
-Your mom's so nice.

1139
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,019
l want you to distract my parents

1140
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,170
while I slip out and
get these glasses to them, okay?

1141
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,290
-Ronald Wickity?
-It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1142
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,400
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1143
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,540
-Never heard of it.
-Never will.

1144
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,020
Your son's the great-grandson of
Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1145
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,379
It's Witwicky.

1146
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,340
May I enter the premises, sir?

1147
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,150
Ron, there's guys
all over the front yard.

1148
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,500
What the heck is going on here?

1149
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,540
Your son filed a
stolen car report last night.

1150
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,810
We think it's involved
in a national security matter.

1151
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,349
-They're ripping up my rose bushes!
-National security?

1152
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,510
That's right. National security.

1153
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,090
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1154
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,360
There's guys in suits
all around the house! Look at this!

1155
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,260
Could you stay off the grass?

1156
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,790
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1157
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,410
They're pulling
bushes out of the ground!

1158
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,420
Good Lord! They've got to
get their hands off my bush!

1159
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,140
-Drop the bat, ma'am.
-Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1160
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,519
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1161
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,920
But you'd better
get those guys out of my garden

1162
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,980
or l am gonna beat
the crap out of them!

1163
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,880
Are you experiencing any flu-like symptoms?
Aching joints? Fever?

1164
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,070
-No!
-What is this?

1165
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,719
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

1166
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,380
-Yeah.
-Well, I need you to come with us.

1167
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,690
Whoa, way out of line.

1168
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,330
Sir, l am asking politely. Back off.

1169
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,490
-You're not taking my son.
-Really?

1170
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,710
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1171
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,930
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1172
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,050
because there's something
fishy going on around here.

1173
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,679
Yeah. There's something
a little fishy about you, your son,

1174
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,410
your little Taco Bell dog and
this whole operation you got going on here.

1175
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,850
-What operation?
-That is what we are gonna find out.

1176
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,370
I think direct contact.

1177
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,210
-Son?
-Yeah.

1178
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,849
-Step forward, please.
-Just stand?

1179
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,940
Fourteen rads.

1180
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,900
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1181
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,370
If you hurt my dog,
I'll kick your ass!

1182
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,120
Get me a sample
on that vegetation ASAP!

1183
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,730
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1184
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,580
-Yeah.
-Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1185
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,850
So,

1186
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,309
LadiesMan217.

1187
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,710
That is your eBay username, right?

1188
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,160
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1189
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,430
What do you make of this?

1190
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,740
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay? And my...

1191
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,059
Is that you?

1192
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,139
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1193
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,589
Last night at the station,
you told the officer your car transformed.

1194
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,400
-Enlighten me.
-Well, here's what I said, okay?

1195
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,520
‘Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1196
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,940
-Really?
-...from me, from my home,

1197
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,809
but it's fine now
because it's back! It came back!

1198
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,710
-Well, not by itself.
-Well, no.

1199
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,880
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1200
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,650
That's funny. That is so funny.

1201
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,020
So what do you kids
know about aliens, huh?

1202
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,790
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T. ? No.

1203
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,460
-It's an urban legend.
-Yeah.

1204
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,700
You see this?

1205
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,130
This is an l-can-do-whatever-l-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1206
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,840
-Right.
-I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1207
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,290
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1208
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,550
He's just pissy 'cause
he's got to get back to guarding the mall.

1209
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,520
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1210
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,750
Especially with
your daddy's parole coming up.

1211
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,269
What? Parole?

1212
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,360
-It's nothing.
-Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1213
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,520
You know those cars
my dad used to teach me to fix?

1214
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,310
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1215
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,540
You stole cars?

1216
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,200
Well, we couldn't
always afford a babysitter,

1217
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,019
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1218
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,250
She's got her
own juvie record to prove it!

1219
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,850
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1220
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,130
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1221
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,720
It is time to talk!

1222
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,669
Big! It's big!

1223
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,040
Go, go, go, go!

1224
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,890
-I can't see it! I can't see it!
-Shift your weight towards the front!

1225
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,509
All right! All right!

1226
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,600
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1227
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:21,470
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1228
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,549
Taking the children was a bad move.

1229
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,960
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1230
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,270
Freeze!

1231
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,269
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Give me those!

1232
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,430
Whoa!

1233
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,820
Whoa!

1234
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,400
Hi, there.

1235
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,840
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1236
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:03,220
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1237
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,480
I'm not authorised
to communicate with you

1238
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,610
except to tell you
Il can't communicate with you.

1239
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,170
-Get out of the car.
-All right.

1240
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,019
-Me? You want me to get...
-Now!

1241
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,500
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1242
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,640
All right, I'm...I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1243
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,070
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1244
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,860
You're good with handcuffs, too, now, huh?

1245
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:22,990
How you doing?

1246
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,670
-You weren't supposed to hear all that.
-How's it going, huh?

1247
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,780
-Yeah.
-This is real.

1248
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,790
Now, listen. If 1 choose to engage with him,
mum is the word, all right?

1249
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:33,429
Sam, I have a record because
I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1250
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,990
When have you had to sacrifice anything
in your perfect little life?

1251
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,360
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1252
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,060
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1253
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,620
I'm the one who asks questions around here.
Not you, young man!

1254
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,890
-How'd you know about the aliens?
-Where did you take my parents?

1255
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,920
-l am not at liberty to discuss it.
-No?

1256
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,820
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offence.

1257
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,590
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1258
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,300
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden,
with his big alien friend standing over there.

1259
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,420
-Where is Sector Seven?
-Wouldn't you like to know?

1260
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,660
Hey!

1261
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,340
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1262
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,480
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1263
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,850
-All right, tough guy, take it off.
-What are you talking about?

1264
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,599
-Your clothes, all of it, off.
-For what?

1265
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,620
For threatening my dad.

1266
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:29,780
Little lady, this is the
beginning of the end of your life.

1267
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,559
You're a criminal.

1268
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,750
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1269
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,870
Those are nice. Now get behind the pole.

1270
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,150
All right.

1271
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,150
This is such a felony,
what you're doing.

1272
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,929
-I will hunt you down, okay?
-He'll hunt you down.

1273
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,099
-Without any remorse!
-No remorse.

1274
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,519
-Enjoy.
-Okay?

1275
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,520
-We have got to alert everyone.
-They already know. Speaker.

1276
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,929
Optimus! Incoming!

1277
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,570
Roll out.

1278
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,160
Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.

1279
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,160
Okay, I'm getting really good rad readings.
Forty-two and higher.

1280
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,800
Up you get.

1281
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,120
Okay, we're dropping in.

1282
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,410
Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.

1283
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,620
Ship one and two, come on in.

1284
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,130
That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.

1285
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,290
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.

1286
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,490
I got it. 12:00.

1287
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,790
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1288
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,660
Got him going down the street.

1289
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,219
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?

1290
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,900
Okay, I lost him. I lost him.

1291
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,400
Okay, we're coming around.

1292
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,690
Easy, you two.

1293
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,580
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1294
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,120
Sam, don't! Sam, don't!
I'm slipping! I'm slipping!

1295
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,390
-Hold on!
-No!

1296
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,240
Sam!

1297
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,390
All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.

1298
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:12,920
I'm in for the shot.

1299
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,389
Stop! Stop!

1300
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,220
Wait! No!

1301
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,850
-Take the shot, get him.
-Take the shot.

1302
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,730
No!

1303
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,059
No! Stop!

1304
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,960
Stop!

1305
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,590
Get down on the ground!
Get down! Get down!

1306
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,080
What? Okay.

1307
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,860
Look, he's not fighting back!

1308
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,530
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1309
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,210
Stop hurting him!

1310
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,870
Don't let him move!

1311
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,090
I got him here!

1312
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,419
No!

1313
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,900
Happy to see me again?

1314
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,840
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1315
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,390
l want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1316
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,490
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1317
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,669
Optimus,

1318
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,140
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1319
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,640
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1320
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,550
-But it's not right. He...
-Let them leave.

1321
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,389
Foreign troops
are nearing our area of operations

1322
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,700
in the western Pacific.

1323
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,780
We feel like this could
get out of hand real fast.

1324
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,470
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1325
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,380
Our task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1326
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,920
of cruise missile range.

1327
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,180
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1328
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,330
-Yes, sir!
-Mr Secretary?

1329
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,120
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

1330
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,540
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy,
Tom. I think you can see that.

1331
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,020
-What's going on here?
-I don't know.

1332
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,040
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1333
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,469
-The whole room's gone down, sir.
-l can see that!

1334
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,280
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1335
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,590
-General?
-I'll take a seat.

1336
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,660
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1337
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,440
They used our network to
spread out to the whole world.

1338
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,820
The blackout's global.

1339
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,430
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1340
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,670
You mean to tell me that 1 cannot
pick up this telephone and call my family?

1341
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,530
Mr Secretary? I'm here
under direct order from the President.

1342
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,950
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1343
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,490
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1344
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,550
you won't understand right away.

1345
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,690
Sector Seven is a
special-access division of the government

1346
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,040
convened in secret
under President Hoover 80 years ago.

1347
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,719
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1348
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:15,860
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1349
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,830
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1350
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,810
This was classified above top secret.

1351
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,690
EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.

1352
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,330
More than just
a pile of Martian rocks.

1353
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,630
This is the image from Mars.

1354
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,990
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1355
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,910
from the base attack.

1356
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,470
We believe they are
of the same exoskeletal type,

1357
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,990
and obviously not human beings.

1358
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,960
Are we talking about an invasion?

1359
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,960
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1360
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,240
These things can be hurt
by our weapons and now they know it.

1361
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,190
That's why the virus shut us down,

1362
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,250
so we can't coordinate
against their next attack,

1363
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:15,550
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1364
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,760
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1365
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,000
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1366
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,290
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1367
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,290
And inform all commands
to prepare for imminent attack.

1368
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,170
Captain Lennox, we need you and your team
to come with us right now!

1369
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,550
Let's go!

1370
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,660
She's in here.

1371
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,599
What's going on?

1372
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,860
You're coming with me.

1373
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,759
-You're going to be my advisor.
-Me, too?

1374
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,160
Who's this?

1375
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,670
-He's my advisor.
-He comes, too.

1376
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,940
-So...
-What'd they get you for?

1377
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:22,860
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1378
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,349
Wow.

1379
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:25,980
Who knew?

1380
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,809
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1381
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,710
Please, let this work.

1382
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,969
Fire it up, Optimus.

1383
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,380
The code.

1384
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,210
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1385
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,790
Il sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1386
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,830
They must know it's here, as well.

1387
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,240
What about Bumblebee?

1388
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:20,919
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1389
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,889
He'll die in vain if
we don't accomplish our mission.

1390
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:29,019
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1391
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,090
Why are we fighting to save the humans?

1392
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,600
They're a primitive and violent race.

1393
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,920
Were we so different?

1394
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,690
They're a young species.
They have much to learn.

1395
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,670
But I've seen goodness in them.

1396
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:52,590
Freedom is the right
of all sentient beings.

1397
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:56,740
You all know
there's only one way to end this war.

1398
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,639
We must destroy the Cube.

1399
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:04,540
If all else fails,
I will unite it with the spark in my chest.

1400
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,320
That's suicide.

1401
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,750
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1402
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:14,070
A necessary sacrifice
to bring peace to this planet.

1403
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:17,490
We cannot let the humans
pay for our mistakes.

1404
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,559
It's been an honour
serving with you all.

1405
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:25,150
-Autobots, roll out!
-We rolling!

1406
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,820
Team attention! Present arms!

1407
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,420
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1408
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,440
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1409
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,510
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1410
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,920
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

1411
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,790
But it won't do us much good if
we can't get world communications back up.

1412
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,640
Hey, kid.

1413
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,040
I think we got off
to a bad start, huh?

1414
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:00,780
You must be hungry?

1415
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,720
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1416
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,410
Where's my car?

1417
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,700
Son, I need you to
listen to me very carefully.

1418
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,040
People can die here.

1419
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,880
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1420
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,290
Okay.

1421
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,680
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1422
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:22,170
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1423
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,809
Come with me. We'll talk about your car.

1424
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,320
Thank you.

1425
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,280
The man's an extortionist.

1426
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,360
All right, here's the situation.

1427
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,630
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1428
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,910
NBEs?

1429
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:41,170
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1430
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,770
What you're about to see is totally classified.

1431
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,540
Dear God. What is this?

1432
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,010
We think when he made his
approach over the north pole,

1433
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,389
our gravitational field
screwed up his telemetry.

1434
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:07,250
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1435
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,570
We shipped him here to this facility in 1934.

1436
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,070
We call him NBE One.

1437
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,440
Well, sir, 1 don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1438
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,830
but, 1 mean, that's Megatron.

1439
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,860
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1440
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:24,000
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1441
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,389
Your great-great-grandfather
made one of the greatest discoveries

1442
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,110
in the history of mankind.

1443
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,849
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1444
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:38,040
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight,
cars, all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1445
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:42,150
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1446
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,370
And you didn't think
the United States military might need to know

1447
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,760
that you're keeping a
hostile alien robot frozen in the basement?

1448
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,490
Until these events,
we had no credible threat to national security.

1449
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,650
Well, you got one now.

1450
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,790
-So why Earth?
-It's the All Spark.

1451
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,460
All Spark? What is that?

1452
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,890
Well, yeah, they came here looking for
some sort of cube-looking thing.

1453
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:05,320
Anyway, Mr NBE One here, AKA Megatron,
that's what they call him,

1454
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,990
who's pretty much the harbinger of death,
wants to use the Cube

1455
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,990
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1456
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,740
That's their plan.

1457
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,030
-And you're sure about that?
-Yeah.

1458
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,490
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1459
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,059
Follow me.

1460
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,820
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1461
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:39,690
Carbon dating puts
the Cube here around 10,000 BC.

1462
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,970
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1463
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:48,500
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1464
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,340
as well as NBE One.

1465
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,770
President Hoover had the dam built around it.

1466
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,190
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1467
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,370
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1468
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,890
or any alien species on the outside.

1469
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,709
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1470
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,900
-What kind exactly?
-Good question.

1471
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,940
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1472
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,360
Oh, wow.

1473
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:02,360
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1474
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,690
Oh, no, man.

1475
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:07,750
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1476
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,820
-Right? That's Wolverine!
-That's very funny.

1477
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,200
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1478
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,870
I got a phone.

1479
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,290
Nokias are real nasty.

1480
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:26,440
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1481
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,500
Nokia's from Finland.

1482
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,700
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1483
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:41,590
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1484
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,130
-Mean little sucker, huh?
-That thing is freaky!

1485
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,720
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1486
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,290
He's breaking the box.

1487
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,700
Go! Go! Go!

1488
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:33,860
Move!

1489
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,410
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1490
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,559
Banachek. What's going on?

1491
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,380
Well, the NBE One hangar has lost power...

1492
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,590
-What?
-...and the backup generator

1493
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,450
-is just not gonna cut it.
-Do you have an arms room?

1494
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,310
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1495
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,790
I'll bring security to the...

1496
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,180
Get everyone to the NBE One chamber now!

1497
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:04,930
-The lights are out!
-Move it! Move it!

1498
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,360
Let's go!

1499
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,110
They're popping our generators!

1500
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:20,990
Megatron melting!

1501
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,350
16502. We're losing pressure.

1502
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,660
Stand by! Set!

1503
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,750
We're losing pressure!

1504
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,990
The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!

1505
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,200
Forty millimetre sabot rounds on that table!

1506
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,010
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1507
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:51,010
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1508
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,269
He's gonna know what to do with the Cube.

1509
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,129
-Your car? It's confiscated.
-Then unconfiscate it.

1510
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:55,910
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1511
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,280
-You don't know.
-Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1512
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,680
You just wanna sit here
and wait and see what happens?

1513
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,600
l have people's lives
at stake here, young man.

1514
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,390
Take him to his car!

1515
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,290
Drop it.

1516
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,519
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1517
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,600
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1518
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,790
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1519
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:14,950
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1520
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,019
I'm ordering you under
S-Seven executive jurisdiction.

1521
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,370
S-Seven don't exist.

1522
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:20,110
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1523
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,139
-I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
-Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1524
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,400
-Simmons?
-Yes, sit?

1525
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,120
I'd do what he says.
Losing's really not an option for these guys.

1526
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,560
All right. Okay.

1527
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:41,810
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the world
on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1528
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,720
No, no!

1529
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,040
Stop! You got to stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1530
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:53,460
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1531
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,190
Are you okay?

1532
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,910
They didn't hurt you, right?

1533
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,750
Listen to me. The Cube is here and
the Decepticons are coming.

1534
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,269
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1535
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,490
They're not gonna hurt you.

1536
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,820
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1537
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:25,090
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1538
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,860
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1539
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,110
Okay, here we go.
He doing something. He doing something.

1540
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:11,960
Oh, my God.

1541
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:17,910
Message from Starfleet, Captain.

1542
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,349
Let's get to it.

1543
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,160
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1544
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,790
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1545
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,120
We're gonna sneak that Cube out of here

1546
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,440
and we're gonna hide it
somewhere in the city.

1547
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:27,620
Good! Right.

1548
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,160
But we cannot make
a stand without the Air Force.

1549
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,310
This place must have some
kind of radio link!

1550
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,220
-Yes. Shortwave, CB.
-Right, yes.

1551
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,730
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1552
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,349
In the alien archive, sir!

1553
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,280
-The alien...
-There's an old Army radio console.

1554
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:41,930
-Will it work?
-Anything's possible!

1555
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,230
-Did you see that...
-All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1556
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,110
Mr Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1557
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,799
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1558
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,730
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1559
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,370
Affirmative!

1560
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:54,870
Warning! NBE One cryo-containment failing.

1561
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,849
Check that backup system!

1562
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,670
The cryo's failing! You got to
bump up the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1563
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,540
Come on! Get out of here!

1564
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,100
Heads up! Look out!

1565
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,230
Set a perimeter
around the yellow vehicle!

1566
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:11,510
-This way, this way, this way!
-Up there! Let's go!

1567
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:23,830
lam Megatron!

1568
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,389
-The Cube's okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

1569
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:44,510
Well, put the seat belt on.

1570
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,700
Pour it on him!

1571
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,720
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1572
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:03,070
Where is the Cube?

1573
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,190
The humans have taken it.

1574
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:11,900
You fail me yet again,
Starscream. Get them!

1575
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,020
Come on, Mags!

1576
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,500
Over here, sir!

1577
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,670
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1578
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,070
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1579
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:28,110
-We're hot! We're live!
-Where are the mikes?

1580
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,299
Mikes?

1581
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:31,600
This doesn't work without mikes, Simmons.

1582
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1583
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,740
Let's find them.

1584
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,260
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

1585
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,340
-Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
-They steal everything out of this place.

1586
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:41,280
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1587
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:42,840
-Glen?
-Huh?

1588
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:46,030
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1589
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,390
What good is that?

1590
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,630
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1591
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,020
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

1592
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,060
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1593
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,860
There's Optimus.

1594
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:26,500
Almost done.

1595
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,049
What the hell was that?

1596
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,639
Barricade the door!

1597
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,469
-Get something.
-Watch out!

1598
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,590
Six, five, four, six, three.

1599
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,320
Here! Put some rounds in!

1600
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:52,549
Master search.

1601
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:55,280
I got it! We're transmitting!

1602
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:56,580
Send exactly what I say!

1603
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,280
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1604
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,250
"This is Defence Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1605
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,130
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

1606
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:08,790
What was that?

1607
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,420
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1608
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,620
Sir, have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1609
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,280
-No, no, no, no, no.
-What?

1610
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,510
It's the same cop! Block them,
block them, block them.

1611
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:06,150
Oh, my God.

1612
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,760
Cool, Mom!

1613
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,440
This is so not good.

1614
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:20,969
He's behind the pillar!

1615
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,430
-Shoot that mother...
-Maggie., cover fire!

1616
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:34,760
It's the Air Force!
They're responding!

1617
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,400
Sucker, burn!

1618
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,320
Oh, shit!

1619
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,480
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1620
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,590
Raptors, let's scramble, scramble, scramble.

1621
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,890
Strike and Dark Star roll call.

1622
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:59,620
Looking out the right side.

1623
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,500
Push to Kill Box One Alpha...

1624
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,020
-Come on, let's go! Mount up!
-Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1625
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,380
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1626
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,010
Wait. What am I supposed
to do with these?

1627
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,320
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1628
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:23,480
This is like RadioShack
dinosaur radios or something, man.

1629
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,410
I'm only gonna get 20 or
30 miles out of these things.

1630
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:29,120
Are there any aircraft
orbiting the city?

1631
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,370
F-22 at 12:00.

1632
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:33,920
All right, 1 want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1633
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,900
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1634
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,550
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1635
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,480
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1636
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:44,890
We have you visual.

1637
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:47,760
Green smoke is the mark.

1638
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,910
Provide air cover and
vector Black Hawks for extraction.

1639
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,440
It's Starscream!

1640
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,519
Please tell me you copy.

1641
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,960
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1642
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,560
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1643
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:10,550
-Back up! Back up!
-Retreat! Fall back!

1644
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,050
Incoming!

1645
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,780
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1646
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,309
Clear the area!

1647
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,340
Oh, my God.

1648
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:49,780
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1649
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,640
Your legs.

1650
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,370
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

1651
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:00,309
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1652
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,130
Ratchet!

1653
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,300
-What the hell was that?
-What are you talking about?

1654
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,210
What do you mean, what am I talking about?
They shot at us!

1655
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,520
F-22 pilots would
never fly below buildings.

1656
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,700
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1657
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,430
You got to get up.
You're okay. You're okay.

1658
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:17,830
Come on!

1659
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:19,860
Army Black Hawk
inbound to your location. Over.

1660
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,580
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1661
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,920
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1662
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:44,870
Move out! Let's go!

1663
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:52,630
Let's go! Move!

1664
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,559
I'm not gonna leave you.

1665
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,990
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1666
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:47,570
Oh, my God!

1667
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,410
Concentrate your fire!

1668
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,130
Come on. Come on.

1669
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:17,150
Megatron!

1670
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,960
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1671
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,839
Fall back!

1672
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,620
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1673
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,710
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1674
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,930
We need air cover down here now!

1675
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,150
Sam, help me with this.

1676
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:57,969
-That all you got, Megatron?
-Come here, little cretin.

1677
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:00,350
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1678
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,610
No! I want two!

1679
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,589
What's going on?

1680
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,690
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1681
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,730
Oh, these things just don't die.

1682
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,700
Oh, we're so dead.

1683
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,890
-Wrap it around the head.
-Sam!

1684
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:21,179
Where's the Cube?

1685
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:22,269
-Right there.
-Okay.

1686
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,389
And take that and wrap it around

1687
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:24,470
the base and then put it around his neck.

1688
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,930
-Okay?
-Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1689
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,820
That building.

1690
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,140
-Okay.
-What?

1691
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,929
All right, 1 can't leave my guys back there,
so here, take this flare.

1692
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,290
Okay, there's a tall,
white building with statues on top.

1693
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:42,500
-Go to the roof. Set the flare.
-No.

1694
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:44,490
-Signal the chopper and set the flare.
-No, no. I can't do this!

1695
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,520
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1696
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:51,010
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1697
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,110
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1698
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,740
-You got to go. You got to go.
-No, I'm not leaving.

1699
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,010
-You need to go. Go.
-No, I'm not leaving

1700
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:58,519
till l get Bumblebee
out of here, okay?

1701
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,139
Army Black Hawk requested.

1702
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,500
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1703
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:06,020
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1704
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,030
-Sam, we will protect you.
-Okay.

1705
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,720
-Epps, where are those planes?
-Sam!

1706
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:21,430
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

1707
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,250
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1708
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:30,380
-Decepticons, attack!
-Hit it!

1709
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:35,139
-Cover fire!
-Move to cover!

1710
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,640
Watch out!

1711
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:50,720
-Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
-I'm going! I'm going!

1712
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:52,599
Get out of here now!

1713
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:20,419
Megatron!

1714
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,660
Prime.

1715
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,270
Humans don't deserve to live.

1716
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,880
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1717
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:53,590
Then you will die with them!

1718
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,349
Join them in extinction!

1719
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,440
Keep moving, Sam!

1720
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,760
Don't stop!

1721
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,150
No!

1722
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,590
Sam, get to the building!

1723
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,219
Give me that Cube, boy!

1724
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,380
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1725
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:44,030
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1726
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:52,150
I smell you, boy!

1727
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:05,210
Maggot!

1728
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:24,930
Oh, no!

1729
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:50,220
I'll drive! You shoot!

1730
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:11,640
This isn't going well!

1731
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:13,070
Shoot! Shoot!

1732
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:58,240
Nice shot.

1733
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:01,389
-That tank is definitely dead now.
-All right, let's go! We got business!

1734
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:12,750
Hey!

1735
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:19,110
Hey! I'm over here!

1736
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:32,790
We've got the boy.

1737
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,589
Watch out!

1738
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:40,130
Missile!

1739
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:51,540
Hang on, Sam!

1740
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:01,200
No! No!

1741
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:11,080
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

1742
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:25,900
Where do I go?

1743
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:30,690
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1744
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:33,759
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1745
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,030
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1746
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,790
Oh, so unwise.

1747
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:55,860
I got you, boy.

1748
02:01:57,720 --> 02:01:59,260
Hold on to the Cube!

1749
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,780
-Oh, no. Oh, no!
-Disgusting.

1750
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:26,790
Sam?

1751
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:33,730
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1752
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,020
No sacrifice,

1753
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:40,110
-no victory.
-If cannot defeat Megatron,

1754
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:42,900
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1755
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:46,260
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1756
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:48,340
Get behind me.

1757
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:52,290
It's you and me, Megatron.

1758
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:55,170
No, it's just me, Prime.

1759
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:02,150
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1760
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:12,030
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1761
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:32,990
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1762
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:35,429
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1763
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:36,710
Hey.

1764
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:39,780
Bring the rain. All right?

1765
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,120
All right, let's kill these things.

1766
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,570
-Move, move, move!
-Remember, aim low.

1767
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,520
Armour's weak under the chest.

1768
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:58,730
Target marked. Still waiting.

1769
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,750
Time on target, 20 seconds.

1770
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:09,390
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1771
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:15,870
Move out!

1772
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:20,200
Incoming!

1773
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,310
Weapons armed. Status green.

1774
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,980
Run! Move!

1775
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,690
Second wave's on approach.

1776
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:03,570
What is that? Break off!

1777
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,940
-Copy.
-It's either a massive amount of...

1778
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:16,420
Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!

1779
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,280
Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.

1780
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:24,070
Take him out!

1781
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:38,960
Two's down!

1782
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,809
I'll kill you!

1783
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:52,470
Mine! All Spark!

1784
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:56,140
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1785
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:58,059
Sam!

1786
02:05:58,920 --> 02:05:59,970
No, Sam!

1787
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:25,850
Hold up.

1788
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:31,490
You left me no choice, brother.

1789
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,460
Sam, I owe you my life.

1790
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:46,350
We are in your debt.

1791
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:07,269
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1792
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:09,480
Jazz.

1793
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:14,570
We lost a great comrade

1794
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:17,690
but gained new ones.

1795
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:20,080
Thank you, all of you.

1796
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:22,680
You honour us with your bravery.

1797
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:25,600
Permission to speak, sir?

1798
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:28,740
Permission granted, old friend.

1799
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:30,420
You speak now?

1800
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,230
I wish to stay with the boy.

1801
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,860
If that is his choice.

1802
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:41,780
Yes.

1803
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:05,600
Gentlemen, the President
has ordered Sector Seven be terminated

1804
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:09,240
and the remains of
the dead aliens disposed of.

1805
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:12,970
The Laurentian Abyss
is seven miles below sea level,

1806
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:15,230
deepest place on our planet.

1807
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:18,660
The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,

1808
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:21,050
would crush and entomb them,

1809
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,470
leaving no evidence.

1810
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:34,760
With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.

1811
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:39,130
And fate has yielded its reward,

1812
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:43,370
a new world to call home.

1813
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:53,260
We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,

1814
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:56,190
but watching over them in secret,

1815
02:08:56,720 --> 02:08:58,930
waiting, protecting.

1816
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:03,120
l have witnessed
their capacity for courage.

1817
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:06,570
And though we are worlds apart,

1818
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,180
like us, there's more to
them than meets the eye.

1819
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:15,340
lam Optimus Prime

1820
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,840
and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots

1821
02:09:19,320 --> 02:09:21,880
taking refuge among the stars.

1822
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:24,670
We are here.

1823
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:27,150
We are waiting.

1824
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:50,120
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1825
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:58,230
Do you know what?
I think that if there was some sort of an alien

1826
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:01,049
-infestation...
-Yeah.

1827
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,670
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1828
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:05,440
The government would let us know.

1829
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:07,170
-l mean, this is America.
-Yeah.

1830
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:09,509
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

1831
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:11,250
because there's no secrets.

1832
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:13,310
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1833
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:25,970
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
