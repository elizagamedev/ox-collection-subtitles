00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,360
Hi, I'm Mark Osborne. One of
the directors on Kung Fu Panda.

2
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,370
I'm John Stevenson,
the other director on Kung Fu Panda.

3
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,869
And welcome to the commentary!

4
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,774
It's been a long four years.

5
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,872
We were really inspired by anime
in making this film,

6
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:36,172
so we wanted to start the film
not only as an homage to anime,

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,990
but we wanted to find a new way
to create a 2-D look

8
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,252
for Kung Fu.

9
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:47,144
And we're really,
really excited with what

10
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,443
Ramone and Jen came up with

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,590
for the look of this sequence.

12
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:55,839
Also, I like the idea of starting
a computer generated movie

13
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,026
with a traditional 2-D sequence.

14
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,874
We love traditional animation

15
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,813
and hope it comes back.

16
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,648
We particularly love it when
it's very stylized,

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,998
as it is in this dream sequence here.

18
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,811
We also thought it would be the perfect
way of showing the biggest contrast

19
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:20,322
between Po's dreamlife, where he's free
to do all these crazy, heroic things.

20
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,881
And contrast that when we go into
our computer-generated images

21
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,310
with his more gravity-based reality.

22
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,566
We should also talk about James Baxter,

23
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,202
who is the fantastic animator
behind this sequence.

24
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,629
We were lucky
to have him involved in this.

25
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,045
It was a combination
of wanting to be limited,

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,000
look like anime,
but we wanted fluid animation.

27
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,261
They came up with a great style
that was fluid,

28
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,748
at the same time had the
pose-to-pose limited quality of anime.

29
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,949
Also, we've got hugely vibrant,
saturated colors,

30
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,556
‘cause we're going to
make the contrast once we go to

31
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,573
what's reality in our film.

32
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,695
Where we're using computer graphics

33
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,298
of a more muted palette
when we first see Po.

34
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:11,881
It's really a Technicolor dream
that goes to a more subdued...

35
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,614
...color palette
when we go into reality.

36
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:22,225
It's worth pointing out
that this is the first CG movie

37
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,456
at DreamWorks to be shot
in CinemaScope.

38
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,180
So here we are coming up on the great
reveal that this has all been a dream.

39
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,321
So here we are coming up on the great
reveal that this has all been a dream.

40
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,590
And we find Po in the reality that

41
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,107
now he has weight.

42
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:39,482
And we get to meet Jack,
the real Po, for the first time.

43
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:43,607
We meet him in his environment,
it's very different, very quiet.

44
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,323
It was something we wanted
to show the contrast between

45
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,614
the dream life and the reality
as much as possible.

46
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,411
The other thing worth noting,

47
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,863
because it's a visual motif we will
be revisiting throughout the film,

48
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,396
our first real look at Po,
he's upside down.

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,490
Po being upside down
is something we'll see a few times.

50
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,756
I'll point them out, the each have
a particular significance to us.

51
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,844
Dan Wagner did a lot of this animation
we're seeing here.

52
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,857
He's really the master
of the Po animation

53
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,648
and established what Po
would look like early on.

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,340
The subtlety of his acting,

55
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,268
I think Dan did an incredible job

56
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,377
of establishing the sensitivity
of the character.

57
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,291
That shadow of Po's father,

58
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:30,793
we put that in the category of one of
our way-home type jokes.

59
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,905
- Nobody laughs at it.
- Nobody gets it.

60
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,043
Hey, can't win them all.

61
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,518
It's supposed to be a misdirect

62
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,924
that that shadow is
the shadow of a panda.

63
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,591
So, next time see if that works for you.

64
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,588
It certainly doesn't work
for most people the first time.

65
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,898
That's one of our failures, I think,

66
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,690
in trying to make an interesting reveal

67
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,574
that's Po's father is a goose.

68
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,109
Why? Why is Po's dad a goose?

69
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,343
A lot of people come out of screenings
asking that question.

70
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:06,589
For us, it was a hilarious thing that
one of our story artists came up with.

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,280
Alfred Gimeno, he always threw out
these big, wacky ideas.

72
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,998
At one point he had Po's dad as a goose,

73
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,344
it was hilarious, we loved it
and ran with it.

74
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,209
Originally, Po was working,

75
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,205
had a mean goose boss,

76
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,480
when he was working
as a short order cook.

77
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,676
Alfred said, "He's not his boss,
he's his dad."

78
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,706
He was a caring dad, putting his hat
on him, putting his apron on him.

79
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,673
We should make a big shout out right now
for Mr. James Hong,

80
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,250
who does an absolutely wonderful job
as Po's dad.

81
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,787
He brought a lot of warmth and heart

82
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,214
and comedy to Po's father,
who is a very simple character.

83
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,117
He has only got room in his head
for two things.

84
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,864
There are two things in the world he
loves, his son and noodles. That's it.

85
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,794
And he can't possibly imagine

86
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,162
why Po would ever want
to do anything other than noodles.

87
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,706
People say why doesn't Po tell his dad
about his love of kung fu?

88
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,827
It's because he doesn't want
to break his dad's heart.

89
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,430
In the early days of exploring this,
trying to figure out who Po was,

90
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,814
at one point he lived with his mom
down at the Bamboo Forest.

91
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,014
He worked at a chime factory.

92
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:15,775
He worked at a chime factory.

93
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,409
There used to be loads of other pandas
that lived in a panda village.

94
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,443
We tried everything
until we settled on this idea

95
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,816
that he works in his dad's noodle shop.

96
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,618
And it makes him the outcast,
.
In a sense,

97
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,668
there's no other pandas in the film.

98
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,623
This is our first glimpse of kung fu,
with the Furious Five attacking Shifu.

99
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,951
This was actually one of the last
kung fu sequences we did on the film.

100
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:42,408
At this point,
animation knew how to make

101
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,409
these characters do all the
cool things we see throughout the movie,

102
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,577
We wanted to start our introduction
of the world of kung fu

103
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,171
with a huge, explosive bang.

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,469
Have the Five attacking
this little old man.

105
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,371
It's also the first time that we show

106
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,385
how our camera work is different
for our kung fu scenes.

107
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,638
It's our rule, when we're just shooting
dialogue and character scenes,

108
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,756
the cameras are pretty restrained,
pretty formal.

109
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,982
When we go to our fight scenes, the
camera gets more active and dynamic.

110
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,156
It's a really important contrast,

111
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,605
to make sure you guys get
a rich experience.

112
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,605
Many ups and downs.

113
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,814
This is the first time
we're seeing Dustin Hoffman.

114
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:31,126
We wanted to give you the misdirect
that he's the wise, old master.

115
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,235
And then we reveal him to be the least
Zen Zen Master ever.

116
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,815
And we also have the amazing
Randall Duk Kim as Master Oogway.

117
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,758
We were very lucky to find him.

118
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,628
He has such warmth.

119
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,944
Every time we played
any sequence with Shifu and Oogway,

120
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,840
even Dustin was like,
"That guy's amazing."

121
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,956
We went for a very
abstract version of Tai Lung,

122
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,846
and processed the animation

123
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,322
so that it felt almost flat
and 2-D.

124
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,567
But, it's also the introduction
of our evil color.

125
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,103
We have a complex color theory
in the film.

126
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,413
Blue is our negative color, associated
with Tai Lung, he's a snow leopard.

127
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,615
That's the first very blue sequence.

128
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,728
And the petals that
are on the moon pool,

129
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,389
which will tie into Oogway's peach tree,

130
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,344
and it's also the introduction
of the circle motif.

131
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:40,633
And we elected to have,
basically, not a common villain,

132
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,224
but a scary, driven,

133
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,270
in his mind,
an emotionally justified villain.

134
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:51,714
But we were making the pact that
Walt Disney made with his audience,

135
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,389
for all the classic films, which is

136
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,842
there is going to be scary stuff
and dangerous stuff in this movie,

137
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,683
there is going to be scary stuff
and dangerous stuff in this movie,

138
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,532
but it's going to work out OK.

139
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,184
I was in the first
recording session with Jack.

140
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,423
He started to reveal his more insecure
and vulnerable side,

141
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,286
something that has been in
all of his performances,

142
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,439
to mitigate some of the abrasiveness.

143
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,748
But he really was
bringing that to the floor.

144
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,433
That was a huge gift
that he brought to the film.

145
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,430
And once we saw that, it really made Po
a much more appealing character.

146
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,731
A guy who was very self-aware,

147
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,666
who knew his limitations and...

148
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,596
And would often feel
very bad about them.

149
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,559
We went back and tried to retool
the whole film

150
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,967
to support that idea
which Jack had brought to us.

151
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,828
Then we have to shackle Po
to this noodle cart,

152
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,651
as much as he dreams about kung fu,
he just can't get away from this

153
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,929
noodle burden that his father
puts on him.

154
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,992
And we see how that plays out

155
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,764
at the bottom of the staircase
of 1,000 stairs.

156
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,841
That becomes a big, running gag
throughout the movie.

157
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,958
Po and stairs. People laugh.

158
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,579
Ours is probably the most stair-centric
movie we could think of,

159
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,473
we're always having Po

160
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,458
run up or fall down the stairs
throughout the film.

161
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,978
There's a reason for it in the end. But,
there's a lot of stairs in our movie.

162
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,952
In this gag, we wanted to be
as dramatic as possible

163
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:46,068
in setting up this whole
Po climbing up the stairs.

164
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,903
We wanted to make it in the hot sun,
like he's crawling across the desert.

165
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,413
Then we get this great reveal.

166
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,679
It was one of the earlier jokes that
we tried 1,000 different versions of,

167
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,667
and finally settled on this version.

168
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,966
Let's give a shout out
to the Shaw brothers,

169
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,306
Jack's Tenacious D brothers,

170
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,858
Kyle Gass and J.R. Reed.

171
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,065
J.R. Reed... it's amazing. We got all
of Tenacious D in our movie.

172
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,016
The Shaw brothers,
a tip of the hat, obviously,

173
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,316
to the legendary kung fu film studio

174
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,856
that came up with some of the greatest
martial arts movies ever made.

175
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,630
There's all these great mechanisms
the Furious Five are going to battle.

176
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,612
You see them just for a split second.

177
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,611
One of the earliest versions
of this sequence,

178
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,972
you saw the Five battling
these giant mechanical beasts,

179
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,433
you saw the Five battling
these giant mechanical beasts,

180
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,542
and all these really cool things.

181
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,154
Buy the game, you'll get to see
what they look like.

182
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:51,117
It was better, story-wise, to stay with
Po and to be trapped outside with Po

183
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,343
in the shadow of this great event
that's happening inside.

184
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,187
It gave us a much better stage

185
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,870
for the comedic beats

186
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,310
of Po struggling to get in,
to see that stuff.

187
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,392
There's a couple of lighting choices,

188
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,007
everything inside the auditorium

189
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,590
is lit with bright sunshine.

190
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,579
Po's outside and he's kept in shadows.

191
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,376
So he's away from his dream,

192
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,885
from everything he wants,

193
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,724
We also, unapologetically, decided this
was going to be a very broad

194
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,862
slapstick, Tex Avery, Chuck Jones

195
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,355
kind of sequence with those
kind of visual gags,

196
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,555
to establish that we could do that.

197
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,317
This is also one of the most
technically complex of our sequences.

198
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,790
There are so many crowd characters,

199
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,000
they're all wearing incredibly
complicated clothing.

200
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,449
We also have other effects.

201
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,771
The shots of the crowd

202
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,051
would take...

203
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,516
They would be
on the render farm for days.

204
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,340
Even when they're out of focus,
in the background,

205
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,179
they're just specks of color.

206
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,791
They still have to have
all their cloth, and everything proper.

207
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,662
And it's pretty frustrating.

208
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,209
Once we get all those details are right,

209
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,901
it really gives
a nice realistic setting.

210
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,787
I think this sequence
took 18 months to light.

211
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,130
It was incredibly difficult.

212
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,053
We the audience can't see what's
happening inside.

213
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,852
And we know it's really cool because
we've seen the Furious Five in a dream.

214
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,283
So these little glimpses
we get here are

215
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,339
supposed to tease the audience
as much as Po gets teased.

216
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,858
This sequence came up,
our story artists teamed up

217
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,513
and did a jam on this sequence.

218
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,852
We had every story artist
in our whole crew

219
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,898
working on coming up with ideas

220
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,600
of how we keep Po outside.

221
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,373
Because we wanted to riff on the idea

222
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,462
that he keeps trying crazier
and crazier things to get in.

223
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:00,218
And it was Phil Craven who brought up
the idea of using fireworks.

224
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,570
That Po would finally
strap fireworks to a chair.

225
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,050
And that's based on an urban legend,

226
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:13,876
a myth of a low level Chinese official

227
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,337
from the Ming Dynasty,

228
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,413
who tried to go to the moon

229
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,326
by strapping rockets to a chair.

230
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,545
So the legend goes, and disappeared.
He obviously blew up.

231
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,593
That was sort of a funny story
we thought would actually make sense

232
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,299
for Po to try and emulate

233
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,838
in his desperate attempt to try
and get in to see his heroes.

234
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,962
He's such a fan.
He's the ultimate fan boy.

235
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,518
And so this is an expression of
how much he cares about the Five.

236
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,865
How much he cares about kung fu.

237
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,973
He's willing to blow himself up
to get in there.

238
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,732
It's the thing he does that causes him

239
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,117
to get into the right spot.

240
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,721
He creates his own destiny
by being a fan.

241
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,294
Sometimes people say
"He landed by accident."

242
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,956
But, as Oogway says,
"There are no accidents."

243
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,271
Early in story, Po was going to land
directly on top of Tigress.

244
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,638
We wanted to make it clear
Oogway was choosing Tigress.

245
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,969
That pointing finger was landing on
Tigress when Po landed on her.

246
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,029
It was a little bit too much,
story-wise,

247
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,718
to have him land on her.

248
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,196
She's a kung fu master, she should be
able to have her wits about her.

249
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,053
It became better to have him land
directly in front.

250
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,699
It's something we tried
a few different ways.

251
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,707
But, it's one thing we didn't
clarify as much as possible.

252
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,527
That Tigress is Po's favorite.

253
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,646
Tigress’ fairly cold treatment of him,

254
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,826
is more painful, that was the idea.

255
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,965
All those scenes of celebration are
incredibly difficult and elaborate.

256
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:37,433
Sequences involving tons of effects.

257
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,877
But the effects crew
pulled it off beautifully.

258
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,040
I think when we first
suggested confetti,

259
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,717
everyone was like,
"Do we really need confetti?"

260
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,313
We were like, "Yes!"

261
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,778
We really need confetti.

262
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,341
Markus Manninen and Alex Parkinson

263
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,860
were hugely responsible

264
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,742
for handling all
the technical challenges,

265
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,968
from clothing to confetti
to all the difficult aspects.

266
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,974
We wouldn't have any of the cool stuff
without those guys.

267
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,882
So this is the first time
we get to hear Angelina Jolie,

268
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,902
in our film as Master Tigress.

269
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,358
And she really did an incredible job

270
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,364
of creating a very rich character.

271
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,239
We wanted to have really interesting
scene transitions.

272
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,195
We worked hard on finding creative ways
of getting from one scene to another.

273
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,186
We worked hard on finding creative ways
of getting from one scene to another.

274
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,156
This change of locale to Mongolia,

275
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,439
which is where the prison is set,

276
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,793
was very critical.

277
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,915
Again, it's the introduction

278
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,088
in the body of the story.

279
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,747
The blue presence of Tai Lung.

280
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,774
The whole scene

281
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,012
is lit primarily blue for Tai Lung.

282
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,336
With contrasting red,

283
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,285
which became our power color.

284
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,995
But it was very important to do
as many things as possible

285
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,522
to tell you that
you're in a different world.

286
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,237
No longer in the Valley of Peace,
which is sunny,

287
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,707
you were in a somewhat far away,
somewhat hostile...

288
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,668
We wanted to feel not only the threat,
and to feel like

289
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,827
he was this villain
that was kept far away,

290
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,821
but we needed to establish Tai Lung
as a ticking clock.

291
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,725
We needed to feel like he was as far
away from the Valley as possible because

292
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,365
we have all this story
that we need to tell of Po,

293
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,063
and that needs to happen
in the Valley of Peace.

294
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,060
We needed to have a psychological
separation between those two locations.

295
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,001
Another of our story artists,

296
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,196
Rob Koo, who came up with the idea
of taking the Great Wall of China

297
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,180
and wrapping it around the interior
of a hollowed out mountain.

298
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,775
So, those two visual ideas became

299
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,972
the basis for Chorh-Gom prison.

300
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,185
And "Chorh-Gom prison" means

301
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,581
"sitting in prison,” or"in prison."

302
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:13,595
So that's one of our little in jokes.

303
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,693
Commander Vachir,
which is a Mongolian name,

304
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,466
which means "thunder bolt,"

305
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,815
played by Michael Clarke Duncan, the man
with the biggest voice in the world.

306
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,917
A voice so deep you can rearrange your
internal organs as you listen to it.

307
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,833
We wanted somebody hugely powerful,
which Michael is.

308
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,762
Everything about it,
like the rhino commander,

309
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,957
his guards all had to be...

310
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,684
It takes 1,000 of these guys
to keep Tai Lung in place.

311
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:45,037
We should point out the armor he's
locked in was created by Rob Koo.

312
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,648
He came up with this
great idea that Oogway

313
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,724
designed this tortoise shell armor

314
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,639
that encased Tai Lung

315
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,615
and had acupressure,

316
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,710
these dragon-headed pins poking...

317
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,750
To screw up his chi flow.

318
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,259
And basically paralyze him

319
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,692
and keep him absolutely...

320
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,654
Plus, he's anchored to two huge rocks.

321
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,629
Apparently chained to his cuffs.

322
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,129
Something you'll see later
when he escapes.

323
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,056
This feather has been falling for quite
some time, gently floating down.

324
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,498
And then when we come back,
we contrast back to good times,

325
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,929
And then when we come back,
we contrast back to good times,

326
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,370
happy times.

327
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,896
A great moment to shout out
to John Powell and Hans Zimmer,

328
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,276
who did an amazing job with our score,

329
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,599
in helping us to create that contrast.

330
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,149
The contrasting feel
we wanted to get from the prison

331
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,099
back to the Valley of Peace.

332
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,754
We wanted to use all
the story-telling tools we could

333
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:51,144
to make sure we were getting
the contrast between

334
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,584
the darker moments in our movie
and the lighter moments.

335
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,021
This Yin and Yang balance
between aspects of the film.

336
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,867
John and Hans gave us

337
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,437
what we always
dreamed of having in this movie,

338
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,723
which was a great orchestral score.

339
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,709
We were trying to create

340
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,195
a self-contained universe
and a timeless story,

341
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,918
we didn't want to have
contemporary songs on the soundtrack.

342
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,109
We were very lucky that

343
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,421
Hans and John wanted to work together.

344
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,684
They gave us more score
than we could ever dream of.

345
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,587
It's a score we love deeply.

346
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,133
It has many very beautiful cues.

347
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,694
I'll just say this sequence
is very special to me.

348
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,453
We took inspiration from...

349
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,366
l was up at the Skywalker Ranch once.

350
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,850
A friend of a friend got me in,
I'm a huge Star Wars geek,

351
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,633
and I was creeping around
inside the main house,

352
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,706
and looking at all the artifacts:

353
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,072
The lightsaber, Indy's hat.

354
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,998
l remember being terrified that at any
moment someone was going to come in,

355
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,935
"What are you doing?
You're not supposed to be here!"

356
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,145
Carefully wanting to soak up
as much as possible,

357
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:16,705
and I think it's funny that I'll
see that played out as a panda.

358
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,153
It was a great way of showing

359
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,938
Po the giant fan boy.

360
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,052
In the home of the most
sacred artifacts of kung fu.

361
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,659
He knows everything about this stuff.
He's read everything, knows the history.

362
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,951
And that's why it was important
for Po to run in

363
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,584
and be spouting out stats about this
stuff. He doesn't have to read the card,

364
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,452
he knows exactly what this stuff is.

365
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,548
And then, when he knows
what the Wuxi finger hold is,

366
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:52,631
that, of course,
is the ultimate total minutiae,

367
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,262
as far as kung fu is concerned.

368
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,044
He actually knows all about it.

369
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,976
Knows who created it,
knows when it was developed.

370
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,229
That actually, you can see,
it slightly impresses Shifu.

371
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,939
But Shifu has much more
hatred for Po at this moment,

372
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:11,559
he can't appreciate the fact that
this guy actually knows his stuff.

373
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:16,588
The Wuxi finger hold
used to come later in the movie,

374
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,259
when Shifu was trying
to restrain Po from leaving.

375
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,199
And it originally started
as a Chinese finger trap.

376
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:27,769
And then Derek changed that to this
thing he made up, the Wuxi finger hold.

377
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,954
And we love the idea
that the most scary thing,

378
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,918
the most scary kung fu move,

379
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,555
in our world of martial arts,

380
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,691
is this tiny thing
of holding your finger.

381
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,212
is this tiny thing
of holding your finger.

382
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,453
- Holding your finger up.
- How ridiculous.

383
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,970
Now we come into, Po gets to witness

384
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,777
the coolest thing
he's ever seen in his entire life.

385
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,040
He didn't get to see the show earlier,
now he gets to see the Five.

386
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,116
It's his own private viewing
of the Five doing kung fu.

387
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,793
And we wanted to make this
really intense, really hardcore.

388
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,453
We wanted to make it very dramatic,

389
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,096
like he was stepping into
a torture chamber.

390
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,675
These guys can

391
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,924
avoid all the torture,
but we know what's coming for Po.

392
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,611
We spent a lot of time looking at movies
like The 36th Chamber of Shaolin,

393
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:19,148
and any of those great movies
that have rigorous training.

394
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,141
Training halls, things to

395
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,365
make kung fu heroes work.

396
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,328
All our training devices
are based on animals.

397
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,054
No human beings in our world. We took
all things, like Shaolin Wooden Men,

398
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:40,092
even those spiky things
that swing over...

399
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,403
we call them pork swings,
.
or porcupines.

400
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,666
Those snakes that go over the water.

401
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,564
They rotate and
you have to balance on them.

402
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,570
Those are actually based on snakes.

403
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,525
The rings hanging from the ceiling
are snakes as well.

404
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,018
There's tiger claws.

405
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,679
Originally, the Five Floor,

406
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:04,279
we used to see cutaways of
palace geese, underneath the floor,

407
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,754
- operating the mechanism.
- Pedaling bikes and starting fires.

408
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,278
But it was just
too distracting to do that.

409
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,441
Jack really found Po in this sequence.

410
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,788
And in the previous sequence
when we were recording early on,

411
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,868
we had a more abrasive version of Po.

412
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,850
And in this sequence is when he really

413
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,276
brought the more
insecure character out.

414
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,861
The real vulnerable character
and the sweeter character.

415
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,498
The character that doesn't think
he's going to just walk in

416
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:39,138
and show everybody how it's done,
but the character who's terrified

417
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:43,215
to reveal that he doesn't
know how to do kung fu.

418
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,682
This was actually the first sequence
we put into production.

419
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,192
We called it our "panhandle" sequence.
It was the first scene

420
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,469
that had character acting and action
and kung fu and slapstick comedy.

421
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,460
So it was a very good sequence to try
and see the technical problems

422
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,458
we were going to be faced with,
and acting problems.

423
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,797
It was the first scene that was lit,
as well.

424
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:07,646
We ended up, many months later,
going back and relighting it.

425
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,607
In a more aggressive style.

426
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,985
It was too conservative
the first time around.

427
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,714
So we went with a red sky.

428
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,259
We asked Ramone to really take a chance
and make a bold statement.

429
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,622
And he was doing amazing bold statements
in other sequences,

430
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,786
that we said let's hit this again.

431
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,122
Something that happens when
the very first things you start with,

432
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,026
even the animation
often gets more sophisticated

433
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,313
or more subtle or more pushed.

434
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,622
So we revisited it to make it stronger.

435
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,497
To use our color theory,
once we decided red was our power color,

436
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,150
we hit the scene with red

437
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,850
to reinforce the power
of the Furious Five.

438
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:51,166
This is their home, contrasting to
Oogway's home, green in knowledge.

439
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,864
This is all about strength and power.

440
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,239
And just in case anybody wonders

441
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,578
what the words are
on the hanging tapestries

442
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,249
around the training hall,

443
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:05,408
the words say, "Focus. Harmony. Honor.

444
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,504
Sacrifice. Courage. Power.

445
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,080
Agility. Speed. Grace. Balance."

446
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,881
This is our great Dewey Finn moment.
We wanted to have Po react

447
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,525
to overhearing the Five.

448
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:30,695
He's a self-aware character who knows
that he's out of place.

449
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,570
Also, another shout out
for matte painting,

450
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,099
most of that exterior
is all matte painting.

451
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,562
There's very little stuff
that we actually built there.

452
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,405
The whole bunkhouse
and all the background

453
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,201
is matte painting.

454
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,540
It's also the reinforcement
of the negative blue color.

455
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,260
This is not a good time for Po.

456
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:54,892
So, just as we'd use blue for
something overtly evil, like Tai Lung,

457
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,507
we also use blue

458
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,600
for when Po is having
a negative emotion.

459
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,996
The earliest version
of this sequence was done by

460
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,707
our storyboard artist, Paul McEvoy.

461
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:12,403
He came up with this idea that Po
would just be in their bedrooms,

462
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:16,435
without them even knowing it. It started
with Po face to face with Mantis.

463
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,159
It was just Po being
the creepiest fan ever.

464
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:22,288
You know, kind of lurking around.

465
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,589
A huge shout out
to David Cross, as well.

466
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:39,201
He plays Crane so perfectly, dry,

467
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:43,445
in contrast to Jack's nervy energy.

468
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,729
A lot of what David did was adlib, too.

469
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,541
There wasn't much on the page and
he kept adding bits here and there.

470
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,442
We wish there was more
Furious Five in our movie.

471
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:57,899
One of the things we're sort of sad is,
they don't get more screen time.

472
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,294
But, we love the Furious Five.

473
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:04,212
Everybody who was a member
of the Furious Five,

474
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,382
which were about the five deadly venoms.

475
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:11,884
But David Cross and Lucy Liu
and Angelina

476
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,757
and Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan,

477
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,140
we loved them all and wished they had
a chance to have more screen time.

478
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:24,733
We used to have a bunch of vignettes.

479
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,584
Po sneaks down the hall,

480
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,221
he's trying to get to an empty room.

481
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:34,327
We used to have things where
we would see into Mantis' room,

482
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,740
Viper's room and we would see
that they would hear him coming.

483
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,727
And they would do anything to avoid
having him come into their room

484
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,427
and talk to them.

485
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,264
We had silly stuff like

486
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,247
Lucy pouring tea on her...

487
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,154
Trying to look like
she was in the shower.

488
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,783
Mantis hiding under the bed,
rubbing those things...

489
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,340
To sound like a cricket, so it sounded
like nobody was in there.

490
00:28:58,837 --> 00:28:59,947
We cut it out.

491
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,572
Probably for the better.

492
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,329
Po eats when he's upset.

493
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:46,751
And the peach tree, we'll talk about it
more when we get to that sequence,

494
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,226
in the scene we call "Oogway departs,"

495
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,719
but that became the key location
for that sequence.

496
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,935
We realized, once we knew that Oogway

497
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:59,615
was going to have this
very beautiful death scene,

498
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,232
that we had to introduce
the peach tree earlier.

499
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,044
We changed the kitchen location

500
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,988
to be Oogway's peach tree.

501
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,158
The peach is a symbol of immortality
in Chinese culture,

502
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,809
peach blossom and peach tree leaves

503
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,659
are used in Taoist magic.

504
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,457
The wood of the peach tree
is said to ward off evil.

505
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,212
So, in our mythology,

506
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,610
it was Cogway
who planted the peach tree...

507
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,795
..a thousand years ago
when he first came to China.

508
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,605
And his staff is made
from the wood of the peach tree.

509
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,065
The peach tree is the place
that overlooks the valley,

510
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,209
and is this very significant place.

511
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,057
One other thing to mention
is that Oogway brings light.

512
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,317
It's a moment of enlightenment
between Oogway and Po.

513
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,820
So it was a really cool visual thing

514
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,307
to have him bring the lantern
and leave light behind.

515
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,187
It also was a good transition.

516
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,840
He's in the same color language,
blue and a bit of orange.

517
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,821
We go from the blue of the night sky
and the orange of the lantern

518
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,285
to the golden orange of Tai Lung's eyes

519
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,869
in the cut to our first
big action set piece.

520
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,649
in the cut to our first
big action set piece.

521
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,377
While we're in the land of color,

522
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,669
this whole sequence was designed
to be a battle between

523
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:25,126
blue, Tai Lungs color,
and red, the power color.

524
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,441
If you watch the scene
a couple of times, you'll notice that

525
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,226
as Tai Lung wins each level,

526
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,583
‘cause the thing is designed
like a video game with levels,

527
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,250
as Tai Lung wins each level, he
extinguishes all red light behind him.

528
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:43,014
So that was one of the big,
overriding conceits for the sequence.

529
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,568
And hopefully, if we make you believe
the physics and the gravity

530
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,498
of all the stuff with Tai Lung
in the hand-to-hand,

531
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,141
you'll accept that he can defy
the laws of gravity in the end,

532
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,566
when he starts to run back up
the falling debris.

533
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,644
Which is obviously a complete
and utter cheat,

534
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:05,653
but it is designed to show
how amazingly skillful he is.

535
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,974
We should call out sound designers
who did an incredible job.

536
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,008
Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl.

537
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:15,636
They approached this like King Kong,
Transformers and Lord of the Rings.

538
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:21,158
Gave us a really amazing,
huge, epic soundtrack.

539
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,767
We really wanted to bring them in,

540
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,418
as we did with many of our other
creative people on our team,

541
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,015
to say let's make this a real movie,
let's try to push the boundaries

542
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,766
of what a family animated film can be.

543
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,282
The first time we get to hear lan
McShane's voice come out of Tai Lung,

544
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,219
and we realize he's actually a thinking,

545
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,495
a very smart, and real being,
not just a feral beast.

546
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:48,086
That was a conscious choice,
to have him not say anything

547
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:52,287
until he's beaten his challenge.

548
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:55,891
The only thing you would hear
would be actual animal sounds,

549
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,304
you might think he was just bestial.

550
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,743
lan is one of the most amazing actors.
He made our joke completely redundant.

551
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,811
"Could I get a cup of tea, love?"

552
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,193
He comes in as
the nicest guy in the world.

553
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,242
And then, every single take,

554
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,379
from A through Z,

555
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,165
he'll find every single possible way
of delivering a line.

556
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:21,535
And when he's finished he just looks
at you through the control room glass,

557
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,863
and goes, "Did I miss anything, love?"

558
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,239
And you'll go, "No. No, that was great.
Let's move on."

559
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,959
Nails it every time. Brilliantly.

560
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,622
Halfway through production, we were
really trying to find Tai Lung.

561
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,179
l was looking back at
The Hero with a Thousand Faces,

562
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:42,338
and it talks about

563
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,563
a villain is the hero of his own story.

564
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,730
And that's perfect for Tai Lung,

565
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:51,158
because he thinks he's been
unjustly imprisoned for 20 years.

566
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,546
He wants that Dragon Scroll,
that's his third act.

567
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,340
In his mind, he's going
to get that scroll,

568
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:00,456
everything's going to be great
and people will understand.

569
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:05,036
And finally, he'll be able to be
the hero the way he wants it to be.

570
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:08,487
Reconciliation of the father,
Shifu is the father figure.

571
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:12,957
And I think that's
not interesting unless...

572
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,804
Unless there's a human component
to the villain

573
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,587
that makes you understand

574
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,986
why they believe they're justified
in their villainy.

575
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,273
We actually freaked people out.

576
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:26,814
Then we kept getting the note:
"He's too dimensional. Too human.

577
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,641
There's too much going on."

578
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,040
I've got too much sympathy
for Tai Lung.

579
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,422
There's a balance we had to strike.
We wanted you to engage with him.

580
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,335
And believe him as a villain.

581
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,418
At the same time, we didn't
want him to be totally sympathetic.

582
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,248
That's why we ended up putting in
an abstracted version of a massacre

583
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,362
in the flashback scene,
which will be coming up.

584
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:51,252
Because people felt bad for Tai Lung.

585
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:54,103
He wanted something
and he was denied it,

586
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,862
locked away in
this hideous prison for 20 years.

587
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,752
So we realized we hadn't
done a good enough job of

588
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:04,085
justifying why Tai Lung
had to be incarcerated.

589
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:08,333
So we put in this abstracted version
of him running amok

590
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,517
in the Valley.

591
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,159
So, we wanted Tai Lung
to cast a literal shadow

592
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,767
over the second act of the movie,

593
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,109
and also the Valley.

594
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,988
We weren't going to cut to him
traveling back from the prison,

595
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,419
We weren't going to cut to him
traveling back from the prison,

596
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,590
so we worked on the transition
from his escape

597
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,549
into this next sequence.

598
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,059
So that subliminally,

599
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,867
his shadow burns
over the landscape of the Valley,

600
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,378
to indicate his coming threat.

601
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,452
Another moment with the Five,

602
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:46,212
just a little bit of glue
for Po's story,

603
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,191
to get us back into his story.

604
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,410
There was a great gag
where Po was asleep.

605
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:54,499
He had been trying to do splits all
night, and ended up falling asleep,

606
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,185
‘cause he got stuck.
We changed it, it was too confusing.

607
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,950
Too much story going on.

608
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,441
Obviously, he took
OCogway's words to heart.

609
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:08,242
And decided to take the next day
as a challenge and come.

610
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,890
This is where it's dawning on him

611
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,830
how much of a fan this guy is.

612
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,395
He's not going to quit.

613
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,270
He keeps trying to turn up the heat,
to scare him away,

614
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,280
trying to raise the intensity
of his attack on Po.

615
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,425
He can't do it overtly, because that
would be going against Oogway's wishes.

616
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,826
And this sequence is all about Shifu
turning up the heat

617
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,949
and this gag right here,
when Po hides the piece behind his back.

618
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,487
I think that was something Rodolphe
had boarded early on.

619
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,043
- It was a Rodolphe gag.
- It made us laugh.

620
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,969
We got the hugest crew laugh every time,
we worked hard to make sure

621
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,317
we maintained that
all the way to end.

622
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,339
In the land of reincorporation,

623
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,861
seeing Tigress do
that combat split kick,

624
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,128
and hearing Shifu say,

625
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:58,957
"It takes years to perfect a split,"

626
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,297
obviously is going to
payoff later in the movie.

627
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:06,534
So, here we get some more kung fu
coming from the Five.

628
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:11,695
Just snippets, but we continue
to establish the slapstick...

629
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,647
What happens whenever
Po tries to do kung fu,

630
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:18,103
we get this slapstick result.

631
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,535
But, Po's indomitable spirit

632
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,930
keeps freaking Shifu out to no end.

633
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:28,145
That thing where Po
is being flipped around,

634
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,573
that comes from Atom Ant.

635
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,995
An old Hanna-Barbera cartoon,

636
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,191
where bad guys would get beaten up

637
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,174
by this ant that was too small to see.

638
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:44,040
We just used that for Mantis
beating the snot out of Po.

639
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,026
One of his special abilities
is he's almost invisible.

640
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,930
We tried it with a green smear,
We talked about it.

641
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,370
- It was less interesting.
- It's very funny to not see him.

642
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,680
And this moment is
a pretty intense moment for Po.

643
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,298
This starts our
bouncing down the stairs.

644
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,277
It's a running gag
that we see later in the film.

645
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,617
It should be pointed out,

646
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,432
this moment was heavily scripted
over and over again.

647
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,740
We finally figured out
what we needed to do here,

648
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:18,233
when Seth Rogen
adlibbed that amazing line.

649
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,450
Seth ended up rewriting
and adlibbing all of his lines,

650
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,844
to the betterment of the movie.

651
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,420
He's hugely responsible for...

652
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,609
Mantis doesn't have a lot
of screen time, unfortunately,

653
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,644
but Seth made every moment count.

654
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,515
but Seth made every moment count.

655
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,882
Just his big throaty laugh

656
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,558
coming out of a little insect would
always make us crack up every time.

657
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,985
But, when he adlibbed,
that was when the pieces fell into place

658
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:47,115
around his great adlib
about Po bouncing on the stairs.

659
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,899
This sequence was storyboarded
by Rob Koo,

660
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:53,395
another continuation
of his acupuncture idea.

661
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,438
We've got the acupressure on Tai Lung
in the tortoise shell armor,

662
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,782
and this was a continuation
of that same idea.

663
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,488
We thought it would be
perfect for Mantis.

664
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:10,124
Initially, he was going to use
his thingies to do acupuncture,

665
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,772
but we felt it was better to do needles.

666
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,897
We're laying the pipe for the fact that

667
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,589
Mantis can't reach his pressure points
with his acupuncture needles,

668
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:23,463
for how he's going to stay
invulnerable to Tai Lung.

669
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,118
Will Tai Lung's Nerve Touch
work on Po?

670
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,134
Well, we'll have to find out.

671
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:30,713
Angelina's fantastic in this scene.

672
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,212
This is her big acting moment

673
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,560
where she reveals she's this

674
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,321
fairly tough, stern,

675
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,881
unforgiving presence in the film.

676
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,587
But you find out she's nursing a wound.

677
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,757
She has a psychic wound of her own.

678
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,542
We had this back-story,
that Shifu raised Tai Lung,

679
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,205
we didn't want the characters
talking about it.

680
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,281
So we came up with this idea
to actually show it.

681
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:57,988
And to go into...

682
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,839
Tigress is a very
one-dimensional character,

683
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:04,396
two-dimensional character,
to give us all this rich back-story,

684
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,772
and by accident,
she's defending Shifu in this moment,

685
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,339
but by accident she ends up revealing
all these deep secrets about herself.

686
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,315
It's also Po's awareness of himself

687
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,703
is starting to
cause these other characters

688
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,264
to have more awareness of themselves.

689
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,310
It's brilliant, the one-to-one

690
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,947
correlation between

691
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:31,016
when Tai Lung is a kid
and being trained by Shifu.

692
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:58,343
So, again, in the land of visual motifs,

693
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,553
just wanted to point out that

694
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:03,608
the Nerve Touch
that Oogway does to Tai Lung,

695
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,232
is based on the water ripple.

696
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,937
We saw an energy version
of the water ripple

697
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,248
when he used his staff to still
the waters in the moon pool.

698
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:16,665
And that same energy ripple

699
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,651
will be something that we use again ina
very different way towards the climax.

700
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,522
Which I'll point out when we get there.

701
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,845
We wanted a mirror of Tigress
and Tai Lung as children,

702
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,398
as closely as possible.

703
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,139
She hits the dummy in the same way,

704
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,790
but Tai Lung actually knocked a weapon
out of the weapon rack,

705
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,345
whereas Tigress just caused it to spin.

706
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,244
So Tai Lung's actually
a little bit better than Tigress.

707
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:43,454
Coming up here we have some great subtle
animation between the two of them.

708
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,055
This is a subtle moment
that gives way

709
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:49,394
to a very slapstick and ridiculous
moment, boarded by Rob Koo.

710
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,064
This is probably
the biggest laugh in the movie

711
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,963
where we reveal
the pin cushion on the back.

712
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:59,364
And then we segue into a very
different moment with Shifu.

713
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,904
We wanted to show him,
the disruption in his life,

714
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:06,258
and how he is not a Zen Master,
he's trying to be.

715
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,004
And Alessandro Carloni
did an amazing job

716
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:13,584
of animating the subtlety in this scene
of Shifu's amazing kung fu hearing.

717
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:15,602
Disturbing his meditation.

718
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:19,467
Also, in that opening shot, you'll see
the pressure of blue on negative color,

719
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:23,818
pressing down on Shifu's
little bubble of warmth,

720
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:27,539
which is about to be popped
by the news from Zeng.

721
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,326
It's a big thing in a movie,
.
any movie,

722
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,716
but particularly in a family film,

723
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:33,147
but particularly in a family film,

724
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,594
to make the decision
to kill off a character.

725
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:41,401
When we knew that it was going to be
good for the story to do that,

726
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,840
it actually changed
a lot of the tone of the film.

727
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,576
It meant that we were going
to have to be...

728
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,685
- It got deeper, it got richer.
- You can't do that in a trivial film.

729
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,020
But he knows Shifu's struggling, he's
seen Shifu struggling for many years.

730
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,327
Like a great therapist,
he doesn't ever give the answers.

731
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,067
He's always gently guiding.

732
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,442
I think this is a moment where
we like to think it's very clear

733
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,879
that right here Oogway
makes his decision to leave,

734
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,042
because he knows that Shifu
isn't going to be able to do it

735
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:15,209
as long as Oogway's around
to be a crutch and to be relied on.

736
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,433
Oogway knows "It is my time."

737
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,538
Oogway chooses this departure time,
I'm getting goosebumps.

738
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:24,278
It's a beautiful, emotional moment.
A significant moment in the story.

739
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:28,022
I think it was one
of those sequences early on that

740
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:32,609
was a real proof of concept for how deep
and emotional a movie could be.

741
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:36,234
And how we wanted to make something

742
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,703
that was taking the story seriously.

743
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,950
We didn't want to be a parody, a spoof,
we didn't want to be jokey,

744
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,930
we wanted to be significant
and deep and rich.

745
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:49,421
And our actors,
Randall Duk Kim and Dustin

746
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,524
we really asked them to dig in
for the sequence,

747
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,334
to make it heartfelt,
to make it believable.

748
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,453
Dustin had to be anguished
and conflicted.

749
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:02,973
- And Randall had to be...
- Calm. At peace.

750
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,358
.. accepting of...

751
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,486
For Oogway this is an adventure,
it's not a bad thing,

752
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,645
that he's moving on.

753
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,348
There's a more interesting
adventure awaiting him

754
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,061
on some other plane of existence.

755
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,368
He's OK with it.
It's Shifu who's very not OK

756
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:24,305
with losing his mentor, his master,
and his safety net, really,

757
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,002
for everything that's about to come.

758
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,884
And also, there's some back-story where

759
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:34,371
Oogway knows that Shifu's destiny
is to be the next Oogway,

760
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,546
and I think Shifu spent
a lot of his young career

761
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,510
probably hoping to be
the Dragon Warrior himself.

762
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:43,663
It wasn't until

763
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:47,611
he believed he failed, he wasn't good
enough, didn't believe in himself,

764
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,316
which is thematic to the film,
that he became a teacher.

765
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:55,042
And he thought "I'm going to raise,
create the next Dragon Warrior,"

766
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,020
Shifu's been on this track of
"l failed at my mission."

767
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,039
Oogway's known, "No, there is a
greater mission for you."

768
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,565
Which is where Oogway
gives him his staff and says...

769
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,649
"You're now me.

770
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,248
You need to take over the role of..."

771
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,450
Which Shifu doesn't get.
Shifu doesn't understand.

772
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,870
He's using it as a weapon.

773
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:19,053
He'll actually go on to use the staff
in a forceful way that is

774
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,960
very strange.

775
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:43,772
And now we come to the sequence
we cursed early on in production,

776
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:43,854
And now we come to the sequence
we cursed early on in production,

777
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,750
by naming it "Fun in the Kitchen."

778
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,417
The sequence is not fun.

779
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,198
It actually is fun now.

780
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,460
For many years it was
the absolute opposite of fun,

781
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:57,425
It was the least funny sequence
you've ever seen.

782
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,995
The core idea of Shifu,
after the death of his master,

783
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:05,212
finding Po doing something ridiculous,

784
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:09,196
that was the core idea, to have Shifu
coming from this horrible thing

785
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:11,433
into everybody laughing,

786
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,316
the Furious Five with their feet
up on the tables, eating,

787
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:16,959
they're breaking their kung fu diet.

788
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,560
We wanted to have the reality
come slamming into Po.

789
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,067
And actually, I think it was Phil Craven

790
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:27,134
who first boarded the idea that Po
makes fun of Shifu.

791
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,798
And we expanded on that.

792
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,584
So, Po starts imitating Shifu.

793
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:33,876
I think it's brilliantly animated.

794
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:37,475
It's mocking, but if
you listen carefully,

795
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,065
he's making fun of himself.
He's using Shifu as the vehicle,

796
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,935
but he's actually being
self-deprecating.

797
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:47,055
And I think that's one of
the great things about Jack

798
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:51,345
and Jack's performance in this. He's
never lashing out at anyone but himself.

799
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,312
It's this consistent thing that he does.

800
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:57,522
And because we needed this to be fun,

801
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,412
we have the famous joke:
"The boob bowls."

802
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:05,119
The biggest laugh
in the movie usually is...

803
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,849
Back in the day!

804
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:11,721
It used to be this sustained laugh
that would just go on and on.

805
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,089
- Much to our surprise.
- We test screened to kids,

806
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:18,493
and kids went nuts, they laughed
for a minute straight.

807
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:22,449
And actually we should put that
soundtrack on the DVDs as an Easter egg.

808
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,587
They laughed for a minute straight,
the craziest thing.

809
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,490
They were climbing over the seats,
talking to their friends about it.

810
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,988
And Jeffrey Katzenberg
was at that screening.

811
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,404
l remember him turning
and looking at us.

812
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:37,683
There was no way
we were cutting that scene.

813
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,132
It's there forever.

814
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,650
This next sequence was
the hardest one to get right.

815
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,980
We knew we had this big comedic laugh
coming when we see Po running away.

816
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:23,118
But the drama between these guys
and what gets said,

817
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:26,494
in this moment of sheer panic
on Po's part,

818
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,841
and truly it's panic on Shifu's part,

819
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:31,162
he's made this commitment to Oogway,

820
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,699
and he doesn't know how
he's going to pull it off.

821
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,298
We did many versions of this sequence.

822
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,850
This scene existed as a card.

823
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,966
There was always a scene
we had to have in the film

824
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,150
called "Po and Shifu have it out."

825
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:48,674
Jed Diffenderfer did the earliest
version when it involved a punching bag.

826
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,696
It was more of a training sequence.

827
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:55,756
We went through so many versions
of trying to get this scene right.

828
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,703
It was the last sequence
we put into production.

829
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,413
We knew that because
we were having such trouble

830
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:05,266
trying to get the balance right,
it would be the last thing we did.

831
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,270
We recorded it more times
than any other scene,

832
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:09,939
with Jack and Dustin.

833
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,991
Jack was always like,
"This one again?"

834
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,716
"Didn't I do this great already?"
And he always did.

835
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,139
And it was us, we kept monkeying
with it, changing the writing

836
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,202
and trying to change the status.

837
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:23,481
Shift is the status transaction between
these two characters.

838
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,330
Po, who was desperate to stay,

839
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,510
who now is desperate to leave,
he knows his life's in danger.

840
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,547
Shifu, who's made this commitment
to his master,

841
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,629
who is committed to having Po stay
and trying to believe in him,

842
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,578
and so they've flipped places here.

843
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,957
Getting the actual chemistry and
balance right was very challenging.

844
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:47,241
And also finding this no-man's-land
to set this in.

845
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,825
It's not the dojo, it's not the palace,

846
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,917
it's this area near the peach tree,

847
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:55,093
so we're reminded of Oogway
in this spot,

848
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,689
but, really it's a moment
where these two characters

849
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:03,006
bare their souls and reveal their
deepest, darkest flaws.

850
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:06,791
Po reveals that he doesn't
believe that he can do it.

851
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,884
That this was all just a lark and...

852
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,283
Shifu reveals that
he doesn't know how to do it,

853
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,692
even though he has
committed to believing...

854
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,794
These characters need each other
to complete their journey.

855
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,028
They need each other so bad...

856
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,980
But they don't know how
it's going to work at this point.

857
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,379
- So this is their...
- It's a giving up.

858
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:27,502
ina sense, emotionally,
this is their darkest point.

859
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,295
And then Tigress will
pick up the charge.

860
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,998
And that is always
what we wanted to have.

861
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:36,327
That we saw the fracture
earlier in the kitchen,

862
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,500
when the Furious Five know...

863
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,902
And she makes a plea to Shifu,
"Come on, give me my shot.

864
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:45,866
Let me do it. I'm your best student,
we're all trained.

865
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,779
You equipped us to do this."

866
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,445
I think she's completely shaken

867
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:55,732
when he rejects her
‘cause of his promise to Oogway.

868
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,810
She's defying her master,
she's defying Oogway,

869
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,413
going against everything
she's ever learned.

870
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,692
She's the most disciplined,
honorable of all warriors,

871
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:08,672
and also at this moment
we get to see how amazing she is.

872
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,513
And so we want the audience
to believe that

873
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,272
- Tigress is going to do it.
- She's going to succeed.

874
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:17,252
- They're going to join up.
- Like a team of superheroes.

875
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:20,695
We want you to think, obviously,

876
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,607
this crack elite force going out
to take down the bad guy,

877
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:27,259
has got a huge chance of success.

878
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,459
This location and moment
is affectionately known as

879
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,472
"Mopey Mountain" to our crew.

880
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,037
Mike Mitchell coined that term because
we used to have one more instance

881
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:41,311
of Shifu sitting upset
and not sure what to do.

882
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:44,558
And we pared it down
and went for the simpler one moment

883
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:48,477
of despair before enlightenment.

884
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:51,586
And that comes in the sound.

885
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,612
Talking about the sound, yes, Shifu has
kung fu hearing, we established that,

886
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,839
theoretically he should know
where the sound is coming from,

887
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,877
and not go to the room
to see if Po's there,

888
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,051
he should know where it's coming from,
but it worked better

889
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,681
for him to go to the place
he expects it be,

890
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:14,855
which is the training hall, and then to
find that Po's actually in the kitchen.

891
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:18,622
It's actually very symbolic
for Shifu because

892
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,766
he's spent his whole life
thinking he knows the answer,

893
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,786
he knows the right way to do things.

894
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,704
He thinks those sounds should be
coming out of the dojo,

895
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,743
this is the beginning of Shifu starting
to look at things a different way.

896
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,455
Starting to think outside his box.

897
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,807
His box is the training hall.

898
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:42,542
He had to hit rock bottom in order
to be able to be aware enough,

899
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:47,377
have his eyes open enough, to see that
Po can do things in a different way.

900
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:50,932
This moment right here,
when he sees Po in the splits...

901
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:54,682
Harking back to that split
that Tigress did in combat,

902
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:58,305
Shifu says "It takes years to get
that right." Po can get that right

903
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:02,029
when he's not thinking about it,
if he's thinking about something else.

904
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,356
Po has this internal ability,
this natural ability,

905
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:08,805
because of his love for kung fu,
his obsession with it.

906
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,886
And it only can show itself
when he's distracted.

907
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,386
Now we get to see him
distracted by food.

908
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,678
This is part of Shifu's rebirth,
and re-inspiration as a teacher.

909
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:41,252
He takes him outside of his box,
the training hall,

910
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:45,382
to our equivalent
of Wudang Mountain in China.

911
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:48,171
Avery mystical place,

912
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,881
home of many Taoist monasteries,

913
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:54,045
and often the home
in martial arts movies,

914
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:58,778
and stories of the place

915
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,016
where kung fu reaches
its highest level.

916
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,933
But it was really important for us
to take Shifu as a character,

917
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,720
out of his normal, everyday life,

918
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:10,953
and he is now changing,
it's a rebirth.

919
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,331
He goes back to this place,

920
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,204
This is the birthplace of kung fu.

921
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,625
It's where Oogway invented it,
taught Shifu,

922
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:21,678
Shifu went and created
the box, the dojo,

923
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,629
and started creating
a fabricated version of this.

924
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,167
This is a very significant moment
for Shifu,

925
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:30,461
to start turning this corner,
becoming more like Oogway,

926
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,214
more open to the possibilities
of the universe.

927
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,823
Then we get to see Oogway doing kung fu,
which is so cool.

928
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:39,921
You'll see there's a lot
of lighting stuff in here.

929
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,563
The scene starts
with being pretty misty,

930
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:49,263
‘cause Po's in the fog,
he doesn't know where this is going.

931
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:53,707
And then it transitions to
the sun breaking through.

932
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:58,244
Which is back to our use of gold
as a heroic motif

933
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:03,372
for the flashback to Oogway
at the point where he invented kung fu.

934
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:07,547
Also for Shifu's symbolic rebirth

935
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:10,065
and his declaration
that he is Po's master.

936
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,247
That he is invested and invigorated,

937
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,790
committed to making Po a success

938
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,396
on the same place
where Oogway created kung fu.

939
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:23,167
This is a great example of...
we didn't try to reinvent the genre.

940
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:26,676
There's a training montage
in every sports movie,

941
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,667
and every great kung fu origin film.

942
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:33,808
A great hero training.

943
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,981
So we're going to find
our version of that.

944
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:38,834
We're not going to reinvent it,

945
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:42,562
we're certainly not going to do
a really long one 'cause

946
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:46,566
we wanted to show you this unlocking
happened over a long period of time,

947
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,590
that it's believable, that at the end,
Po has unlocked all these abilities.

948
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:54,168
We don't know exactly how long
it takes, it doesn't really matter.

949
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:57,841
- Don't do the math, people.
- It doesn't make sense.

950
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,905
It's just the idea that they went away,

951
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:05,245
and they took as long as it took
for Po to get where he needed to go.

952
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,831
We're coming to the chopstick fight,

953
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:33,312
which is, hands down, the audience
favorite at every screening.

954
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:37,394
It's the concept sequence that,
when we first executed it,

955
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,921
everybody knew that this
was the film in a nutshell.

956
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,028
The great relationship
between Po and Shifu.

957
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:47,718
And this sequence actually started
many years ago.

958
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:52,368
Rodolphe Guenoden had boarded it
as a fight between Tai Lung and Shifu.

959
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,060
It was a contained fight
at a dinner table.

960
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,922
It was a James Bond meets
the supervillain thing,

961
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:02,913
They were being polite to each other as
they talked about their back-story,

962
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,063
but trying to dominate
each other as they...

963
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:10,531
...tried to steal food out of each
other's chopsticks.

964
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:14,684
Then we realized that Po's training
was going to be food-based,

965
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,455
we remembered and brought
that sequence back,

966
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:22,553
a story artist named Phil Craven,
who was trained by Rodolphe in story.

967
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,353
- How very apt.
- Yeah.

968
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:27,408
He took the sequence and made it new,

969
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:30,231
and actually exploded it
and made the epic version.

970
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:32,817
So it starts very small and goes big.

971
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,203
Phil did, I think, an amazing job.

972
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,742
He boarded the previous sequence, too.
The training montage.

973
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,366
Giving us this believable arc

974
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,505
from the panda who doesn't
know how to do anything,

975
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,132
to the panda who manages to figure out

976
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:51,156
how to unlock and use his abilities
by the end of the sequence.

977
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:55,135
What was really cool, was when Jack saw
the finished movie he pointed out

978
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:59,832
he didn't realize how layered and
significant some of these moments were.

979
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,227
So the "I'm not hungry" moment
really resonated and plays great.

980
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,245
We get applause in some of
our audience screenings.

981
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,020
Again, the chopstick fight

982
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:16,703
had a lot of very careful thought
in the visual design of that sequence.

983
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:21,137
Again, it's lit with gold light.

984
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:25,302
We don't have any
conventional skies in our film

985
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,619
until our very last sequence,
the end with the credits.

986
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:33,176
A very deliberate choice, every sky
is there for an emotional reason.

987
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,370
That one was a bright yellow sky

988
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,978
because it's Po's becoming a hero.

989
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:44,989
Also, there's a lot of red in the trees.

990
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:46,355
Again, our power color.

991
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:46,876
Again, our power color.

992
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:50,334
So, the mix of those color elements
became a significant thing

993
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,201
in the visual design of that sequence.

994
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:57,347
And now we're coming up to one of the
biggest set pieces in our film,

995
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,594
one of the coolest, most ambitious...

996
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,288
This sequence took forever
to figure out,

997
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,752
not only how to do
this particular sequence,

998
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:09,679
but what this sequence was going to be,
it was another one of those scenes

999
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:12,767
we knew we had to have the Five
fight Tai Lung.

1000
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:16,173
So, love the way lan McShane

1001
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:19,493
plays Tai Lung

1002
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,506
when he's talking to Tigress.

1003
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:24,922
Here, the bridge is being cut.
Basically they're both in danger

1004
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:28,299
of being plummeted
into this bottomless abyss.

1005
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:31,984
And he's so nonchalant
and self-possessed.

1006
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:35,372
The artists did a great job
of just having him lean.

1007
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:38,717
Jed came up with that image.

1008
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:41,289
There he is, he doesn't care.

1009
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,897
that he's thousands of feet
above a bottomless precipice.

1010
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,935
He can afford to be comfortable
and relaxed,

1011
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,421
he's cool enough to even
walk along the tightrope

1012
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,882
without blinking
or breaking into a sweat.

1013
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:57,938
And lan just plays
this moment perfectly.

1014
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:01,520
That Tai Lung hears Po's name
for the first time

1015
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,702
and conjures up

1016
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:07,818
this, obviously, completely
incorrect image in his head,

1017
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:10,968
that he's got a worthy opponent

1018
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:13,428
waiting for him at the end of his road,

1019
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:17,237
which will be the completion
of Tai Lung's hero story.

1020
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:21,731
That Tai Lung actually bests this guy
who's worthy of his skill.

1021
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,781
Certainly, this is
the most technically challenging

1022
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:27,553
and complex sequence.

1023
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,041
The dynamics of figuring out
the rope bridge moving constantly...

1024
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,141
The breakage of the boards.

1025
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:36,359
Characters adjusting their weight
on the bridge as it's moving.

1026
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,083
The mist is also super-complicated.

1027
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,979
Hopefully none of this is self-evident.
You should be caught up in the action.

1028
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,850
But when we were brainstorming about

1029
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:48,433
what was going to be the venue

1030
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:52,322
for this epic fight
between the Five and Tai Lung.

1031
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:56,453
When the idea was proposed to the
special effects people,

1032
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,330
that it was going to be on a shifting,
crumbling, breaking rope bridge,

1033
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:05,472
they all went ashen and white
and looked really scared.

1034
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:10,219
And we thought, "Great! Perfect.
We don't know how to do that."

1035
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:14,677
- So that means it's worth trying.
- Nobody's ever done it before.

1036
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,172
It's obviously really hard
to figure out.

1037
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,727
And really, just to give you
an idea of how complicated it is,

1038
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:25,949
Viper, which is the most complicated
character in our film,

1039
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,296
just because she has
so many points of articulation,

1040
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:32,443
she's a very complicated rig to work.

1041
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,579
And the bridge is,
essentially, four Vipers.

1042
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:39,455
Because there's four major ropes
to the structure of the bridge.

1043
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,426
Just to give you an idea of how

1044
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,658
complicated it is
for the animators to deal with.

1045
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:47,065
Love Jen's idea

1046
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,894
of not seeing Tai Lung

1047
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,616
as he flips off the rope.

1048
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,045
The rope kind of like attached to

1049
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:57,191
the shark in Jaws
plowing through the mist.

1050
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,607
Tai Lung is so good, he's so quick,

1051
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:03,350
that you don't even see him
when he does his kung fu spring.

1052
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:04,220
So, in keeping with

1053
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,951
So, in keeping with

1054
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:08,625
the idea that Tai Lung is the hero
of his own story,

1055
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:12,535
even though he's mostly in cool colors.

1056
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,376
We've kept his eyes golden,
our hero color.

1057
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:18,924
And we used the transition
from the gold of his eyes

1058
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:23,776
to the gold of the sunset here,

1059
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:26,961
because Tai Lung
has beat these five masters.

1060
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:28,747
In his eyes,

1061
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:32,292
he is on his journey to be
the Dragon Warrior.

1062
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:35,006
And this is another step in his story,

1063
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:39,895
where he is the hero and he has
defeated the overwhelming odds.

1064
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:45,250
We wanted to play the drama of they've
been paralyzed and defeated by Tai Lung,

1065
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:49,422
but we wanted the comedy as well
of the fact that

1066
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,046
these guys are now incapacitated.

1067
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:55,592
And Po has to figure out
how he's going to...

1068
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,796
Now he's left, he's the only solution
to this problem.

1069
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:02,522
We wanted to basically freak Po out
as much as possible

1070
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:05,915
by seeing the evidence of what Tai Lung
has done to the Five.

1071
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:17,398
So, we go into

1072
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,513
a very, very difficult
and lengthy scene,

1073
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,074
that was very hard to get right.

1074
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:25,423
There was a lot this scene
had to accomplish.

1075
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,939
There were a lot of story points
that had to land,

1076
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:31,815
a lot of emotional turns,
a lot of things that had to happen.

1077
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:35,335
And so we knew we were
trying to pack it all in.

1078
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:41,067
The movie's been building up to this
moment of Po getting this Dragon Scroll.

1079
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,401
The opening of the Ark of
the Covenant, it's this huge moment.

1080
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:47,343
It's the moment that Shifu and Po

1081
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:52,737
believe is actually going to make
everything turn out OK.

1082
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,196
Po thinks he's going to be transformed.

1083
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,518
Shifu is taking steps towards
becoming more like Oogway.

1084
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,962
By using the staff, he's showing that

1085
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:06,828
he's using Oogway's staff to get
the Scroll in this way,

1086
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,610
That shows he's changing from being the

1087
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:14,014
harsh taskmaster, the kung fu trainer,

1088
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:18,614
to being the more enlightened
and involved character.

1089
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,625
He's still hardcore,
the thing we wanted to have.

1090
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,395
This contrast, this combination of Shifu

1091
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,933
doing something in a hardcore way
with kung fu,

1092
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:30,337
but he's redirecting these petals
just on wafts of air.

1093
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:33,674
Also worth noting, not something most
people would register,

1094
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:38,417
but it is actually the first time Shifu
calls Po by name.

1095
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,625
As opposed to calling him Panda.

1096
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,600
Which indicates how far
their relationship has come.

1097
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,067
He's no longer an object,
he's a person.

1098
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,890
He's a friend,
that there is genuine affection.

1099
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,686
This is the key scene for Shifu's arc.

1100
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:56,719
Here's a guy who was almost trying
to kill this guy in the beginning,

1101
01:04:57,293 --> 01:05:00,863
drive him away, beat him up, detested
him, wanted him out of his sight.

1102
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:04,357
And in this scene he actually

1103
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:07,701
has come so far that he's prepared
to lay down his life

1104
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:12,511
to give this guy a chance
to fulfill his destiny.

1105
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:18,216
It's where a lot of
the elements of the film come,

1106
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:21,762
also, it's got a big reversal,

1107
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:26,118
obviously when the scroll
is revealed to be blank.

1108
01:05:26,723 --> 01:05:28,653
We've been building up the entire movie,

1109
01:05:28,992 --> 01:05:31,362
it's been a thousand years
of history in this world

1110
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,221
that this scroll contains a secret,

1111
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:36,330
The secret to limitless power.

1112
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:39,473
The thing throughout production,

1113
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,196
we tried many things.

1114
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,548
Early on in the story we had

1115
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:47,887
the scroll was, at times,
the Dragon's sword,

1116
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:51,851
locked in a room we never saw.

1117
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:54,432
It was a box that had something in it.

1118
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,834
"The greatest power
in any of us is within."

1119
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:59,467
You open the box, it's empty.
We put a mirror in it.

1120
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:02,106
We tried many different versions
knowing that

1121
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:05,272
this was the philosophical idea

1122
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,158
we wanted to deliver.

1123
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,649
But it took us a while
to find the exact means to deliver it.

1124
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,717
And then once we figured it out,

1125
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,872
everything fell into place around it.

1126
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:18,775
It's also worth noting, this is
a particularly lovely run of music

1127
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:23,382
from this sequence into the next,

1128
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,743
through the end of the movie.

1129
01:06:26,049 --> 01:06:29,389
This little ramp of music
that Hans and John did

1130
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,229
is particularly gorgeous

1131
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:35,872
and supports all the emotions
in the scene.

1132
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,783
We love the way the music works.

1133
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:50,839
And then we go into
the big transition into our exodus.

1134
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,800
And then we go into
the big transition into our exodus.

1135
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,752
Brilliantly done by Yong Duk,

1136
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:58,734
this use of succession of cuts
through the long lens.

1137
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,625
‘Cause we don't want to make it
feel like there was...

1138
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,962
We wanted to find that...

1139
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:08,308
Not too much panic. We didn't want
bloodcurdling screams.

1140
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,511
We wanted there to be
an intensity and energy.

1141
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:14,071
There's definitely
an imperative to get out

1142
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,450
before the bogeyman returns.

1143
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,969
Most of the energy comes from camera.

1144
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,295
The handheld camera.

1145
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:24,453
Especially in contrast to how stately
the previous sequence has been.

1146
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,244
It really worked well.

1147
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:30,346
That's the Shaw brothers there,
two other members of Tenacious D,

1148
01:07:30,947 --> 01:07:33,907
- they're stealing a foo dog.
- Our favorite dumb joke in the movie.

1149
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,694
Nobody sees it and it goes by quickly.

1150
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,015
Little red wagon
with a giant stone foo dog,

1151
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:43,135
that's the thing they've chosen to try
and rescue as they get out of town.

1152
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,276
They're morons.

1153
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,551
One of our way-homers.
It always made us happy.

1154
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:52,602
And then, when we get into
Po reuniting with his dad,

1155
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:56,038
this sequence was done
by Alessandro Carloni

1156
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,116
he came up with the joke of the dad
putting the apron back on Po.

1157
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:04,663
It's a brilliant piece
of visual storytelling.

1158
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:08,488
For Po's dad, nothing has changed,
everything's back where it should be,

1159
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,768
Po's going to come back
to the kitchen, he's oblivious,

1160
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,831
he's tying Po back into his old life.

1161
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:17,313
But then, when we get into
the emotional content later,

1162
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,997
you notice the dad
isn't oblivious, he is aware.

1163
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:24,313
That was really important for us to not
continuously play the dad for comedy,

1164
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,244
but to let there be
a significant relationship here.

1165
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,291
That doesn't always get talked about.

1166
01:08:33,076 --> 01:08:35,626
His dad really does love Po.

1167
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:41,441
I think the very nice piece of
storytelling that's very sweet

1168
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,548
is that the dad's only way
of trying to heal his son,

1169
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:49,028
make him feel better is to use
the thing the dad loves the most,

1170
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,709
he loves noodles more than anything.

1171
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,460
He hopes that by
expressing that to his son,

1172
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:58,278
that this will make his son better.

1173
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,037
He's trying to heal his son
by giving him...

1174
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,017
The only thing he's got left.

1175
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:06,495
.. the most amazing thing in the world,
the secret of the soup.

1176
01:09:08,044 --> 01:09:11,233
Truly it's great, he is coming from
a place of being noodle-obsessed.

1177
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:14,468
And that, he's being himself,

1178
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:17,057
but he ends up, inadvertently,

1179
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,560
giving Po the secret.

1180
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:22,447
It's brilliantly played by James Hong.
James did a magical job

1181
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:26,505
with the delivery of these lines,
making them warm and heartfelt

1182
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:29,752
and sympathetic.

1183
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:33,478
And also, one of our favorite moments
that we're very happy with,

1184
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:35,933
one of our biggest laughs in the movie,

1185
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,461
when it looks like the film
is going to explain

1186
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,471
why Po has a goose for a father,

1187
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,341
- and...
- We skip right past it.

1188
01:09:43,613 --> 01:09:46,983
.. since it has absolutely
no importance to Po's story,

1189
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,296
we completely don't do it.

1190
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:54,698
Shifu waiting at the stairs
for Tai Lung

1191
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:58,311
as a sort of a Sergio Leone

1192
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:00,698
echoing Once Upon a Time in the West,

1193
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,870
the flapping door of the tournament
grounds, waiting.

1194
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:06,413
And then literally,
in the blink of an eye,

1195
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:10,109
since we've established
that Tai Lung can appear

1196
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,310
like the bogeyman out of nowhere.

1197
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:14,828
And we think Tai Lung waited

1198
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,521
until Shifu blinked
in the lightning flash,

1199
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:20,103
to choose to make his appearance there.

1200
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:22,623
We wanted to create
tension in this moment,

1201
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:26,644
This very still, static camera
face off moment.

1202
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,533
The electricity in the air
of the building storm

1203
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:32,266
before the storm breaks.

1204
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:35,972
With these two guys, everything
is subtext in this conversation.

1205
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:39,429
Twenty years of... everything, actually.

1206
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:43,442
There's not just a lot of hatred there,

1207
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:47,466
there's also love and regret.

1208
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,090
There's a great amount
of depth in this story.

1209
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:54,606
This is when all the pieces come
together, now we get the last flashback.

1210
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:17,097
There's a significant,
emotional turning point

1211
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:20,166
that exists in this sequence.

1212
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,240
It used to be much longer
and more significant.

1213
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,331
If you notice, if you look closely,

1214
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,370
Shifu is defending in the whole
beginning part of the fight.

1215
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:34,160
Defending, defending and
it's not until Tai Lung finds

1216
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,059
Shifu's staff,

1217
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,070
finds Cogway's staff over at his shrine,

1218
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,046
over near the candles,

1219
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,471
that Tai Lung realizes
that Oogway is gone.

1220
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:46,943
That it truly is between him and Shifu.

1221
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,113
He asks Shifu, "Give me the Scroll,"
basically is the subtext.

1222
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:53,593
This is the first time Shifu goes on
the attack and attacks his son.

1223
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:58,326
Because he's defiled the memory
of Oogway by touching his staff.

1224
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:13,092
And the breaking of the staff
became a significant one,

1225
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:17,199
in the land of Shifu's journey
to becoming Oogway,

1226
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:20,397
and the staff becoming a symbol

1227
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,057
of Oogway's wisdom and benignness,

1228
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:26,779
but is now used as a weapon
with Tai Lung trying to kill Shifu.

1229
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:30,090
So it's being used in
this completely negative way.

1230
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:34,006
And we made the choice to make breaking
the staff a somewhat magical event.

1231
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:37,100
There's a life-force inside that staff.

1232
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,630
It's the last part of Oogway,

1233
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:41,888
when that staff is broken

1234
01:12:42,225 --> 01:12:44,855
and that light is snuffed out
within the staff,

1235
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:47,814
we see the last echo of Oogway,

1236
01:12:48,231 --> 01:12:51,691
the petals that are left
around the moon pool blow across,

1237
01:12:52,235 --> 01:12:56,214
and that distracts Shifu long enough
for Tai Lung to get in this sucker kick.

1238
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:59,799
Not a sucker punch, but a sucker kick
that pounds him into the wall.

1239
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:05,298
Shifu's running for his life
for the rest of the sequence.

1240
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:10,479
When they breakout through the roof
of the palace,

1241
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,803
there was some discussion about
whether we needed to do that.

1242
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:17,717
Maybe that was more fight
than was necessary.

1243
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:21,011
But, Mark and I fought
very hard to keep it in.

1244
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:24,504
We felt it added a legendary

1245
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:28,601
and epic quality to the conflict
between the father and the son,

1246
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:32,301
to have them burst out into the sky
against a crack of lightning.

1247
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:37,876
It was a very important part
of the fight,

1248
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:42,126
to take it outside for
the final drop back into the fire.

1249
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,979
And I think it's all about
going more and more epic.

1250
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:57,855
We wanted this to increase...

1251
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:02,041
completely turning up
the volume of this battle.

1252
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:03,438
So that we could, in contrast,

1253
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,369
So that we could, in contrast,

1254
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:07,643
get the funniest battle
to come on the heels of it.

1255
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:11,624
Yeah, they sort of become
Greek gods at that point.

1256
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:15,281
Shifu and Tai Lung fighting in the sky.

1257
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:20,384
And then when Po returns,
like we were mentioning,

1258
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,800
the new light coming back in,

1259
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,435
and the likeness tonally
to the story comes back,

1260
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:29,947
Po knows the secret, he understands

1261
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,429
but he has no idea
how he's going to win this fight.

1262
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,835
He just knows he has to save Master
Shifu by distracting Tai Lung.

1263
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,085
The one thing Tai Lung wants
is the scroll.

1264
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:43,643
The thing Tai Lung wants more
than anything in the world

1265
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,135
is the power he believes
is in that scroll.

1266
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,522
Which we all know is nothing.
But, Tai Lung doesn't know that.

1267
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,509
What's interesting here
is Po is using the scroll,

1268
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:54,531
he's relying on an artificial...

1269
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:58,013
he's still relying on
an external thing to gain the advantage,

1270
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:01,927
so Po hasn't become enlightened yet.
We save that for later.

1271
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:05,305
He's still relying on Tai Lung's
desire for the scroll

1272
01:15:05,768 --> 01:15:09,168
and using that against him. But that
gives us somewhere to go in the fight

1273
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:11,665
so we can have more shape to it.

1274
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:13,998
This conceit for the fight,

1275
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,473
with the using of the scroll,
was a little

1276
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,549
Muhammad Ali‘Cassius Clay,
Joe Frazier,

1277
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:26,278
the rope-a-dope, where Po's
wearing Tai Lung down,

1278
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:31,262
as Tai Lung renews his efforts
to try and get the scroll.

1279
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,007
He's using his weaknesses against him.

1280
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:37,763
- He knows Tai Lung wants the scroll
- Emotionally, he wearing Tai Lung down.

1281
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,960
He knows the clincher is going to be
when Tai Lung opens the scroll.

1282
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,197
And understands that Po doesn't have
any special magic powers,

1283
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:49,526
he's been bested by a panda.

1284
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,919
That's the most humiliating thing.
This Panda is standing up to him.

1285
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:57,880
This whole sequence now is the ultimate
callback to the chopstick fight.

1286
01:15:58,421 --> 01:16:01,881
We've seen the game of keep away
and how effective that was.

1287
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:05,325
So Po is using that training
he got from Shifu,

1288
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:08,075
to do the ultimate game
of keep away with Tai Lung.

1289
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:12,064
We spent a lot of time wondering what
the shape of this battle would to be.

1290
01:16:12,635 --> 01:16:16,325
We'd had epic fights, the Shifu-Tai Lung
fight, the bridge fight,

1291
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:20,416
and so we were wondering
how big and crazy

1292
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,696
does this final fight have to be?
Do we set it in a volcano or

1293
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:27,606
what's the legendary setting that we're
going to have for this final battle?

1294
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,019
We realized Po's journey has
taken him from his noodle shop

1295
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,611
up to the world of kung fu
in the Jade Palace.

1296
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:40,312
And so what we needed to do
was retrace his steps.

1297
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,803
Take him back from the palace,

1298
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:45,562
in fact, the fight ends up at the door

1299
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,718
of the noodle restaurant.

1300
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:52,131
So we took it back through all
the places that Po had been,

1301
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,128
and re-incorporated ideas
we had seen in the film,

1302
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:58,674
now being repurposed by Po
in a different way.

1303
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:03,311
To use them as an effective battle
against Tai Lung.

1304
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:06,613
Whether it was the fireworks or

1305
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:09,955
the idea of the chopstick battle,
now used with woks.

1306
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:13,206
And we're coming up
on the most dramatic...

1307
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,711
Tai Lung has taken out
his aggression on Po,

1308
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,534
and is desiring the scroll,
he practically kills Po.

1309
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:22,456
He creates a crater around him.

1310
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,818
A circular crater,
circular language again.

1311
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:26,784
Tai Lung gets the scroll.

1312
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:30,217
The most important thing for us is,

1313
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:33,126
this battle could have
gone on for decades,

1314
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:37,359
we joked at one point
this would go on for two years...

1315
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:41,613
- The legendary battle.
- ...across the mountains of China.

1316
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,971
And we decided it was more significant
to end the battle here

1317
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,687
outside the noodle shop.

1318
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:49,619
Give this moment,
which was a truly heroic moment,

1319
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:53,525
as Po, the noble warrior,
offers the answer to Tai Lung.

1320
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:58,211
If Tai Lung were
to accept that answer...

1321
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:01,477
A shot at redemption if Tai Lung had
listened to Po's wisdom,

1322
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:05,544
he might not get...
into oblivion at the end.

1323
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:09,014
This is also the moment when
the playing field has been leveled.

1324
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:11,915
Now the secret is out,
the scroll is meaningless.

1325
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:15,721
And Po has to stand back up again
and fight without any advantage.

1326
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,508
Truly use only himself

1327
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:20,504
and what he has within himself,

1328
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,016
to see how this fight's going to work.

1329
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:27,589
It was important for the shape
of the fight to have that change occur,

1330
01:18:28,237 --> 01:18:31,427
where Po is now fighting with nothing
but his own skills, his own wits.

1331
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,281
Everything he's learned from Shifu,

1332
01:18:34,677 --> 01:18:36,487
his body...

1333
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:40,212
A lot of people have said
"Po's overweight."

1334
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:44,029
He's not overweight. Po is exactly
the right weight for a panda.

1335
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,163
And that's why he beats Tai Lung.

1336
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,870
Po is the peach.

1337
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:53,189
The soft, squishy peach
that Oogway was talking about.

1338
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,322
His soft and squidginess,
his bounciness,

1339
01:18:56,765 --> 01:19:00,515
his absorbency, all the things we've
seen, where he bounces down stairs,

1340
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,733
and can absorb all those things.

1341
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:09,242
His ability to redirect Tai Lung's hard
force back against him,

1342
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:11,621
using a martial art principle,

1343
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,084
that allows him to win.

1344
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,320
A mixture of some real martial arts

1345
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:20,036
and some very Tex Avery stuff.

1346
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,321
His most Tex Avery moment
in the whole movie,

1347
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,662
the cookie cut-out hole
that Tai Lung has smashed into.

1348
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:30,879
And what's great is we earned
the ability at this point

1349
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:33,137
to be as silly as that,

1350
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,245
as ridiculous as that, all the final
battle stuff we're doing,

1351
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:39,195
because we've been
so grounded throughout.

1352
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,778
And we allow ourselves
to get to this point

1353
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:45,134
where Tai Lung can climb out of
that hole and be messed up

1354
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,954
and be still on the attack to Po
and Po can get the advantage.

1355
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:51,535
We had a lot of discussion about

1356
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:54,376
what is the final thing
that's going to get...

1357
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,220
How do we get rid of the villain?

1358
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,966
We knew we had this
big fight Po would win,

1359
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,297
but we didn't know how he was going
to win, what he was going to do.

1360
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:02,527
but we didn't know how he was going
to win, what he was going to do.

1361
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,881
We had a belly blast that
sent Tai Lung through 15 buildings

1362
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:08,512
and he ended up in Po's bedroom.

1363
01:20:08,871 --> 01:20:12,591
And he looked up and saw all of
Po's fan stuff all over the walls

1364
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,515
and was completely confused.

1365
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:15,917
That didn't seem enough,

1366
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:20,425
we were questing around
for the definitive final thing

1367
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,133
that will get rid of our villain?

1368
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,615
And we found the answer
was already in the movie.

1369
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,599
Derek Dryman's Wuxi finger hold,

1370
01:20:29,892 --> 01:20:32,412
which we had implanted as

1371
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:37,078
this formidable, ultimate, who knows
what happens when you drop your pinkie,

1372
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:41,603
in the scene where
Shifu and Po first meet.

1373
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,374
It was obvious,

1374
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:45,945
or became obvious,
it wasn't obvious for a while,

1375
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,362
it became a thing we discovered.

1376
01:20:48,711 --> 01:20:52,751
That we should see what happens
when you drop the pinkie.

1377
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:56,861
And what happens when you drop
the pinkie is a mysterious,

1378
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,229
and obviously somewhat magical event.

1379
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:02,575
It harks back to
the circle language of the ripples,

1380
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:06,078
and also to the Oogway energy

1381
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:08,142
that he used in the nerve touches.

1382
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,040
It's actually, in some versions of it,

1383
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:14,897
when we were planning it, it ended up
looking like an atomic bomb explosion.

1384
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:17,897
We made the choice that,
since this is probably

1385
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:22,147
a really masterful kung fu technique,

1386
01:21:22,745 --> 01:21:24,474
it shouldn't look that destructive.

1387
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,620
It should look magical and benign.

1388
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:28,879
So we used golden light
and rings of energy

1389
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,268
to hark back to

1390
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,050
the water ripples in
Oogway's nerve touch.

1391
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:36,356
Just on a gigantic scale.

1392
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:38,652
We have no idea
what happened to Tai Lung,

1393
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,804
it's one of the mysteries of the movie,

1394
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,880
whether he's atomized,

1395
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,987
or what actually happened to him.

1396
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:51,960
Now we're coming up on my most
favorite part of the whole movie,

1397
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:55,251
and it definitely gets
the best audience response,

1398
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:59,991
this interchange between the dying Shifu

1399
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,519
and the returning hero.

1400
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,590
It's another cliched moment
that everyone expects.

1401
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,310
The master's going to die.
Everyone expects that

1402
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:14,152
we're going to follow suit with what you
would expect with this kind of movie.

1403
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:17,006
And we get a great moment from Dustin

1404
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:20,709
when it's revealed that even
in this moment of enlightenment,

1405
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:23,456
he's the same guy,
he's still the same character,

1406
01:22:23,839 --> 01:22:27,179
and a character can only grow so much,
can only have so much insight,

1407
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:30,579
and it's a really touching moment...

1408
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:34,463
...emotionally, because not only
do we feel like he's dying,

1409
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:38,137
but we get this great reversal and
it's such a joy that he's still alive!

1410
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:40,174
We cheat unapologetically.

1411
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:43,856
We told Dustin,
play it like you're dying.

1412
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:46,613
So we make the audience think that.

1413
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:50,945
Every time we've seen the film,
we've heard the audiences go, "Oh."

1414
01:22:51,567 --> 01:22:54,847
A little kid behind me said,
"Mommy, is Master Shifu dying?"

1415
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:56,830
The mom said, "Yes he is, honey."

1416
01:22:57,105 --> 01:23:00,674
And then, when he was still alive,
there was a huge laugh.

1417
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:03,523
The mom was shaking the kid,
"He's alive!"

1418
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:07,342
He's still the same. So, just to go back
to the first time we saw Po,

1419
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:09,492
he was upside down.

1420
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:09,983
Here at the end of the movie,
he's back upside down.

1421
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,474
Here at the end of the movie,
he's back upside down.

1422
01:23:12,888 --> 01:23:14,908
In a mix of gold for heroism

1423
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:17,097
and green for wisdom.

1424
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:19,506
He has completed his journey,

1425
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:21,202
under his own terms.

1426
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:23,893
And that says "Kung Fu Panda"
behind in the logo there.

1427
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:26,049
The Chinese characters.

1428
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:29,298
The idea here was we wanted
to bring back the 2-D

1429
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:33,281
as a call back to
the dream sequence.

1430
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,982
We wanted to give
the characters a curtain call

1431
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,075
in this great graphic environment.

1432
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:41,165
Book end the film

1433
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:44,320
with the language we've established
for heroes in Po's mind.

1434
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:47,246
The graphic, 2-D language.

1435
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:52,854
Now Po has earned
his place in that world, too.

1436
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:56,349
Plus, there's a lot of credits
in an animated film.

1437
01:23:56,765 --> 01:24:00,105
There's almost ten minutes of credit.
That's a lot real estate in the film,

1438
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:04,556
which has a brief running time
like our film has.

1439
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:07,393
So, we figured if we have
all that time,

1440
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:11,556
we might as well use it to try
and do something fun and artistic.

1441
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:15,307
Anybody who's watching the credits

1442
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:17,867
they should be seeing
something beautiful.

1443
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,910
Our 2-D animators, certainly our
3-D animators, on the show

1444
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:23,755
actually got the chance
to do some 2-D animation.

1445
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,558
All the shots you see of the characters

1446
01:24:26,962 --> 01:24:30,152
are done by a lot of our animators
who worked on the film.

1447
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:33,766
So it was a great way for them
to return to their roots.

1448
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:35,729
Flex that old 2-D muscle

1449
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:38,634
that's been a little bit
underused recently.

1450
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,914
But I think everyone
loves traditional animation.

1451
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,927
It was great to not only get the movie
in there, but to have

1452
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:47,456
our animators return
to their roots like that.

1453
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:51,626
We also wanted to honor everybody
who worked so hard on this movie.

1454
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:57,170
We wanted white type scrolling
against black for ten minutes.

1455
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,146
Which was not interesting to look at.

1456
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:03,399
We wanted to make sure people
were looking at the credits.

1457
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:06,995
Seeing the names of everybody who worked
on the film and made it great.

1458
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,232
And actually enjoying doing that.

1459
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:10,998
‘Cause it was beautiful art.

1460
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:13,263
We worked with a great company
called Shine,

1461
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:16,359
who helped to execute
these end credits.

1462
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:20,942
Working with Ramone and Tang, our
production designer and art director.

1463
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:25,503
That combination of those guys
and Shine.

1464
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:31,702
The sense that the story of our world
continues after this movie.

1465
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:35,004
We didn't want to have
the storytelling end.

1466
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:38,048
We have a definitive end to the movie,

1467
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:40,707
but we wanted to give the audience

1468
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:43,473
a little bit more time
with the characters.

1469
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:46,532
And hint at some call backs.

1470
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:51,165
We just wanted people to
enjoy the continuation.

1471
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:54,327
Something Amir Zaki does
in a lot of his films

1472
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:56,353
that we've found inspirational,

1473
01:25:56,652 --> 01:26:00,082
that sense that you just drop in
to see a story at a particular moment,

1474
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:02,582
that world was there
before you got there,

1475
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:05,824
and will continue afterwards,
we love that.

1476
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:08,693
We thought it would be
an interesting thing to do

1477
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:11,467
to try and indicate...

1478
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:16,304
Those are these little vignettes, where
Po is still working in the noodle shop,

1479
01:26:16,872 --> 01:26:20,352
and his father is playing
mahjong with Shifu and winning.

1480
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:24,249
Or that Tigress is having
a moment with Shifu

1481
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,920
so that her story has improved.

1482
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:28,652
Shifu's laughing.

1483
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:32,817
And Tigress is able to have
a bit more sense of humor

1484
01:26:33,422 --> 01:26:34,712
than we've seen in the film.

1485
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:37,176
All these little moments indicate

1486
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:40,079
the world has changed
for the better.

1487
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:42,394
It continues the way it always was.

1488
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:45,191
Because that is what is so nice
about Po's story.

1489
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,850
Is that he is basically the same guy
that he was in the beginning.

1490
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,211
He's a little bit more of that guy.

1491
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:55,170
Because he's allowing himself to take
his internal and make it external.

1492
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,733
He is the Dragon Warrior, but
working at his father's restaurant.

1493
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,384
serving noodles when
he's not saving the world.

1494
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:05,120
And Shifu is still a little bit on edge.

1495
01:27:05,654 --> 01:27:07,904
He's trying to learn
to be like Oogway every day,

1496
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:09,960
but he's still going to snap at Po.

1497
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:14,529
His dad is still going to care
about noodles and love his son.

1498
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:19,350
But everybody is hopefully... their
lives are just a little bit better.

1499
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:23,951
A little bit more relaxed, they know a
little bit more about each other.

1500
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:27,443
And hopefully we feel this world
that we're leaving

1501
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,688
is left with everybody

1502
01:27:31,146 --> 01:27:32,755
knowing more about themselves.

1503
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:34,947
That makes their lives better.

1504
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:38,823
Po, the thing we want people to feel,
the thing we don't necessarily show

1505
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:41,996
is that the world truly has changed
by Po's example.

1506
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,734
Because everyone has seen

1507
01:27:45,127 --> 01:27:49,197
this most unlikely character
become a kung fu master.

1508
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:52,111
Now they all hopefully will go back,

1509
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:55,811
whatever they believe or want
for themselves, they can pursue it.

1510
01:27:56,338 --> 01:27:59,148
He's enlightened everyone.
Whether you're trying to be a chef

1511
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:00,948
or an artist, whatever it is,

1512
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:04,139
that Po's example
is the most extreme example.

1513
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:06,603
And the most enlightened example.

1514
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,889
If you look, there's a shot of Po

1515
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:13,178
showing the children of the village,
these little rabbits,

1516
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:16,905
the blank scroll,
so they can see their reflection.

1517
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:21,426
For a thousand years
that secret has been withheld.

1518
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:25,060
And it's for the world to see.
Po is not going to withhold it,

1519
01:28:25,567 --> 01:28:28,377
he's going to let everyone see it,
he let Tai Lung see it.

1520
01:28:28,837 --> 01:28:29,887
That was the lesson,

1521
01:28:30,105 --> 01:28:32,794
that Oogway had to wait
for somebody like Po

1522
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:34,531
to come along to understand,

1523
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:37,356
that a warrior wouldn't have
necessarily got there.

1524
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:40,409
Po, not being a warrior,

1525
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:43,839
but Po just being himself,
he does understand.

1526
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,859
He's allowing everybody to see
their true potential.

1527
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,293
And hopefully believe

1528
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,375
that they can accomplish
whatever their dream might be.

1529
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,228
Let's thank our editorial department.

1530
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,079
it's not just post-production.

1531
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:02,467
They truly are editing the movie
from the very beginning

1532
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:05,160
and they are the last ones
to leave the project.

1533
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:07,957
They're like the Marines.
First in, last out.

1534
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,300
It's amazing.

1535
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:14,625
There's never a break. We're always
building towards a screening,

1536
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:16,830
some important deadline,

1537
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:20,578
so they're always working around
the clock and on weekends.

1538
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,322
I don't know how they do it.

1539
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:24,637
So, to Clare Knight,

1540
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:27,513
and CK Horness,
and Jeremy Shipp,

1541
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:31,999
and everybody in editorial,
thank you.

1542
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:34,854
There's no movie without you guys.

1543
01:29:35,237 --> 01:29:37,577
You worked like champs
to make this film happen.

1544
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:42,809
And, of course, the other departments
that we should have mentioned,

1545
01:29:43,445 --> 01:29:44,785
that we didn't talk about,

1546
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,826
we have Alex Parkinson,

1547
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,090
he wore many hats on our show.

1548
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:54,607
He did an amazing job of coordinating
many painstaking aspects of our film,

1549
01:29:55,257 --> 01:29:56,456
to make sure that

1550
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:59,531
when we wanted a crowd scene,
we'd be able to have a crowd scene.

1551
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:02,925
We'd have those details
and bits and pieces taken care of.

1552
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,148
A lot of what those guys do
is invisible to most people,

1553
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:09,851
because you just accept it
as being right and natural,

1554
01:30:10,372 --> 01:30:12,982
but, getting the cloth
to fall over the fur or

1555
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,748
to get the crowd
to interact with each other,

1556
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:20,469
and not collide or go through
or any of those things

1557
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:23,612
that would totally break
your belief in the world,

1558
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:26,982
were handled by Alex and his team

1559
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:29,855
completely invisibly.

1560
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,657
So you could just enjoy the story.
But they were incredibly difficult.

1561
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:36,035
For the most part,

1562
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:38,973
the clothing system was designed

1563
01:30:39,401 --> 01:30:42,771
to follow the characters and allow the
characters to move a lot.

1564
01:30:43,305 --> 01:30:46,235
There was so much hand animation
that had to occur

1565
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:48,348
to make all the cloth look perfect.

1566
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:52,153
I love this little moment where Po
has got an action figure of himself.

1567
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:54,494
He's now carved his own action figure.

1568
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:57,066
He's now, he really is
the theme of the movie,

1569
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,152
which is: he is his own hero.

1570
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,384
He's his own fan boy.

1571
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:04,508
He's got his own model of himself
to prove it.

1572
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:08,226
So, 1 want to talk about the cookie.

1573
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:12,830
We didn't want it to be a joke.
We wanted it to be

1574
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,488
an end of the story between
Po and Shifu.

1575
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:19,112
Beautifully animated by Ben Willis.

1576
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,784
They're friends and Po's question,
"Do you want to get something to eat?"

1577
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,971
Well, yes they do and they're doing it
under the peach tree,

1578
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:28,584
which is returning to life.

1579
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:32,519
Weill see the new peach tree
is starting to sprout.

1580
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:35,718
And we leave our heroes,
looking over the valley

1581
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:39,527
as two friends,
under Oogway's peach tree.

1582
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:43,021
For me, John Stevenson,
one of the directors of Kung Fu Panda.

1583
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,607
- And...
- Mark Osborne, the other director,

1584
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:47,637
we say thank you.

1585
01:31:47,936 --> 01:31:49,196
- Be your own hero.
- Yes.

1586
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:52,337
And always, always,
look within for the answer.
