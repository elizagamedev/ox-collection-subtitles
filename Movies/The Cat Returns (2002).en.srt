lf you find yourself troubled

4
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,881
by something mysterious

5
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,939
or a problem that's hard to solve

6
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,437
there's a place you can go

7
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,617
a place where...

8
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,119
Oh no!

9
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,715
Haru, are you awake?

10
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:00,897
Just got up!

11
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,191
Good

12
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,535
Morning

13
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,012
Really...

14
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,267
Why bother to set
your alarm clock?

15
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,872
Bye

16
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,514
Aren't you having breakfast?
It's so delicious

17

Ooh, so delicious

18
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,633
Not fair

19
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,261
Bye

20
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,268
My shoe!

21
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,164
Excuse me

22
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,715
Oh no!

23
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,027
The Kingdom is now gone

24
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,447
Yet the mountains and rivers remain

25
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,173
The castle draped in the

26
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,122
Dense greens of spring

27
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:19,865
Miss Yoshioka

28
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,187
You don't have time to sneak in
just get to your seat

29
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,373
Yes sir

30
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,982
Caught again

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:54,070
The Cat Returns

32
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,105
l hate this

33
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,147
Late again and embarrassed
in front of the whole class

34
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,463
Machida was laughing at me too

35
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,078
He was laughing

36
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,587
Why?

37
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,632
What's wrong with me?

38
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,785
Well, this must be a sign

39
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,085
Something even worse
is about to begin

40
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,615
Thanks for the sympathy

41
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,809
That's an unusual cat

42
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,753
What's so great about Machida?

43
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,996
He's just so cool!

44
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,051
Have you told him that?

45
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,745
He seems to have a girlfriend

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,247
She's a freshman and
very good-looking

47
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,590
So you already know

48
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,691
In case you get dumped
I'm ready to console you

49
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,504
Thanks a lot

50
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,776
l think Tsuge is cool

51
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,529
Good, if he dumps you...

52
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,338
Had something in his mouth

53
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,433
Stolen goods?

54
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,346
Hmmm...

55
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,086
What's he doing?

56
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,673
Hey cat! Watch out!

57
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,035
Anyway, it's just a cat

58
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,558
Hey, that’s dangerous

59
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,112
Oh no. what's he doing?

60
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,048
Wait. Haru!

61
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,972
Good going Haru!

62
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,886
Hey! Stop that truck!

63
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,287
Cat...

64
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,399
Are you OK?

65
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,361
Thank you for saving me
from a dangerous situation

66
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,210
l hope you haven't injured yourself

67
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,315
Please excuse me, but
l really must be going now

68
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,445
Allow me to express
my gratitude later

69
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,387
Don't mention it

70
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,452
Haru!

71
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,883
Ah, you broke it

72
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,931
Never mind, a cat's life is
more important

73
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,407
Did you see that?

74
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,176
Huh?

75
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,051
The cat bowed to me

76
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,564
Haru...did you hit your head?

77
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,147
I'm home

78
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,511
Don't step on that!

79
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,496
Sorry. ] can't decide
which pattern to use

80
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,080
Honey, can you make dinner?

81
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,053
Mom

82
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,995
Can cats talk?

83
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,816
Well.. let's see

84
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,089
What !?

85
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,848
Come to think of it
you said so before

86
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:40,896
Really?

87
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,441
When you were very small

88
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,635
you used to say
“lL can talk with cats”

89
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,176
Did I?

90
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,157
Yes, don’t you remember?

91
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,043
What's wrong?

92
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,700
l see, you're hunery

93
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,549
Do you like fish?

94
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,082
OK, take these

95
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,786
You're so dirty...

96
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,575
Good?

97
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,046
OK. OK

98
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,899
More?

99
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,277
Good girl

100
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,182
Eat them all

101
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,723
No need to thank me

102
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:49,972
Haru

103
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,823
Oh. Mom!

104
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,449
What were you doing?

105
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,441
Talking with a cat

106
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,698
Remember asked you what did you
talk about with the cat?

107
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,076
Then you said. “she told me it's
tough to make a living in this world”

108
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,437
and I thought it was so funny

109
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,602
I guess that did happen

110
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,033
Anyway, I'll get up
early tomorrow

111
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,629
in time for breakfast

112
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,166
Uhm,..over here please

113
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,097
A little closer

114
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,872
Allow me to introduce

115
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,223
The King of the Kingdom of Cats

116
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,360
A King among Kings

117
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,802
The Cat King

118
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,338
That's me

119
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,968
The cat you saved today was

120
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,320
the son of the King, Prince Lune

121
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,145
Given the importance
of the matter,

122
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,371
the King himself has come to
show his gratitude

123
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,917
Uh... mmm...

124
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,768
Thank you

125
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,521
This is the program

126
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:29,988
From tomorrow,

127
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,599
countless joys will befall you

128
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:37,866
Thank you

129
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,370
See you

130
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,572
A dream?

131
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,245
You're saying...

132
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,149
it really wasn't you
who did this?

133
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,040
l have no idea

134
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,265
Then who did it?

135
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,487
Haru!

136
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,181
Haru, hurry up!

137
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,167
What is this!

138
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,891
Cattails!

139
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,040
Oh. I work too hard.
I'll ba in bed today

140
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,537
No!

141
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,109
Why?

142
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,551
Haru, it's this one, see?

143
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,625
Morning!
Sorry, got to run

144
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,074
What's she up to?

145
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,925
You think she has catnip?

146
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,784
Catnip? Why?

147
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:23,956
Don't know

148
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,995
Hey Yoshioka!
Leave your cats at home

149
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,308
They're not mine

150
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,328
What is this?

151
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,766
It wasn't a dream

152
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,742
It was those cats that did this

153
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,627
Was it a mistake to save a cat?

154
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,271
Haru

155
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,718
Wha...What is it?

156
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,887
Did you get rid of
the catnip smell?

157
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,903
Yeah, it seems OK

158
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,699
and the cats aren't after me
anymore

159
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,271
That's good

160
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,055
Yeah

161
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,938
Say, can l ask you a favor?

162
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,656
Can you take my turn
for clean-up?

163
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,070
Tsuge has a game today

164
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,651
and I can't make it if I don't
leave right now

165
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,007
Please!

166
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,615
Oh... sure...

167
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,954
Clean-up, right?

168
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,780
Thank you Haru!

169
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,659
Tsuge! Go for it!

170
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,560
Hurray Tsuge!
You're so cool!

171
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,578
Be careful of the step

172
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,382
Thanks

173
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,478
Ouch, that hurt

174
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,943
Oh no!

175
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,048
What a mess

176
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,704
Uh oh

177
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,738
What on earth am doing here?

178
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,589
There you are,
Miss Haru, Miss Haru

179
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,436
You cats! One thing after
another all morning

180
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,899
We're glad you're pleased

181
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,269
NOT!

182
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,380
Why is that!?

183
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,498
This project has been taken
on by the whole kingdom

184
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,131
to express our maximum gratitude!

185
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,030
What are you saying?

186
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,072
don't eat mice

187
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,764
] don't like cattails or catnip

188
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,367
Oh, is that so...

189
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,746
Excuse our ignorance

190
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,471
This is unexpected

191
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,241
How shall] report to the King?

192
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,094
Sorry, did l hurt you?

193
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,983
Maybe ! said too much

194
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,130
To tell the truth, a lot
happened to me recently

195
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,824
Such as?

196
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,073
Such as many things

197
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,980
l see, is that so?

198
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,887
Even a beautiful lady like
Miss Haru has troubles

199
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,870
Again...that's enough

200
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,505
No, it isn't enough

201
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,347
We can't stop now

202
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,005
We'll do our best to
make you satisfied

203
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,694
You have more?

204
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:18,973
Yes

205
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:23,514
Please come visit us in
the Kingdom of Cats

206
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,646
The Kingdom of Cats?

207
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,029
It's a nice place

208
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,011
Lots of natural scenery
and good food

209
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,853
The whole Kingdom will
welcome Miss Haru

210
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:37,976
And what's more

211
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,168
The King is expecting

212
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,513
Prince Lune, who you
saved yesterday,

213
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,100
to welcome Miss Haru
as his bride

214
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,466
No way! That's impossible

215
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,553
The Prince is a cat

216
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,385
What's the problem?

217
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,337
He is a cat but he’s cool!

218
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,168
Cool?

219
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,165
Well...

220
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,000
A Kingdom of Cats might be good

221
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,506
Just laying around all day

222
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,738
Exactly!

223
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,461
It might be heaven

224
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,476
Eat tons of great food
then have a nap,

225
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,132
forget all your troubles...

226
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,685
But a cat's bride...
that's going too far

227
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,690
Even if he is a prince, that's...

228
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:37,536
Huh?

229
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,519
Well then, we'll come
for you tonight

230
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,432
What do you mean?

231
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:45,424
Hey! Wait!

232
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,199
Ouch

233
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,946
That really hurts

234
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,682
Wait, give me time to think

235
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,464
That is to say...in a word...

236
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,160
What can I do?
I'm sure those cats will do it

237
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,213
They'll take me to
the Kingdom of Cats

238
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,441
They'll make me the cat's bride

239
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,785
No, no, no! Never!

240
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,271
Haru

241
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:17,825
Haru

242
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:19,761
Who is it?

243
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,579
Haru, the Cat Business Office

244
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,604
Find the Cat Business Office

245
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,620
Not this

246
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,526
Who is this?

247
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,294
What is the Cat Business Office

248
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,220
I'm sure they'll help you

249
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,982
A large white cat at the Crossroad
will show you the way

250
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,826
A large white cat...

251
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,418
Haru, go to the Crossroad

252
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,598
and find the Cat Business Office

253
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,725
Never heard of
the Cat Business Office

254
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,872
A large white cat...

255
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,254
But the voice was beautiful.
Might be a nice white cat

256
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,004
Oh, I'm tired

257
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,278
I'm taking a break

258
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,978
What? What is it?

259
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,633
What's this big fat cat

260
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,947
What are you doing here?

261
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,471
A large white cat!

262
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:37,639
Is this it?

263
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,585
Hey you. do you know
the Cat Business Office?

264
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,438
I need your help

265
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,933
I mistook you for a different person...
oops, a different cat

266
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,050
I'm sorry l sat on you

267
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,246
Follow me

268
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,568
You are the one

269
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,172
Hey, wait for me!

270
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,179
Hey, isn't there an easier way?

271
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,579
Is this revenge?

272
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,658
Because I said you're fat?

273
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,756
What a strange place

274
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,243
Where's the Cat Business Office?

275
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,032
Are you listening?

276
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,899
l have a big problem

277
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,739
These cats are taking me
to their kingdom!

278
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,061
Is... this...

279
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,744
Hey, Baron!
You got a visitor!

280
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,086
Cut the theatrics and just come out!

281
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,414
Welcome to the Cat Business Office!

282
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,407
Cool...

283
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:04,069
This place is in a dimension
a little differant from yours,

284
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,570
a world for beings who have souls

285
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,339
When people create something

286
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,988
with all their heart and hopes.
the creation is given a soul,

287
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,619
like me and him

288
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,026
Oh my gosh!

289
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,758
Ha is Toto, a gargoyle with a soul

290
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,181
Baron, it's quite rare for you
to have a visitor

291
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,851
Yes, and a quite charming one,
don't you think?

292
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,640
Baron...?

293
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,280
I'm Baron Humbert von Gikkingen

294
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,089
The person who created me named me so

295
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,235
So that's why you're called Baron

296
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,207
l heard your story

297
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,079
Trouble with some cats from
the Cat Kingdom?

298
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,129
That's right

299
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,793
l saved a cat from being run over

300
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,562
Now they're saying. in return.
they want to take me to their kingdom

301
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:01,842
In return?

302
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,711
Heh, it figures,

303
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,770
too kind for your own good

304
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,808
You shouldn't have bothered

305
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,171
Your mind is nasty as ever, Muta

306
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,639
You can't appreciate the kindness
which saved a cat

307
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,358
And she is in trouble for it, right?

308
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,530
Never mix in somebody else's business

309
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,987
Where did you meet this girl?

310
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,373
At the Crossroad place

311
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,671
She already knew about this place

312
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:32,994
Hmmm

313
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,499
Uh, I heard a voice,

314
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,385
though ] don't know who it was

315
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:39,276
A voice?

316
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,655
You listened to some strange voice!?

317
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,557
How naive can you get... Yeow!

318
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,312
What are you doing?

319
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,377
Why don't you hold your tongue!

320
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,266
You stay out of this... !!

321
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,071
Don't fight because of me...

322
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,912
You said your name was...?

323
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,564
Oh, it's Haru.
My name is Haru

324
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,050
Okay, Haru.
Plaase do come in

325
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,681
Don't worry about them

326
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,533
You lousy black bird!

327
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,964
Don't you even know I'm a crow?

328
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,173
Come out from the dark, you fowl!

329
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,293
Nobody can miss a giant
marshmallow like you!

330
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,636
You big hog of a cat!

331
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,498
Go get fried, chicken wings!

332
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:19,991
Shut up, moo shoo pork!

333
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,989
Pollo loco

334
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,812
I'm coming in

335
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,089
Oh... This place is gorgeous

336
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,419
Now, do come in and have a seat

337
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:36,487
Thank you

338
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,003
Any lemon or milk with your tea?

339
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,195
Milk, please

340
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,425
You have a beautiful office

341
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,168
Here you are

342
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,336
Thank you

343
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,486
Cute

344
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,042
It's my special bland

345
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:05,268
Can't guarantee the flavor though,
it's different each time

346
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:09,714
This is good!

347
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,125
This is really good

348
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,733
Then, you're lucky

349
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,555
How can you drink green leaves?

350
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:19,863
Too refined for your
tongue, I bet

351
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,782
Go catch a worm, bird

352
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,287
Muta...

353
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,401
Tell me about
the Kingdom of Cats again

354
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,007
That whole place is fake,
a place for

355
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:33,339
those who don't have
a mind of their own

356
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,155
Mind of their own...

357
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,604
One of the Cat King’s men said,

358
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,943
they want me to marry their Prince...

359
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,643
Why not?
A cat's bride?

360
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:44,841
What !?

361
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,517
Might not be so bad

362
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,095
This is going nowhere

363
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,070
Could be an interesting experience

364
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:51,466
l see

365
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,268
I did want to visit
the Kingdom of Cats once

366
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,263
This might be a good opportunity

367
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:02,295
How brave of you, Baron.
but think I'll give it a miss

368
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,208
You are coming with me

369
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,136
No thanks. It's not my territory

370
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,029
You're not taking her, are you?

371
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,389
That won't be wise

372
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,181
But I can't leave her here all alone

373
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,515
Babysitting isn't my thing either

374
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:21,823
Are you busy?

375
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,137
Not really

376
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:25,302
Um, 1 think I'll go home

377
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,236
I'm just making trouble for all of you

378
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,257
I started all this mess

379
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,608
l have to solve this myself

380
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,005
l see

381
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,367
I'm sorry
] couldn't be of any help

382
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,255
Okay, okay, I'll do it

383
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,606
I'll just hang around for a while

384
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,168
You're a good cat, Muta!

385
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,080
It's set then

386
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,878
Haru, you can come back now

387
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,257
But...

388
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,844
Muta complains a lot

389
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,317
but doesn't actually mean it

390
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,199
l see

391
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,624
He is actually nice then

392
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,022
That's right

393
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,277
I'm not listening

394
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,507
Thank you for your help,

395
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,018
Moota

396
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,333
Moota?
Did you say Moo!?

397
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,022
Are you saying ! am a fat cow!

398
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,747
No, you're just fat...oops!

399
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,756
Ha ha. This girl is not bad

400
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,428
No way I am going to halp!

401
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:31,383
Didn't we have some delicious
chiffon cake in the cupboard?

402
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,167
Where?

403
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:34,885
On the upper right shelf

404
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,350
Why didn't you say so

405
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,603
Let's have a piece before we start

406
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,287
I'll go get my special
mulberries then!

407
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,709
It seems like this is
going to be fun

408
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,697
Let me help too

409
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,745
Haru, you need to think about

410
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,157
how you can learn to be yourself

411
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,888
Then, you should have nothing to fear

412
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,525
Okay

413
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,000
Baron! Give me a hand. I'm putting
some whipped cream on top

414
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:09,904
We're really going full-scale

415
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,428
Of course we are

416
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,936
Maybe, I'll find something here

417
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:19,384
Yes

418
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:20,794
ls that Toto at the door?

419
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,151
Miss Haru, we have come for you

420
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,241
No!

421
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,812
What is this?

422
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:38,956
Not good

423
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,679
You promised to help me!

424
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:48,603
Baron, horde of cats headed this way

425
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,410
You're blind as a bat!

426
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,462
After them!

427
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,332
Owwwww...

428
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,261
Miss Haru. we looked
all over for you!

429
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,106
I'm going home

430
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,283
Careful!

431
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,795
Let me off! Take me back!

432
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,139
lam going back, this instant!

433
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,994
You must be having
pre-marriage blues

434
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,828
lam not!

435
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,221
Things got a bit out of hand

436
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:23,694
Owwwwww

437
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,099
Hey, you, wait, ouch, let go!

438
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,619
Muta, and Baron!

439
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,464
Let go, I'm telling you!

440
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,091
Toto, now!

441
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,267
Don't let go!

442
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:38,892
Why did we get out of the way!

443
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,327
No choice

444
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,322
I'm really mad now!

445
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,048
Yeay!

446
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,669
This is over the weight limit!

447
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:50,648
Toto!

448
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:51,796
I see it

449
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,212
Where are you going !?

450
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,300
Out-maneuvered

451
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:23,043
Go up

452
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:23,995
OK

453
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,389
Now what?

454
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,443
The wind. Follow the lights

455
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:44,782
OK!

456
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,064
Ooooh...

457
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,337
I landed on my back...

458
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,515
Why?

459
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,301
Where am I?

460
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,628
Muta? Did you get bigger?

461
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:18,627
No, you got smaller

462
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:22,163
Why?

463
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,378
Because we're here

464
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,285
This is the Kingdom of Cats?

465
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:57,988
This is it

466
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,073
Wow, cats really live here

467
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,163
Well, this is their kingdom.
you know

468
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:28,712
Hey, come on

469
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,265
Ahh, it's so nice and relaxing here

470
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,095
We should find a way out
and go back

471
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,238
Just a little longer

472
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,492
Let's get going

473
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,127
But...it feels so nice

474
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,736
No! You must go back at once

475
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,218
Hurry. Run away!

476
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,639
Hey, what a pretty cat

477
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,835
Even the cats are prettier here

478
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,204
Please, you have
no time to lose!

479
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,496
Haru, you are not meant
to be here

480
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,816
Why do you know my name?

481
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,258
Miss Haru!

482
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,188
It's that cat again

483
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,430
lam so relieved to find you

484
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:23,225
Seems we dropped you
when coming in

485
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,212
Your servant exceeded
our weight limit

486
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,685
Servant!?

487
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,194
No no, this is Muta

488
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,609
Shall we? A banquet is being
prepared in your honor

489
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,096
You are welcome to join us, Moota

490
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:39,029
Moota? Moo?

491
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:40,667
But ...

492
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,038
His Majesty is waiting
at the palace

493
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,165
Palace?

494
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,069
The palace is right over there

495
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,475
Oh, really

496
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,759
Yes, indeed

497
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,899
Hey, you're not thinking of...

498
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,439
Maybe it's rude not to
greet the King first

499
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,971
Are you out of your mind?
Let's go!

500
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:00,871
Please, this way

501
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,072
Wait

502
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,281
Can she come with us?

503
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,411
What is your name?

504
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,132
Yuki, sir. l serve at
the royal table

505
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,995
So you work at the palace

506
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,621
Miss Haru, you'll see her later

507
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,067
Okay, I'll see you again

508
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,465
Haru

509
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,909
What's that? Creepy!

510
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:06,481
There's my future daughter-in-law

511
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,837
Well, [ must go see her in person!

512
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,469
He's strangely familiar

513
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,697
Please change before
meeting the King

514
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,460
I need to change clothes?

515
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,038
Plaase wait in the next room

516
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,547
Why can't I go in with her?

517
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:44,642
Don't be gross

518
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,026
Gross?

519
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,913
We prepared refreshments for you

520
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,420
Okay, I'll wait

521
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,093
Not bad

522
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,781
The dress is very becoming on you

523
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,640
Prince Lune is the idol of all
female cats in this Kingdom

524
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,420
You'll be very happy with him

525
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,580
Really?

526
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,714
l mean, no, that's not why I'm here

527
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,944
You look lovely

528
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,634
You are the purrfect bride for Lune

529
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,259
Natoru, who is that cat?

530
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,334
A servant named Moota, I believe

531
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,690
Moota?

532
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,989
Never heard of him

533
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,304
No match for my stomach

534
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,252
Um, ! am sorry but

535
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,884
l can't really accept marriage to...

536
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,594
l thought you already said yes?

537
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:15,518
That was what I was told

538
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,984
Where is the Prince?

539
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,173
He is away at an official function

540
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,101
Anyway, I don't really know him

541
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,486
And the Prince, he is a cat, right?

542
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,050
I'm not a cat, so
l can't marry him

543
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,674
That, you don't need to
worry about

544
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,647
You already are a cat

545
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,308
Wow, real cat ears

546
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,989
I'm a CAT!!

547
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,523
Muta, where are you?

548
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,618
What happened to him?

549
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,727
He insisted on having
a bowl full and

550
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,635
dunked himself in catnip jelly

551
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:22,453
He didn't have to die like this!

552
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,411
Muta, how could you
do this to me?

553
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,151
...the banquet is ready to begin

554
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,220
No! 1 don't want to leave him

555
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,455
Then, he will come with us

556
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,704
Is this Miss Haru?

557
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,705
She has a perfect pair of ears!

558
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,851
Such full, attractive paws!

559
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,710
l was told you don't like mice,

560
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,220
so l have prepared
fresh fish for you

561
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,627
Miss Haru doesn't seam pleased

562
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,767
What do we have
for entertainment?

563
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,259
1 will bring them in

564
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,556
l want something more amusing

565
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,487
Next!

566
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,109
Can't you do anything better !?

567
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,397
shall amuse Miss Haru

568
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,920
What should we do?

569
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,028
Why not?

570
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,249
Shall we dance?

571
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,103
I can't dance meow

572
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:30,535
Oh no, I even sound like a cat!

573
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:34,141
... trust me

574
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,033
They dance well together

575
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,658
What is this...

576
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,091
I never felt like this before

577
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,361
Being a cat might
not be that bad

578
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,272
No, Haru. Don't lose yourself

579
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,704
You must learn to be yourself

580
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,540
I already told you that.
didn't I?

581
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,731
You are...

582
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:11,173
Stop this music!

583
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,761
You suspicious cat

584
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:25,364
Exactly who are you?

585
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:28,891
Apologies for my
belated introduction

586
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,940
There is nothing to fear

587
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,233
] am Humbert von Gikkingen

588
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:45,862
l have come for Haru

589
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,097
Baron!

590
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,861
Can this be?

591
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,410
What?

592
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:51,928
No way

593
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:52,816
Guards, get him!

594
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:08,868
] can't eat anymore

595
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,810
It's alive!

596
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,908
Yeay, Muta, you're alive

597
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:15,312
Uh oh

598
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:18,636
Stop, you scoundrel!

599
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,006
Take His Majesty
to a safe place!

600
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,339
Don't let him get away

601
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,979
Guests’ emergency exit this way

602
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:37,634
Out of my way!

603
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:39,399
Muta, you're strong!

604
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,191
I didn't start it

605
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,315
This way

606
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,275
You're the cat...

607
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,747
Baron, ! knew you would come

608
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,407
How do you know me?

609
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,069
I've heard about you
and your Office

610
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:58,745
If [ had listened to you,

611
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,619
this wouldn't have happened

612
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:05,823
If you leave before dawn,
you can still become human

613
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:07,437
Really?

614
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,862
A secret passage to the outside

615
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:11,007
This is convenient

616
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:12,632
What about Muta?

617
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,299
He'll be all right.
Haru, hurry

618
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:25,365
Yes

619
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,850
This is the back of the castle

620
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,664
Top of that tower leads to the exit

621
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,591
It's so tall!

622
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:46,357
You must go through the ruins
to the tower and then climb up

623
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,484
We'll make it

624
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,806
Good, Plaase take care of Haru

625
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:53,773
Wait

626
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,567
She is gone. ] haven't even
thanked her yet

627
00:48:58,202 --> 00:49:00,542
Haru, this is just my guess

628
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:04,191
but isn't she the one
who led you to me?

629
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:08,717
Haru, the Cat Business Office

630
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,320
Yes, that beautiful voice was hers

631
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,920
But why?

632
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,300
Because of you, ! almost died

633
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,437
Must hurry now

634
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,315
Right

635
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,288
You guys, listen to me

636
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,839
Did they go in?

637
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,812
Yes, Your Majesty

638
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,259
Purrfect

639
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,030
That labyrinth was built with
our state-of-the-art technology

640
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,153
We'll enjoy the view from here

641
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:57,303
Tricky

642
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:58,815
The sun is still high, though

643
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:00,763
It's always daytime here

644
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:02,301
What? It is?

645
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,290
It's probably past
midnight outside

646
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,069
Then, we have to hurry!

647
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,711
This way? That way?

648
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:11,721
Which way should we go?

649
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:15,805
They are lost

650
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,899
It won't be easy to
get out of there

651
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,273
Right, Your Majesty?

652
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,245
Yes...we have nothing
to worry about

653
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:24,848
Where are the soldiers?

654
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:25,959
Over there

655
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,430
Let's go this way

656
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:32,741
We must keep trying.
one by one

657
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:34,874
Keep your eyes on the tower

658
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,475
You won't lose your way

659
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:37,921
Smart

660
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,969
Muta, you're cheating

661
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:42,895
Why get lost just ‘cause
it's a maze

662
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,377
There he is!

663
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:48,227
Why does it have to be me?

664
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,515
Let's hurry while he keeps
them busy

665
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,404
Right

666
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,669
Why do I have to be the bait!

667
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,545
Get back, Haru!

668
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:29,683
You're strong!

669
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:31,975
Your cane got bent?

670
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,712
I was going to buy
a new one anyway

671
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:36,936
Used is best

672
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:45,835
Nice shot!

673
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,146
It hit one of ours!

674
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,230
What?

675
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,575
Your Maiesty,
how could you?

676
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,647
Don't tell anyone, okay?

677
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:00,883
Excuse me, sir

678
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,712
Our men are all scattered

679
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,921
They are all lost

680
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,250
Where is Haru?

681
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,962
They already got that far!

682
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,060
Hi!

683
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,224
Welcome back

684
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,226
How's that way?

685
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,520
It's a dead end

686
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,948
Everything as planned

687
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,860
Is this another dead end?

688
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,695
It's getting more difficult

689
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,803
Something's wrong! There was
no wall here a minute ago

690
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,776
It must be your imagination

691
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,318
No, we walked through here

692
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,667
Are you saying that
walls have feet?

693
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:01,731
This is no wall

694
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:02,999
It's fake

695
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:15,722
See?

696
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,186
Good work, Haru!

697
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:18,631
What is all this?

698
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,930
] told them not to get in line!

699
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,448
They are getting away!

700
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,257
Your Majesty, wait!

701
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:42,073
Go ahead, I'll catch up with you

702
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,444
Show off!

703
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:51,204
No, Baron...

704
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:52,012
Don't worry!

705
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,498
Your Majesty, please,
it's dangerous

706
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,114
I can't let this happen!

707
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:19,156
l have soldiers waiting
in the tower, just in case

708
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:24,153
Brilliant move!

709
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,468
Good, good

710
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,716
I'm afraid the tower's
getting old...

711
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,778
This is not good at all!

712
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,674
We have no choice
but use THAT

713
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:56,147
What? No, not that!

714
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:59,107
If you do that. Your Majesty,
your image will go to shambles

715
00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:00,523
Give me the button!

716
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,514
There is no such thing here

717
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,036
Here's the remote control

718
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,285
Yeay, we came out
to an opening

719
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:11,810
Just a bit more

720
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:16,382
Now!

721
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:22,866
What?

722
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:23,723
Hold on!

723
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,459
That was a great spectacle!

724
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,590
Let's go!

725
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,173
We're back on the ground

726
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,159
Let's see how things go

727
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:55,935
We have no choice

728
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,562
Come on, come on

729
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,407
Gikkingen. nice to see you again

730
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:10,024
Haru! We'll go back to
the castle right away

731
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,100
Being a cat is not so bad

732
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,760
Do I have to learn to like mice?

733
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,995
It's too early to give up

734
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:37,865
What's all this?

735
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,099
Father!

736
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:44,829
Lune, you're back already?

737
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,435
His Highness the Prince!
As you were!

738
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:49,275
Prince?

739
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:57,769
l hurried back thanks to Yuki

740
00:56:58,215 --> 00:56:59,475
What is all this?

741
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:02,015
Haru

742
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,580
Oh, Yuki

743
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,281
I'm glad we made it

744
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,810
Err, ] just wanted to thank her

745
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,723
I thought you'd be happy

746
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,450
to have Haru as your bride

747
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,576
You don't need to
worry about me

748
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,818
Il want to marry Yuki

749
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:24,203
What !?

750
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:25,901
Looks like news to everyone

751
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:27,436
This Prince is not bad

752
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,076
Yuki, look

753
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:36,568
l went to your old
home to find this

754
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,756
Oh, could this be
what I think it is?

755
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,450
Those cookies...
used to love those

756
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:50,577
That's right

757
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:55,208
These are the fish cookies you gave
me when [ was an orphan kitten

758
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,042
That kitten, that was you!

759
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,628
You're so beautiful now that
I didn't recognize you

760
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:03,336
Yuki

761
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,504
Will you accept these as a token

762
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:08,446
of our life together from now on

763
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,797
That means

764
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,560
you two are getting married?

765
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,441
Oh. l am so happy
for you Yuki!

766
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:21,947
Thank you, Haru!

767
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:25,173
If l hadn't met you then,

768
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,788
l could have starved
on the streets

769
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,924
You also saved ma from danger

770
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:34,627
I didn't know you were the person
Yuki told me so much about

771
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:37,219
You saved both of our lives

772
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,154
How can we thank you?

773
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,026
I don't want anything

774
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:43,218
You two made me
so happy already

775
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,060
Saving a cat was a good thing

776
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,850
This is such a moving sight

777
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:56,043
So you already had a fiancée

778
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,752
I didn't know,
but that is all right

779
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:02,038
Haru, you must be disappointed

780
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,089
Not really

781
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,930
No need to be polite.
If you can't marry my son,

782
00:59:06,343 --> 00:59:08,042
why don't you marry me?

783
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:11,063
You can eat all the cookies

784
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,191
and fishes you want

785
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:15,905
How about it?

786
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:19,043
Just put me back
to the way I was

787
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,106
That depends on your answer

788
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,777
Are you out of your mind!?

789
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:31,084
Of course ! don't want
to marry you

790
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,968
You pervert!

791
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:37,413
Why can't you...?

792
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,767
This is hilarious!

793
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:45,701
It's out of the question!

794
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,256
l admire a woman with
a mind of her own

795
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,199
You found yourself an ally

796
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,979
I, Renaldo Moon will
lend you a hand!

797
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:56,429
Renaldo?

798
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,680
Renaldo Moon?

799
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,421
That Renaldo Moon?

800
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,038
That's it!

801
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:01,911
Who?

802
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,499
Have you forgotten,
Your Majesty?

803
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:07,014
The worst, most notorious crime
in this Kingdom's history!

804
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,294
A cat suddenly came from nowhere

805
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,946
and devoured all the fish
in the lake and escaped

806
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,155
the criminal of the century,
Renaldo Moon!

807
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:16,515
Unbelievable...

808
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:17,856
He's a monster

809
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,745
Muta, you did this?
Disgraceful

810
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,098
I'll eat the whole castle this time!

811
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,795
Take His Majesty to a safe place!

812
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:32,888
No!

813
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:35,518
Men, protect Haru

814
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:36,694
Yes, sir

815
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,333
All forward!

816
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:43,292
Get that culprit!

817
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,410
Your Majesty!

818
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,342
Leave my father to me

819
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:49,327
Everybody, please run

820
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,106
But the tower has fallen

821
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,464
It's still connected to the other side

822
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:01,317
Strange...

823
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:02,958
Oh no, it's dawn

824
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:03,840
Leave it to me!

825
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,427
What? Are you...doing !?

826
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,096
Don't!

827
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:12,661
Haru, run!
We'll be right behind you!

828
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:13,989
Take care!

829
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,691
You too

830
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,427
Thanks, Yuki

831
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:25,493
l wasn't wrong

832
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,476
Saving a cat,

833
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:29,501
feeling lost and down,

834
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:33,006
that was all part of
finding out who ! am

835
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:38,724
You go ahead!

836
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:39,749
Thanks

837
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:41,767
Where is Father?

838
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,052
Up there

839
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:46,401
Father, you'll hurt yourself.
Plaase come down

840
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,470
What a rash thing to do

841
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:50,172
will bring His Majesty back down

842
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,111
We'll settle this with a duel!

843
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:09,027
My pleasure!

844
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:10,113
Baron!

845
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,470
Take care of Haru!

846
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,331
Right

847
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,609
I win, King

848
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:04,396
Orat!

849
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:18,028
I've heard about a statue of a cat
that doesn't mind his own business

850
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,488
Had no idea you were this good

851
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:24,527
I heard you were just a window
display standing in some back alley

852
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:29,488
You should have come to
my Kingdom and joined me

853
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,562
Unfortunately. I'm quite happy
with my present way of life

854
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:42,158
Where am 1!?

855
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:45,107
What did you do?

856
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:49,818
I didn't do a thing

857
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,984
With the tower collapsed this much,

858
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:56,386
[wouldn't be surprised if the exit
moved to a different point

859
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:57,903
I must go!

860
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,020
Miss Haru!

861
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:06,819
l should have foreseen this

862
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,507
But look! Haru is human again!

863
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,615
I think I'm going to fall

864
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,089
Oh no, I'm falling

865
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,240
I'm going down!

866
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,353
Haru!

867
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,495
Muta, please don't say I'm heavy

868
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,513
Hang on...but next time...

869
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:47,434
lose some weight!

870
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:01,636
] can't hold on!

871
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:06,033
Haru!

872
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,990
I'm going to die!

873
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,483
You're not dead yet!
Open your eyes!

874
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:16,424
Baron?

875
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,800
Straighten up

876
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:19,251
and look down!

877
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,886
l can't!

878
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,169
Trust me!

879
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,268
Are we...still alive?

880
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,120
Yes!

881
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,411
I think so!

882
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:52,957
You know what?

883
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,333
Wea look fantastic!

884
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,630
What is this?

885
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,094
There are so many of them

886
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:13,295
We're saved

887
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,980
Hey, Muta!

888
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,495
How is it, being saved by birds?

889
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:25,644
Toto!

890
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:27,599
Oh, it's lousy black bird

891
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:29,291
Thanks for saving us, Toto

892
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,699
Glad ! had my friends
waiting up here

893
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,390
Doesn't it hurt walking on them?

894
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:37,719
You're light as a feather, Haru

895
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:38,697
Really?

896
01:06:38,895 --> 01:06:40,355
disagree

897
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,773
Look, Haru!

898
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,733
It's my school!

899
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,008
I'm home. I was able to
come back!

900
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:50,445
Everybody, thank you so much!

901
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,516
Yes! They made it!

902
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,040
Hooray, Miss Haru!

903
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,309
I'm relieved

904
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,138
Take care, Haru!

905
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:05,947
Your Majesty!

906
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:13,405
Natori

907
01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:16,293
My time on the throne is over

908
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,180
Then must resign with you

909
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,672
Toto, thank you

910
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:35,602
My heart is still pounding

911
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,022
Of course

912
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,070
But it was a bit fun

913
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,726
Yeah, right

914
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:44,204
Haru has to go to school,

915
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,791
so she'd better go home and rest

916
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:49,728
Yeah

917
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,073
Is this going to be goodbye?

918
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,419
Must do one last thing

919
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,427
Baron, I might have
a crush on you

920
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,353
! admire your sincerity, Haru

921
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:24,397
Haru, when you really need us,

922
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,260
our doors will open to you again

923
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:32,196
Until then, goodbye!

924
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:39,374
Goodbye

925
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:49,702
Thank you!

926
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:53,993
Baron! Toto!
You too, Muta!

927
01:08:57,899 --> 01:08:59,889
What do you mean, me too?

928
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,520
Me too?

929
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,947
Oh no, better get up

930
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:46,565
Morning

931
01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:48,999
Why are you up so early?

932
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,479
Today is Sunday

933
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:52,897
I'm going to the movies
with Hiromi

934
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:54,616
Going early before
it gets crowded

935
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,229
l better get going

936
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,737
l made eggs and salad for you

937
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:01,584
What?

938
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:03,074
l already ate so please
help yourself

939
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,826
There is also English tea
in the pot

940
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:08,430
And about the tea

941
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:11,112
That's Haru's special blend

942
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:15,051

so no guarantees about the flavor

l see...

944
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:25,236

945
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,921
Haru! News from a reliable source!

946
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,820

Machida, he broke up!

949
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:44,702

950
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:45,893
What?

951
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:47,859
Don't you have more
to say than that?

No

953
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,478

954
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,575

No

956
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:06,331
You're lying

957
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:07,929
No, honestly

you and Tsuge?

961
