1
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,410
So I get this phone call, July 30th, 2005,
from Steven Spielberg.

2
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,910
He calls me up in
his jovial self and he says,

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,950
"Michael, I want you to direct
this movie called Transformers."

4
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,210
I'm like, "Okay, Steven,
well, that sounds great.

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,820
"Let me think about it,
and I'll get back to you.”

6
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,110
I hung up the phone

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,710
and in the 30 seconds everything
that goes through your brain.

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,910
"Is that that little robot toy movie?"
"Is that like a Small Soldiers movie?"

9
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,190
"That was just Steven Spielberg
calling me up. Oh, my God!"

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,600
"This is one of my idols,
wants me to direct a movie

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,399
"that he wants to
be involved in."

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,620
So I thought about it.

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,580
I called Adam Goodman, president
of the studio at DreamWorks.

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,580
l said, "Adam, so what is
this Transformers movie?"

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,420
He goes,
"Why don't you think about it?"

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,440
Adam convinced me to
go to Transformer school,

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,550
which is in Hasbro
in Rhode Island.

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
And I'm like, "Okay,
well, let's make the trek.”

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,020
So the next morning
we went into Hasbro.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,810
You pass this hallway of all
the famous toys we all grew up with.

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,940
We sat in this
big conference room.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,130
I mean, they must have
had 25 people in there,

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,430
all trying to convince
me to do Transformers,

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,360
and they started with
Transformer school

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
which is, they basically take you
through the entire lore of Transformers.

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,060
Now, I have been offered a lot of
comic book, superhero movies

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,650
in my short film career.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,780
And I have always said no because
it really hasn't appealed to me.

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,449
But one thing I did spark to recently
was Japanese anime movies.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,050
I just love their visuals. It's just a
really unique type of cartoon.

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,510
And I'm sitting in this Transformer,
I guess, like, lecture.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,229
I kept looking at this artwork
of just a multitude of images

33
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,079
and there was something
from this Japanese artist.

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,940
He had some amazingly dark,
cool images that...

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,529
That just right there
in the room inspired me.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,440
I kept thinking to myself,
"I need to make this very real.

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,960
"I need to make this cool.”

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,799
I kept thinking about cars
transforming at 80 miles an hour.

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,890
Action images would just
kind of come to my mind,

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,760
of, like, "Why would I be
interested in doing this movie?"

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,670
I did like the lore
of Transformers.

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,130
It's very noble, it's got good
morals, it's interesting.

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,310
But it's like, how do
you make Transformers

44
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,799
understandable to an adult

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,209
who has no knowledge
of what Transformer toys are?

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,340
We broadened the story in terms
of bringing in the American military.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,770
It's this big story, but it kind of comes
down to this little story on Earth,

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,070
which is all about Sam
and having these glasses.

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,100
This is kind of how the birth
of Transformers happened.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
l have always had the lucky fortune
of working with military equipment

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,650
before anybody else, such as
these Ospreys right here.

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,190
They have never
been used in a movie,

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,530
and I don't think many people
have shot that Stealth 117 either.

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,020
So I've got this hotline
to the Pentagon.

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,780
I've got this relationship with
the film liaison, Phil Strub,

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,829
who helped me on Armageddon
where we worked with the Air Force.

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,500
And Pearl Harbor, where we worked
with the Navy and all the branches.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,790
And I called Phil up and I said, "Phil,
I'm gonna be doing this movie.

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,820
"It's a fantasy movie called
Transformers."

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,920
And he goes,
"Oh, the kids’ toy, huh?"

61
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,750
He said, "Well, Mike, you know,
if we did have alien robots on Earth,

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,070
"[ think the American military
would be involved.

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,120
"And we will bring the fight
anywhere we have to.

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,829
"So let me read the script.
I'm excited to read it."

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,750
And I guess the rest is history.
He loved it.

66
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,700
And then it's a matter of me
going to different bases

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,790
and trying to convince bases
to be...Imitate Qatar,

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,030
which is the forward command
for the whole Middle East.

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,969
And we found Holloman
Air Force Base in New Mexico,

70
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,240
which kind of has these
white sands

71
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,180
which are test missile ranges
for, I think, the Army.

72
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,670
Right here, this was done at
Edwards. These are two F-22s,

73
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,670
which are the brand-new planes
that are costing $130 million each.

74
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,650
They can take out six F-16s before
they can even be spotted.

75
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,740
They are just deadly lethal,

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,250
and of course, I was the
first to use those as well.

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,710
Why does the military
let me use this stuff?

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,810
Because they look good at
what they do in my movies.

79
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,809
And working with these
men and women...

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,390
You know, I have done many years
of working with them, in movies,

81
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,030
and, you know, they are
really great people.

82
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
And they're really dedicated.

83
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,360
And I really admire them for
the service they do for the country.

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,010
And, you know, they don't
work for a great wage,

85
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,890
but they're just so dedicated
to the country and...

86
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,140
You know, so, like, just diligent
and just, you know...

87
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,530
I find many of them so intelligent,

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,850
and it's always been a great experience
when I've worked on these bases.

89
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,300
And I really have fond memories
of it.

90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,289
And very much, they're impressed
with our film industry

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,820
because we work very much
like the military works,

92
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,710
in terms of the different hierarchy
and how it works on our sets and crews.

93
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,450
And they are always very sceptical
when we show up,

94
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,419
because they think we're going
to be a bunch of Hollywood...

95
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,610
But they always come away with,
I'm sure, with a great respect.

96
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,940
And they tell us that,

97
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,760
that they come away with a great
respect for what we do,

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,940
because they see it so
similar to the military.

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,840
So this was our first
transformation here.

100
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,039
And the transformation was...
"How are we gonna do this, basically?"

101
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,130
l had my animators do
tough versions of it.

102
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
But when we had
this first version up...

103
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,490
That was the very first version
l ever saw of that transformation.

104
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,489
And it was done by
an artist named Keiji.

105
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,620
He's Japanese.
He speaks like no English.

106
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,770
He is the absolute Rubik's Cube
genius to figure those things out,

107
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,690
of how those parts actually
move and come together.

108
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,980
I met Keiji in a very odd meeting
at Industrial Light and Magic.

109
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,859
I had about 30 ILM artists
sitting in a kind of hi-def room

110
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,330
where we are looking
at the artwork

111
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,870
that my illustrators had
worked for months,

112
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,260
I mean we're talking
eight months, on.

113
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,860
And then I saw Optimus Prime's
face in his first 3-D kind of,

114
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,070
I guess, iteration of him.

115
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,930
He looked terrible.
He had this fat, ugly face.

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
And I'm like, "You guys
got to be kidding me.

117
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,729
"This is awful. What
happened to Optimus?"

118
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,349
And all of a sudden, in this small room,
this guy pops up in the back,

119
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,950
and he goes, "That Optimus Prime is
an insult to the Japanese people.

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,950
"That is an insult to the Japanese,
l want to do Optimus Prime.”

121
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,320
But you can tell someone else
was obviously modelling

122
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,910
Optimus Prime's fat, ugly
face and Keiji knew this.

123
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,530
And so I said, "Keiji, first of all, this
is the most bizarre meeting

124
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,460
"Il have ever been to, the biggest,
funniest outbreak I have ever seen,

125
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,860
"and you know what,
just because of that,

126
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,969
"I'm gonna let you work
on Optimus Prime."

127
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,730
So not only did Keiji do Optimus
Prime in terms of the 3-D modelling,

128
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,670
but he did the amazing
Rubik's Cube

129
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,190
of how we were going to
transform these robots.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,700
What the military is very concerned
of when they do movies

131
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,810
is that they just want things
to be accurate.

132
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,190
They are very into, like,
those uniforms.

133
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,190
If they are not Qatar-issue uniforms,
we just can't use them.

134
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,500
Right here, I shot this
in the Tank Graveyard.

135
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,510
These are old tanks, some are
just kind of shells of other tanks,

136
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,210
where they actually put
them out in the field,

137
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,810
in this white sand, and they
use them as target-practise.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,930
We actually started the shoot,
the very first day was...

139
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,600
I shot this little, I guess,
Mars rover. I shot that.

140
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,750
I got it assembled because
I had this idea for a teaser

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,210
that was the very first teaser
that came out the summer

142
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,620
where we just began to start...
We just started shooting.

143
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,900
I just wanted to mark our date of
July 4th and to say we were real.

144
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,410
The very first day of
pre-production photography,

145
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,840
I shot in the Tank Graveyard.

146
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,010
My first days really never
suck, but this one really sucked.

147
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,410
I get to the set,
I'm all excited,

148
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,790
and I'm walking around with
my viewfinder, ready to go.

149
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,690
And I get on set
an hour before call

150
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,240
and the hour passes and then
I'm waiting, "Okay, where's my crew?"

151
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,270
I'm like, "This isn't good."

152
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,699
My crew apparently was
just eating dinner.

153
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,700
And normally when you
get to set, you show up,

154
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,819
you either eat dinner before...

155
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,160
So my cameraman, Mitchell Amundsen,
my operators, everyone's eating.

156
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,209
And I'm like, "Okay." And that pissed me
off, the first night.

157
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,900
So I'm like,
"Mitch, this is a big movie,

158
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,100
"and you're not going to be
eating your burritos any more

159
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,190
"when I show up to set and
I'm ready to work."

160
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,510
So I think that kind of shook the
ground of everyone, the first night.

161
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,100
Because I got to tell you,
when I come on the set

162
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,830
I'm like, ! come in...
They joke on the set,

163
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,400
"Bay's coming in hot."

164
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,550
It means I like to work.
I don't like to fart around,

165
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,010
and everyone knows that
I do a lot of set-ups every day.

166
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,990
An average on a movie is 19 to 25.
I do 50, 60, sometimes 75.

167
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,329
And these are real set-ups.

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,800
And I shot a lot of this movie
very, kind of, suburbia.

169
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,570
But I didn't kind of sex it up
in terms of making this slick.

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,970
This is a classroom that we all
know about, we have all been to.

171
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,250
And it's something that makes it
more accessible, I think, to everybody.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,930
And like, I have never in my life
ever shot in a Burger King.

173
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,300
But you know what? We all eat at
Burger King or McDonald's or whatever,

174
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,790
and it just makes it
more everyday life.

175
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,329
And I kind of like this,
kind of, sci-fi movie

176
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,000
coupled with this suburbia life.

177
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,860
I thought it was a good mix.

178
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,069
And casting Shia...

179
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,860
l actually started to
look for kids and I had...

180
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,010
My casting ladies scoured the Earth for
the best 16, 17, 18, 19, 20-year-old kid

181
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,090
that can play a 16-year-old
out there.

182
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,800
And we looked from London to
Australia to Canada,

183
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
and lan Bryce was the first to
mention to me Shia LaBeouf.

184
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,370
Or "LaBoof." I call him
"Shia LeBuff.”

185
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,870
I said, "Well, saw him
in Constantine,

186
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,640
"and I have never seen
the movie Holes,

187
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,620
"but in Constantine he was playing
a cab driver. He looked a little old."

188
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,140
So the kid came in, and
he was kind of skinny

189
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,469
and, like, a little goofy and
way over-excited.

190
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,510
I'm like, "Dude, you
got to calm down here,

191
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,849
"you're just auditioning with
me at my office.”

192
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,590
And he goes, "Wow, I just...l want to be
an action guy and I want to be a...

193
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,610
"It's just like, wow, I love your movies and
I can't believe I'm meeting you."

194
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,040
I'm like, "All right, calm down,
let's just do the audition."

195
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,719
And I just instantly liked his
energy in the audition.

196
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,430
You know, we had some of our early,
early written pages,

197
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,780
where the dialogue really needed
to be tweaked and made more real.

198
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,840
And sometimes it's actually good to
read with some clunky dialogue,

199
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,069
and you see how actors
could fare through,

200
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,170
because a good actor can
make any line sound good.

201
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,150
And Spielberg will even
tell you that.

202
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,110
That's the art of acting,
.
In a way.

203
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,170
But I started throwing some
stuff to Shia,

204
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,110
like improv-ing with him a bit
in the audition.

205
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,089
My thing is I love finding actors
that can improv

206
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,170
because a lot of my film-making,
.
we Improv as we go.

207
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,580
I mean, we have the basis
of the scene.

208
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,819
I mean, I kind of learned this on working
with Martin and Will on Bad Boys.

209
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,260
Shia just had this great thing.

210
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,710
And, you know, I called Steven,
and I said, "I met with Shia.”

211
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,430
And Steven goes, "I love Shia."
So he was all excited about that.

212
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,660
And I said, "Well, I really want
to show you this tape."

213
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,720
l went downstairs and because I had
auditioned a couple of other kids

214
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,900
and he just was heads and tails
above every other kid that came in.

215
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,480
And I asked the girls
in the office,

216
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,550
my assistants who are
very blunt, I said,

217
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,820
"So what do you think
of him?"

218
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,849
I said, "Just watch the DVD,
watch his video."

219
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,420
They saw and they go like,
"Oh, my God, he's great, he's great.

220
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,290
"He's so funny, he's so charming,
he's so funny."

221
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,680
So I sent the audition to
Steven,

222
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,650
and then I called Shia back.

223
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,310
And meanwhile I had to
make this movie for a price.

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,320
And I actually do some of
my own actor deals

225
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,840
because when I make a movie
for a price, 1 make it for a price.

226
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,870
So I have to play a tough guy and
I say, "Basically, if you want the part,

227
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,630
"you got 24 hours to decide. This is
what we are going to pay you.

228
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,120
"Yes or no, give me an
answer in 24 hours."

229
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,990
So sometimes that's the
only way to get a deal done.

230
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,140
I must say, I'm very proud
of the fact

231
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,540
that we made this movie
for $150,000,000.

232
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,700
But I'll go into that later, okay?

233
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:48,150
But Shia, I guess he was
my first snag on the cast.

234
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,590
And from there it followed
to Jon Voight

235
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,730
and then the amazing John Turturro, who
l had always wanted to work with.

236
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,560
I originally thought of Steve Buscemi,
but Steve was busy directing something,

237
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,380
because I love working with Steve and
Turturro is someone I've always loved.

238
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,880
Me being such a huge Coen
Brothers fan.

239
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,000
It's like, anyone who can bowl
and have a rose in their bowling ball,

240
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,670
I got to work with that guy.

241
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,160
From there we kind of went
on to get our female,

242
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,050
and I looked at a lot of females.
It was a very hard role to cast

243
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,250
and Megan Fox is someone
we auditioned for a movie

244
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,170
I produced for Platinum Dunes
for Amityville Horror.

245
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,480
And I remembered her and
my casting ladies brought her in.

246
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,750
said I wanted to see her
because I really liked her look.

247
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,230
And in person she's very, kind of,
timid and shy. She's from Tennessee.

248
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,720
She had a sweetness about her,
and I knew I had to make her tough.

249
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,120
And she was very new at acting.

250
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,400
But I just liked something
about her.

251
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,820
There was something that
was more exciting to work

252
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,800
with an actress who is fresh
and not done a lot of movies.

253
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,800
And so I had Shia come in
and work with her.

254
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,050
And we did several
auditions with her

255
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,730
and working with Megan, she
was so timid in the beginning,

256
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,330
just being on this big, massive set.

257
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,050
But there was a good kind of
chemistry between her and Shia.

258
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,790
Shia was able to really
lighten her up,

259
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,069
and there were times I really
had to make her tough.

260
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,600
And every actor has a button
you got to push once in a while,

261
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,680
and you got to figure out what
that button is when you're directing them.

262
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,630
And her button was...Because I
couldn't get her to emote tough enough

263
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,700
when she was, like, cutting that
little robot in half with a saw.

264
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,880
And it just was looking way
too girly, way un-tough.

265
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,110
And I'm like, "Megan, remember
I told you when you got this part,

266
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,890
"you had to be tough.”

267
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,140
And she told me she would hang out
with mechanics or whatever

268
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,199
to get this movie part.

269
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,760
Finally, her button was, I said, "Megan,
we have so much money on this movie,

270
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,260
"we will stay here all night long
to get this one shot.

271
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,340
"l don't care if we stay here 15 hours,
we're gonna shoot it all night long.

272
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,170
"Because you will hate this
shot right now.

273
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,220
"Come here, look at the monitor."

274
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,970
And all of a sudden that would
get her angry. It would get her pissed.

275
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,170
And that was her button where she
was able to really give me...

276
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,400
Like emote, and whatnot.

277
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,320
So anyway, I just thought she had
a good thing with her and Shia.

278
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,400
And Shia was able to really throw
a lot of things at her.

279
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,370
And, you know, her problem was
with his improv,

280
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,849
she just kept laughing through
the takes. So that wasn't good.

281
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,640
Many of the times we had to CG
her face out when she was laughing.

282
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,089
No, I'm kidding, we didn't.

283
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,160
Mojo, the dog, was kind of like
an idea...

284
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,530
I just love dogs and like...

285
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,200
You know what, a dog addicted
to pain pills with a cast,

286
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,930
that's just funny.

287
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,890
So I said to the writers, I said,
"Let's put a dog named Mojo."

288
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,169
So I auditioned a bunch of
Chihuahuas.

289
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,480
And this one was, I guess,
by far the best one.

290
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,629
Then I thought, what better
than having a Chihuahua

291
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,430
that's stoned eating pain pills,

292
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,870
that hobbles up on his
little penthouse of a birdhouse.

293
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,280
So you can imagine when
I'm telling the art department,

294
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,110
"l want to build this little
silly, little doghouse,

295
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
"but it's elevated."

296
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,710
Well, this gives the movie
audience a laugh,

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,470
because that's just funny.

298
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,590
Right here, the dad right here,
this is my best friend,

299
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,010
Robert Offer, who's my lawyer,
who I have known since nursery school.

300
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,880
He has a problem with his kids.

301
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,770
He doesn't let his kids walk
on his grass.

302
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,909
And I have always...I save things up
that I learn in life for movies.

303
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,660
And I'm like, "What neurotic dad

304
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,790
"doesn't let their kids walk
on his own grass?"

305
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,439
Well, this is Robert
Offer right now.

306
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,439
And this right here is complete
improve, where...

307
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,560
This is an example of how

308
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,400
we were playing around with
Kevin Dunn and Julie White,

309
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,260
this amazing mom who just actually
won a Tony. A Tony award.

310
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,310
At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.

311
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,260
Oh, my God.

312
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,900
Our bases worldwide are,
as of now, at DEFCON Delta,

313
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,110
our highest readiness level.

314
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,070
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

315
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
that we have not come across before.

316
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,140
But our prayers are with the
families of the brave men and women...

317
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,000
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

318
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,450
I've never seen
a weapons system like this.

319
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,120
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

320
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,080
like it's cloaked by some
kind of invisible force field.

321
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,410
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

322
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,580
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

323
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,040
-Man, I don't know.
-What is that?

324
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,070
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

325
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,890
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

326
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,649
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

327
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,390
How about you
use those magic voodoo powers

328
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,050
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

329
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,970
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

330
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,080
It looked right at me.

331
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

332
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,470
They got to know
what we're dealing with here.

333
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
My radio's fried.

334
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,690
-1 got no communication with aerial.
-Hey, Mahfouz.

335
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,570
-How far do you live from here?
-Not far. Just up that mountain.

336
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,330
-Do they have a phone?
-Yes.

337
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,000
All right, let's hit it.

338
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,440
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

339
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,100
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

340
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,490
This is a scene where for
Shia, you know, our character Sam...

341
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,600
This is an experience where
every guy has had this experience,

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,440
where the tough guy comes up

343
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,920
and kind of tries to embarrass you
in front of his friends.

344
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,939
This moment right here is
the moment where

345
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,270
I think every guy first of all
identifies with him.

346
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,330
But you like him instantly because he's
able to come back with comedy and wit.

347
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,870
This guy, John, right here,
he jumps up on this tree

348
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,830
and I'm like, "Wait a minute,
that's great, that's funny.

349
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,840
" mean, what kind of kooky-ass
friend would hang on a tree

350
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,490
"and make this kid embarrassed?"

351
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,370
So I wasn't gonna
make this kid the geek,

352
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,870
because I didn't want the geek.

353
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,820
l wanted the geek who
was sharp, who was witty

354
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,689
but was able to come
back with humour.

355
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,730
And right here with this whole
"colouring book" thing,

356
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,010
this is, I think, where you kind
of fall in love with this kid.

357
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,570
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

358
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,590
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little colouring areas,

359
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,210
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

360
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,090
That's funny.

361
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,100
People were very worried
about the tone of this movie,

362
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,080
where it was very
edgy and hard

363
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,370
and then it had these funny
kind of suburbia touches.

364
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,040
And, you know, that's the thing
that everyone talks about,

365
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,190
the tone of the movie.
They love the tone of the movie,

366
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,730
and that's what, around the world,
when I did press for this movie,

367
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,750
everyone talks about the tone
and how funny it is.

368
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,430
And, you know, that's just
kind of what I like doing.

369
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,800
It's my thing.

370
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,960
God, I can't even tell you
how much I'm not your little bunny.

371
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,790
Okay.

372
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,460
You'll call me.

373
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,210
Who's gonna
drive you home, tonight?

374
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,900
Hey, man,
what's wrong with your radio?

375
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,770
-I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
-What?

376
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,330
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

377
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,090
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

378
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,439
You got to be
understanding here, all right?

379
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,870
All right. We'll put her
in the back. I'll be quiet.

380
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,520
-Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
-I called shotgun.

381
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,310
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

382
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,760
-That's a party foul.
-What rules?

383
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,010
Bros before hos.

384
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,750
Miles, I'm begging you
to get out of my car. Okay?

385
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,950
You can't do this to me.

386
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,460
You got to
get out of my car right now.

387
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,500
So when I signed on
to do this movie,

388
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,960
God, there was a lot of talk
on the Internet about,

389
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,899
"Michael Bay will wreck this movie,
he won't know how to do this movie.

390
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,960
"He doesn't know anything
about Transformers."

391
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,639
You know, stuff like, "Michael Bay is
wrecking my childhood.”

392
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,230
"Death to Michael Bay." Boy, I had a lot
of death threats, I must say.

393
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,750
They even actually protested
at one of my offices,

394
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,370
but it was an office 1 had moved
out of two years prior,

395
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,620
so, you know, I guess they weren't that
smart, to figure out where to protest.

396
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,050
But I remember listening to
stuff on the Internet.

397
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,590
I would listen to some of their ideas
that they would talk about,

398
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
because fan support
is very important,

399
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,850
and I wanted them to be
happy with Transformers.

400
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,480
But I was trying to introduce
a world of people

401
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,159
that have never seen
Transformers to this movie.

402
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,570
And, I think, in a way, it was better
that l wasn't a Transformer fan,

403
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,320
because I was able to make
this movie more accessible

404
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,399
to the non-fan, I guess.

405
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,949
So I must say right now,
lam a true Transformer fan.

406
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,740
l have probably thought
about robots

407
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,050
more than anybody
in the past year and a half.

408
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,120
And probably...
I thought about robots

409
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,690
more than anybody else on
Earth for the past year and a half.

410
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,899
We would have artwork
that would leak.

411
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,870
I mean, it was truly one of
the most sought-after movies

412
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,979
and talked about on the Internet than
l can remember in a very long time.

413
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,629
Our art server had 39,000
attempted hacks

414
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,070
in the month of January,
in the year 2006.

415
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:44,340
And we had to literally get, like,
almost Pentagon-type quality encryption.

416
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,410
And they actually personally hacked
into my personal computer.

417
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,440
And they were able to steal
one script.

418
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,790
We know who stole it, and
l was able to get the script back.

419
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,430
But luckily it only
got out once.

420
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,120
So there were so many leaks that I
decided to actually keep the script...

421
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,210
Just literally, had the only original
script in my computer.

422
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,919
And certain actors had
ones that were older

423
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,000
and everyone had coded scripts.

424
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,420
And we collected all
the scripts from the crew.

425
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,870
We gave them out
and they gave it back

426
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
and all those
different measures.

427
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,190
And there was one script,
a very old script

428
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,770
that got out on the Internet
that everyone read,

429
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,830
and everyone kept
commenting on, and...

430
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,340
But it was so old,
scripts can change.

431
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,860
In a month you can change
so much in a script.

432
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,630
And theirs was, like,
probably five months

433
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,740
older than what the script
was in the movie.

434
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,169
I mean, we had...
In case the script got out,

435
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,660
we had names of our robots,
a. k. a. names.

436
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,710
But there were many characters
that I tried to create.

437
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,770
Like, let me give you an example.
We were working on this movie,

438
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,650
budgeting this movie and
they have to make these toys,

439
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,100
like moulds and like the idea
of these type of moulds,

440
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,629
a year and a half out.
We didn't even have a script

441
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,260
and lan Bryce came to
me and says,

442
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,870
"Hasbro needs to know
what Transformer vehicles

443
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,810
"and what are you using
for the Decepticons?

444
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,230
"Autobots and Decepticons.
What kind of cars?"

445
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,459
And I'm, like, literally had to
come to a choice with, like,

446
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,450
"Okay, I think, maybe a tank.

447
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,990
"l don't know if we can get that
amazing bomb-searching Buffalo truck,

448
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,290
"that's brand new, that
they are sending to Iraq,

449
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,250
"if we can maybe do that one.

450
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,610
"I definitely, if l can get an F-22,
but I don't know if we can get an F-22."

451
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,940
So that's how we kind of had to decide.
We had to decide very quickly.

452
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,730
There it is.

453
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,780
l had fun. So, you know,
thanks for listening.

454
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,270
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-You... You think I'm shallow?

455
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,520
I think you're...
No, no, no. I think...

456
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,899
I think there's a lot more than
meets the eye with you.

457
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,190
Okay.

458
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,980
Yeah.

459
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,340
All right, I'll see you at school.

460
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,630
All right.

461
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,660
That's stupid.

462
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,980
That was a stupid line.

463
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,590
"There's a lot more than
meets the eye with you." Stupid.

464
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,360
Oh, God.

465
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,210
Oh, my God. I love my car.

466
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,630
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Terrorists.

467
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,479
Come on, man. This is way
too smart for their scientists.

468
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,160
-Think about it.
-What do you think, kid?

469
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,780
No way. This is nothing like
what they are using.

470
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,260
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

471
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,310
We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,

472
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,500
we'll know
just what to do with them.

473
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,100
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

474
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,220
l also wanted to make other characters,
like in the boom box on Air Force One.

475
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,649
l like this kind of character,

476
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,360
and I think, if we do
Transformers 2,

477
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,850
we're gonna have a lot more
unique characters,

478
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,720
like this but also bigger.

479
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,700
And just, you can imagine
where the mind can go here.

480
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,970
I mean, I designed some...

481
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,000
With the artists, some
amazingly huge characters

482
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,700
who just got to be too big, too
costly, too expensive, whatever.

483
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,450
And it was Steven who said,

484
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,050
"You know what? We should
probably just keep this kind of like

485
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,040
"six against five or something,
where it's a little bit more manageable."

486
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,510
And I think he's right
that we keep it smaller

487
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,050
to kind of try to introduce
what's going on here.

488
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,360
Steven says I saved 30 grand right there
by doing that little one camera move.

489
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,570
We had a guy grab the boom box.
He's right. So I saved an effect.

490
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,350
Then right in here, this is our actually
full-scale puppet of this...Frenzy here.

491
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,290
Frenzy was animated by
a French artist

492
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
at ILM.

493
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,800
I liked this very quirky
kind of movement.

494
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,689
And when I was
directing the animation,

495
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,570
because I would actually
every single day,

496
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,919
I would work with animators

497
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,980
where they would send me
down what they are working on

498
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,879
so that I can actually
direct them,

499
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,240
you know, after these shots that...
We have done these plate shots

500
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,230
and try to direct their acting.

501
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,260
I got to tell these characters
so well

502
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,240
that I knew that when another artist
was working on this Frenzy character,

503
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,830
he wasn't the French guy.

504
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,650
I'm like, "Well, did you guys have
a different animator working on this?"

505
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,490
They are like... You hear them kind of over
the conference call, "Yeah."

506
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,480
So I'm like, "You got to put
the French guy back on,

507
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,550
"because it's a total
different character."

508
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,610
You know, and he says, "He's on
another movie, he's working on Pirates."

509
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,590
I said, "Well, you got to get
the French guy back.

510
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,490
"Whatever you got to do,
you got to get the French guy back."

511
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,690
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

512
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,340
We need a senior analyst.

513
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,179
-I think they're planting a virus.
-A virus?

514
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,650
-It's streaming right now.
-They are planting a virus

515
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,740
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

516
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,500
Code Red. We have a breach.

517
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,080
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

518
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,830
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

519
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,750
-You got to cut the hard lines.
-What?

520
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,630
-Whatever they want, they are getting it.
-Sir?

521
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,399
Permission to take down
the Defence Network.

522
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,169
-Cut all server hard lines now.
-Cut all server hard lines now.

523
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,060
My theory on effects, well,
it all comes down to lighting.

524
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,140
And I feel everyone
in their brain

525
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,280
has something that we
don't really know that's there,

526
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,790
but we can tell when
something is not lit right.

527
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,320
We don't know why it's there,

528
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,350
but we just know there's
something wrong with the shot,

529
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,470
and it's all coming down
to lighting.

530
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,270
Because we are used
to looking at the world

531
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,350
the way we see it
through our eyes.

532
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,980
After I did Pearl Harbor,
Dennis Muren said to me...

533
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,310
He says,
"You raised the bar on effects."

534
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,740
And I'm like,
"What did he mean by that?"

535
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,530
And he goes, "You have just
made effects more realistic."

536
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,060
And the first time I went to ILM,
or used them, was on Pearl Harbor.

537
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,720
And I had a big meeting
up there where I just felt

538
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,220
that Lucas’ stuff is awesome,
but it's very pastel.

539
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,400
In terms of their light,
it doesn't look real,

540
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,820
the shadows aren't
dark enough,

541
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,950
it doesn't have enough contrast.

542
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,980
It doesn't have the right
tipple reflections on metal.

543
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,740
So that was one of
the big achievements

544
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,330
I think we worked with
on Pearl Harbor,

545
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,280
in terms of shooting a movie
at 12:00 noon,

546
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,949
and making it, not disguising it
in night and showing it in broad daylight.

547
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,080
And making the planes as real
as possible and all these other ships.

548
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,340
And so I think that's what
Dennis was talking about.

549
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,470
Well, you know this, we had to
take it to a brand new level,

550
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,480
in terms of trying to
make reality here.

551
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,830
So we spent a tremendous
amount of time

552
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,200
and software and just
trying to invent new tricks

553
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,390
on how to light these robots.

554
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,850
They use this process
called ray tracing.

555
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,660
When you look at a car,
you go out on a parking lot...

556
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,830
I've shot a lot of
car commercials, so...

557
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,570
I was trying to explain, you can't just
have one quality of light

558
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,840
.
on a car, on a plece
of sheet metal.

559
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,690
It will reflect soft light,
hard light

560
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,050
it will have pings,
it will have long lines.

561
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,710
Cars are, like,
a nightmare to light,

562
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,220
in terms of if you're actually doing
a total digital model of a car.

563
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,380
So you probably couldn't
have done this movie,

564
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,899
I guess, as of two years ago.

565
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,540
That's my car!

566
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,240
No!

567
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,340
No, no, no, no.

568
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,310
So in terms of our effects,

569
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,320
we had Industrial Light and Magic
that were heading up Transformers,

570
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,650
and we had Digital Domain,
which is an effects company

571
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,510
that I recently purchased with
a couple of other partners.

572
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
Those are the ones that did...

573
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,000
Both companies did
the work for this movie.

574
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,830
ILM did three-quarters and Digital
Domain did the last quarter.

575
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,010
ILM came down
and they talked to me

576
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,950
about something that
was used in Star Wars Ill.

577
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,360
It was a digital model
of a character

578
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,700
that was kind of like a robot,
and it was so uncomplicated.

579
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,970
I'm like, "Guys, we have to go
so much farther than this."

580
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,300
General Grievous was ILM's most
complicated digital model at the time

581
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,780
and it was, if you look at it, it's so simple

582
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,209
compared to the complexity that we
needed to do our models.

583
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,160
They talked about these models which
finally, when they were done,

584
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,810
Optimus Prime is made of 10,108 parts

585
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,990
that all have to move,
not intersect,

586
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,860
and it's just an immensely

587
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,470
complicated digital model.

588
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,120
They say they're the most complicated
digital models ever made.

589
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,720
My name is Sam Witwicky.

590
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,420
Whoever finds this,
my car is alive, okay?

591
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,530
So this is actually Shia's first night, and
you can see his nappy hair right now.

592
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,129
I just kept looking at his
hair, I said,

593
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,620
"Dude, we gotta do
something with your hair."

594
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,530
And he says, "Mike,
what's the matter with my hair?"

595
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,650
I said, "It just looks nappy.
We gotta make it cooler."

596
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,070
l wasn't allowed to cut it because
he was still shooting Disturbia.

597
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,090
And this is his first
scene for the movie,

598
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,570
and those dogs chasing him
are actually killer police dogs.

599
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,940
And Shia's running,

600
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,090
and there's a man in a big dog
suit who stands behind him,

601
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,449
and he was there with a whip,
and he was calling the dogs.

602
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,400
Well, they actually missed
the guy with the big dog suit

603
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,890
where they're supposed to
chomp on the arm,

604
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,790
and they kept going after Shia.

605
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,919
Shia was almost killed that night,
lam not kidding you.

606
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,270
Thank God he was fast.

607
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,120
It wasn't good when the guy with
the whip, he says, "Uh-oh, uh-oh."

608
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,360
The whole crew started
chasing after the dogs

609
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,190
with the big chains on their necks,
so we were able to tackle them.

610
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,000
-Good, you're here.
-Let me see your hands!

611
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,569
-No, no, no! It's not me!
-Let me see your hands.

612
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,440
-The guy's inside.
-Shut up! Walk towards the car.

613
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,110
Put your head on the hood.

614
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,640
If you have military assistance, you
have to have advisors on the set

615
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,400
that are from the Pentagon
that make sure

616
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,690
that we're doing things correctly.

617
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,940
They won't tell us, like, what lines we
have to say and what we can't say,

618
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,140
but it's just gotta be accurate.

619
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,540
When Rachael here had
to go into this room,

620
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,220
l was just gonna have
her slip into the room,

621
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,440
but we had to have this other
guy knock on the window.

622
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,240
That was the only way they were
gonna let me do this shot,

623
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,050
because they would say there would
be no way in the Pentagon for her

624
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,370
to slip into a private
room like this.

625
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,020
So you gotta make these little
concessions here and there.

626
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,779
And I said to the guy, "Are you sure
that would never happen?"

627
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,210
"No way, that would be impossible. "
"Are you sure?"

628
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,820
"No, that's impossible."

629
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,920
So, okay, I'm, like, "All right, this is
the way we gotta block this scene."

630
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,000
shows them doubling
its naval activity.

631
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,340
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

632
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,680
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

633
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,089
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

634
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,300
and start
considering quantum mechanics.

635
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,600
There is nothing
on Earth that complex.

636
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,100
What about an organism?
A living organism?

637
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,510
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

638
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,970
-And I know that that sounds crazy...
-That's enough. That's enough.

639
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,010
We have six floors of
analysts working on this thing.

640
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,360
Now, if you can find proof
to back up your theory,

641
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,859
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

642
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,540
on that brain-mouth thing, you're
gonna be off the team. You understand?

643
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,149
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear am being.

644
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
-It just stood up.
-It just stood up.

645
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,589
Wow. That's really neat.

646
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,799
Okay, chiefie.

647
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,670
Time to fill her up.
And no drippy-drippy.

648
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,640
What are you rolling?

649
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

650
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
-No, I'm not on any drugs.
-What's these?

651
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,629
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

652
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,370
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

653
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,850
-Those are my dog's pain pills.
-You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

654
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,120
What was that?

655
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,540
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

656
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,950
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

657
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,180
‘Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

658
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,920
Are you on drugs?

659
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,450
This was actually the very first day of
official shooting right here.

660
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,759
New Mexico, White Sands.

661
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,170
Let's hope this telephone line works.

662
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,940
Hey, heads up!

663
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,410
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

664
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,200
What the heck was that?

665
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
English, dude. English.

666
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,950
The way we made
the Skorponoks work

667
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,049
was I remembered something
we did in Armageddon

668
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,800
where we did these primer cord
explosions that...

669
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,640
Primer cord's like a very stable
kind of explosive device.

670
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,890
It's like rope.

671
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,799
And we put like 150 of
these in a row,

672
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,629
and they had a computer
that was able

673
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,990
to fire milliseconds apart from each
other so it made a ripple effect.

674
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,110
And that's how we did this shot right
here with this ripple shooting up

675
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,370
and the thing jumping
out right behind them.

676
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,450
l remember doing
the animatic for that shot.

677
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,550
Il said, "You know what?
That shot's a trailer shot."

678
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,500
And that was Tyrese's second day

679
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,410
where the guys actually had to
run over a carpet of explosives

680
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,260
as the stuff was fired
behind them.

681
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,330
I'm, like,
"Guys, do not stop, do not trip,

682
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,730
"and we're gonna fire
these things off,

683
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,610
"and this stand's gonna go,
because it will really hurt your foot."

684
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,570
So that look is, I guess,
one of fear and real terror, there.

685
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,750
A lot of these guys, these rangers
here, are the real deal.

686
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,770
Many of them were very decorated
United States SEALs and Rangers.

687
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,529
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

688
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,880
-Cell phone!
-I don't know how to thank you.

689
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,029
Fire!

690
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,980
This scene right here with Josh

691
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,210
was something that I remember
a real SEAL telling me.

692
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,230
It happened down in Grenada where
they were trapped in a house.

693
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,690
They lost all their coms,

694
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,360
and they had a cell phone where
they had to call to the Pentagon

695
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,240
and literally had to get a credit
card to get out of the country

696
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,220
and link up with an operator at the
Pentagon to get an air strike to come in.

697
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,520
And they had to vecto
in their position.

698
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,580
So something I always held in my
ideas of wanting to get into a movie,

699
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,970
and so this was
an idea of making it

700
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,670
kind of fun and serious
at the same time.

701
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,270
I just like the whole
chain of events

702
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,009
and how fast you can see
this air strike come in.

703
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,370
It's called an Air Force Combat Controller.
That's what Tyrese plays.

704
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,090
An Air Force Combat Controller is a job
that a guy can use a gun.

705
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,760
He can help them in battle,
but he's a very important tool

706
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,490
in terms of getting very deadly
air support,

707
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,420
which is what they call
"danger close,”

708
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,140
which is where they'll
shoot missiles,

709
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,580
and they give a precise position
where the friends are,

710
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,569
and they will give a precise position
where the foes are.

711
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,600
And these missiles will sometimes
come in 50 feet, 20 feet,

712
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,710
that's why they call it
"danger close" there.

713
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,690
You know, sometimes you think
we're "movie-ising” this thing up

714
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,310
where the guys are
coming in with,

715
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,870
I guess, those laser-sighting
things on their guns.

716
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,339
That's called marking a target.

717
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,690
Hey! Make way!

718
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,310
-What is that?
-I don't know.

719
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,069
We need air support
and we need it now.

720
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,960
Roll in strike package
Bravo on unknown target.

721
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,450
l authenticate Tango Whiskey
at time 0300 Zulu.

722
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,380
Attention, all aircraft.
This will be a danger close-fire mission.

723
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,129
These guys on the AWACS, that
was done on Edwards Air Force Base.

724
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,880
I told these guys on the AWACS...
These are all the real guys.

725
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,210
I said to the guy in charge of
the AWACS, I said,

726
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,549
"How would you run this mission?

727
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,840
"This is what's going down
on the ground.

728
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,090
"This is what's happening.”

729
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,810
And literally within three minutes,
these guys were talking.

730
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,990
I did not add one line here.

731
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,460
This is exactly how they talked.
That's as fast as they talk.

732
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,980
And, literally, we were capturing it
like a documentary.

733
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,820
It's amazing how fast everyone's
talking over each other.

734
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,450
And a multitude of things
.
going on.

735
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,890
And what's going on,
Josh, right now

736
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,040
is laser-designating for these missiles
coming in right now,

737
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,940
and that's actually how it's done.

738
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,069
These Warthogs are, ! must
say, very, kind of, scary

739
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,890
‘cause they've got a very
low, kind of, sound to them

740
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,400
and they get very low to
the ground,

741
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,990
and they're slow enough
where you can see them

742
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,520
and they just got this evil whine to it,
and they're just so deadly, these things.

743
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,779
No frigging way
that thing's still not down.

744
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,850
Spooky Three Two,
use 105 shells. Bring the rain.

745
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,230
Be advised, ground team
is requesting 105 sabot rounds.

746
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,130
Skorponok was our first
scene that we shot

747
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,000
and it was one of the first scenes
that was kind of digitally completed.

748
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,320
And that was kind of, I guess, the basis of how
these Transformers should look.

749
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,770
I started showing some of my friends this
scene and everyone kept saying,

750
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,830
"Well, what is it, an animation?
What is it?"

751
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,029
And then I'd show them
this scene

752
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,569
and then instantly,
this is a scene they go,

753
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,940
"I get it. l understand
the movie now."

754
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,200
"You're doing this kind of
in a real-life way."

755
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,049
And it's got fun, and,
you know, it's kind of sci-fi.

756
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,930
So I guess this is when we started
convincing a lot of people.

757
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,720
Like even the Japanese came
in, the Toho distributors.

758
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,839
I had to do a lot of dog-and-pony
shows for a lot of people

759
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,100
because we were, I guess, one of
the very few non-sequels of the summer,

760
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,350
and we had to kind of
position ourselves.

761
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,700
And a lot of theatre owners,

762
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,200
"Well, what is Transformers?
I don't get it."

763
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,200
So we did this little compilation
reel of 20 minutes,

764
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,830
and it's something that we started
showing around to theatre owners

765
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,209
and to try to get people on board,
to understand what we have here.

766
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,490
Because everyone
thought this is, kind of,

767
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,010
"What is it, silly?" "Is it
animation?"
Is it this, is it that?

768
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,840
We started showing people this.

769
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,560
Like, for example, Toho,

770
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,860
which is the biggest movie
distributor ownership in Japan,

771
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,460
which is a gigantic market.

772
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,910
They came into my trailer, I
showed them 20 minutes of stuff,

773
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,910
and, literally,
you just heard the word...

774
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,220
And I guess that meant
"Good" in Japanese.

775
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,720
They upped our estimate,

776
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,350
they doubled our estimate
of what we're gonna make in Japan,

777
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,720
and they gave us
the number one house...

778
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,590
Toho, I guess,
chain in Japan.

779
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,550
But that reel was a way to really
get people on board with this movie,

780
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,900
you know, ‘cause I kind of knew
what we had early on,

781
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,860
and I remember going in to
see my very first fight in Vegas.

782
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,430
A live fight.
It was Oscar de la Hoya.

783
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,980
And I walked in and there was
Peter Chernin, who I'm friendly with,

784
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,799
and, you know, good jovial fun,
he's walking in with his friend.

785
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,970
And he goes,
"So, [ hear you got Transformers."

786
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,070
And I said,
"So, l hear you got Die Hard!"

787
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,500
And I'm, like, "Yeah,
they're the same date.”

788
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,830
And I just kind of said, "Yeah,
but you'll move, don't worry."

789
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,510
And, of course, they moved.

790
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
You know, it's kind of a game
of chicken.

791
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,720
I think they saw our
second teaser.

792
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,569
We wanted it to be a hard-edged teaser,
‘cause we wanted to show the fans

793
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,680
that we're gonna do a serious,
cool Transformer movie

794
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,560
and we weren't making
it too kiddy,

795
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:01,460
and it was going to appeal to
the 30-year-old guy and girl

796
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,880
that, you know,
grew up with Transformers,

797
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,570
as well as the younger kids
that are just getting into it.

798
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,959
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

799
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,730
"Project Iceman"?

800
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,880
-What's Sector Seven?
-Who is Captain Witwicky?

801
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,470
Are you playing
those video games again?

802
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,980
You can tell right here, 1 mean
this guy, Omar, right there,

803
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,690
he wasn't in the script,

804
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,450
but I always add weird stuff like this
tight here...Going through glass.

805
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,370
Why are we doing that? I don't know,
it's funny, all right?

806
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,450
That's just my humour.

807
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,740
So this is where the studio goes,

808
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,980
"What are you doing?
Is this director out of his mind?"

809
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,900
But in every single movie theatre,

810
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,410
I've seen it around the world,
they all laugh.

811
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,600
You know, what can I tell you?

812
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,439
We're not told where they're going.

813
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,670
Morning, Mo.

814
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,770
The government has been very quiet
about what's going on but in our...

815
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,520
-Mojo. Mojo.
-They were headed directly

816
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,100
towards secret targets.

817
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,220
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

818
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,660
We had $145 million to
make this movie.

819
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,160
It doesn't sound like a lot.

820
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,570
I mean, it sounds like a lot,
but it's really not.

821
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,380
When you look at some of these
movies like Pirates, which is $350

822
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,010
and Spider-Man which is $325,

823
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,450
I don't even know how you spend
that much money on a movie.

824
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,470
I'm really proud of the fact
that we did this movie

825
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,780
for ultimately $151
at the end of the day.

826
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,620
We were very judicious about
where we used the effects.

827
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,860
And I must say a lot of that is
attributed to Steven,

828
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,779
‘cause Steven would put
the reins on me.

829
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,310
I mean, literally, Steven is very,
very tough about budget.

830
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,190
He wanted me to think really hard
about how many effects I used

831
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,740
and to use them and
choose them wisely.

832
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,750
He would say, like, "Listen,
when I did Jurassic Park,

833
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,240
"it was only 50-something effects,
and we all remember it as more.

834
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,690
"When I did War of the Worlds,
it was only 117 effects."

835
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,720
I kind of thought, "Are you kidding?
would think it'd be more than that."

836
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,040
So he really got me to thinking
how to use my effects wisely

837
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,030
‘cause they can get very pricey

838
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,620
and that's why the budget
can just balloon.

839
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,690
So I literally animaticked the whole
movie, in terms of every scene

840
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,450
where we were gonna
do big effects.

841
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,839
Literally, a lot of these effects in the movie
are exactly how we did them

842
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,990
in our little MILE files in my office.

843
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,290
I started to get excited about potentially
what I can visually show.

844
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,170
Like this shot right here of Shia
going in, this whole scene.

845
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,970
A kid on his stupid mom's bike that is
now gonna confront a monster.

846
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,439
I kept thinking this could
be a movie...

847
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,320
Every kid has to have a
movie that they own, you know.

848
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,600
With me growing up,
it was like E. T.

849
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,680
and really, like, Raiders of
the Lost Ark and Star Wars.

850
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,630
Those were two movies
that kind of...

851
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,430
There are seminal moments in
my childhood of cool movies I saw,

852
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,970
and that's what I wanted
this movie to be for kids.

853
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,080
You know, it's something new and
different that they can discover.

854
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,610
It's not a repeat of something.

855
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,910
You know, I can't tell you how
many kids have come up to me

856
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,880
saying, "It's my favourite movie
I've ever seen!

857
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,530
"l love Transformers! I can't wait
to see Transformers 2!"

858
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,850
You know, this is why you do movies,
and I think people responded to it

859
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,560
because it was kind of
new and different.

860
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,150
And, well, what I'm really
surprised about

861
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,610
is the massive age range
this movie had,

862
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,340
from 50, 60-year-olds to,
I mean, young four-year-olds.

863
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,020
I don't get that. I don't see how
four-year-olds can see this movie

864
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,820
and not think it's too scary
or whatnot.

865
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,290
I don't know if I really believe in parents
bringing their kids to a movie like this

866
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,710
when they're that young.

867
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,780
I think what really inspired me to do this
movie were not only animatics

868
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,520
but the illustrations.

869
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,530
The movie started to become more real,
and there's a charm about the movie.

870
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,600
I like this whole magic of these two kids
kind of discovering these things.

871
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,910
And, you know, my favourite scene,
I think, in this movie is...

872
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,090
It's kind of ironic. Thinking back, it's
like all my movies, like, first hour in,

873
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,150
there was always one
montage. That kind of...

874
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,730
You can kind of see this in
all my movies like The Rock.

875
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,009
Sean Connery and Nic Cage
breaking in into the Rock,

876
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,220
and then Armageddon,
the astronauts lifting off

877
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,050
or Pearl Harbor, the Japanese
kind of getting ready to attack

878
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,509
or the asteroids coming in and landing
and the kids meeting the Autobots.

879
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,610
I kind of have a theme,
I guess, in my movies.

880
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,730
I do these montages
that really inspire me,

881
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,480
and they always seem
to happen an hour in.

882
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,110
But that's kind of
my favourite scene,

883
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,590
when we see Optimus kind of
transform in front of the kids.

884
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,420
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

885
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,049
No, we're not.
No, we're not gonna die.

886
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,280
-Oh, my God!
-Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

887
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,910
So when we're
doing scenes like this,

888
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,370
I'm sometimes, often times,
in the car with Shia and Megan,

889
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,270
and we're driving with
the stunt driver,

890
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,140
and we're driving very
fast and controlled,

891
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,060
but it really gets your
adrenalin going, ! must say.

892
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,580
We're locked in.

893
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,029
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

894
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,020
Okay.

895
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,129
Shia always says I'm the director
that will put my knee pads on,

896
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,290
I'll be right next to the actors.

897
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,439
When I do action...Oh, God,
you hear these rumours.

898
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,550
It's the kind they love
to just get onto the...

899
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,100
"Michael yells."
"Michael's a screamer." Blah, blah, blah.

900
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,960
No, Michael's like
a tough-ass basketball coach

901
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,170
that is in your face, especially
when you're doing action.

902
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,759
For one, because of safety,

903
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,210
two, because I'm trying to
get your adrenalin level

904
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,230
where I think it needs to
be for that scene.

905
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,799
How many action
scenes do you see

906
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,520
where it seems like actors are
just kind of walking through it?

907
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,490
I really want that adrenalin to be real,
and I want you to look energised.

908
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,340
So that's kind of how I work, you know?

909
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,010
So the screaming only comes,
I guess, when I'm doing tough action,

910
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,080
and I want you to get to that
energy level, you know.

911
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,250
And it's also, a lot of these times,

912
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,480
I'm very safety-conscious,
and I take it personally,

913
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,290
and I'm like my own A. D.
on my sets.

914
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,490
l work with an A. D. ,
l worked with Simon this time,

915
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,350
but I move my sets forward
for myself,

916
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,050
and I want everyone to know
what I'm thinking and I'm vocal about it.

917
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,100
Like, "We're moving over here!
We're coming over here!"

918
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,590
And so I've got a good projecting
voice that, you know, like,

919
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,859
"Let's get our day done,
and let's, like, do it."

920
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,200
Granted, I like to laugh just
like the next guy, and I tease.

921
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,779
lam a professional teaser
with my crew.

922
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,509
And it's funny when you see
new crew members come on.

923
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,570
They're day players,
whatever, and I'm teasing,

924
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,970
‘cause I'll act it like
I really mean it.

925
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,200
I'm totally screwing
around with people,

926
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,190
but my crew that's
been with me for 16 years,

927
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,779
they all know that I'm
screwing around with you.

928
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,649
But I like picking on people,
and I like being picked on, too,

929
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,819
just as long as you're good at
picking on people. It's fun.

930
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,230
But I do like to have
a good environment on the set

931
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,130
and especially work with people
that I really like being around

932
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,060
that look at it as a career,
not as a job.

933
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,740
Because, let me tell you,
I know everyone's job on this set.

934
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,060
I've been doing this
since I'm 24,

935
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,650
and I will be the first to point out to you
when you're not doing a good job.

936
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,299
But you know what?

937
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,940
A director's only
as good as his or her crew,

938
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,860
and the studio wanted to ship me
off to Australia, then to Canada.

939
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,370
We went to check out Canada.
I felt Australia was too far away.

940
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,160
And we went up to Canada and
I just, like, "Oh, my God..."

941
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,350
I was trying to make it work,
trying to make it work.

942
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,350
Looking around, scouting, and I
realised this will be a waste of money.

943
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,610
It'll just be...

944
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,770
There's no way the crew can do
the serious kind of stunt work

945
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,520
that we really do on our sets,

946
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,500
‘cause they just don't have a lot of
great stunt work up there,

947
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,220
and you gotta ship in too many people,
and it just would be a lost cause.

948
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,170
And so the studio gave me
some grief for not going up there.

949
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:48,569
So I ended up giving 30% of my fees so
l can shoot with my crew in America,

950
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,100
and that's because I'm loyal to my crew,
and they're just, I think, the best.

951
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,630
Visitors from heaven? What...

952
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,750
What are you, like,
an alien or something?

953
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,260
The sound work was done
by Ethan Van der Ryn and Mike Hopkins

954
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:11,910
who did the sound work for
Lord of the Rings and King Kong.

955
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:18,009
Mike is from New Zealand,
Ethan was trained up at Lucasfilm.

956
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,830
And I must say, awesome sound.

957
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,029
When you listen on this DVD,
it is just awesome sound.

958
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,850
My mixers, Kevin O'Connell
and Greg Russell...

959
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,560
Kevin, by the way, is the biggest Academy
loser in Academy history.

960
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,710
He's lost, I think, 20 times.

961
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,390
He's done some amazing movies.
He's an amazing mixer.

962
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,730
As a team, they're amazing mixers.

963
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,910
And Kevin and Greg said to me,
in all their time on mixing,

964
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,450
they felt this was the most inventive
sound work they've ever worked with.

965
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,540
And, meanwhile, they feel it's
one of their finest sound designs

966
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,120
and mixing efforts that
they've done as of yet.

967
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,900
We had to invent so many
different sounds here,

968
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,860
and it just gives these robots
such personality,

969
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,110
and it's really just a launching pad for
where we can go on number two.

970
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,750
-Yeah, all right.
-Right?

971
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,330
-Yeah.
-Okay.

972
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,560
There, see? That's better.

973
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,270
-Okay.
-Okay.

974
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,840
You know, that seat belt thing
was a pretty smooth move.

975
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,109
Thank you.

976
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,980
You know what I don't understand?

977
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,920
Why, if he's supposed to be,
like, this super-advanced robot,

978
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,570
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

979
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
I have no idea why this scene
right here,

980
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,420
and I've seen this movie from Korea to
Australia, all over Europe,

981
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,890
America, just why
tight here in the movie,

982
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,410
they applaud when this
yellow car comes up.

983
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,910
Oh, that shot. Let me tell you
about that shot right there.

984
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,350
That was the most patient
I've ever been

985
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,629
for doing a stunt in
the history of my career.

986
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,310
That took exactly three and half hours
for that guy to go up on two wheels.

987
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,850
Why was he on two wheels?

988
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,040
Well, he was on two wheels
because, I don't know,

989
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,660
l wanted the guy up
on two wheels

990
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,330
and, you know, wanted to go old
school with the stunt there.

991
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,750
That Camaro was
a prototype that I saw

992
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,050
when I was looking through
all these car companies,

993
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,140
new kind of prototypes
that were coming out.

994
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,760
Then I saw this
at the skunk works at GM,

995
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,950
this little, kind of secret
building in California

996
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,560
where they do kind of
these concept cars,

997
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,400
and I kind of knew right away
that was the car.

998
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,290
That was gonna be Bumblebee,

999
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,950
and the fans were gonna give me grief
because it wasn't a Volkswagen,

1000
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:43,170
but there's just no way I could do
this movie if this was a VW bug.

1001
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,400
And so I just felt that
was the car.

1002
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,990
So there's a scene with
this little girl in her bed.

1003
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,490
And, you know,
this girl was five,

1004
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,279
and I actually hired two of them
for the exact same scene,

1005
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,400
and I shot one shot with one and another
one literally with the other girl,

1006
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,720
and we were like flipping back
and forth, ‘cause I knew...

1007
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,700
The studio teacher
that comes with the kid

1008
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,200
is a kind of a social worker
that watches the kids.

1009
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,720
She said, "I've never seen
a director in my 20 years

1010
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,009
"ever hire two girls
for the same role."

1011
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,040
I said, "Well, at 11:30 at night,

1012
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,640
"when we have 20 minutes
left on our time,

1013
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,250
"where you have to take the kids,
we're doing the most important shot

1014
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,900
"with this robot getting
out of the pool,

1015
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,330
"and I guarantee you,
one of them will crap out."

1016
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,480
And sure enough, by the time we got to
the pool, one of them had crapped out.

1017
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,569
And so we used
the little blond girl.

1018
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,330
This was a fun night for
the crew, I must say,

1019
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,310
because we're up there at this
house, it's 8:00 at night,

1020
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,150
and I said to the guy,
"So what crane do we have?"

1021
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,180
And everyone kind of looked at
me. It was like the silent look.

1022
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,060
"Crane?"

1023
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,840
"Well, guys, you saw the animatic,
what we need to do, right?

1024
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,729
"We have to move this, like,
long move, and whatever."

1025
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,720
Well, let me tell you, they called
every place around Hollywood.

1026
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,649
I don't know how they
manufactured this weird-ass crane,

1027
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,799
but anyway,
we got to do this shot.

1028
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,009
And this was our very
first take with the girl.

1029
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,770
Now it's very hard, 'cause she has to
follow this pole above her six times

1030
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,990
and right there when she does that
little stutter step, I just loved it,

1031
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,970
‘cause she tripped and
it just looked more real.

1032
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,870
And ILM said, "Whoa!
Let's use the other shot

1033
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,359
"cause she looks
like she screwed up."

1034
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,430
I said, "That's what it's about. It's about
a kid screwing up. That's what it is."

1035
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,850
Now the concept car, 'cause
we only had one in the world,

1036
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,900
we had to actually build it.

1037
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,230
And once we got the
CAD files and the okay...

1038
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,250
It's very hard to get CAD
files from a car company

1039
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,160
because of thievery or
whatever they call it.

1040
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,640
This shot right here with
Optimus transforming,

1041
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,960
this is one of the shots we made
very early on in the animatic process

1042
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,540
that got me excited about
the movie.

1043
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,330
This is almost verbatim to our animatic
that we created in my office.

1044
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,640
I think this moment right here when
I finally heard all the sounds

1045
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,340
with Peter Cullen's
. .
amazing voice.

1046
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,390
Thank God the fans
actually...

1047
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,259
I kept listening to fans,
and they were right.

1048
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,350
You guys were right
all the way through.

1049
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:16,330
But I just wanted to have an open mind
of who can play these robots, so...

1050
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,360
You know you can't
fault me for that.

1051
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,549
But that was Optimus Prime.
When he speaks, let me tell you...

1052
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,550
But when Ethan and Mike added
those sounds to Optimus,

1053
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,680
it just made it
come to life.

1054
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,540
You know when you look at these effects
tight here, it's just so real

1055
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,370
in terms of the reflections of
the metal and how they fit in.

1056
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,620
-What's cracking, little bitches?
-My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

1057
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,300
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

1058
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,819
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

1059
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,170
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

1060
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,100
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

1061
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,290
-You feeling lucky, punk?
-Easy, Ironhide.

1062
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,540
Just kidding. I just wanted
to show him my cannons.

1063
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,799
You know, there's the whole thing about
Transformers about mass-shifting,

1064
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,340
and to me, that was just
always a complex thing.

1065
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,530
It was very hard to get across
in movie-making,

1066
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,049
and I wanted to keep
the idea of the robots.

1067
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,839
If you're coming from a vehicle,
you've gotta kind of stay that same size

1068
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,780
of whatever that vehicle you
could possibly stretch it out to.

1069
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,390
So, yeah, I got some
flak about

1070
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,940
changing Optimus from
a flat-nose to a long-nose,

1071
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,660
and the long-nose just made
him so he can be 28 feet

1072
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:44,259
instead of the 20 feet that he
would've been with a flat-nose truck.

1073
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,230
And, you know,
I got a lot of flak for that.

1074
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,780
And then I got more flak for
putting flames on Optimus.

1075
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,820
Boy, I mean, it was literally...
Death threats all started over again,

1076
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,680
and the "Damn you, Michael Bay!"
And whatever the hell it was.

1077
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,010
I mean it's just, you know,
l wanted flames.

1078
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,260
I mean, if you want
a pink house,

1079
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,530
l want a green house.
What's the difference?

1080
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,900
I'm the director, and, it's just,
that's what I wanted.

1081
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,900
And I knew the flames
were barely visible

1082
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,130
when you saw him
when he was transformed,

1083
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,390
and it kind of gave
the impression that he had ribs.

1084
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,170
And it was a picture of a truck
that saw, and I wanted to copy it.

1085
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,580
And I must say,

1086
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,080
l went to my teamster captain,

1087
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,779
and I said... They're in charge of
painting vehicles, and I said,

1088
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,990
"I'm telling you, a white guy is not
allowed to paint those flames, okay?

1089
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,230
"l want, what we call in LA,
l want a cholo.

1090
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,779
"l want a guy
who is an artist

1091
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,580
"who knows how to do
these amazing kind of cholo cars.

1092
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,140
"It's art. Find him, all right?"

1093
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,750
And so the funniest picture
I got in this entire movie was our guy.

1094
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,370
He's from Mexico. He had a cup of
coffee with his hat backwards.

1095
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,040
He's sitting in the art kitchen.
They took a picture of him and said,

1096
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,570
"Here he is.
This is your guy.

1097
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,260
"He doesn't speak any English.
We're gonna use an interpreter.

1098
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,910
"But he does amazing flames."

1099
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,060
And I gotta tell you, they were
the most beautiful flames I've ever seen.

1100
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,319
He accidentally activated his
navigation system.

1101
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:35,790
The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.

1102
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,279
How'd you know about his glasses?

1103
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,960
I must say, I did audition
Peter Cullen twice.

1104
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,820
They wanted me to go with
Frank Welker for Megatron.

1105
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,750
To me, Frank Welker, great voice artist,
but it just sounded too cartoon to me,

1106
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,770
and I don't think I could really tell
Frank to change it for this movie.

1107
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,830
It just wouldn't feel right.

1108
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,759
So early on in the process

1109
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,780
when I picked certain actors

1110
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,700
to be what I would interpret
that character to be...

1111
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,540
Like, let me give you an idea.
Liam Neeson was Optimus Prime,

1112
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,710
Michael J. Fox was Bumblebee,

1113
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,160
Hugo Weaving was Megatron.

1114
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,310
And, you know,
just in terms of movies

1115
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,120
that I wanted the artist to
look at, to kind of emulate,

1116
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,470
not the way they move,
but just how regal,

1117
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,130
like, Liam Neeson is, to,
you know, Hugo Weaving.

1118
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,259
And it's just his voice, Hugo's voice
just kept sticking in my head for Megatron.

1119
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,910
One of my producers,
Lorenzo di Bonaventura,

1120
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,510
who used to run Warner Brothers,
he did the Matrix movies.

1121
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,600
And he called Hugo and
got him into doing this,

1122
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:53,009
and Hugo was down in Australia and I
was directing him from here via iChat

1123
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,150
and they had the movie
down there,

1124
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,720
and it was amazing how I was
able to direct him so far away

1125
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,240
in modern technology.

1126
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,530
But he just has an awesome
voice for Megatron.

1127
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,080
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

1128
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,890
l was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

1129
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,770
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

1130
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,020
-And then...
-Glen, you freak.

1131
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,100
Hey! 1 am not going to jail
for you or anybody else!

1132
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,340
l have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

1133
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,870
Okay, so what?

1134
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,870
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

1135
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,640
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

1136
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,830
-I promise!
-Glen, shut up!

1137
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,130
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

1138
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,680
So I never get sick
when I shoot.

1139
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,900
You just kind of have
this adrenalin that carries you

1140
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:52,330
for a full year-and-a-half,
two years through a movie.

1141
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,900
But one day I had a little
vacation down in Cabo,

1142
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,200
‘cause I guess there
was a union break we had,

1143
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,500
and I leaned down in the elevator
of Air Force One, I'm like, "Uh-oh!

1144
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,210
"Maybe we got a little Cabo-VWabo
something going on there."

1145
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:16,100
And within an hour,
I just got violently sick with the flu,

1146
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,150
and I'm sitting in my chair,
and I'm shaking and I'm sweating,

1147
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,020
and I'm like, "I'm okay,
can direct. I'm okay, I'm okay.”

1148
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,370
And you know how you
get when you get fluey.

1149
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,839
So I went outside of the trailer,
and I had to lie down on the asphalt

1150
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,110
‘cause I was so cold.
I'm shivering.

1151
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,860
And my producer, lan Bryce, is standing there
and says, "Buddy, you gotta go.”

1152
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,740
I said, "No, no, I've never gone
home ever, ever in my career,

1153
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,620
"ever gone home sick.
No, I'm not going home.”

1154
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,590
And then we had some gigantic
days like, literally, two days away,

1155
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,000
we had to shoot downtown
at the cost of, like, $375 each,

1156
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,760
and it's a big deal to shut
all that stuff downtown.

1157
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,610
And then the set doctor
came by and she says,

1158
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,840
"You got 102-and-a-half.
You gotta go home," so...

1159
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,330
Anyway, I kicked it kind of, sort of,
like the next day, or whatever,

1160
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,980
but I was sick and kind
of whatever,

1161
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,500
and I had to direct in my trailer, s
o they had a microphone.

1162
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,000
And I was kind of like Coppola in the
Silverfish where he would direct,

1163
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,880
but he had a Jacuzzi in his.

1164
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,279
But I was trying to direct my crew

1165
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,840
and they were so slow
without me on the set.

1166
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,810
We went from 50-something set-ups
a day to 15, and I'm on a microphone,

1167
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,850
and it was just like, "Guys, you are
so slow. What's going on?"

1168
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,700
It was pretty funny.

1169
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,800
One more thing, huh?

1170
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,600
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

1171
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,900
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1172
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,930
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the...Please, please, please.

1173
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,820
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

1174
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,310
-Sorry. My bad.
-Oh, I... You couldn't...

1175
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,359
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

1176
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,069
I told you to just stay!
Just stay! God!

1177
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,200
-I told you to watch them. I told you.
-Okay, you know what?

1178
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,930
-They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
-Oh, this is bad. No!

1179
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,630
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

1180
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,610
-Oh, wet.
-No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

1181
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,350
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

1182
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,110
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

1183
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,050
-Put the...Put them away. Please.
-You have a rodent infestation.

1184
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,490
-A what?
-Shall 1 terminate?

1185
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,580
No, no, no, no. He's not a rodent,
he's a Chihuahua.

1186
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,620
This is my...This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

1187
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,899
So, you know, working
on these scenes,

1188
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:25,099
they are looking at literally window
washer poles with different heights.

1189
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,770
And those arms we had two window washer
poles with tennis balls on them

1190
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,120
so that they can actually kind of
have an eye line to watch.

1191
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,510
It makes it kind of hard

1192
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,970
when you're trying to do camera
moves without things there

1193
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:42,609
and trying to imagine
what fits in.

1194
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,840
That's why the animatics were huge
helps for the actor to see.

1195
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,059
There are times like this, this is
a shot I made up on the fly,

1196
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,450
just having Optimus look in.

1197
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,480
-You didn't even ground him.
-Almost, almost.

1198
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,690
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1199
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,359
Come on, come on.

1200
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:08,890
What? What is this?

1201
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,330
l always do these crazy things,
like, this should've been a set,

1202
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,090
but I like shooting in a real house
where I have the access to the outside.

1203
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:20,130
The houses are always way too small,
locations are small.

1204
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,960
Sometimes locations
just feel better to me.

1205
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,410
And even though this is a minuscule
toom we're shooting in

1206
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,810
with a crew.
It's sometimes ridiculous.

1207
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,090
Right there,
she grabbed that box.

1208
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:32,719
That was kind of an improve
thing. And he ran over.

1209
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,840
I mean, that's got to be his porn box,
l would think, you know.

1210
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,649
Every boy's got that
somewhere in the room,

1211
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,270
and guess we all understand that,
don't we?

1212
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,220
I'm already stressed out enough.

1213
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,780
Okay. What now?

1214
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:49,149
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1215
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,870
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1216
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:54,379
Oh, God. Oh!

1217
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,110
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
tight here and now it's gone.

1218
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,640
My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?

1219
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,750
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1220
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,530
-He's back here.
-I can't deal with this. I can't...

1221
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,330
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1222
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,510
-This is my mother's flower...
-Oops.

1223
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,770
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1224
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,680
If my parents come out here and see you,
they're gonna freak out.

1225
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,260
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1226
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,850
We must have the glasses.

1227
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,450
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1228
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,610
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1229
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:20,900
Keep searching.

1230
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,280
The way we'd get facial emotions
like this from Optimus, I'd actually...

1231
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,930
The animators up north
or down here at DD

1232
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,920
would kind of imitate something,
video themselves or whatnot,

1233
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,679
and then they'd kind of animate
how that would work.

1234
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,290
Or we'd actually use actors
to do certain things.

1235
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,280
We wouldn't use motion
capture like you would here...

1236
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,880
He wants us to be quiet.

1237
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,910
Earthquake! Move, move, move,
move, move! Earthquake!

1238
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,700
Judy! Judy, get under the table!
Move it! Duck and cover right now!

1239
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,820
How did you
get over there so fast?

1240
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,550
Wow! That was tingly!

1241
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,780
-You got to try that!
-Yeah, that looks fun.

1242
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,480
-Sam?
-Sammy?

1243
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,280
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know.

1244
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,870
-Sam?
-That's weird.

1245
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,630
-Sam!
-Ratchet, point the light.

1246
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,090
-Come on, hurry.
-Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1247
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,389
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1248
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,210
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1249
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,500
-Shut it off.
-Sam, are you in there?

1250
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,630
How come the door's locked?

1251
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,930
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1252
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,450
You know he'll start counting

1253
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,760
-if you don't open the door!
-One more chance. Five...

1254
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,940
Oh, dear.

1255
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,630
-Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
-He's counting!

1256
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,040
-Sam, just open the door.
-Three.

1257
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,190
-Oh, my.
-Two.

1258
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,150
-He's counting.
-Stand back.

1259
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,960
-What's up? What's with the bat?
-Who were you talking to?

1260
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,009
-I'm talking to you.
-Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1261
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,809
I'm a child.
You know, I'm a teenager.

1262
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,970
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1263
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,900
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1264
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,740
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1265
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,300
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1266
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,640
-Maybe it bounced...
-There was light under the door.

1267
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,750
First time I showed
this scene to Steven,

1268
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,760
I said, "Steven,
l want you to...

1269
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,330
"I'm almost done with my rough cut.
I want you to see some scenes."

1270
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,790
He goes, "No, no, no. I want to see
the movie when it's all done.”

1271
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,809
Il go, "Come on, Steven,
l want you to see this scene."

1272
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,260
So he was watching
this scene particularly,

1273
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,360
around the house,
with the robots around the house.

1274
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,550
And it was hysterical

1275
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,150
because he kept hitting me
on the leg and laughing like a kid.

1276
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,070
And I'm like,
"What are you doing?"

1277
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,960
And he goes,
"l have never seen robots do this."

1278
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,610
It was a funny moment

1279
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,630
because, considering I filed his
Raiders of the Lost Ark storyboards...

1280
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,820
And now this guy is slapping me
on the leg saying he's never seen robots.

1281
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,630
And I'm like, "You're the dude
that's invented dinosaurs,

1282
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,480
"and you've seen everything."

1283
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,990
And he goes, "But I've never seen this."
So that was kind of a fun moment.

1284
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,460
Also a funny moment,

1285
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,230
when we saw the first cut
at my house in my screening room,

1286
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,710
he kept giving me high fives
when he was watching the movie.

1287
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,440
Spielberg giving me high fives
when he's watching the movie.

1288
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,960
When a good scene
would come on,

1289
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,590
you'd see his arm go up,
"Bam!" Another high five.

1290
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,639
But, you know, when I do scenes,
I actually...

1291
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,390
When I'm doing the illustration
and the animatic process...

1292
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,810
Like, a shot like this.

1293
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,780
This was like a seminal shot
you base these scenes around.

1294
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,450
And so this shot was created
very early on

1295
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:14,450
in the animatic process.

1296
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,790
Those are the scenes
I kind of hang my hat on.

1297
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,650
Or those are what the charm
of the movie is.

1298
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,070
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1299
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,290
What is with you?

1300
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,330
Well, I'm just saying
we could. It's an option.

1301
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,240
We heard you talking to somebody, Sam.

1302
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,550
-We wanna know who.
-Mom, I told...

1303
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,430
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1304
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,290
I'm a...I'm a friend of Sam's.

1305
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,270
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1306
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,100
-She can hear you talking, Mom.
-Thank you.

1307
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,120
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1308
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,820
-Sorry that we're bugging you.
-Do you have my backpack?

1309
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,090
-Come on, hon. Let's go.
-Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1310
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,690
John Turturro in his character study,

1311
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,849
he kept saying
he was trying to imitate me.

1312
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,370
Now, I don't understand
how his character

1313
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:14,020
is even the slightest bit imitating me
because that's not who I am.

1314
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,720
But according to him, that's what I am.
See, I would never do that.

1315
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,230
John's character, we kind of felt
that he was a Sector Seven Agent,

1316
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,060
that his great-great-grandfather was
a Sector Seven Agent.

1317
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,860
He's been doing it for generations.

1318
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,400
It was actually in the movie,

1319
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,600
in some of the dialogue,
and we actually cut it out,

1320
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,430
made it pretty funny
for his character.

1321
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,530
He thinks he still lives with
his mom and whatnot.

1322
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,260
He was questioning his sexuality
in this movie.

1323
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,180
I just didn't think that was
really necessary.

1324
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,970
John, I don't think we have to
really go there.

1325
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,219
I think you're a guy, okay?

1326
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,929
So just let's keep it at that,
all right?

1327
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,450
He was a great delight to
work with.

1328
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,380
He has the best Scorsese imitation
you have ever seen.

1329
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:05,700
I think we must have that.

1330
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,830
We must have that somewhere
in the making of.

1331
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,400
-Yeah.
-Well, I need you to come with us.

1332
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,690
Whoa, way out of line.

1333
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,330
Sir, l am asking politely. Back off.

1334
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,490
-You're not taking my son.
-Really?

1335
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,710
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1336
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,930
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1337
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,050
because there's something
fishy going on around here.

1338
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,679
Yeah. There's something
a little fishy about you, your son,

1339
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,410
your little Taco Bell dog and
this whole operation you got going on here.

1340
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,850
-What operation?
-That is what we are gonna find out.

1341
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,370
I think direct contact.

1342
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,210
-Son?
-Yeah.

1343
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,849
-Step forward, please.
-Just stand?

1344
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,940
Fourteen rads.

1345
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,900
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1346
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,420
If you hurt my dog,
I'll kick your ass!

1347
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,970
I don't know where we found this
little dog stick,

1348
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,500
but I just thought that was
a funny moment.

1349
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,720
"Put that thing around the dog,
please."

1350
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,760
Mom walks out and she says,
"T'll kick your ass."

1351
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,620
Judy's a funny woman.

1352
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,850
So,

1353
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,309
LadiesMan217.

1354
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,710
That is your eBay username, right?

1355
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,160
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1356
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,430
What do you make of this?

1357
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,740
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay? And my...

1358
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,059
Is that you?

1359
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,139
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1360
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,589
Last night at the station,
you told the officer your car transformed.

1361
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,400
-Enlighten me.
-Well, here's what I said, okay?

1362
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,520
‘Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1363
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,940
-Really?
-...from me, from my home,

1364
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,809
but it's fine now
because it's back! It came back!

1365
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,710
-Well, not by itself.
-Well, no.

1366
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,880
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1367
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,650
That's funny. That is so funny.

1368
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,020
So what do you kids
know about aliens, huh?

1369
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,790
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T. ? No.

1370
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,460
-It's an urban legend.
-Yeah.

1371
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,700
You see this?

1372
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,130
This is an l-can-do-whatever-l-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1373
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,840
-Right.
-I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1374
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,290
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1375
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,550
He's just pissy 'cause
he's got to get back to guarding the mall.

1376
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,520
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1377
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,750
Especially with
your daddy's parole coming up.

1378
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,269
What? Parole?

1379
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,360
-It's nothing.
-Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1380
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,520
You know those cars
my dad used to teach me to fix?

1381
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,310
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1382
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,540
You stole cars?

1383
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,200
Well, we couldn't
always afford a babysitter,

1384
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,019
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1385
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,250
She's got her
own juvie record to prove it!

1386
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,850
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1387
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,130
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1388
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,720
It is time to talk!

1389
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,669
Big! It's big!

1390
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,929
We actually hung these actors
on this little contraption

1391
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,759
that would spin them around.

1392
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,410
I got on the car with the operators,
and it's quite fun.

1393
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,940
I got to tell you, this stunt, where we
strapped cameras, right there, bam,

1394
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,230
that looked like it hurt.

1395
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,600
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1396
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:21,470
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1397
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,549
Taking the children was a bad move.

1398
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,970
The scene where we pull
the guns out,

1399
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,410
look at the driver in the car
with John Turturro.

1400
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,590
We had little Jazz here. He uses
his magnetic gun right there.

1401
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,519
If you freeze it, watch as the gun...
Watch the guns fly up past the guys.

1402
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,470
l want you to go back in that DVD and
freeze it.

1403
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,090
Because I told the driver, I said,
"No, you will not get hurt.

1404
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:52,169
"They're rubber guns and they're on
bungee cords and they're gonna pull."

1405
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,920
If you freeze it, you'll see it hit
him kind of on the temple.

1406
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,160
He goes, "I thought you said it
wasn't gonna hurt.” Well, I'm sorry.

1407
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,440
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1408
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,480
I'm not authorised
to communicate with you

1409
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,610
except to tell you
Il can't communicate with you.

1410
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,170
-Get out of the car.
-All right.

1411
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,080
I don't know, I was kind of crazy
when I told the writers,

1412
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,629
I said, "I really want to have Bumblebee
piss on John Turturro."

1413
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,830
Call me crazy, but you know what?
At least the audiences laughed.

1414
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,010
You know, doing Transformers,
I got to tell you,

1415
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,280
a bunch of adults running around
the set the first couple of days

1416
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,530
and saying the word "Bumblebee"
and "Megatron"...

1417
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,280
l remember the first couple of days,

1418
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,680
literally about 50 airmen,
military extras

1419
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,920
at Holloman Air Force Base

1420
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,780
and I said, "I know, guys,
this sounds really stupid,

1421
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,309
"but you're gonna have this big robot
fly in, transform, land right here."

1422
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,530
And the guys were in their 20s, 30s,
they go, "Would that be Starscream?"

1423
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,180
I'm like... You know, it was...

1424
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,500
I honestly did not think

1425
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,970
there were that many fans
around the world for this thing.

1426
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,890
And how much it meant to
people that are now in their 30s...

1427
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,920
Being told but seeing in
your life is a different thing.

1428
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:28,460
But for Hasbro to say, "This is
the largest-selling toy around the world.

1429
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,660
"It's the top-five largest selling toy
around the world for 20 years."

1430
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,139
I think that's a big accomplishment.

1431
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,759
But I just didn't realise
the depth

1432
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,930
of how many fans
there were around the world.

1433
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:45,129
And, you know, right now,
you just kind of...

1434
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,990
As we were getting ready
to release the movie,

1435
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,620
the trailers were always, like,
in Yahoo,

1436
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:55,880
like, the number-one downloaded,
most watched, consistently

1437
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,969
from when they came out Christmas
till almost the day of the release.

1438
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,469
Like, Pirates would come up there,
and they would fall back down,

1439
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,730
but we were always one and two
for the entire time.

1440
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,620
And that kind of told me something.

1441
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,310
It actually became one of
the most downloaded trailers in history,

1442
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,140
according to Yahoo that
tracks this stuff.

1443
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,240
So all those kind of signs were
telling me something.

1444
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:21,770
And when it opened and it became
the largest non-sequel opening of all time,

1445
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,690
I guess I was...

1446
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:29,640
I just honestly did not think it could
do as well as it's done so far.

1447
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:33,219
I mean, it's gonna pass 300-plus
million here.

1448
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,660
And it's right up there with
the Spider-Man and Pirates 3,

1449
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,990
these gigantic franchises.

1450
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,790
And internationally,
it's gonna...

1451
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,160
Right now we're already
at 260-something,

1452
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,330
and it'll probably go to 350, 400,
I don't know.

1453
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:56,170
Anyway, I guess it was a good
gamble for the studio on this.

1454
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,790
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1455
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,660
Got him going down the street.

1456
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,430
A lot of people would've done that
helicopter shot right there digitally,

1457
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,900
but not me, for some reason.

1458
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,420
That was a real helicopter
very close to that bus.

1459
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,930
I just like things real.
As much real as I can get, I'm gonna do.

1460
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,070
It seems to be like a dying art
with a lot of directors now

1461
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,849
where you do your own stunts,
you do a lot of stunts and stuff like that.

1462
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,750
Doing these gigantic moves
on this special Akela crane,

1463
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,320
which is like 75 feet tall,
we're able to do these big drops.

1464
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,230
This was kind of a chaotic scene

1465
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,940
because we had four helicopters,
one airship,

1466
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,710
and it was quite noisy
in this river of...

1467
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,230
I don't know if that's...

1468
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,790
I don't know what's in that river.
That polluted river right there.

1469
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,480
We actually saved a guy's life
in the river that night.

1470
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,000
We just so happened to be there

1471
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,980
when a guy in a hospital uniform
was floating by.

1472
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,950
And literally, there's no
getting out of that thing

1473
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,990
because that channel travels
very quickly.

1474
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,509
And it's all algae, there's no stopping,
it goes all the way to the ocean.

1475
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:14,540
One of our electricians just threw out
a piece of cable and saved this guy,

1476
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,769
who was like an escapee from
some hospital.

1477
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,850
-Take the shot, get him.
-Take the shot.

1478
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,730
No!

1479
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,210
I've never worked on a movie

1480
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,400
where obviously I've had to do
so much digital animation,

1481
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,550
character animation.

1482
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,620
It was really one of the most
fascinating things about this movie,

1483
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,610
is actually directing these
kind of creatures

1484
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,290
and ultimately making them feel

1485
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,770
like you've got a soul inside of them
when you see these things.

1486
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,230
And I think it's done through
sound and facial stuff.

1487
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,110
You just start to feel for this thing
that doesn't even exist.

1488
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,610
I think that's kind of
the accomplishment of the movie.

1489
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,210
Stop hurting him!

1490
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,870
Don't let him move!

1491
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:19,040
Right there, right there,
that's the mock-up of Bumblebee

1492
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,340
we actually built for 200 grand.

1493
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,050
Really complicated to build.
You couldn't really shoot it that closely.

1494
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,580
Like you're gonna see
tight there,

1495
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,500
it's the mock-up which saves
money on digital shots.

1496
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,990
And then there again
you see the mock-up,

1497
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,710
and then we go back to
a digital shot.

1498
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,790
So if you use it sparingly,
tight there,

1499
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:42,120
the five, six, seven shots with that
mock-up just saved a lot of money.

1500
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,900
We only had mock-up pieces of like,
Optimus Prime,

1501
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:49,320
and certain head sections but
nothing that detailed.

1502
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,240
We built Megatron's legs in the
chamber where he's being held.

1503
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:58,780
We built about 30 feet of his legs,
which cost us half a million dollars,

1504
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,950
but when we use it through those shots
it actually saves you on effect shots.

1505
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,780
Because every one of those pieces...

1506
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,640
Reason why it's so expensive,
you've got to carve it out of foam,

1507
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,840
and then it's got to be on a steel
kind of frame to hold it up.

1508
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,010
This shot right here, I call it
"the jungle gym Optimus.”

1509
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,450
I just hated the blocking of it,

1510
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,870
but we were just kind of stuck
with the shot that we had shot.

1511
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,339
Often times the animators

1512
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,960
had to squeeze in where
we could fit our robots.

1513
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,570
We got to be very good at
shooting robots after a while.

1514
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,640
We used a special tool.

1515
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,860
It's a Porsche Cayenne with
a special crane on it where we were able

1516
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,370
to move at a high rate of
speed on a car

1517
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,880
and we can do these amazing
crane moves.

1518
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:47,540
It was actually a robot-cam
where we could spin around.

1519
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,960
Right there walking through
National Military Command,

1520
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,330
that was a room that I'd been to,

1521
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,160
it's in the basement of the Pentagon,
that's where they run wars and whatnot.

1522
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,830
And the thing that I always remember
was going down there,

1523
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,940
they have these two Lucite doors

1524
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:04,700
that are like bullet-proof and blast-proof
and you have to go through these doors.

1525
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:12,530
The chamber that we take this
conversation that comes up

1526
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,469
is called the Vault in the Pentagon,
actually.

1527
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,460
It's this soundproof room that
has this vault door

1528
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,950
and it has five seats

1529
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,130
for the Secretary of Defence and
the four different branches of military,

1530
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,730
with a direct link to the President.

1531
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,110
They feel that this room is like,

1532
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,440
the fewer people that know
about what's going on,

1533
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,690
the better a secret could be kept.

1534
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:41,060
We kind of designed it exactly
the way I saw the room

1535
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:45,110
from my memory, I guess,
when I was down at the Pentagon.

1536
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:46,660
They actually took me into the room

1537
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,740
where the two guys are there
to launch nuclear weapons.

1538
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,700
They sit in their own vault.
It was kind of an odd experience.

1539
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,190
l was down at the Pentagon

1540
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,629
when I was doing Pearl Harbor,
the tap dance.

1541
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,660
I met with every branch of the military
because of the cooperation we needed.

1542
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:09,760
Actually, Transformers, since
Black Hawk Down and Pearl Harbor...

1543
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,250
This has been the largest military
cooperation

1544
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,060
that they've done thus far
since those two movies.

1545
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,830
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1546
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,810
This was classified above top secret.

1547
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,370
This is actually
the very first stuff

1548
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:29,790
we ever shot for Transformers
tight here, the Mars rover here.

1549
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,690
It was part of our teaser.

1550
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,970
I've always been fascinated,

1551
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,990
what if the Mars rover found
something that was of human origin?

1552
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,810
So it's something I always
saved for a movie.

1553
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,469
More than just
a pile of Martian rocks.

1554
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,630
This is the image from Mars.

1555
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,990
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1556
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,910
from the base attack.

1557
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,470
We believe they are
of the same exoskeletal type,

1558
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,990
and obviously not human beings.

1559
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,960
Are we talking about an invasion?

1560
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,960
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1561
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,240
These things can be hurt
by our weapons and now they know it.

1562
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,190
That's why the virus shut us down,

1563
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,250
so we can't coordinate
against their next attack,

1564
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:15,550
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1565
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,760
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1566
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,000
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1567
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,290
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1568
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,290
And inform all commands
to prepare for imminent attack.

1569
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,650
Josh Duhamel is someone
I met

1570
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,530
in one of my Platinum Dunes meetings,
for a movie,

1571
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,230
and I just liked his energy.
He just was a great guy.

1572
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,040
And he's got those movie star
looks.

1573
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,120
Just thought he would be
a good fit in this movie.

1574
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,990
Jon Voight's one of the elder statesmen.
He's just...

1575
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,860
Actors love hanging around him.
He's a really fun guy.

1576
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,559
He's just such a good actor.

1577
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,639
And it was nice to see
all these young actors around him.

1578
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,290
He's really such a leader
among these actors.

1579
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,690
Steven wanted me to cast this movie
where I wasn't using movie stars,

1580
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,599
like he would do a lot of
his movies.

1581
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,860
Because, you know,
the movie was the star.

1582
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,940
The Transformers were the star.

1583
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,679
I think right now you've got
this Shia LaBeouf,

1584
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,040
who's just gonna explode
off the screen.

1585
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,490
He's now in Indiana Jones.

1586
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,800
The guy is, you know,
he's like the young Tom Hanks.

1587
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,140
He's just one of those kids that
really has exploded off the screen.

1588
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,940
I'm proud to have worked with him.

1589
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,930
He's been a lot of fun to work with,
actually. Great energy.

1590
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,730
Please, let this work.

1591
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,969
Fire it up, Optimus.

1592
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,380
The code.

1593
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,210
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1594
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,790
Il sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1595
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,830
They must know it's here, as well.

1596
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,240
What about Bumblebee?

1597
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:20,919
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1598
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,889
He'll die in vain if
we don't accomplish our mission.

1599
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:29,019
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1600
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,110
This is the Los Angeles Observatory,

1601
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:38,270
and it's been under renovation
for five years.

1602
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,349
And California becomes
a very tough place to shoot,

1603
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,900
where they just make
it tough to shoot.

1604
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,339
And that's been closed...

1605
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,230
And when you have a big movie,
you have a lot more clout.

1606
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,870
So going to City Hall
and convincing them

1607
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,730
that we're bringing
this gigantic movie here,

1608
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,230
and we're keeping it here
in America and in California

1609
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,250
where things are running away,
moving out of state.

1610
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,120
And we demanded certain things,
like to shoot at this observatory.

1611
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,120
I think the only way I got into this
observatory, from what I heard,

1612
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,030
because it's run by this doctor,

1613
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:19,830
he knows someone who is
married into my family

1614
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,330
called Leonard Nimoy.
You know, Spock,

1615
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,050
who's a big giver of the...

1616
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,440
Susan Bay and Leonard Nimoy
are big givers to the Observatory.

1617
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,860
Right here this is the Hoover Dam.

1618
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,340
And that's its actual wall.

1619
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,840
They don't touch it because
it's kind of a landmark, obviously,

1620
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,570
and they don't put rails
around it and whatnot.

1621
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,310
They told me I wasn't allowed to
do anything that exploded by it,

1622
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,930
because they're worried about
a terrorist blowing up the dam.

1623
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,509
Now, let me tell you something.

1624
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,180
I think you need a nuclear
bomb to blow that thing up

1625
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,010
because it's seven football
fields thick of concrete.

1626
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,570
It was made in three years.

1627
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,210
It was a constant pour. Actually it was
made in four...1 think, four years.

1628
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,350
A constant pour,

1629
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:05,520
where they poured one piece
of concrete for four years.

1630
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:06,910
When I did this movie,

1631
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,660
I mean, certain people
in California look at this movie,

1632
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,500
like, "Is this director stupid?

1633
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,360
"Because they go from Nevada
all the way to Los Angeles.

1634
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,590
"How did they go so fast?"

1635
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,730
Ultimately, most people don't
know where this dam is,

1636
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,809
which is in Nevada.

1637
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:26,090
Half of it's in Nevada, half is
in Arizona, by the way.

1638
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,130
And I tried to shoot Los Angeles
not as Los Angeles

1639
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,240
but Anytown, USA.

1640
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,810
That shot you just saw there,
that crane shot by the dam,

1641
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,750
we had to keep our crane very
low because of possible arcing,

1642
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,610
where it would arc from the gigantic
power lines onto the crane,

1643
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,900
just because of metals too
close to these power lines

1644
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,820
that could jump and
kill my crew members.

1645
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,070
It's very scary,
I must say.

1646
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,370
This was shot down
at the Spruce Goose,

1647
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,950
where we built this entire set.
We did some digital extensions here.

1648
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:06,610
We used some of
the actual Spruce Goose walls.

1649
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,880
It just gave me a lot more
production value.

1650
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,370
Right there,
you're seeing that's all real,

1651
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,080
everything there is built,
those feet are real.

1652
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,130
It even says "Bay Foundry"
tight there on that little plaque

1653
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,100
tight there if you zoom in.

1654
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,000
My grandfather actually helped
build that platform...No, I'm kidding.

1655
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,850
My grandfather was in
the stonewashing business.

1656
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,290
Like you need to know that.

1657
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,630
He actually never thought
I would make it in the film industry.

1658
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,610
He always thought I would
be stonewashing jeans.

1659
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,600
Thank God I wasn't doing that.

1660
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,150
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1661
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,370
And you didn't think
the United States military might need to know

1662
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,760
that you're keeping a
hostile alien robot frozen in the basement?

1663
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,490
Until these events,
we had no credible threat to national security.

1664
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,650
Well, you got one now.

1665
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,520
So why Earth?

1666
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,330
Right here, that was a real
structure as well.

1667
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,580
We built part of the hands.

1668
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,370
We walk into this next scene.

1669
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,440
l had a very funny speech
for John Turturro.

1670
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,240
He actually...John kind of
sparked off something I said,

1671
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:21,990
and he made up this very
funny speech

1672
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,820
which is in kind of the added extras,
extra scenes.

1673
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,190
Right here,
that was an all-digital shot.

1674
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,310
For some reason,
I just wanted pictures of the First Seven.

1675
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:44,630
I don't know what it means.

1676
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,540
I think these are the guys that helped
discover this Cube long before,

1677
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and then they built the dam
over this Cube.

1678
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,770
President Hoover had the dam built around it.

1679
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,190
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1680
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,370
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1681
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,890
or any alien species on the outside.

1682
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,030
So when we had to shoot
by the F-22 on the ground,

1683
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,280
it was a totally secured area.

1684
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,270
And they wouldn't allow
Simon Warnock,

1685
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,050
who was my assistant director, near the
plane because he was a foreigner.

1686
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,799
And I didn't want him near the plane
because he's clumsy.

1687
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:30,769
It's $130 million plane made out of
composite material and whatnot.

1688
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:33,250
They wouldn't allow your cell phones
near the plane.

1689
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,930
I think they were worried about radio
interference or something,

1690
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,709
I'm not sure.

1691
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,470
That Blackout pilot was

1692
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,530
actually the helicopter pilot of
that very helicopter,

1693
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
and when we hired Moustache Man,

1694
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,070
the guy actually flying,

1695
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,870
I said, "My God, you look just like
the Moustache Man I'd imagined."

1696
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,400
And Steven Spielberg
called me up

1697
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:55,670
and goes, "That's exactly how
I pictured Moustache Man.”

1698
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:59,760
So, we actually had him delay
his wedding and his honeymoon

1699
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,610
so that we can come and shoot
Transformers

1700
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,950
and thus make more money
for his future babies.

1701
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,120
So we helped in the cause.

1702
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,840
-Right? That's Wolverine!
-That's very funny.

1703
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,200
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1704
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,870
I got a phone.

1705
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,299
Originally when we did this scene,
I really wanted to have a little iPod,

1706
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,360
but Steve Jobs wouldn't allow it.

1707
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,130
So we ended up using some,
I guess, Nokia phone or whatnot.

1708
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,750
On that sign behind John Turturro

1709
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:33,630
it says, "The last accident
happened here 322 days ago,”

1710
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:39,010
because that meant that 323 days ago
someone was killed in that very facility,

1711
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,790
as you saw the scratches
in the wall and whatnot.

1712
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,970
l actually ended up cutting
it out just for time.

1713
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,930
I think when we do
Transformers 2,

1714
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,010
I think this is a start of something
where we can branch off

1715
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,759
what can really go on,
happen in our world.

1716
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:06,240
That is, if I'm gonna do Transformers 2,
still haven't made the deal yet.

1717
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,410
Listen, 1 gambled my fee
on this movie.

1718
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,680
That means I put my cojones
on the line

1719
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,519
where I gambled my entire fee
that this movie would make money.

1720
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,570
So that's why when I go to Vegas
with my friends I don't gamble.

1721
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,330
‘Cause I gamble on
$150 million movies.

1722
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,390
I don't need to be gambling
on $20 slot machines

1723
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,180
or, you know, $5 hands of blackjack.

1724
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,200
I gamble on big-ass movies,
that's what I do.

1725
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,700
Go! Go! Go!

1726
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:33,860
Move!

1727
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,410
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1728
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,559
Banachek. What's going on?

1729
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,380
Well, the NBE One hangar has lost power...

1730
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,590
-What?
-...and the backup generator

1731
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,450
-is just not gonna cut it.
-Do you have an arms room?

1732
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,670
That was Kenny Bates and lan Bryce.

1733
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:57,370
Kenny Bates is my stunt coordinator,
who I've worked with since Bad Boys.

1734
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,460
He's like my older brother.

1735
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:08,290
He's like the Rain Man of stunts.

1736
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11,110
Sometimes you can't understand
what he's saying,

1737
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,060
but he's brilliant in his physics
and whatnot.

1738
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:17,290
He's gonna kill me for saying that,
but that's the truth.

1739
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,880
There's so much physics
when you do stunts

1740
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,690
in what can go wrong and trying
to predict what can go wrong.

1741
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:30,650
That's why we've had such
an amazing safety record together.

1742
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,780
Because we do very
dangerous stuff,

1743
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:36,590
but we've just been incredibly
safe about it.

1744
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,240
Forty millimetre sabot rounds on that table!

1745
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,010
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1746
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:51,010
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1747
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,269
He's gonna know what to do with the Cube.

1748
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,129
-Your car? It's confiscated.
-Then unconfiscate it.

1749
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:55,910
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1750
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,280
-You don't know.
-Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1751
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,680
You just wanna sit here
and wait and see what happens?

1752
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,600
l have people's lives
at stake here, young man.

1753
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,390
Take him to his car!

1754
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,290
Drop it.

1755
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,519
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1756
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,600
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1757
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,790
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1758
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:14,950
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1759
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,019
I'm ordering you under
S-Seven executive jurisdiction.

1760
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,370
S-Seven don't exist.

1761
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:20,110
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1762
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,139
-I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
-Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1763
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,400
-Simmons?
-Yes, sit?

1764
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,120
I'd do what he says.
Losing's really not an option for these guys.

1765
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,560
All right. Okay.

1766
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:41,810
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the world
on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1767
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,720
No, no!

1768
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,040
Stop! You got to stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1769
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:53,460
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1770
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,190
Are you okay?

1771
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,910
They didn't hurt you, right?

1772
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,750
Listen to me. The Cube is here and
the Decepticons are coming.

1773
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,269
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1774
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,490
They're not gonna hurt you.

1775
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,820
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1776
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:25,090
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1777
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,860
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1778
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,600
Steve Jablonsky did our music.
He is Hans Zimmer's protégé.

1779
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,670
Hans helped a little
on the movie, as well.

1780
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,100
It was very hard to get that theme,

1781
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,440
that heroic theme I wanted for
Transformers.

1782
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,360
And just one day, I said,
"Steve, that's the theme."

1783
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,080
I played it for Steven and Steven goes,
"I love that, it's very memorable."

1784
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:50,750
Because it sounds like a Western.
It's just got that great tragic hero.

1785
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:56,160
Which I liked. It's just so powerful
how to get the right mood

1786
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,770
through music.

1787
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,790
That's why I really feel that sound
in movies is 50% of a movie.

1788
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,240
What you try to do with music is
you try to set up different themes.

1789
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,090
You've got the heroic theme
for the Optimus.

1790
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:14,750
You've got Sam's theme
which is kind of by the lake.

1791
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:22,139
You've got the Decepticon theme
which is kind of, we found this...

1792
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,700
There's this church choir in London

1793
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:31,110
that's got this very dark-sounding
church they record in,

1794
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:36,410
and we gave them operatic kind
of words that they sang.

1795
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:40,349
And it was just this chilling kind of
Decepticon music.

1796
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:41,970
-Will it work?
-Anything's possible!

1797
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,230
-Did you see that...
-All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1798
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:45,580
Mr Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1799
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,390
You saw that Camaro transform
tight there.

1800
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,190
That was officially the lamest shot
of the entire movie.

1801
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,660
That's why we cut it down.
You always have turkey shots.

1802
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,360
And that was, let me tell you,
a turkey.

1803
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,700
I'm gonna tell you another shot
when we get there.

1804
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,960
Steven actually wanted to
pay for it.

1805
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:06,380
It's where Optimus’ nose unfolds
and you see his face

1806
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:10,320
after he slides around the Camaro.
I never ended up putting it in the movie.

1807
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,210
I left it off.

1808
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:23,830
lam Megatron!

1809
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:34,160
Right here, that thing flying,
I didn't like that thing flying.

1810
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:37,390
That flew a little farther than
l wanted for comfort.

1811
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:41,390
We had stuntmen down below,
but no one was hurt.

1812
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,389
-The Cube's okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

1813
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:44,510
Well, put the seat belt on.

1814
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,700
Pour it on him!

1815
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:58,130
That one sound when you see
Starscream on the top of that dam,

1816
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:00,990
and he's vibrating, that's my favourite
sound in the entire movie.

1817
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:04,589
When you hear his body shudder,
tight there.

1818
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:09,930
What I'm gonna do in Transformers
2 is I'm gonna focus more on the faces.

1819
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,730
I guess, because of the limited number
of effects shots, I limited myself

1820
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,200
on how close I went into
these faces

1821
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,840
so that I can, I guess,
do more with less.

1822
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,719
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1823
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,070
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1824
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:28,110
-We're hot! We're live!
-Where are the mikes?

1825
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,299
Mikes?

1826
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:31,600
This doesn't work without mikes, Simmons.

1827
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1828
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,410
This is called our Alien Archive room,
that I thought was fun.

1829
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,640
It's got books going 40 feet
tall up into the stacks.

1830
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,290
This holds all the Sector Seven stuff
that's been there through history

1831
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,220
of anything alien, having to do
with our world here.

1832
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,060
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1833
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,860
There's Optimus.

1834
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,450
That shot where we're tracking
behind Optimus,

1835
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,230
I'm actually in the Porsche Cayenne.
We're going 55 miles an hour,

1836
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,690
as an entire semi locks up,
and we are right behind.

1837
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,760
I mean, I gotta tell you,
that's a little scary.

1838
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:25,230
We shot that scene where
they're driving in the Valley of Fire.

1839
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,460
We actually blew a roadblock
because the sun was going down.

1840
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:32,180
Which means we passed a cop
roadblock, and we kept shooting

1841
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:35,740
on this road, and they
were so pissed.

1842
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:40,030
They hauled lan Bryce, my producer,
and he had to kiss a bunch of hands

1843
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:44,780
in Vegas or they were gonna shut
us down at the Hoover Dam.

1844
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,509
So thank God to lan, but I had to
get this shot. And you know what?

1845
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:50,370
I'll run any police roadblock
I have to if the sun's going down,

1846
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,060
and I got a beautiful shot.

1847
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:55,410
See, I'm never really good
at taking no for an answer.

1848
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:00,940
I don't know, "Whoops,
I didn't see it, sorry."

1849
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,330
"This is Defence Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1850
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,130
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

1851
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:08,790
What was that?

1852
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,420
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1853
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,620
Sir, have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1854
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:23,700
Doing this highway scene, we shot
it on a freeway, near Riverside.

1855
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:29,610
I've done a lot of car stuff in
my day. We did this in two days.

1856
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:33,740
We're actually launching cars
off a car carrier that are dropping

1857
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:37,830
onto the ground and the Bay Buster
is actually ramming into these cars.

1858
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,429
It's a special thing that I built on
Bad Boys 2. Go see that disc,

1859
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,780
and then you'll learn all about it.

1860
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:44,000
So on this freeway, you can see
all those people standing up there?

1861
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:45,940
They heard that Transformers
was shooting

1862
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,559
in the neighbourhood. So those are
real fans actually watching us shoot.

1863
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:54,330
Right here, this is done with a special
go-cart and then we transition

1864
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:59,440
to the Porsche Cayenne camera and
we tilt down and we pull away.

1865
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:04,730
Two different moves and we
seamlessly blend it in together.

1866
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,900
So I wanted Bonecrusher,
tight here, as he slaps through,

1867
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,009
I wanted him to look like a hockey player.
So I had the...

1868
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,830
Right here, this looks like
a hockey player

1869
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,800
and then we go to
a football tackle, right there.

1870
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,650
That was my favourite shot
in the whole movie, right there.

1871
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:22,559
This was over a freeway and
we had the bigger moving crane.

1872
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:26,980
We blocked this doing plates
and whatnot.

1873
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:32,620
What I realised in the animation is
the animators are not fight choreographers.

1874
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,070
Fight choreographers have been working
20 years and been doing this.

1875
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,680
So they spent forever on this stuff
tight here, you're seeing right now,

1876
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,920
and they were never getting
it right.

1877
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:45,469
So what we did is,
once I got these plates, these shots,

1878
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:49,100
l actually used real fighters
that had different abilities,

1879
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:50,860
different fighting skills,

1880
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:54,030
and I would videotape them
by a pole or whatnot,

1881
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:57,050
and kind of imitate these angles.
And we actually had humans

1882
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:01,759
fighting this out at the same beat,
at the same time as these plates.

1883
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:05,879
And it wasn't motion-capture,
but they were able to copy

1884
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:09,040
what these fighters were doing
in the time they were doing it.

1885
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,709
So that became a very effective way
for us to work.

1886
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,950
The voice of this little Frenzy guy,

1887
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,429
he's just got the most
amazing human voice,

1888
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:24,750
and we were able to overlay
some mechanical sounds over it.

1889
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,990
It's amazing that humans can
actually talk like this.

1890
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,400
But it makes it quite funny.

1891
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:31,690
If you listen really closely,
he's saying the word "Tutankhamen."

1892
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,460
He keeps saying "Tutankhamen,"

1893
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:36,950
I don't know, it's just a funny thing,
if you listen to it.

1894
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,400
Sucker, burn!

1895
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,320
Oh, shit!

1896
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,480
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1897
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,590
Raptors, let's scramble, scramble, scramble.

1898
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,990
Here we are
at Edwards Air Force Base,

1899
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,360
where they're actually
going into real F-22s,

1900
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:01,390
unlike Die Hard,
where they had to use fake F-22s,

1901
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,560
because, I don't know,
they just don't have the juice.

1902
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,880
But we got real stuff.

1903
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:09,260
That's because I got the phone
number to the Pentagon.

1904
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,020
-Come on, let's go! Mount up!
-Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1905
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,380
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1906
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,010
Wait. What am I supposed
to do with these?

1907
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,320
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1908
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:23,480
This is like RadioShack
dinosaur radios or something, man.

1909
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,310
Doing this downtown stuff,
I gotta tell you,

1910
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,250
is one of the harder things
that I've done

1911
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:32,040
in terms of keeping all these
different storylines going simultaneously.

1912
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:35,340
And unfortunately, what made it
harder for me is was not able to shoot

1913
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,800
on one block consecutively.
I literally had to be shoved around LA

1914
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:44,620
to different blocks, and so I had to
use basically three different blocks.

1915
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:50,370
One in Detroit, two in LA...Actually four.
One on the Universal back lot.

1916
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:55,410
And blend them all together
as if they're one.

1917
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,030
So some of the geography shots,
I don't really have,

1918
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:03,350
because I was never able to do it.
Because they were different blocks,

1919
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:07,080
and it would give things away.
So it made it very tough on me

1920
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:11,430
to figure out some of the stuff.
But one of the helps was

1921
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:15,090
we had to shoot on the weekends,
so l was able to assemble

1922
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:18,790
what we were shooting,
so I can keep track of everything.

1923
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,690
You know, it's just...

1924
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:26,290
It's really hard when you've
got multiple stories going on.

1925
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,370
Especially this is like a 25-minute
ending action scene.

1926
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,550
This is one of my
favourite moments, here.

1927
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,160
This was shot on the Universal back lot,
this shot.

1928
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:44,540
With a real truck,
we moved it on cue.

1929
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,780
Right there, we kind of shake it
because I'm counting it out.

1930
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:52,349
We kind of walk it out for Shia,
how fast Bumblebee will be moving.

1931
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,929
It's just beautiful animation right here,
and how he's straining, right there.

1932
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,130
See that arm going down and
the head shaking, right here.

1933
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,099
You can really get into the fine detail
with these animators.

1934
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:08,790
That was Universal back lot,
tight here and then the shot with Josh

1935
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,880
in the close up, that was downtown.
So it's just...

1936
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:17,650
You gotta remember exactly what piece you
shot that you need in another place.

1937
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,900
Army Black Hawk
inbound to your location. Over.

1938
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,580
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1939
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,920
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1940
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,570
That's the Universal back lot,
tight there.

1941
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,000
And again, Universal back lot.

1942
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,900
DreamWorks kept having meetings
on the Universal back lot,

1943
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:43,070
they kept hearing explosions.
Now we come down to downtown.

1944
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:46,700
And now we're in the back lot.
See how you can go back and forth.

1945
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:50,820
You really can't tell. That's the back lot,
and now we're downtown.

1946
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:52,669
Let's go! Move!

1947
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,559
I'm not gonna leave you.

1948
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,920
Coming up here, these are some
of my favourite shots, right here.

1949
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:20,089
This just takes it to a whole new level.
l wanted these robots not to be,

1950
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:24,960
what I call "Clunky, fat, f-ing robots."

1951
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:28,870
That was the lingo
on the animator's desk.

1952
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:33,469
So we looked at a lot of ninja movies,
karate movies, samurai,

1953
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,370
things like Gladiator.

1954
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,990
We just wanted them to be warriors
that can jump and spin.

1955
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:49,970
If you look at this scene, right here,
coming up, where he's shooting,

1956
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:54,269
there's gonna be something right
here on the roof, right there,

1957
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,110
it says "Takara Sushi."

1958
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:58,500
There's actually a whole
bunch of things.

1959
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:02,070
If you actually pause at certain cars,
random cars, you'll see things

1960
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:06,110
on licence plates. You'll see Easter
eggs all over this movie.

1961
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:13,130
You'll see different shop signs
that say certain things.

1962
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,010
You'll even see my address
to my house on one of these things.

1963
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,360
I'm not telling you where it is.

1964
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:22,490
Got the tail number to my plane,
it's 4500 XRAY.

1965
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:28,490
We needed a tail number,
so why not use mine? Sounds good, too.

1966
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,839
Fall back!

1967
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,620
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1968
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,710
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1969
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,930
We need air cover down here now!

1970
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,150
Sam, help me with this.

1971
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:57,969
-That all you got, Megatron?
-Come here, little cretin.

1972
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:00,350
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1973
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,610
No! I want two!

1974
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,589
What's going on?

1975
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,690
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1976
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,730
Oh, these things just don't die.

1977
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,700
Oh, we're so dead.

1978
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,890
-Wrap it around the head.
-Sam!

1979
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:21,179
Where's the Cube?

1980
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:22,269
-Right there.
-Okay.

1981
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,389
And take that and wrap it around

1982
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:24,470
the base and then put it around his neck.

1983
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,930
-Okay?
-Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1984
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,820
That building.

1985
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,140
-Okay.
-What?

1986
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,929
All right, 1 can't leave my guys back there,
so here, take this flare.

1987
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,290
Okay, there's a tall,
white building with statues on top.

1988
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:42,500
-Go to the roof. Set the flare.
-No.

1989
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:44,490
-Signal the chopper and set the flare.
-No, no. I can't do this!

1990
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,520
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1991
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:51,010
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1992
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,110
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1993
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,740
-You got to go. You got to go.
-No, I'm not leaving.

1994
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,010
-You need to go. Go.
-No, I'm not leaving

1995
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,780
till l get Bumblebee
out of here, okay?

1996
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,620
You always want to
te-do things in movies

1997
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:02,200
and that prop of
the Cube is kind of lame.

1998
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,300
You know?
It's just...

1999
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:09,850
It's just not what it should be.
But you can't catch everything

2000
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:13,470
because you've got so
many millions of parts moving on.

2001
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,250
Those Black Hawks that are
flying through downtown,

2002
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:19,840
it was the only time in my life

2003
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,970
I've wanted a religious service
to end quickly,

2004
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:26,920
because we were not allowed to
fly them close to downtown

2005
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:30,830
while this religious service was going on,
tight where Shia is running towards.

2006
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,780
Il was even thinking of
offering donations

2007
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,660
so that we could continue shooting.
They didn't wanna buy that.

2008
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,640
Watch out!

2009
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:50,720
-Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
-I'm going! I'm going!

2010
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:52,599
Get out of here now!

2011
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,740
When you watch this movie,
tight here, when you see this,

2012
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:06,760
you're actually rooting for a truck.
I mean, isn't it silly? But it works.

2013
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:11,490
And this we did digitally, with
the Porsche Cayenne coming around.

2014
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:16,170
Kind of like that shot that I did on Bad Boys
where I spun around the guys.

2015
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:20,100
And I've done it subsequently
in The Rock and Armageddon

2016
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,670
and why not do
it with Optimus Prime here?

2017
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,590
Now, Megatron was not a big gun
because I just didn't know

2018
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:29,190
how I would explain him
being a big gun.

2019
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:31,000
Just doesn't make sense.

2020
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:36,500
Shooting that hotel thing,
we shot it with a little, tiny little helicopter.

2021
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:41,030
With, like a lawnmower engine,
it can take a tiny little camera up

2022
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:44,240
and two guys with remote
controls control it.

2023
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:49,670
We got a lot of flak
for the face of Megatron.

2024
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,090
He was a little uglier
than he is now.

2025
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:55,629
And the fans, rightly so,
complained about it.

2026
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:59,110
And we kind of fixed the face.
I think he's pretty cool.

2027
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,350
He looks menacing.

2028
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,360
This was done down in Detroit
and then smashing into a real set

2029
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,350
here with stuntmen diving out.
But shooting the deli shot,

2030
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:16,090
it was very complicated because we had to
shoot it against a bluescreen.

2031
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:19,389
We had to rip up the car, violently,
and we had to throw it,

2032
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:21,420
once it ripped up,
into the window.

2033
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:24,070
So we shoot it, first with
people inside the deli,

2034
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,080
then we have Shia run past
the deli window, several times.

2035
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,210
Then we rip up the car and
we pull it into the window, right here.

2036
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:34,780
Then we marry them all together
to make it look very dangerous.

2037
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,559
This shot with Starscream landing,
those are real cars

2038
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,680
that are getting flipped violently.

2039
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:45,660
Simultaneously, they're being pulled
by giant cranes on these canister rigs

2040
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:49,540
that are just extremely violent
when they pull things.

2041
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,850
So imagine no robots there
and just figuring out timing

2042
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:02,769
of how long that plane's supposed
to transform to it flying out.

2043
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:06,969
I mean, you really,
as you're operating camera,

2044
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,790
it's a little bit of guesswork
trying to fit it in.

2045
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:16,150
There's Ron, you just
saw him there,

2046
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:18,610
the African-American
sitting in the chair.

2047
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,640
Ron is homeless and
a very intelligent homeless man.

2048
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:29,380
We offer him money, he doesn't want it.
But he is a huge fan of movies.

2049
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,510
And what he does, he knows everything
about the film industry.

2050
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,220
He knows so many people
in the business,

2051
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,460
and he literally becomes
a mascot of the set.

2052
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:42,310
He followed us wherever we went.
He actually rented a car,

2053
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:45,830
or hitched a way, got a bus ticket,
and he made it to Detroit.

2054
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,349
And we were all surprised
to see him there.

2055
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,790
And I told lan, "We gotta get
him a hotel room."

2056
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:53,690
And he didn't want it,
but we forced him to take it.

2057
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:58,920
But Ron's gonna be in all my movies
from now on. He's a great guy.

2058
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:03,180
That was the train station
down in Detroit.

2059
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:06,650
It's now gonna be, I think, destroyed,
so this is the last movie to be shot there.

2060
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:47,620
So we're doing this scene with
these gigantic metal prongs

2061
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:50,790
that are off the tow truck,
and we're actually backing up

2062
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:55,450
that tow truck and the driver is Cory
who is dressed as a girl.

2063
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,280
He's got a little, cute pink top on.
He looked frightening as a girl.

2064
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:11,640
This isn't going well!

2065
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:13,070
Shoot! Shoot!

2066
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,790
And that shot, where we're flipping
the cars up, we have these car flippers

2067
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,809
and it gets as close to possible and
it triggers the car flippers

2068
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,820
as the car comes up.

2069
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:58,240
Nice shot.

2070
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:01,389
-That tank is definitely dead now.
-All right, let's go! We got business!

2071
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,560
Now this scene,
where we did downtown on this rooftop,

2072
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:09,750
it's about 20 storeys tall.
Shia is escaping from Megatron,

2073
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:13,839
and he climbs on one of these statues
and lan Bryce, my producer, goes

2074
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,519
"Well, you gonna do this bluescreen,
tight?"

2075
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,150
I said, "No, 1 wanna do it as real as
possible, let's do it real."

2076
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,370
Let's hang Shia out there,
let's hang him by a wire.

2077
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:32,620
This is a Black Hawk, actually,
hovering right over an LA building.

2078
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:36,820
It's kind of an interesting sight having
Black Hawks flying through Los Angeles

2079
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,910
at such low altitude.

2080
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,780
Right there, that's the real tail
of a helicopter mock-up

2081
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,639
that comes past Shia.

2082
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:49,059
It's safe because
Shia's ducking down,

2083
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:52,210
but that thing is actually busting plaster,
concrete and whatnot.

2084
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:55,870
But those are the type of shots that
I like to involve the actor in.

2085
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:59,589
‘Cause it just gives more intensity
and realism to the scene.

2086
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:05,990
I said to Shia, I said, "Shia,
I'm gonna hang you out on this building.

2087
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,519
"And there's not a lot of foot room up there,
but you're safe with wires."

2088
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:12,780
And he says, "Okay, all right,
I'm cool, I'll do it, I'll do it.”

2089
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:16,650
Well, literally the moment before
he was supposed to go up and get on

2090
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:20,639
this very secured statue and
totally safe wire,

2091
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:23,870
even though you can't see it,
it's on either side of his hip.

2092
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:28,009
He goes, "Mike, come here.
I can't do this."

2093
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:31,160
I said, "Are you kidding me, Shia?
You're gonna embarrass yourself

2094
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,180
"in front of the whole crew."

2095
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:36,770
Now, mind you, in my own mind,
I would never go out there.

2096
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,809
But I'm a director so I can tell
people to do things like that.

2097
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:41,780
With all the machismo and whatnot.

2098
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:43,730
"Dude, you're gonna go out there,
and you're gonna like it.

2099
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:46,390
"You get paid way more money than
those kids on Fear Factor.

2100
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:49,540
"So get the hell out there."
So of course he did it.

2101
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,390
It was an awesome shot,
because it's totally real.

2102
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:55,960
And three minutes into doing it,
Shia just loved it.

2103
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:02,590
l was actually supposed to
be hanging out of a Mercedes,

2104
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,330
grabbed by Megatron, and climb
out of the sun roof, which I did.

2105
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:11,160
And they had me wired by a cable
where they pulled my ankle up,

2106
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:16,020
and he was supposed to yank me.
But in light of not doing that shot,

2107
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:20,050
Il was the guy that got flicked by
Megatron and goes into the cab.

2108
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:21,970
So that is me.

2109
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:26,790
Sam?

2110
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:33,730
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

2111
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,020
No sacrifice,

2112
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:40,110
-no victory.
-If cannot defeat Megatron,

2113
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:42,900
you must push the Cube into my chest.

2114
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:46,260
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

2115
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:48,340
Get behind me.

2116
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:52,290
It's you and me, Megatron.

2117
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:55,170
No, it's just me, Prime.

2118
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:02,150
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

2119
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:12,030
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

2120
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:32,990
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

2121
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:35,429
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

2122
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:36,710
Hey.

2123
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:39,780
Bring the rain. All right?

2124
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,120
All right, let's kill these things.

2125
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,570
-Move, move, move!
-Remember, aim low.

2126
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,520
Armour's weak under the chest.

2127
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:58,730
Target marked. Still waiting.

2128
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,750
Time on target, 20 seconds.

2129
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:09,390
F-22s, we're still waiting.

2130
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:15,870
Move out!

2131
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:20,200
Incoming!

2132
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,310
Weapons armed. Status green.

2133
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,980
Run! Move!

2134
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,690
Second wave's on approach.

2135
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:03,570
What is that? Break off!

2136
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,490
-Copy.
-It's either a massive amount of...

2137
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:08,410
Doing the aerial shots, basically
I'm having my helicopter pilot

2138
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:13,230
fly with a VistaVision,
which is a much wider negative,

2139
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:17,470
larger, so you can move it around a bit.
And he's flying as fast as he can go

2140
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:20,640
through these buildings and around.

2141
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,340
It's kind of, very much

2142
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:25,269
how we did some of our Pearl Harbor stuff.

2143
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:29,640
And I had actually some of the same plane
animators that worked on Pearl

2144
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:31,580
work on this.

2145
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:41,540
When I went to test screen
this movie with the studio,

2146
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:45,950
we did it in Arizona,
and we were doing a family theatre

2147
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,390
where it was a bunch of kids at 5:00,
with parents.

2148
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,950
And then we were doing
an adult screening with adults

2149
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:59,290
at about 8:00,
and they were both 500-person houses.

2150
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:02,710
So they're very large.
What I do when I put my movies together

2151
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:06,210
is 1 actually will put a small group
. .
In a screening room.

2152
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:10,020
Different-aged kids, where they'll watch
a very rough cut, give me some ideas.

2153
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,450
It's very good to just have to show
your movie up on a bigger screen

2154
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:15,610
so you can see it and put it
in front of people.

2155
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:18,820
You can see where they get confused,
what they're liking, what's not working.

2156
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:22,610
So I did that twice.
First started with nine-year-olds to 16.

2157
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:26,280
And then I went
from 16 to 25-year-olds.

2158
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,200
And it prepared me
for my studio screening.

2159
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:30,759
Even being a final cut director,
it's still intense.

2160
02:06:31,160 --> 02:06:32,349
Because they come there

2161
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:34,740
with 30 people from Paramount
and DreamWorks.

2162
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:36,450
Everyone is nervous.

2163
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:39,460
They determine what
they're gonna spend on advertising.

2164
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:43,180
That very moment, you get numbers.
So we watched it with the families.

2165
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:45,720
It went well, they were laughing
at the different jokes,

2166
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:48,220
they were not laughing
at some of the adult jokes.

2167
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,990
There were several applause
through the screening.

2168
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:53,929
And I'm like, "That's kind
of fun, but odd.

2169
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:57,200
"They're applauding three or four times
during the screening.”

2170
02:06:57,680 --> 02:06:59,960
Then I quickly ran over
to the adult theatre.

2171
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:02,679
So I saw the adult one start up,
then I ran back to the kids one

2172
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:05,570
where we did a focus group,
26 people.

2173
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,460
Guy stands up saying,
"l have nothing to do with this movie.

2174
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,180
"How would you rate this movie?"

2175
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:14,230
Excellent, blah blah blah,
very good, poor, good, whatever.

2176
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:19,160
All 26 hands raised at "Excellent."
And I'm like, "Well, okay, it's a fluke,

2177
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:22,300
"it's a family thing, whatever."
Then I ran back to the adult screening.

2178
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:25,950
And I sat next to this guy, I was just
sitting in some random aisle seat

2179
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:28,650
where I had a little sound box
where I got to control the volume

2180
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:33,080
because the volume is not really
precise because it's not fully mixed sound.

2181
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:37,050
It's a little abrasive at times.
And the guy knew I was a director

2182
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:40,090
because I told him,
‘cause he asked what that box was.

2183
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:42,870
Halfway through the movie,
the people are really enjoying it,

2184
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:46,120
you can see the adults are laughing.
And I asked this guy, he was about 30,

2185
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:49,970
I said, "So do you like
this kind of movie?"

2186
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:53,540
And he looked at me and goes,
"Yeah, not really my thing, not really."

2187
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:56,640
So I'm thinking, "This movie sucks.
It's just going to be a kids' movie.

2188
02:07:57,080 --> 02:08:00,840
"All right, fine. It'll be a kids' movie."
Every emotion goes through your body

2189
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:04,179
when you're a director
sitting there and watching

2190
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:07,240
500 people at a time
.
see your movie.

2191
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:10,490
And they don't care who you are,
what you are, nothing.

2192
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,440
They'll tell you,
they'll be frank as...

2193
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:18,900
It can be a brutalizing experience,
because they will tell you

2194
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:22,059
how bad or good your movie is.
Then we did a focus group

2195
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:25,570
with the adults and we had
a huge round of applause

2196
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:28,540
at the end of the movie.
And I'm like, "That's kind of odd.

2197
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:30,920
"These are adults.
This is a robot movie.

2198
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:35,070
"What are they applauding for?
I thought that this was a kids' movie."

2199
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:38,520
So we go to this focus group.

2200
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,300
And this woman who is, I gotta
tell you, she was like 40.

2201
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:45,750
And she says...And this was
after they raised their hands,

2202
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:50,980
which out of 26 people, 24 of them raised
at "Excellent" and 2, "Very good."

2203
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,500
And I'm thinking,

2204
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,690
"Well, that's kind of odd,
‘cause that just never happens."

2205
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:59,660
That's a lot of people
saying "Excellent."

2206
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,240
And this woman raised
her hand.

2207
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:06,400
She says, "I was dragged to this movie.
I didn't want to see this movie."

2208
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:09,200
And she goes, "But you know what?

2209
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:12,720
"This movie,
it reinvents the superheroes."

2210
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:15,730
She goes, "I'm tired of the capes
and the suits and all that stuff,

2211
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:19,040
"and this totally is something new and
different that I've never seen before."

2212
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:20,600
And that's when it kind of hit me.

2213
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:22,870
And then we got the numbers
from the kids' audience

2214
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:28,019
which was a 94. That's a huge score.
I've never had that score in my life.

2215
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:30,130
I mean, that's a massive number.

2216
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:31,650
Then we got the adult score.

2217
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,450
It was the exact same, 94.

2218
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,670
So obviously the studio
is doing cartwheels.

2219
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:40,570
I guess it was a good experience
as far as movie testing goes.

2220
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:47,900
The parents here were something
that the audience,

2221
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:51,820
they all felt, what happened to them?
So this is an additional scene I shot

2222
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:55,030
just to let people into
what happened to them

2223
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:57,230
and that they're keeping
this conspiracy going.

2224
02:09:57,560 --> 02:09:59,380
Likewise, they also wanted to
know what happened to Starscream.

2225
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:02,280
So I added it again, where you
see him go back into space.

2226
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:05,530
What they told me in that test
was I had to fix this ending.

2227
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,820
And a lot of times, if they don't
like the ending, an audience,

2228
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:10,550
they'll actually be harder
on the grading of the movie.

2229
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:14,610
But somehow, there was so much
goodwill to this movie, that they...

2230
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:18,910
They still gave it a very high score.

2231
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:22,099
I had to fix some issues
with the Cube.

2232
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:25,790
I had to show...It was very vague
for them to understand

2233
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:28,809
what Sam had to do by pushing
the Cube into his chest.

2234
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:30,710
So we had to do something
about the observatory

2235
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,830
with Optimus showing the spark.
And talking about,

2236
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:39,370
he'll put it into his own chest.
And then we had to do a few more shots

2237
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,140
with Sam pushing it into
Megatron's chest,

2238
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:45,500
just to clarify the ending.

2239
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,160
It's been a bizarre experience
travelling with this movie

2240
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:51,080
to so many different countries.

2241
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:54,380
And even Japan, where I just saw
a screening with 4,500 people.

2242
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:58,610
In Japan, it's funny, they'll tell you,
"The movie's so funny, it's so funny."

2243
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:01,230
But you watch it, and you wanna
kill yourself.

2244
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:04,020
Because you got 4,500 people
sitting there, not emoting at all

2245
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:07,669
because it's impolite to laugh in
Japan when you're watching a movie.

2246
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:10,059
But then they gave it huge
applause at the end,

2247
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,820
which is something that
they don't do as well.

2248
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:15,380
And Japanese theatre people

2249
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:18,740
that are distributors there, they were
just saying, "That's a very good sign."

2250
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:21,590
So it opens in Japan...1 guess
when you get this DVD

2251
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:26,460
it will have already opened in Japan,
but this is a week before it opens.

2252
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:33,330
In the Asian countries,
it's just been phenomenal.

2253
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:36,060
I mean, Korea, it's the number
one movie of all time,

2254
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:38,880
at $50-million something.

2255
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,650
Malaysia, it's the number
one movie of all time.

2256
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:47,240
It's the biggest opening in China
of all time. It's just crazy.

2257
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:51,660
Transformers was the most fun experience
I've had directing a movie.

2258
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:55,990
It was definitely challenging, but a lot of
my movies have been challenging.

2259
02:11:56,600 --> 02:12:00,430
It was a new experience for me
in that working almost like

2260
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:04,660
on an animation movie
with live action.

2261
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:11,320
I can't wait to get started on 2.
The experience of it coming out

2262
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:16,080
and the way it's been accepted around
the world has been staggering to me.

2263
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:18,580
The fans have...

2264
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:22,710
The death threats stopped.
I'm very glad, you know?

2265
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:25,670
I think I've made a lot of
the fans very happy.

2266
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:29,840
I mean, I know I have.
They've told me.

2267
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:35,210
So many have said, "Thanks for making
my childhood dreams come true.”

2268
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:37,970
It's like they've all dreamed
of this movie.

2269
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:44,620
So that's a really nice feeling. But it's an even
nicer feeling to see older people

2270
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:48,950
that knew nothing of Transformers to actually
really enjoy this movie.

2271
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:52,260
And I'm just proud to have worked
with the people I've worked with.

2272
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,820
And I can't wait to do it again.

2273
02:12:56,280 --> 02:12:59,230
It was a delight to work
with the writers.

2274
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,470
Kurtzman and Orci, I don't know
if they're going to write 2,

2275
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:06,520
because they don't know
if there's any magic left.

2276
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:09,130
They've gotta be wrong
with that, you know?

2277
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:14,290
So I'm about to hear many,
many pitches.

2278
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,210
But I know that Transformers 2,
if I do it,

2279
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:20,650
I definitely want to take it to
a whole other visual level.

2280
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:26,480
I think this movie has definitely raised
the bar of visual effects.

2281
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:31,060
In terms of realistic visual effects
and what can be done.

2282
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:34,760
It's almost anything what a director thinks
can be done, nowadays.

2283
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:39,030
It's amazing how effects jump
every single year.

2284
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:44,870
I'll look forward to doing it again.
So thanks for listening to me.

2285
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:50,980
Some of it, hope I'm not blabbing.
It's hard to sit in a dark room, right here,

2286
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:54,870
with a microphone in front of you
and talk for three hours.

2287
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:58,200
Till next time, see you.
