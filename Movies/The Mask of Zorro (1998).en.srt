1
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:39,527
Come on, Alejandro, it is my turn.
Let's me see.

2
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,056
Montero!

3
00:01:45,405 --> 00:02:04,725
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

4
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,570
What are you doing
cutting holes in my wagon?

5
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,471
lam sorry, Senor Lopez.

6
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,639
We were just waiting for Zorro.

7
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,118
Go home, muchachos.

8
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,739
Do you think he's really going to come,
Senor Lopez?

9
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,339
Someone thinks he will.

10
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,930
Joaquin, Alejandro...

11
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,912
once I carved coffins
for your mother and father.

12
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,436
[ would hate to carve ones for you.

13
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:35,868
Now go!

14
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,713
Alejandro, Joaquin...

15
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,268
this is no place for you.

16
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,173
Now, get back to the mission.

17
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,266
Don Montero, for the love of God,
why are you still here?

18
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,600
Now, now, Don Luiz. Calm, calm.

19
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,586
Santa Anna's men are three miles
from the town.

20
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,782
You have to go sir. Now!

21
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,428
The, government of Spain

22
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,076
would like to thank you
for your devoted service.

23
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,873
This land is the property
of the Spanish government.

24
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,396
And, in two hours' time,

25
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,351
it will be the property
of the Mexican government,

26
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,469
unless I hand them over to you.

27
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,195
I'm well acquainted with Santa Anna.

28
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,714
He will realize that the dons
will be dutiful taxpayers,

29
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,940
and he will respect your claims.

30
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,235
The, rest of Alta California

31
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,174
I have divided up equally among
the other dons.

32
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,899
trust that you will make sure
that all of them receive their grants.

33
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,650
Get the children out...
of the plaza immediately!

34
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,164
The children should never
have to see the things we do.

35
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,492
I want to see!

36
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,325
Put me down!

37
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,134
Zorro?

38
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,660
I saw him.

39
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,834
I saw Zorro.

40
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,125
Come here!

41
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,423
Attencion!

42
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:27,777
Who are these men

43
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,741
that you would risk your life
to have them killed?

44
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,876
Who are they? I have no idea.

45
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,702
Three peasants pulled
at random from the crowd.

46
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,406
Where is he?

47
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:11,924
Go.

48
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,331
Come on.

49
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,701
My thanks to you gentlemen.

50
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,570
Now if you will excuse me...

51
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,632
I'm missing my own party.

52
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,041
Kill him!

53
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,293
Zorro!

54
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,368
You would murder three innocent men
just to capture me?

55
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,241
I would murder
a hundred innocent men

56
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,805
if it meant killing you.

57
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,035
Three men, three cuts.

58
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,024
Asmall memento of Mexico,

59
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,346
Rafael...to remind you not to return.

60
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,233
Zorro! Zorro! Zo...

61
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,194
Tornado, my old friend...

62
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,983
you're getting too old for this.

63
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,449
Yes, me too.

64
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,091
But the good prince
was not afraid of the evil king.

65
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,121
He raced across the drawbridge,
fighting off a hundred guards.

66
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,097
And then, looking very handsome

67
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,752
and dashing in the late afternoon sun,

68
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,921
he leapt...onto the balcony
and thrus this enchanted sword...

69
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,012
under the king's chin.

70
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,914
"You would kill three innocent men,"

71
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,649
he...demanded, "just to capture me?"

72
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,612
"Yes. "

73
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,525
Then suddenly, lightning flashed

74
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,165
and a mighty thunder shocked
the wasted land.

75
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,006
And the evil king glared
at the good prince...

76
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,060
and said...

77
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,567
something very forgettable.

78
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,973
And the good prince...
what did he do?

79
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,063
Well, he leapt from the balcony
onto his faithful old steed, Tornado,

80
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:37,314
and...raced home
to his beautiful wife...

81
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,660
Esperanza...
and to his little child, Elena...

82
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,632
never to do anything so foolish...

83
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,401
or dangerous again.

84
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,248
She loves to hear your stories.

85
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,087
Oh, it's...only the sound of my voice.

86
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,253
One day she'll have no time for them.

87
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,649
I never tire of them.
Why should she?

88
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,223
Esperanza.

89
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,319
She already has your strength.

90
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,805
Today she broke the little clay horse
you made for her...

91
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:23,992
Diego...

92
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,071
It's just a scratch. It's all right.

93
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,487
-Diego, you promised me.
-l know.

94
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,912
No more nights waiting up,
praying you'll come home alive.

95
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,903
The Spaniards are going home.

96
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,829
Today is Zorro's last ride.

97
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,681
From now on we'll...

98
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,853
grow old together
with our five children.

99
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,613
Five?

100
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,287
Yeah. Not enough?

101
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,232
I love you.

102
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,171
Dona de la Vega...

103
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,971
still as beautiful as ever.

104
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,751
Don Rafael.

105
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,269
What an honor...
the governor in my home.

106
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,526
You will stay for dinner, of course.

107
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,632
I have come to apologize,
Esperan...za.

108
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,375
I'm sorry that
I could not protect this country

109
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,897
from the peasants
who have overrun it.

110
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,233
I'm sorry that
I couldn't make you love me.

111
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,630
And I'm sorry that
[ have to leave you without a husband.

112
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,244
Arrest him.

113
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,786
Blood never lies...

114
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,130
Zorro.

115
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,802
You're a traitor to your country
and your class.

116
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,459
Take him away.

117
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,122
Wait!

118
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,351
No!

119
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,628
No!

120
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,324
[ would never have let any harm
come to her.

121
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,776
She was never yours to protect.

122
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,040
Elena.

123
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,632
] want you to live...

124
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,674
with the knowledge that you have
lost everything that you hold dear.

125
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,919
] want you to suffer,
as I have suffered,

126
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,810
knowing that your child
should have been mine.

127
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,480
Elena!

128
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,714
Elena!

129
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,857
Let me hold her.

130
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,849
Let me hold her!

131
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,168
Rafael!

132
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,689
She has her mother's eyes.

133
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,561
Rafael!

134
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,990
You'll never be rid of me!

135
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,073
Rafael!

136
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:09,926
Caught the bandits,
plain to see doo da, doo da.

137
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:17,273
big, tough and mean,
but don't...scare me.

138
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,033
Oh, doo da day.

139
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,765
Stayed on their track bringin' em back.

140
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:31,465
So pay the bounty now to me
because...

141
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,517
because...

142
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:45,469
Nobody's tough as Jack.
Nobody's tough as Jack.

143
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,649
Now you're getting’ her.

144
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:53,588
Like I done told you,
singin’ can lighten your terrible load.

145
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,505
Come one, come all!

146
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,004
For the fright of your life!

147
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,100
See the notorious Murrieta Brothers!
Robbers, horse thieves...

148
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,990
bandits...people of the worst sort!

149
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,580
Hey, gather ‘round!

150
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,754
Gracia.

151
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,251
It's the Murrieta Brothers.

152
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:48,243
Get over here, you mangy...trash.

153
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,661
Con su permiso, amigo?

154
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,568
These men are now in the custody
of Corporal Armando Garcia,

155
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,852
and we will take them
the rest of the way.

156
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,283
And you can claim your
bounty in Tlaxco.

157
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,920
Yeah, when bulls start
wearin’ bloomers.

158
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,299
-How much are we worth?
-Get out.

159
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:17,318
All figured...about two hundred pesos.

160
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,701
Two hundred pesos? That's it?

161
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,066
After all the payrolls we've robbed?

162
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,838
A lousy two hundred pesos apiece,
that's all we're worth?

163
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,903
-We're wasting time.
-That's two hundred pesos...

164
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,619
for the both of you.

165
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,901
What? Are you crazy?
Don't take it, Jack!

166
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,070
Touch my brother again...

167
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,109
and I'll kill you.

168
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,424
Yes, he will.

169
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,828
Hey...I thought you were tied up.

170
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,026
That's because you are stupid.

171
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,469
Drop it! Drop it!

172
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,716
Hey.

173
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,949
They got a strongbox on the wagon.

174
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,818
We know. That's why we came.

175
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,965
Lousy two hundred pesos.

176
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,370
That cheat. It is the fact that I,

177
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,198
the legendary Three-Fingered Jack,
ain't even mentioned.

178
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,292
l ain't even mentioned.

179
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,919
And ain't I the one

180
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,435
that figured to kidnap the mayor
from his own outhouse?

181
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,772
I tell you.
lam the holy guts of this gang.

182
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,547
Without me,
the whole dang opera falls apart.

183
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,399
Amigos...adios.

184
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,971
Joaquin, Joaquin...

185
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:25,383
Just go!

186
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,831
Come on. Get up, get up!

187
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:33,611
Go.

188
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,495
Go.

189
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,307
] want you to know...

190
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,360
I consider this an honor.

191
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,805
Bury the body. Bag the head.

192
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,688
Of course I have feelings for you.

193
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:48,632
Yes, yes, but quick...hide in the barn.

194
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,391
He's coming.

195
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:57,812
What do you want?

196
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,639
Please! Don't touch me.

197
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,182
What do you want? Who are you?

198
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,371
Don Rafael.

199
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,321
Listen to me.

200
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,600
If any one of you is,
or ever was that masked man all...

201
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,788
dressed in black, known as Zorro...

202
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,988
reveal himself now!

203
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,245
lam Zor...ro!

204
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,264
They took my mask...

205
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,306
-...my sword, my horse!
-Silence...you old fool!

206
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,186
lam Zorro! ! am the man you want!

207
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,473
-l am the original...the first!
-Liar! Liar!

208
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,436
-l am the root!
-Anyone can see you are too...tall!

209
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:40,525
lam Zorro! l am the Zorro!

210
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:53,590
lam Zorro. lam Zorro. l am Zorro.

211
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,625
Get him out of here...

212
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,990
before he starts to stink.

213
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,216
Did you find him?

214
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,812
He's dead.

215
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,355
Back to the boat.

216
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,763
I need some sleep
before landing tomorrow.

217
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,878
The governor has returned!

218
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,687
Luiz.

219
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,003
Welcome home, Rafael.
It has been too long.

220
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,263
Too long, my friend.

221
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:06,322
You said once
you favored me above all.

222
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:11,056
Consider this...a fool's apology
for ever doubting you.

223
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,472
Come.

224
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,524
A crowd has gathered to greet you.

225
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,988
-Don Pedro.
-Don Rafael, welcome.

226
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,974
-You're looking well.
-Thank you.

227
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,693
-Don Hector.
-Welcome back, sir.

228
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,984
-Don Julio.
-Bienvenido a casa.

229
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,558
Gentlemen.

230
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,180
Please, please!

231
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:51,404
I know that
you are not really happy to see me.

232
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,807
So let us all stop pretending,
shall we?

233
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,167
You think I don't know that...
you've been paid...

234
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:01,694
even threatened, to come out
in the hot sun and greet me?

235
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,568
l understand exactly how you feel.

236
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,252
Why should you care
about any of your leaders,

237
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,591
past or present?

238
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,486
What did they ever do for you?

239
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,286
The Spaniards oppressed you...
the Mexicans ignored you,

240
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,060
and the dons,
well, the dons, the dons...

241
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:26,620
The don's seem merely content
to cheat and lie to you.

242
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,561
In fact, I put it to you...

243
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,347
Who in your entire history
has ever helped you?

244
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,129
Zorro! Zorro fought for the people.

245
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,885
Yes, Zorro.

246
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,772
Where is he now, Padre...

247
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,044
your masked friend?

248
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:52,543
Unless I'm mistaken,

249
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,858
he hasn't shown himself
in twenty years.

250
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,591
Twenty years!

251
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,990
People of California,

252
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,423
the time has come to take our
destiny into our own hands.

253
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:09,555
Not as Spaniards, not as Mexicans,
but as Californians!

254
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,895
I stand here before you today...
with no mask.

255
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,731
Only a pledge.

256
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,029
Asolemn pledge
that I will never abandon you!

257
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,926
And you have my word,

258
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,024
the word of Rafael Montero,

259
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,554
that I will do everything
within my power to help you fight

260
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,793
for a free and independent California!

261
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,028
Father!

262
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,478
Gentlemen,

263
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,302
allow me to introduce my daughter,
Elena.

264
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,703
Thank you.

265
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,997
Can anyone tell me
what this flower is?

266
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,282
I know this scent.

267
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,927
Si senorita. It's called Romneya.

268
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,139
But it only grows in California.

269
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,079
And I believe
this is your first visit to our shores.

270
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,732
Yes.

271
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,316
More whiskey.

272
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,703
Or whatever you call this.

273
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,905
I don't want to see the bottom
of this glass, eh?

274
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:03,353
Money first.

275
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,035
Money first.

276
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,002
Wait, wait, wait.

277
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,523
What about this?

278
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,241
Silver.

279
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,348
Of course, silver. The finest.

280
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:27,366
Where did you get that?

281
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,569
It's none of your business.

282
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,125
Where did you get it?

283
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,863
It was my brother's.

284
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,754
He's dead.

285
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:44,937
I'm sorry.

286
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,326
You're sorry?

287
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,792
Why should you be sorry?

288
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,815
You should not trade something
like that for a mere glass of whiskey.

289
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,522
Why not?

290
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,490
You think I could get two?

291
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,707
Who's that?

292
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,046
That's the man who killed my brother.

293
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,194
You're drunk and you're angry,

294
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,721
in no condition to fight
a professional soldier.

295
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,999
Get out of my way, old man.

296
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,165
Would you care to try again?

297
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,515
You're welcome.

298
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,553
For what?

299
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,008
For saving your life.

300
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:06,964
I would have killed him.

301
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,808
No, not today. He is trained to kill.

302
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,158
You seem trained to drink.

303
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:13,167
Yes, my friend,

304
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,558
you would have fought very bravely
and died very quickly.

305
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,704
Who, then,
would avenge your brother?

306
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,810
[ would have found a way.

307
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,231
I've never lost a fight.

308
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,536
Except to a crippled old man,
just now.

309
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,716
What is your name?

310
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,067
-Alejandro.
-Alejandro.

311
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,974
You know there is a saying,
a very old saying...

312
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,446
"When the pupil is ready,
the master will appear."

313
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,759
Now, if you want to kill this man,

314
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,520
I can help you
and I can teach you how.

315
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:44,532
How to move, how to think,

316
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,753
how to take your revenge
with honor and...

317
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,335
live to celebrate it.

318
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:49,803
But it will take dedication.

319
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,531
It will take time.

320
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,786
Why are you so eager to help me?

321
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,792
Because once, a long time ago...

322
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,341
you did the same for me.

323
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,474
I can't believe it.

324
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,061
I never thought that one day...

325
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:21,223
] would be standing
in the lair of the fox.

326
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,103
In the lair of Zorro.

327
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:28,843
Yeah...this place was devoted
to the training of Zorro.

328
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,125
Where were you all these years?

329
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,125
I thought you were dead.

330
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,665
I was dead...

331
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,537
and we will leave it at that.

332
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,156
l remember last time I saw you,
in the square.

333
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,623
Fighting a hundred men.

334
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,605
-A hundred men?
-l cannot forget.

335
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,127
You were the greatest swordsman
who zer lived.

336
00:37:58,543 --> 00:37:59,943
Yes.

337
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,875
Rafael Montero was the governor
of California then.

338
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,718
Do you remember him?

339
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,912
What?

340
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,237
Rafael Montero,
do you remember him?

341
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,342
Yes...his soldiers killed many...

342
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,882
and, he was the sworn enemy
of Zorro.

343
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,397
You.

344
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,167
Montero's come back.

345
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,332
Good.

346
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:27,621
Then you can kill him.

347
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,449
No, there are...complications,

348
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,111
too many complications
for me to ignore.

349
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,814
What complications?

350
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:44,557
I can see we're not gonna spend
much time talking.

351
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,765
Montero has some plan, some...

352
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,237
design for California.

353
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,660
Otherwise,
he would not have retained

354
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,766
the services of your Captain Love.

355
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,365
We must find out what that design is.

356
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,964
And then what?

357
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,477
If you are ready...

358
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,209
we will both tempt our fates.

359
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,298
Let's go then!

360
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,885
Do you know how to use that thing?

361
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,221
Yes.

362
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,292
The pointy end goes
into the other man.

363
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,310
Yeah.

364
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,781
This is going to take a lot of work.

365
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:28,136
This is called a training circle,
a master's wheel.

366
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,020
This circle will be your world,
your whole life.

367
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,794
Until I tell you otherwise,
there is nothing outside of it.

368
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,207
-Capitan Love is out...
-There is nothing...outside of it.

369
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,944
Captain Love does not exist
until l say he exists.

370
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,314
As your skill
with the sword improves...

371
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,334
you will progress to a...smaller circle.

372
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,724
With each new circle,
your world contracts,

373
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,759
bringing you that much closer
to your adversary,

374
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,087
that much closer to retribution.

375
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,198
I like that part.

376
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,364
Shall we?

377
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,960
Slow!

378
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,002
Attack slow.

379
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:33,467
Attack!

380
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,368
Slow. Again!

381
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:36,747
Slow!

382
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:40,308
Let's try and...slow, like...Good.

383
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,969
Good...that is good.

384
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,105
Thank you.

385
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,145
Attack.

386
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,118
Good.

387
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:54,855
Time for a drink.

388
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,015
Perfect. Do it again.

389
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:29,055
One, five, three!

390
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,491
Six, four, two!

391
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,275
And lunge!

392
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,701
Over-lunged!

393
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,128
Lesson number one...

394
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,246
never attack in anger.

395
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,587
Lesson number two...

396
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,543
Come with me.

397
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,035
What?

398
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,313
So what is lesson number three?

399
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,694
To get to lesson number four.

400
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:45,909
Again?

401
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,569
Montero!

402
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,126
A black Andalusian.

403
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,790
Magnificent.

404
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:14,437
Looks like your old horse, Tornado.

405
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,266
Who's that?

406
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:55,081
Quiet, quiet.

407
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:07,910
Damn horse!

408
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,316
What are you doing, huh?

409
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:11,277
What are you doing?

410
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:15,585
I'll see you tonight.

411
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,185
Zorro, you look better than ever.

412
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:09,715
Be careful, senorita.

413
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,358
There are dangerous men about.

414
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:17,050
Well, if you see any,
be sure to point them out.

415
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,016
Okay, everybody's in.

416
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:11,561
Don Burrite...

417
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,509
Listen.

418
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:38,842
I'm going to give you the great honor
of being my horse.

419
00:46:57,415 --> 00:47:00,345
We are...like one spirit.

420
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,020
Damn it! Stop!

421
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,113
Go, go...go, go!

422
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,582
Get him!

423
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:41,457
Kill him.

424
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,241
Zorro!

425
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,140
The legend has returned!

426
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,308
Don't yell.

427
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:08,334
I need sanctuary, Father.

428
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,286
-You don't know me, so...
-Zorro? Of course I know you.

429
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:13,632
Zorro, is it really you?

430
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:14,788
I must say the years

431
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,365
have been far kinder to you
than they have been to me.

432
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,717
I'm sorry,
I have no time for talk now.

433
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,999
Father, please...hide me.

434
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,176
Come.

435
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,552
Just like the old days.

436
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:40,959
Padre, is that you?

437
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:43,613
Padre, is everything all right?

438
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,051
It sounds like there is a battle
going on out there.

439
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,148
Don't worry, my dear.

440
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,060
You are safe in the house of the Lord.

441
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,433
Of course, Padre.

442
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,979
Forgive me, Father,
for have sinned.

443
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,384
It has been three days
since my last confession.

444
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:00,473
Three days.

445
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,314
How many sins could you have
committed in three days?

446
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:04,692
Come back
when you've had more time, please.

447
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:06,716
Excuse me?

448
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:09,788
Listen, senorita...

449
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,100
please...go on.

450
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:20,404
I have broken
the Fourth Commandment, Padre.

451
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:22,515
You killed somebody?

452
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,633
No, that is not
the Fourth Commandment.

453
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,179
Of course not.

454
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:32,451
You...in what way did you break
the most sacred...

455
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,640
..of commandments?

456
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,675
I dishonored my father.

457
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,052
That is not so bad.

458
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,839
Maybe your father deserved it.

459
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,322
What did you say?

460
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:48,394
I said, tell me more...my child.

461
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,969
Well, I try to behave properly,
the way my father would like me to.

462
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:56,264
But I'm afraid my heart is too wild.

463
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,270
Too wild?

464
00:53:58,569 --> 00:53:59,469
Yes.

465
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,743
Could you be a little more specific
about that?

466
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:05,553
I had impure thoughts about a man.

467
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,736
I did.
I think he was a bandit or something.

468
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:11,463
He wore a black mask.

469
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,316
He had a...a deep voice?

470
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,878
Yes.

471
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,216
Ruggedly handsome?

472
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,022
I do not know.
His face was half covered.

473
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,622
But something
in his eyes captured me.

474
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,389
Captured you?

475
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:34,237
l felt warm and feverish.

476
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,302
Lustful?

477
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,107
Yes, lustful.

478
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,491
Forgive me.

479
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,435
l forgive you.

480
00:54:57,995 --> 00:54:59,725
Look over there, by the altar!

481
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,890
Search everything!

482
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,914
The chapel, the loft,
the rectory...all of it!

483
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,645
This is a house of God.

484
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:12,438
Don't worry, Padre.

485
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,779
We'll be gone by the time
He gets back.

486
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,647
Senorita...

487
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,079
..you have done nothing wrong.

488
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:25,668
The only sin would be to deny
what your heart truly feels.

489
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,486
Now go!

490
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,575
Elena!

491
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,206
What are you doing here?

492
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,727
I was confessing.

493
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:44,036
-Confessing?
-Yes.

494
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,178
To whom? The priest is here.

495
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,214
Stand back, Elena.

496
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,647
Please.

497
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:15,677
Out of respect for Miss Montero...

498
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,562
I'll deal with you later.

499
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,194
Horse!

500
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,312
Come here.

501
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,165
Blackie!

502
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,703
Thunder!

503
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:39,762
Storm!

504
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:42,777
Stupido, get over here now!

505
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:48,435
I warn you...I'll get another horse.

506
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:01,288
So...what do you think?

507
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,899
Sir, sir!

508
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,561
I got the black stallion.

509
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:11,583
I carved a "2" in the...

510
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:14,841
Don...Diego,

511
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:17,368
the people will be speaking
the name of Zorro again.

512
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:18,614
You think stealing a horse

513
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:19,965
and scratching marks
in a wall makes you

514
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:23,127
worthy enough to wear that mask?

515
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:27,198
Be careful.

516
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,777
You're a thief, Alejandro.

517
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,893
A pitiful clown.

518
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,179
Zorro was a servant of the people.

519
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:39,531
He was not a seeker of fame,
like you.

520
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:42,818
A buffoon.

521
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,778
Zorro did what was needed.

522
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,730
And now he's needed again.

523
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:53,598
I didn't ask for your help
in the cantina.

524
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:57,716
But I came here to learn
how to fight like you.

525
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,321
To have your strength, your courage.

526
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,528
Now when I try to use them,
you slap me down?

527
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,636
Let me tell you something...

528
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:11,278
1 am tired of all your training,
your lecturing.

529
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:15,475
lam tired of waiting for you
to tell me I am ready.

530
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,350
I have my own scores to settle.

531
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:22,006
A new life to find.

532
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,130
I thought I could do it here...

533
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,053
but I was wrong.

534
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:30,756
Alejandro!

535
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,902
En garde!

536
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,075
Choose your weapon.

537
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,546
Montero has invited
every don in California

538
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,118
to a banquet at his hacienda.

539
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:08,335
If you want to be of service
you can join them as a spy.

540
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:13,204
[ think I do not understand, sir.

541
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:17,397
You have passion, Alejandro,
and your skill is growing.

542
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:19,958
But to enter Montero's world,
I must give you something...

543
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,307
which is completely
beyond your reach.

544
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,932
Oh, yes? And what is that?

545
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:26,979
Charm.

546
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,796
And what is that?

547
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:37,384
Convince Montero
that you're a gentleman of stature,

548
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,008
and he will let you into his circle.

549
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,467
Me?

550
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,807
Agentleman?

551
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,250
This is going to take a lot of work.

552
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:56,612
Yes.

553
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:16,802
Look at me.

554
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,500
look like a butterfly.

555
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,828
This is the most stupid thing
I've ever done.

556
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:22,228
1 doubt that.

557
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:25,198
-We'll never get away with this.
-Yes, we will.

558
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,745
Anobleman is nothing but a man

559
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,638
who says one thing
and thinks another.

560
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,074
What if Montero realizes
who you are?

561
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:36,033
Montero thinks of himself
as a true nobleman.

562
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,948
He will never look
a servant in the eye.

563
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:40,892
Listen to me.

564
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,994
Listen to me!

565
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,682
The most important thing of all...

566
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,668
Do not let the dons leave
the table without you.

567
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:52,071
Yes.

568
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,649
Good.

569
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,920
And good luck tonight.

570
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,053
Thank you.

571
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,317
Stand up straight.

572
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,160
Charm.

573
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,589
Charm.

574
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,115
Don Rafael Montero?

575
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,131
Good evening.

576
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:29,300
lam Don Alejandro
del Castillo y Garcia.

577
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,640
The formal greeting
of the Spanish court.

578
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,758
I have not seen that in years.

579
01:02:34,818 --> 01:02:37,448
My father was very strict
in matters of etiquette.

580
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,211
And who is your father?

581
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,299
Don Bartolo del Castillo.

582
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,485
I have heard of Don Bartolo,

583
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:45,866
but I've never had the pleasure
of meeting him.

584
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,556
l arrived last week from Spain,
by way of Paris,

585
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:51,462
Lisbon and San Francisco.

586
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,138
lam inspecting my family's holdings.

587
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,886
Queen Isabella of Spain has been...

588
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,234
very generous to us.

589
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,655
Very impressive.

590
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:09,628
What brings you to my door?

591
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,446
When I heard you were back
in California,

592
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:13,925
I knew I...must introduce myself.

593
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:16,814
Her Royal Highness speaks
very highly of you.

594
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,392
Really?

595
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:22,281
I was under the impression

596
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:23,992
I was out of favor
with the Spanish court

597
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,761
since alifornia was lost to Mexico.

598
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:35,099
Only in certain circles.

599
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:36,338
Her Majesty knows

600
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:39,883
those unfortunate events were clearly
no fault of yours.

601
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,683
She also told me this province

602
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,669
is still a land of opportunity
for a man of vision.

603
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:48,403
And you are a man of vision?

604
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:52,962
lam a man...in search of a vision.

605
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,608
But my timing is unfortunate.

606
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,697
[ have interrupted a party.

607
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,113
Perhaps I could call again.

608
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,982
No, no, it would,
honor me for you to join us.

609
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,970
It would honor me to do so, sir.

610
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,190
Please, allow me tointroduce
my daughter...Elena.

611
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:14,926
Of course.

612
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:19,958
Charmed.

613
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,983
I'm afraid I have brought no gift
for the hostess.

614
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:30,697
But...wait a moment.

615
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:43,295
Thank you.

616
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:45,123
My pleasure.

617
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:51,836
Bernardo...pick up your feet.

618
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,565
Senorita.

619
01:04:53,857 --> 01:04:55,087
Caballero.

620
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:21,915
Don Alejandro.

621
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,549
My father and I would like you
to join us at our table.

622
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,683
I would be delighted, senorita.

623
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:45,616
Don Alejandro,
I'm so pleased you could join us.

624
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:46,869
Gentlemen, allow me

625
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:49,503
to introduce Don Alejandro
del Castillo y Garcia,

626
01:05:49,913 --> 01:05:51,843
recently returned from Spain.

627
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:55,115
This is, Captain Harrison Love.

628
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:58,215
Not a don, but...
certainly a kindred spirit.

629
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:01,223
Are you not the man

630
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:04,178
who was chasing
a legendary bandit recently?

631
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:06,568
He was hardly legendary.

632
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:07,763
So you caught him?

633
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,017
It's only a matter of time.

634
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,788
Well, the bandit may have escaped,

635
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:17,455
but the rest of us
will certainly think twice

636
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:19,604
before going to confession.

637
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:45,257
Thank you.

638
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:51,285
With all due respect, Don Hector,
I disagree.

639
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:54,245
Until these people are free to...
govern themselves,

640
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:57,953
I think we will see many more "Z's
carved into walls.

641
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:02,026
Don Alejandro, what do you think?

642
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:08,727
I think...the sheep
will always need a shepherd.

643
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:13,848
But, certainly not this...
Zorro creature.

644
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,053
He probably wears the mask

645
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,266
to hide his bald head
and unsightly features.

646
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,396
There are some
who would call him heroic.

647
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,028
Heroism. A romantic illusion.

648
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,634
-Much like nobility?
-Elena, that is enough.

649
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:33,074
Myself, I would think heroism is...

650
01:07:33,316 --> 01:07:35,566
something to aspire to, not sneer at.

651
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,275
All that playing with swords...

652
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,130
shooting guns,
racing around with horses.

653
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,580
Gives me a frightful headache.

654
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,156
Such sweaty pursuits are...
hardly the work of a gentleman.

655
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:47,558
And what is?

656
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,497
Climbing in and out of carriages?

657
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,199
No, my dear.

658
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,024
But increasing one's holdings

659
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:56,373
so as to provide lavish
comfort for ladies...

660
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,390
such as yourself.

661
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:08,659
A woman's grasp of politics.
What can I say?

662
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:14,432
Well, we're at a party, aren't we?

663
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:18,041
Elena...may I have the honor
of this dance?

664
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,218
[ would be glad to.

665
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:12,703
Yes?

666
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,656
Were you looking for something?

667
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:18,081
Asense of the miraculous
in everyday life.

668
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:19,957
Oh, really?

669
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,119
Well, why don't you try
looking someplace else?

670
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,221
The lady and ! were trying to dance.

671
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,230
You were trying.

672
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:28,403
She was succeeding.

673
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:33,843
Forgive me, Capitan,
a shameless joke at your expense.

674
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:36,216
And I hope it will not be the last.

675
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:38,502
Don Rafael wants you back
at his table...

676
01:09:39,809 --> 01:09:41,038
Pino.

677
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:29,532
Would you care to try
something more, robust?

678
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,452
Or do you feel unequal to the task?

679
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:33,871
No, on the contrary, Don Alejandro.

680
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,629
I think only of your distaste
for perspiration.

681
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,105
-Maestro...
-Si.

682
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:10,723
Well, If that's the way they are
dancing in Madrid these days...

683
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,877
Excuse me, Don Rafael.
I need to catch my breath.

684
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:16,666
Your daughter
is a very spirited dancer.

685
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:18,877
"Spirited."

686
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,628
Thank you for putting it so delicately.

687
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,472
l apologize if you were offended.

688
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:32,178
Oh, no. Completely unnecessary,
l assure you.

689
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,355
She's and impulsive...

690
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,610
but her beauty is beyond compare.

691
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:40,296
And she has her father's
commanding presence.

692
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:44,112
Don Rafael?

693
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:50,114
As...an advisor
to Her Royal Highness

694
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:51,956
in matters of finance...

695
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:56,512
it would be my pleasure
to introduce you both at court.

696
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,029
Join us in the courtyard.

697
01:13:08,284 --> 01:13:10,454
There's something
I would like to share with you.

698
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,550
What is that?

699
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,529
Avision.

700
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:26,914
Fellow dons of California...

701
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,843
all of us here can recall
the golden years

702
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,816
when we ruled this country.

703
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:34,251
We commanded respect
as noblemen

704
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,920
and we amassed
a great deal of wealth.

705
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:39,486
There was something that
we never achieved.

706
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:43,869
We never determined our own...
destiny.

707
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,140
Well...the time has come.

708
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:50,545
Time to claim what always
should have been ours.

709
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,826
My friends...

710
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,356
I give...you...

711
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:59,577
the independent Republic
of California.

712
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,824
Don Rafael...

713
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,049
every man here owes
you something.

714
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:21,911
The land you gave us
made us all wealthy men.

715
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:25,894
However,
we must question your motives.

716
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:29,996
The day you arrived on the beach
you made us all look like fools.

717
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:31,873
That is absurd, Don Pedro.

718
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:33,478
I was merely playing to the crowd.

719
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,729
And what are you doing now,
if not playing to the crowd?

720
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,980
Now you're inciting us
to raise arms against Santa Anna,

721
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:44,477
when you know perfectly well
we could never defeat his army.

722
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:47,987
I was not suggesting that
we fight him for California.

723
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:51,514
I was suggesting that we buy it...
from him.

724
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,218
Santa Anna is waging
.
a very ex...pensive war

725
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,513
with the United States
increasingly short of money.

726
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:00,544
Even if we all...
and is combined our fortunes,

727
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,223
we could not come up
with enough money

728
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,715
to buy this country from Santa Anna.

729
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:07,444
I have already
brokered a deal with him.

730
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,888
You're living in a dream, Montero.

731
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,831
Then why don't we all live
in the same dream together?

732
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,607
Meet me here tomorrow morning,
gentlemen,

733
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:35,333
for a journey that will open your eyes

734
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,031
and lay all your doubts to rest.

735
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,463
My friends, I give you...

736
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:36,357
El Dorado.

737
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:49,679
Technically, of course,
all this gold be...longs to Santa Anna.

738
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,102
But fortunately for us,

739
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,950
he's completely
unaware of its existence.

740
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,630
Now, for the deception to work,

741
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:58,428
all these bars have been marked
with the Spanish seal,

742
01:16:58,848 --> 01:17:01,038
so that he will think
they have come from Spain.

743
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,638
You see now, gentlemen?
Is it becoming clearer to you?

744
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:06,438
Two days from now,

745
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:09,315
we will buy this country
from Santa Anna.

746
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:12,989
And we...will buy it with gold dug
from his own land.

747
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,846
Where did you find these people?

748
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:28,786
Anywhere we wanted.

749
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:31,552
Brilliant.

750
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:34,856
Brilliant.

751
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,204
It's only part of the mining process.

752
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,465
First, we were just picking it up
off the ground,

753
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:44,428
but now we're down to blasting.

754
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:02,604
So...is this the future of California?

755
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,570
This is my vision, yes.

756
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:11,928
Basura, up here!

757
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:16,044
Well, now ain't you a sight
for sore eyes!

758
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:21,135
Full-growed vultures walkin’ around
like real folk.

759
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:22,817
Welcome!

760
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,554
Welcome to hell's outhouse.

761
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,622
Now, they call us
the disappeared ones.

762
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:32,027
But as you can...see,
we ain't exactly disappeared.

763
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:34,237
We just been a little hard to find.

764
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,272
Wait!

765
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,664
You! I know you.

766
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,750
You bet you do, peckerwood!

767
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:42,329
I'm the legendary
Three-Fingered Jack!

768
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:45,941
And you...
are a bunch of murderin' trash...

769
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:50,408
dressed up in fancy,
sweet-smellin' doodads.

770
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,810
Ignore him, gentlemen.
He's a common thief.

771
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,500
As common as they come.

772
01:18:56,799 --> 01:19:00,369
But I ain't nothin’
compared to you gentlemen.

773
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:03,520
I steal gold. ! steal...money.

774
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:07,949
But you...you steal people's lives.

775
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:09,601
So damn you...

776
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:12,095
and damn the horse that brung you!

777
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:33,433
Peckerwood?

778
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:19,201
Is there something...
amusing, Captain?

779
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:21,966
Strange, I'd say.

780
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,579
It's the second time
l've shot this man

781
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,780
while he was flying through the air.

782
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:36,906
Don Alejandro!

783
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,303
I need to speak with you
at the hacienda. Alone.

784
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,650
Some other time. Perhaps.

785
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,616
Today. Alone.

786
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:11,922
Good afternoon, Bernardo.

787
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,779
Good afternoon, senorita.

788
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:18,508
Your voice is so calming.

789
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,376
He's high-spirited.
He needs to hear something soothing.

790
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,510
Yes, l understand.

791
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:29,008
How long have you served
Don Alejandro?

792
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,674
Sometimes it seems interminable.

793
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,457
I'm sorry, l speak out of place.

794
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:34,806
Do not worry, Bernardo.

795
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,867
He will not hear it from me.

796
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,901
Don Alejandro confuses me.

797
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:47,458
Sometimes he seems
so arrogant, so superior.

798
01:21:48,871 --> 01:21:50,861
And yet, the way
that he looks at me and...

799
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,960
the way that he dances with me...

800
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:57,173
as if he were two completely
different men.

801
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,309
You look so much like your mother.

802
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:13,724
How would you know that?

803
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:19,709
Well...l don't see much
of Don Rafael in you.

804
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:24,887
I know my father wishes
l acted more like her.

805
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:28,834
She was very proper...
my mother, always appropriate.

806
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:30,961
Is that how he describes her?

807
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,269
Yes, but sometimes
I do not believe him.

808
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,153
She was more like you.

809
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,943
Perhaps.

810
01:22:40,823 --> 01:22:42,693
It would be a way of knowing her.

811
01:22:46,762 --> 01:22:48,602
My ninera once told me

812
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,484
that the departed can see you
in the moonlight.

813
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:53,117
So when I was young,

814
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,005
l used to sneak
out of my window at night

815
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:58,084
and ride my horse across Andalusia.

816
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:02,044
And would wave at the sky,
so she would know it was me.

817
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,523
How did she die?

818
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,218
Giving birth to me.

819
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:17,189
My father rarely speaks of her.
I think he finds it too painful.

820
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,998
Yes.

821
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:29,369
I know what it is like to lose a...

822
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:30,968
a loved one.

823
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,469
You?

824
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,789
Yeah, a daughter...long ago.

825
01:23:40,282 --> 01:23:42,302
When I see you, I remember what it...

826
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:44,760
felt like to be a father.

827
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,987
I'm sure your mother would be
very proud of you, senorita.

828
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,464
Thank you,

829
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:01,343
Bernardo. I have to ask you...
have we ever met before?

830
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:04,931
No. Why would you think that?

831
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,972
I do not know. It's strange.

832
01:24:09,478 --> 01:24:12,088
Your voice seems so familiar,
somehow.

833
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:15,821
But haven't been to Spain
since before you were born.

834
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:18,726
Of course.

835
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,396
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.

836
01:24:25,327 --> 01:24:26,757
Thank you.

837
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,228
Good day, Bernardo.

838
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,961
Good day...

839
01:24:36,939 --> 01:24:38,749
Elena.

840
01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:57,188
Did you know that the Compa Indians
of central Peru used to...

841
01:24:57,726 --> 01:25:01,186
cannibalize their slain enemies
in order to absorb their power?

842
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:05,484
The eyes, in particular,
were most sought after.

843
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:11,244
To be able to see
through the eyes of an enemy...

844
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,411
is a valuable thing.

845
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:20,578
Where are my manners?

846
01:25:20,816 --> 01:25:24,356
Would you...Would you care
for something to drink?

847
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:31,929
No?

848
01:25:32,928 --> 01:25:35,508
A different vintage, perhaps?

849
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,183
You're a very sick person,
Capitan Love.

850
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,394
Heads in water jars,
hands in wine pitchers must,

851
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:55,138
... Strike you as odd. ] suppose.

852
01:25:57,052 --> 01:25:58,661
Well, for one thing...

853
01:25:58,954 --> 01:26:01,174
I think you ought
to fire your housekeeper.

854
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:08,585
Who is he?

855
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:10,904
An enemy.

856
01:26:13,068 --> 01:26:15,998
He has a brother out there
who will share the same fate.

857
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:20,961
I wish you luck.

858
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:26,731
To your health.

859
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:28,995
Murrieta's brother or not...

860
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:32,235
you are more than
you pretend to be.

861
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:35,225
Maybe someday...

862
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,954
! will see what ! look like
through your eyes...

863
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,263
Capitan Love.

864
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:28,508
Oh, it is beautiful.

865
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:47,016
Excuse me...how much does it cost?

866
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:57,449
It is a gift, she says...
in honor of your mother.

867
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:00,397
My mother?

868
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,923
She loved your mother.

869
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:06,313
No, tell her she must be mistaken.

870
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,835
My mother died long ago in Spain.

871
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:22,546
She says there's no mistaking

872
01:28:22,831 --> 01:28:25,701
the daughter of Esperanza
and Diego de la Vega.

873
01:28:26,268 --> 01:28:28,408
She says she was your nanny.

874
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:31,614
She hung flowers on your crib
when you were little.

875
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,540
I'm sorry, l cannot accept it.

876
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,548
Alejandro?

877
01:29:00,135 --> 01:29:01,945
Alejandro, listen to me.

878
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:04,877
Can you find your way back
to the mine?

879
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,248
No.

880
01:29:09,744 --> 01:29:12,464
The carriage windows
were all covered.

881
01:29:14,049 --> 01:29:15,749
He didn't even trust his own dons.

882
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:17,801
Nor would I.

883
01:29:18,153 --> 01:29:20,023
You must go to Montero's house
tonight.

884
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:22,332
Break into the chest in his study.

885
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:24,357
Find anything that will tell us
what his plans are...

886
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,799
People in the mine are dying...

887
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:30,936
and...all 1 can think of is...

888
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:33,263
Capitan Love.

889
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:34,764
He will come into your circle
soon enough.

890
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:36,702
You need not chase him.

891
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:42,468
-[ miss my brother, sir.
-Your brother is dead!

892
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:44,331
We lose the ones we love.

893
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,506
We cannot change it. Put it aside.

894
01:29:47,349 --> 01:29:48,659
How?

895
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:56,869
How can I do what is needed,
when all I feel is...hate?

896
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:00,957
You hide it...

897
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:04,651
with this.

898
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,114
Santa Anna has agreed
to the transfer at noon,

899
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:19,526
the day after tomorrow.

900
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:22,678
But he insists we deliver the gold
five miles north of town.

901
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:24,291
Captain Love?

902
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:29,465
I's a safe distance from the mine.

903
01:30:29,691 --> 01:30:31,391
The bars are stamped and ready.

904
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:33,533
I don't foresee a problem.

905
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:35,659
Tell him we agree.

906
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:38,437
You've done well, Luiz, very well.

907
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:45,507
To the independent
Republic of California.

908
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,768
Don Rafael!

909
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:19,241
Did you send men to the hills?
Double the guard at the wall?

910
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:21,130
Yes, yes, of course.

911
01:31:27,749 --> 01:31:29,329
After all, it's only one man.

912
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:32,077
It isn't just one man, damn it!
It's Zorro.

913
01:31:34,122 --> 01:31:35,642
And he knows about the mine.

914
01:31:35,924 --> 01:31:38,114
Otherwise he wouldn't be here tonight.

915
01:31:39,294 --> 01:31:41,544
-How could he possibly...
-It doesn't matter how.

916
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,534
You don't seem to grasp the...
situation, Captain.

917
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:45,856
lf Santa Anna...finds out

918
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:47,767
that we have paid him in gold stolen
from his own land,

919
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:50,059
he will have us butchered like cattle.

920
01:31:50,405 --> 01:31:52,014
Do you understand?

921
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:56,923
Then we should destroy the evidence.

922
01:31:57,379 --> 01:31:59,779
Set explosives, bury the mine.

923
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,620
And the workers?

924
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:05,157
We destroy all the evidence,
Don Rafael.

925
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,043
No witnesses.

926
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:16,192
Make sure those papers
are locked up.

927
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:35,856
Guards!

928
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:47,043
The much-debated Zorro.

929
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:48,562
No.

930
01:32:49,264 --> 01:32:51,104
The legendary Zorro.

931
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:54,982
Put down your weapons!

932
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,467
Tell them.

933
01:32:57,906 --> 01:32:59,426
Do as he says!

934
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:07,457
Allow me.

935
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:15,554
Come.

936
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:17,584
Stop.

937
01:33:18,493 --> 01:33:20,163
Face the window.

938
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:25,056
Now...bend down
and touch your toes.

939
01:33:27,502 --> 01:33:29,402
Bend over.

940
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:33,539
Would you excuse me, Capitan Love?

941
01:33:35,143 --> 01:33:36,453
Thank you.

942
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:54,197
Alto!

943
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:00,974
Kill him.

944
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:31,748
Good morning, senor.

945
01:36:36,691 --> 01:36:37,951
Good morning, senorita.

946
01:36:38,192 --> 01:36:39,482
Give it back.

947
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:40,511
What?

948
01:36:40,662 --> 01:36:42,942
Whatever it is you have stolen
from my father.

949
01:36:43,331 --> 01:36:45,231
] want it back. Give it to me.

950
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:47,967
No.

951
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:56,346
Come on, now.

952
01:37:10,892 --> 01:37:13,581
I don't have the time to give you
the proper instruction.

953
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:19,304
I have had the proper instruction
since I was four.

954
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:14,851
Not bad.

955
01:38:17,859 --> 01:38:19,199
Not bad at all.

956
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:44,167
This will make it more difficult,

957
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,450
senori...ta.

958
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:13,550
Don't move.

959
01:39:34,769 --> 01:39:36,289
Do you surrender?

960
01:39:36,671 --> 01:39:38,401
Never.

961
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,290
But l may scream.

962
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,423
l understand.

963
01:39:44,912 --> 01:39:47,102
Sometimes I have that effect.

964
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:17,390
Excuse me.

965
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:22,695
Goodbye, senorita.

966
01:40:35,162 --> 01:40:36,802
What are you doing here?
What happened?

967
01:40:37,098 --> 01:40:38,298
Zorro.

968
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:41,143
Zorro was here.
I fought him, and he left.

969
01:40:41,569 --> 01:40:42,589
He left!

970
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:44,032
Do you recognize him?

971
01:40:44,272 --> 01:40:48,312
No. But he was and vigorous.

972
01:40:49,443 --> 01:40:51,583
He was very vigorous, Father.

973
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:53,776
Vigorous?

974
01:40:54,015 --> 01:40:55,415
Yes.

975
01:41:34,789 --> 01:41:36,018
Let's go!

976
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:54,321
Go!

977
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,510
Come on!

978
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:10,972
Here...this is the canyon.

979
01:44:11,378 --> 01:44:13,048
That is where the mine is.

980
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:18,594
They have...twenty five,
thirty guards at most.

981
01:44:19,453 --> 01:44:20,683
Nothing that Zorro can't overcome.

982
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:22,501
I'm not going with you.

983
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:24,130
What?

984
01:44:25,226 --> 01:44:27,036
I'm not going with you.

985
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:32,179
There's something I must do.
It's a personal matter.

986
01:44:34,168 --> 01:44:35,628
What about the prisoners?

987
01:44:35,903 --> 01:44:37,743
There's nothing more
I can do for them.

988
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:40,710
You mean, nothing you will do.

989
01:44:40,975 --> 01:44:42,755
I gave my life to them!

990
01:44:44,078 --> 01:44:45,978
And in return, I lost everything.

991
01:44:46,313 --> 01:44:47,713
My wife was murdered
before my eyes

992
01:44:47,982 --> 01:44:51,852
and my child was stolen to be raised
by my mortal enemy.

993
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:54,233
Montero?

994
01:44:57,491 --> 01:44:59,041
Elena.

995
01:45:01,228 --> 01:45:02,838
She's your daughter.

996
01:45:04,565 --> 01:45:06,235
Yes, she was.

997
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,311
So...

998
01:45:13,741 --> 01:45:15,411
you will simply take your revenge.

999
01:45:15,709 --> 01:45:17,729
No. ! will take my daughter.

1000
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:19,948
And don't pretend
she means nothing to you.

1001
01:45:20,281 --> 01:45:21,651
Well, she does.

1002
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:24,986
But you taught me to see
beyond personal feelings, remember?

1003
01:45:25,486 --> 01:45:27,326
Was that all a lie?

1004
01:45:28,856 --> 01:45:31,846
-You're too to understand.
-To understand what?

1005
01:45:32,526 --> 01:45:34,135
Betrayal?

1006
01:45:34,562 --> 01:45:36,732
All the work, all the training,
all the wise words.

1007
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:38,387
For what?

1008
01:45:38,632 --> 01:45:40,562
To smile in the face
of my brother's killer,

1009
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:42,800
while you make your own plans?

1010
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:49,664
Alejandro, I taught you
everything you need to survive.

1011
01:45:50,978 --> 01:45:52,648
Now I must look to my own heart.

1012
01:45:55,216 --> 01:45:57,026
Elena is all have left.

1013
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,960
I'm not going to lose her again.

1014
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:03,936
What about California?

1015
01:46:04,225 --> 01:46:05,805
What about the people?

1016
01:46:06,994 --> 01:46:09,044
They still have Zorro.

1017
01:46:37,992 --> 01:46:40,072
I've every inch
of the countryside covered.

1018
01:46:40,427 --> 01:46:42,036
If he shows himself...

1019
01:46:44,498 --> 01:46:45,288
are you all right?

1020
01:46:45,466 --> 01:46:46,806
Do you have the map?

1021
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,087
We'll find it.

1022
01:46:48,302 --> 01:46:50,552
Is your army ready to fight
Santa Anna's?

1023
01:46:50,938 --> 01:46:51,368
No, sir.

1024
01:46:51,505 --> 01:46:52,875
Then why are you asking me
if I'm all right?

1025
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:54,070
Of course I'm not all right.

1026
01:46:54,275 --> 01:46:55,264
You know,
I'm really beginning to wonder

1027
01:46:55,476 --> 01:46:57,585
if you want this operation
to succeed at all. Captain Love.

1028
01:46:57,945 --> 01:46:59,085
Just what are you saying,
Don Rafael?

1029
01:46:59,313 --> 01:47:00,483
What I'm saying, Captain,

1030
01:47:00,714 --> 01:47:03,524
is that I think that my horse
could run this army better than you.

1031
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:10,669
I said I'll find him.

1032
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,080
That means I will.

1033
01:47:18,365 --> 01:47:20,175
Perhaps I can save you the trouble.

1034
01:47:20,501 --> 01:47:22,491
Go on, reach for it...Captain!

1035
01:47:24,972 --> 01:47:26,282
Who are you?

1036
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:28,760
I warned you long ago, Rafael...

1037
01:47:30,844 --> 01:47:32,454
you would never be rid of me.

1038
01:47:33,314 --> 01:47:34,894
De la Vega.

1039
01:47:38,686 --> 01:47:39,915
Rafael.

1040
01:47:40,154 --> 01:47:42,674
You were not the Zorro
I saw last night.

1041
01:47:43,357 --> 01:47:45,347
That was your master,
Don Alejandro.

1042
01:47:45,693 --> 01:47:46,983
Yes.

1043
01:47:47,494 --> 01:47:50,714
But there are many who would
proudly wear the mask of Zorro.

1044
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:53,101
Either way, it's of little consequence.

1045
01:47:53,434 --> 01:47:56,014
Events have been set in motion
that you cannot stop.

1046
01:47:56,637 --> 01:47:58,507
I'm not here to stop you.

1047
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,374
Call for Elena.

1048
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:07,963
Call her.

1049
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:11,897
Captain...

1050
01:48:12,686 --> 01:48:14,646
bring my daughter to me.

1051
01:48:16,357 --> 01:48:17,667
Bring her to me!

1052
01:48:26,934 --> 01:48:29,124
You cannot imagine, Rafael,

1053
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:31,433
how I have dreamed
of this moment.

1054
01:48:31,772 --> 01:48:35,052
Night and day, twenty long years.

1055
01:48:36,577 --> 01:48:38,007
Really?

1056
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:40,989
[ haven't given you a second thought.

1057
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:45,822
If l...die, De la Vega,
the truth dies with me.

1058
01:48:47,254 --> 01:48:48,364
We shall see.

1059
01:48:48,589 --> 01:48:49,818
Father!

1060
01:48:50,591 --> 01:48:52,641
Bernardo, what are you doing?

1061
01:48:52,993 --> 01:48:54,773
Tell her, Rafael.

1062
01:48:56,263 --> 01:48:58,403
Tell me what? What is going on?

1063
01:48:58,766 --> 01:49:01,375
Tell her who her real father is.

1064
01:49:02,036 --> 01:49:04,226
Father, what is he saying?

1065
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:10,910
This...unfortunate man
lost a daughter once...

1066
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:12,395
and it has driven him mad.

1067
01:49:12,579 --> 01:49:15,099
And...now,
he seeks to claim you for his own.

1068
01:49:17,418 --> 01:49:20,878
Tell her how her mother died.

1069
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:27,278
Your daughter is lost, De la Vega.

1070
01:49:28,662 --> 01:49:30,242
You cannot have mine.

1071
01:49:30,531 --> 01:49:32,371
De la Vega?

1072
01:49:33,967 --> 01:49:36,626
A woman in town, she told me.

1073
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:41,279
Diego De la Vega?

1074
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:45,374
Father?

1075
01:49:46,647 --> 01:49:48,667
His name is of no consequence.

1076
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:56,080
I was told my ninera used
to hang something on my crib.

1077
01:49:57,891 --> 01:50:01,290
Yes...she had her hang
a...fresh...flower...

1078
01:50:01,829 --> 01:50:02,969
No!

1079
01:50:04,765 --> 01:50:05,935
No!

1080
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:13,558
Let us finish it, Rafael.

1081
01:50:14,174 --> 01:50:15,844
Let us finish what we started...

1082
01:50:16,143 --> 01:50:18,013
the night Esperanza died.

1083
01:50:19,513 --> 01:50:20,742
Drop your sword...

1084
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:23,791
or I will have no choice,
but to have you shot.

1085
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:26,391
Even in the presence of my daughter.

1086
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:31,500
Please.

1087
01:50:46,773 --> 01:50:48,323
They were flowers.

1088
01:50:48,675 --> 01:50:50,485
Romneya.

1089
01:50:57,017 --> 01:50:58,217
Rafael...

1090
01:51:01,054 --> 01:51:02,544
she knows.

1091
01:53:11,718 --> 01:53:12,827
Water!

1092
01:53:48,455 --> 01:53:49,535
Lock them up!

1093
01:54:46,046 --> 01:54:47,626
The fuses are burning. Hurry it up.

1094
01:54:52,652 --> 01:54:53,852
Let's go.

1095
01:55:16,943 --> 01:55:18,023
Wait here.

1096
01:55:28,088 --> 01:55:29,898
Secure the wagon. Stay alert.

1097
01:57:00,113 --> 01:57:01,573
De la Vega.

1098
01:57:02,549 --> 01:57:03,839
Rafael.

1099
01:58:17,857 --> 01:58:19,117
Only one question.

1100
01:58:23,496 --> 01:58:24,426
Really?

1101
01:58:24,631 --> 01:58:25,681
What is that?

1102
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:32,290
How would you like your
remains displayed?

1103
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:05,309
Now I'm free...to kill you.

1104
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:06,839
No!

1105
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:15,160
Drop the sword.

1106
02:00:15,975 --> 02:00:17,025
Drop it.

1107
02:00:26,753 --> 02:00:29,123
You really think
I would have killed my own child?

1108
02:00:32,325 --> 02:00:33,085
No!

1109
02:00:54,981 --> 02:00:56,001
Did you miss me?

1110
02:01:19,973 --> 02:01:21,583
Elena! Get them out!

1111
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:32,516
"M"...for Murrieta.

1112
02:01:33,186 --> 02:01:34,766
Two men.

1113
02:01:35,555 --> 02:01:36,635
One death!

1114
02:02:38,284 --> 02:02:39,744
You're doin’ well.

1115
02:02:40,119 --> 02:02:42,429
Your brother would have
shot himself by now.

1116
02:04:38,237 --> 02:04:39,547
Alejandro.

1117
02:05:55,681 --> 02:05:57,491
ls it finished?

1118
02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:02,421
Yes, Don Diego...it's finished.

1119
02:06:04,624 --> 02:06:06,464
Not for Zorro.

1120
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:10,476
There will be other days,
other battles to fight.

1121
02:06:11,297 --> 02:06:13,906
It is your curse and destiny.

1122
02:06:17,036 --> 02:06:19,086
My beautiful Elena.

1123
02:06:21,974 --> 02:06:24,344
The world is a strange place.

1124
02:06:26,646 --> 02:06:29,516
To have found you at last,
only to lose you again.

1125
02:06:29,982 --> 02:06:31,792
You will never lose me...

1126
02:06:33,319 --> 02:06:34,989
Father.

1127
02:06:38,791 --> 02:06:40,341
Elena...

1128
02:06:43,062 --> 02:06:44,791
you are like your mother.

1129
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:48,299
Same eyes.

1130
02:06:49,001 --> 02:06:50,841
Same mouth.

1131
02:06:51,671 --> 02:06:53,311
Same spirit.

1132
02:06:58,344 --> 02:06:59,984
Alejandro...

1133
02:07:02,915 --> 02:07:04,495
Elena.

1134
02:07:24,904 --> 02:07:26,804
And so it was.

1135
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:29,650
Lightning split the sky...

1136
02:07:30,009 --> 02:07:31,909
thunder shook the Earth.

1137
02:07:32,512 --> 02:07:35,232
Then, all was quiet.

1138
02:07:37,316 --> 02:07:39,096
The great warrior known as...

1139
02:07:39,418 --> 02:07:42,788
Zotro...was gone.

1140
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:46,140
People of the land gave him
a hero's funeral,

1141
02:07:46,526 --> 02:07:49,076
the largest anyone had ever seen.

1142
02:07:49,695 --> 02:07:51,625
They came from far and wide

1143
02:07:51,964 --> 02:07:55,124
to say farewell to the brave
and noble champion.

1144
02:07:58,704 --> 02:08:00,754
But don't worry, little Joaquin.

1145
02:08:02,108 --> 02:08:04,538
Whenever great
deeds are remembered...

1146
02:08:04,977 --> 02:08:07,087
your grandfather will live on.

1147
02:08:08,915 --> 02:08:12,105
For there must always,
always be a Zorro.

1148
02:08:12,685 --> 02:08:17,225
And someday, when he's needed,
we will see him again.

1149
02:08:18,257 --> 02:08:22,597
On his fearsome steed, Tornado,
riding like the wind,

1150
02:08:23,429 --> 02:08:25,769
his sword blazing in the sun.

1151
02:08:26,499 --> 02:08:27,579
Leaping...

1152
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:28,440
. .
jumping...

1153
02:08:28,601 --> 02:08:29,911
swinging through the air.

1154
02:08:30,169 --> 02:08:33,858
Fighting like a lion,
fighting like a tiger, fighting...

1155
02:08:41,314 --> 02:08:43,364
as safely as possible.

1156
02:08:45,184 --> 02:08:47,904
Is this your idea
of putting the baby to sleep?

1157
02:08:55,328 --> 02:08:57,168
Sleep tight, my son.

1158
02:09:04,170 --> 02:09:06,450
When I sleep I will dream of this...

1159
02:09:06,839 --> 02:09:09,499
dashing rogue, Zorro.

1160
02:09:10,543 --> 02:09:12,822
But what face shall I give him?

1161
02:09:14,247 --> 02:09:16,857
He has been
many different men, but...

1162
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:19,830
he has loved you as all of them.

1163
02:09:25,224 --> 02:09:27,474
How can I refuse such a man?

1164
02:09:29,395 --> 02:09:31,535
Do you know where I might find him?

1165
02:09:32,732 --> 02:09:34,402
You know Zorro...

1166
02:09:34,967 --> 02:09:36,897
he could be anywhere.

1167
02:09:53,653 --> 02:09:58,163
There, there, my darling.
