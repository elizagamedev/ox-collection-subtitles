1
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,349
Once upon a time
in a faraway land,

2
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,973
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

3
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,940
Although he had everything
his heart desired,

4
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:00,546
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

5
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,169
But then, one winter's night,

6
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,928
an old beggar woman came to the castle

7
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,734
and offered him a single rose

8
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,917
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

9
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,827
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,

10
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,456
the prince sneered at the gift

11
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,625
and turned the old woman away.

12
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:24,198
But she warned him
not to be deceived by appearances,

13
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,558
for beauty is found within.

14
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,941
And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away

15
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,579
to reveal a beautiful enchantress.

16
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,707
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late,

17
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,207
for she had seen
that there was no love in his heart.

18
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:47,104
And as punishment,
she transformed him into a hideous beast

19
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,041
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle

20
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,664
and all who lived there.

21
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,597
Ashamed of his monstrous form,

22
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,499
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle,

23
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:02,609
with a magic mirror
as his only window to the outside world.

24
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:08,844
The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose,

25
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,159
which would bloom
until his twenty-first year.

26
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,643
If he could learn to love another

27
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,786
and earn her love in return

28
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,975
by the time the last petal fell,

29
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,631
then the spell would be broken.

30
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:29,680
If not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for aif time.

31
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,718
As the years passed,
he fell into despair

32
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,693
and lost all hope.

33
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,373
For who could ever learn
to love a beast?

34
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,927
Little town
It's a quiet village

35
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:19,529
Every day like the one before

36
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,857
Little town
Full of little people

37
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:28,748
Waking up to say

38
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,800
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

39
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,449
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

40
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,524
There goes the baker
with his tray like always

41
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,338
The same old bread and rolls to self

42
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,293
Every morning just the same
since the morning that we came

43
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,281
To this poor provincial town

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,550
- Good morning, Belle.
- Morning, monsieur.

45
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,565
- Where are you off to?
- The bookshop.

46
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:54,144
I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre...

47
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,978
That's nice. Marie, the baguettes!

48
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,680
Hurry up.

49
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,959
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question

50
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,022
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell?

51
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,102
- Never part of any crowd
- 'Cause her head's up on some cloud

52
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,426
No denying she's a funny girl
that Belle

53
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,567
- Bonjour
- Good day

54
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,346
How is your family?

55
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,234
- Bonjour
- Good day

56
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,166
How is your wife?

57
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,101
I need six eggs

58
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,856
That's too expensive

59
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,642
There must be more
than this provincial life

60
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,982
- Belle.
- Good morning.

61
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,174
I've come to return
the book I borrowed.

62
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,647
- Finished already?
- L couldn't put it down.

63
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,699
- Have you got anything new?
- Not since yesterday.

64
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,136
That's all right.
I'll borrow this one.

65
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,786
That one?
But you've read it twice.

66
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,412
Well, it's my favorite.

67
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,753
Far-off places, daring sword fights,
magic spells, a prince in disguise.

68
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,531
If you like it all that much,
it's yours.

69
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,384
- But, sir...
- linsist.

70
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,852
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

71
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,959
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar

72
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,339
! wonder if she's feeling well

73
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,825
- With a dreamy far-off look
- And her nose stuck in a book

74
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,379
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

75
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:18,324
Oh, isn't this amazing?

76
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,573
It's my favorite part because

77
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,731
You'll see

78
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,861
Here's

79
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,597
Where she meets Prince Charming

80
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,645
But she won't discover that it's him

81
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,286
Till chapter three

82
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,627
Now, it's no wonder
that her name means "beauty"

83
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,458
Her looks have got no parallel

84
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,698
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

85
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,861
Very different from the rest of us

86
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,707
She's nothing like the rest of us

87
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,572
Yes, different from the rest of us
is Belle

88
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,102
You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!
You're the greatest hunter in the world.

89
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,509
I know.

90
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,927
No beast alive
stands a chance against you.

91
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,769
- And no girl for that matter.
- It's true, Le Fou.

92
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,489
And I've got my sights
set on that one.

93
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,902
- The inventor's daughter?
- She's the one.

94
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,330
- The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
- But...

95
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,056
- The most beautiful girl in town.
- 1 know, but...

96
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,826
That makes her the best.
And don't I deserve the best?

97
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,760
Well, of course. You do.

98
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:38,488
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her

99
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,902
I said she's gorgeous
and I felf

100
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,619
Here in town there's only she
who is beautiful as me

101
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,039
So I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle

102
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,447
Look there, he goes
Isn't he dreamy?

103
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,047
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute

104
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,680
Be stilf my heart
I'm hardly breathing

105
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:05,107
He's such a tall, dark, strong
and handsome brute

106
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,745
- Bonjour.
- Good day.

107
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,950
- You call this bacon?
- What lovely grapes

108
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,586
- Ten yards
- Excuse me

109
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,729
- I'll get the knife
- Please let me through

110
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,465
- This bread, it's stale
- These fish, they smell

111
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,179
There must be more
than this provincial life

112
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:23,426
Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife

113
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,760
Look, there she goes
A girl who's strange but special

114
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,583
A most peculiar mademoiselle

115
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,570
It's a pity anda sin
she doesn't quite fit in

116
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,534
- 'Cause she really is a funny girl
- A beauty but a funny girl

117
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,401
She really is a funny girl

118
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,119
- That Belle
- Bonjour.

119
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,955
Bonjour.

120
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,470
Bonjour

121
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,035
- Hello, Belle.
- Bonjour, Gaston.

122
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,121
Gaston, may I have my book, please?

123
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,724
How can you read this?
There's no pictures.

124
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,103
Well, some people
use their imagination.

125
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,169
Belle, it's about time
you got your head out of those books

126
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,368
and paid attention
to more important things... like me.

127
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,741
The whole town's talking about it.
It's not right for a woman to read.

128
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,878
Soon she starts
getting ideas and thinking.

129
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,198
Gaston, you are positively primeval.

130
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,143
Why, thank you, Belle.

131
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,835
What do you say you and me take a walk
to the tavern and look at my trophies?

132
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,633
Maybe some other time.

133
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,684
- What's wrong with her?
- She's crazy.

134
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,240
He's gorgeous.

135
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,638
Please, Gaston, I can't.
l have to get home to help my father.

136
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,457
Goodbye.

137
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,436
That crazy old loon.
He needs all the help he can get.

138
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:44,807
- Don't talk about my father that way.
- Don't talk about her father that way.

139
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,387
My father is not crazy.
He's a genius.

140
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,978
- Papa?
- How on earth did that happen?

141
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,125
Doggone it.

142
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,677
Are you all right, Papa?

143
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,135
I'm about ready to give up
on this hunk of junk.

144
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,582
- You always say that.
- [mean it this time.

145
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,636
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!

146
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,079
Yes, you will. And you'll win
first prize at the fair tomorrow.

147
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,602
And become a world-famous inventor.

148
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,149
You really believe that?

149
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,170
l always have.

150
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,310
Well, what are we waiting for?

151
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,509
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

152
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,451
Hand me that
double-legged clincher there.

153
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,717
So did you have a good time
in town today?

154
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,261
I got a new book.

155
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,073
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

156
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,193
My daughter? Odd?

157
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,418
Where would you get an idea like that?

158
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,016
Oh, I don't know.

159
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,718
It's just that I'm not sure
I fit in here.

160
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,938
There's no one I can really talk to.

161
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,363
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fellow.

162
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,477
He's handsome, all right.
And rude and conceited.

163
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,334
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

164
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,419
Well, don't you worry,

165
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,871
‘cause this invention's going
to be the start of a new life for us.

166
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,218
I think that's done it.
Now let's give it a try.

167
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,103
It works!

168
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,321
It does?

169
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,066
- It does!
- You did it.

170
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,855
You really did it!

171
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,294
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair.

172
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,092
Goodbye, Papa. Good luck.

173
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,635
Goodbye, Belle,
and take care while I'm gone.

174
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,922
I should be there by now.

175
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,411
Maybe we missed a turn.

176
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,699
l guess I should have taken that...
Wait a minute.

177
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,312
Let's go this way.

178
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,807
Come on, Philippe.
It's a shortcut.

179
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,473
We'll be there in no time.

180
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:57,454
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?

181
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,347
We'd better turn around.

182
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,415
Whoa!

183
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,766
Whoa, boy. Whoa. Whoa!

184
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,978
Look out!

185
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,610
Whoa.

186
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,446
Whoa, boy.

187
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,812
Back up, back up!

188
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,867
Good boy, good boy.
That's a good... Back up!

189
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,861
Steady, steady. Now, steady.

190
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,300
Steady.

191
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,453
Whoa, Philippe, whoa.

192
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,581
Philippe?

193
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,536
Help! Is someone there?

194
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,096
Help!

195
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,116
Hello?

196
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,520
Hello?

197
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,989
The fellow must have lost his way
in the woods.

198
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,508
Quiet. Maybe he'll go away.

199
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,830
Is someone there?

200
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,617
Not a word, Lumiere, not one word.

201
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,170
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse

202
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,065
and I need a place to stay
for the night.

203
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,411
Cogsworth, have a heart.

204
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,339
Of course, monsieur.
You are welcome here.

205
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,062
Who said that?

206
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,027
Over here!

207
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,348
Where?

208
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,824
Hello.

209
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,180
- Incredible.
- Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.

210
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,545
Splendid. Just peachy.

211
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,441
- How is this accomplished?
- Put me down at once.

212
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:39,991
Stop that.

213
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,473
Stop that, I say.

214
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,174
Close that at once!

215
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,646
- Do you mind?
- [beg your pardon.

216
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,334
It's just that I've never seen a...

217
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,516
You are soaked to the bone, monsieur.
Come warm yourself by the fire.

218
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,478
- Thank you.
- No, no, no.

219
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,308
You know what the master
will do if he finds him here.

220
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,964
I demand that you stop right there.

221
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,354
No, not the master's chair.

222
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,293
I'm not seeing this.
I'm not seeing this!

223
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,972
Well, hello there, boy.

224
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,758
- What service.
- All right. This has gone far enough.

225
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,541
I'm in charge here.

226
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,413
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?

227
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,814
- It'll warm you up in no time.
- No! No tea.

228
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,392
No tea!

229
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,325
His moustache tickles, Mama.

230
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,883
Hello.

231
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,470
There's a stranger here.

232
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,142
Master, allow me to explain.

233
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,067
The gentleman was lost in the wood.
He was cold and wet.

234
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,420
Master, I'd like
to take this moment to say...

235
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,933
.. was against this.
It was all his fault.

236
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,564
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No!

237
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,484
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

238
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,968
I was lost in the woods and...

239
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,942
You're not welcome here.

240
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,164
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,373
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

242
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,955
So, you've come
to stare at the beast, have you?

243
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,605
Please, I meant no harm.
I just needed a place to stay.

244
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,982
- I'll give you a place to stay.
- No, please.

245
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,738
No, no!

246
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:06,464
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?

247
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,279
Yup. This is her lucky day.

248
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,719
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

249
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,598
First I better go in there
and propose to the girl.

250
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,251
And you, Le Fou,

251
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,699
- when Belle and I come out that door...
- l know!

252
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,367
I strike up the band.

253
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,500
- Not yet.
- Sorry.

254
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,791
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.

255
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,160
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

256
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,657
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town

257
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,816
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

258
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,842
This is the day...

259
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,283
This is the day your dreams come true.

260
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,168
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

261
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,986
Plenty. Picture this.

262
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:14,032
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire,

263
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,880
my little wife massaging my feet

264
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,947
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.

265
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,267
- We'll have six or seven.
- Dogs?

266
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,443
No, Belle!
Strapping boys, like me.

267
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,216
- Imagine that.
- Do you know who that wife will be?

268
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,249
- Let me think...
- You, Belle.

269
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,684
Gaston, I'm... I'm...

270
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,386
..- speechless.
I really don't know what to say.

271
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,496
- Say you'll marry me.
- I'm very sorry, Gaston.

272
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,790
But I just don't deserve you.

273
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,325
So how did it go?

274
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,208
I'll have Belle for my wife.

275
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,541
Make no mistake about that.

276
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,869
Touchy!

277
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,101
Is he gone?

278
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,870
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him!

279
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,367
Me, the wife
of that boorish, brainless...

280
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,848
Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it?

281
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,782
Madame Gaston
His little wife

282
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,559
No, sir, not me
! guarantee it

283
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,480
! want much more
than this provincial life

284
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,703
! want adventure
in the great wide somewhere

285
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:03,028
! want it more than I can tell

286
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,046
And for once it might be grand

287
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,753
To have someone understand

288
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,797
! want so much more
than they've got planned

289
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,462
Philippe!

290
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,996
What are you doing here? Where's...?

291
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,560
Where's Papa?

292
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,811
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

293
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,590
We have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

294
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,897
What is this place?

295
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,538
Please, steady.

296
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,678
Steady.

297
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,879
Papa.

298
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,675
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

299
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,264
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?

300
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,350
Serve him tea,
sit in the master's chair,

301
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,970
pet the pooch.

302
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,691
I was trying to be hospitable.

303
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,431
Hello?

304
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,192
Is anyone here?

305
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,402
Hello?

306
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,084
Papa?

307
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,437
Papa? Are you here?

308
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,159
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.

309
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,486
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

310
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,825
Really, Mama.
I saw her.

311
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,089
- Not another word. Into the tub.
- But...

312
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,087
A girl! l saw a girl in the castle!

313
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,814
See? I told you.

314
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,703
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

315
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,911
Papa?

316
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,563
Did you see that?

317
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,297
-It's agirl.
- [know it's a girl!

318
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,677
Don't you see? She's the one.
The girl we have been waiting for.

319
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,610
- She has come to break the spell!
- Wait a minute!

320
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,832
Papa?

321
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,629
Papa?

322
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,893
Hello? Is someone here?

323
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,263
Wait. I'm looking for my father. I...

324
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,091
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.

325
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,287
- ls anyone here?
- Belle?

326
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,410
Papa!

327
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:34,304
- How did you find me?
- Your hands are like ice.

328
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,653
- [have to get you out of there.
- [want you to leave this place.

329
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,233
- Who's done this to you?
- No time to explain.

330
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,673
- You must go now.
- l won't leave you.

331
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,958
- What are you doing here?
- Run, Belle!

332
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,697
Who's there?
Who are you?

333
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,186
The master of this castle.

334
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,298
I've come for my father.

335
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,714
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?

336
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:57,093
- He shouldn't have trespassed here.
- But he could die.

337
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,616
- Please. I'll do anything.
- There is nothing you can do.

338
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,774
- He's my prisoner.
- There must be some way I can...

339
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,518
Wait!

340
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,841
- Take me instead.
- You!

341
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,759
You would take his place?

342
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,309
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing.

343
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,037
If l did, would you let him go?

344
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,427
Yes.

345
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,706
But you must promise
to stay here forever.

346
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,748
Come into the light.

347
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,545
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!

348
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,734
- You have my word.
- Done.

349
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,923
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.

350
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,863
- Wait.
- Belle!

351
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,222
Wait!

352
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,711
No. Please spare my daughter. Please!

353
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,953
She's no longer your concern.

354
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,212
- Take him to the village.
- Let me out!

355
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,860
Please let me out!

356
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,519
Let me out.

357
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,188
Please!

358
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,446
Please.

359
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,556
- Master?
- What?

360
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,078
Since the girl is going to be with us
for quite some time,

361
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,861
l was thinking that

362
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,143
you might want to offer her
a more comfortable room.

363
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,735
Then again, maybe not.

364
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,076
You didn't even let me say goodbye.
I'll never see him again.

365
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,394
And I didn't get to say goodbye.

366
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,190
I'll show you to your room.

367
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,916
My room? But I thought...

368
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,785
- You wanna stay in the tower?
- No.

369
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,245
Then follow me.

370
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,507
Say something to her.

371
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,104
I... hope you like it here.

372
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,680
The castle is your home now
so you can go anywhere you like.

373
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,180
Except the west wing.

374
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,447
- What's in the west...?
- It's forbidden!

375
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:45,037
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.

376
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,534
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

377
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,100
You will join me for dinner.

378
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,232
That's not a request.

379
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:11,876
Who does she think she is?

380
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,097
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

381
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,220
No one says no to Gaston.

382
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,292
- Darn right.
- Dismissed. Rejected.

383
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,764
Publicly humiliated.

384
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,894
Why, it's more than I can bear.

385
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,886
- More beer?
- What for?

386
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:28,524
Nothing helps. I'm disgraced.

387
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,761
Who, you? Never.

388
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,840
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

389
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,006
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

390
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,650
Looking so down in the dumps

391
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,487
Every guy here’d love to be you, Gaston

392
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,043
Even when taking your lumps

393
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,817
There's no man in town
as admired as you

394
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,643
You're everyone's favorite guy

395
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,477
Everyone's awed and inspired by you

396
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:02,456
And it's not very hard to see why

397
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:10,812
No one's slick as Gaston

398
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,890
No one's quick as Gaston

399
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,004
No one's neck’'s
as incredibly thick as Gaston

400
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,078
For there's no man in town
half as manly

401
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,525
Perfect, a pure paragon

402
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,868
You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley

403
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:30,005
And they'll tell you whose team
they prefer to be on

404
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:35,486
No one's been like Gaston

405
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,608
A kingpin like Gaston

406
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,580
No one's got a swell cleft
in his chin like Gaston

407
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,396
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating

408
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,240
Oh, what a guy, that Gaston

409
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,000
Give five hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips

410
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,570
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

411
00:27:56,208 --> 00:28:00,548
No one fights like Gaston

412
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,703
Douses lights like Gaston

413
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,821
In a wrestling match
no one bites like Gaston

414
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:09,275
For there's no one as burly and brawny

415
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,095
As you see, I've got biceps to spare

416
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,425
Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny

417
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:19,637
That's right and every last inch of me's
covered with hair

418
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,662
- No one hits like Gaston
- Matches wits like Gaston

419
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,998
In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston

420
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,751
I'm especially good at expectorating

421
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,559
Ten points for Gaston

422
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,028
When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

423
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,548
Every morning to help me get large

424
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,772
And now that I'm grown
l eat five dozen eggs

425
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:47,232
So I'm roughly the size of a barge

426
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,568
No one shoots like Gaston

427
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,753
Makes those beauts like Gaston

428
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,844
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

429
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,704
l use antlers in all of my decorating

430
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,992
My, what a guy

431
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,470
Gaston

432
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,561
Help! Someone help me.

433
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,166
- Maurice?
- Please, please, I need your help.

434
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,249
He's got her.
He's got her locked in the dungeon.

435
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,804
- Who?
- Belle.

436
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,250
We must go.
Not a minute to lose.

437
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,563
Whoa. Slow down, Maurice.

438
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,511
- Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
- A beast!

439
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,218
A horrible monstrous beast!

440
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,636
- ls ita big beast?
- Huge!

441
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,464
- With a long, ugly snout?
- Hideously ugly.

442
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,164
- And sharp, cruel fangs?
- Yes, yes!

443
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,743
- Will you help me?
- All right, old man.

444
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,873
- We'll help you out.
- You will?

445
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,881
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you!

446
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,287
Crazy old Maurice.

447
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,152
He's always good for a laugh.

448
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,183
Crazy old Maurice?

449
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,411
Crazy old Maurice...

450
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:15,004
Le Fou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking

451
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,030
- A dangerous pastime
- 1 know

452
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,170
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

453
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,080
And his sanity's only so-so

454
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,899
Now, the wheels in my head
have been turning

455
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,939
Since I looked at that loony old man

456
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,583
See, ! promised myself
I'd be married to Belle

457
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,939
And right now I'm evolving a plan

458
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,268
If l try to get her out of there...

459
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,003
- Yes?
- Then we got her out...

460
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,675
Would she?

461
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,433
- Guess.
- Now I get it.

462
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,002
Let's go!

463
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,550
No one plots like Gaston

464
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,578
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

465
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,753
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots
like Gaston

466
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:02,503
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

467
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:07,615
My, what a guy
Gaston

468
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,049
Will no one help me?

469
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,990
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Potts, dear.

470
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,578
I thought you might like a spot of tea.

471
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,823
You're... You're a...

472
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,417
- Careful!
- This is impossible.

473
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,196
I know it is, but here we are.

474
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,938
Told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?

475
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,945
All right, Chip, now that will do.

476
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,527
Slowly now.

477
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:47,912
Don't spill.

478
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,760
Thank you.

479
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,982
Wanna see me do a trick?

480
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:54,875
Chip!

481
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:56,971
Sorry.

482
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,372
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

483
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,041
We all think so.

484
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,536
But I've lost my father,
my dreams, everything.

485
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,696
Cheer up, child.

486
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:10,392
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.

487
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,499
Listen to me, jabbering on while
there's a supper to get on the table.

488
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,356
Chip!

489
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,178
Bye!

490
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,803
Well, now, what shall
we dress you in for dinner?

491
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,015
Let's see what I've got in my drawers.

492
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,776
How embarrassing.

493
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,159
Here we are.

494
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,052
You'll look ravishing in this one.

495
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,540
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.

496
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,514
But you must!

497
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,266
Dinner is served.

498
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,157
What's taking so long?

499
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,418
I told her to come down.

500
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:50,998
Why isn't she here yet?

501
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,936
Try to be patient, sir.

502
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:56,398
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

503
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:00,687
Have you thought that perhaps this girl
could be the one to break the spell?

504
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,649
Of course I have!

505
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,374
- I'm not a fool.
- Good.

506
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,899
So you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you,

507
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,260
and poof, the spell is broken.

508
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,289
We'll be human again by midnight.

509
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,081
It's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

510
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,454
But the rose has already begun to wilt.

511
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,086
It's no use.

512
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,274
She's so beautiful and I'm...

513
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,334
Well, look at me!

514
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,716
You must help her to see past all that.

515
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,250
I don't know how.

516
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,405
Well, you can start
by making yourself more presentable.

517
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,988
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

518
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,447
Yes, when she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

519
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,561
Come, come, show me the smile.

520
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,421
- But don't frighten the poor girl.
- Impress her with your rapier wit.

521
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,208
- But be gentle.
- Shower her with compliments.

522
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,644
- But be sincere.
- And above all...

523
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,807
You must control your temper!

524
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,623
Here she is.

525
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,520
Good evening.

526
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,576
Well, where is she?

527
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,416
The girl. Yes, the girl.

528
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,831
Actually, she's in the process of...

529
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,565
Circumstances being what they are...

530
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,966
She's not coming.

531
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,138
What?

532
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:20,312
Your lordship!
Your grace!

533
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,702
Your eminence!

534
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,737
Let's not be hasty!

535
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,254
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner.

536
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,679
I'm not hungry.

537
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,301
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...

538
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,864
- I'll break down the door!
- Master, I could be wrong,

539
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:39,944
but that may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

540
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,582
Please attempt to be a gentleman.

541
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,511
But she's being so difficult!

542
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,938
Gently, gently.

543
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,122
- Will you come down to dinner?
- No.

544
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,869
Suave. Gentile.

545
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,918
It would give me great pleasure

546
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,116
if you would join me for dinner.

547
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,805
- Can we say please?
- Please.

548
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,484
- No, thank you.
- You can't stay in there forever.

549
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,013
- Yes, I can.
- Fine.

550
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,641
Then go ahead and starve!

551
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:17,812
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all.

552
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,417
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well at all, did it?

553
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,312
Lumiere, stand watch at the door

554
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,796
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.

555
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,966
You can count on me, mon capitaine.

556
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:37,574
Well, we might as well go downstairs
and start cleaning up.

557
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,944
l ask nicely, but she refuses.

558
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,680
What does she want me to do?

559
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:44,992
Beg?

560
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,151
Show me the girl.

561
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,607
The master's really not so bad
once you get to know him.

562
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,428
Why don't you give him a chance?

563
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:59,064
I don't want to get to know him.
I don't want anything to do with him.

564
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,903
I'm just fooling myself.

565
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,795
She'll never see me
as anything but a monster.

566
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,278
It's hopeless.

567
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,295
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

568
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,116
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

569
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,145
- Yes, yes.
- I've been burnt by you before.

570
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,295
Zut alors! She has emerged!

571
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,435
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

572
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:58,093
- But I'm not sleepy.
- Yes, you are.

573
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,916
No, I'm not.

574
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,409
I work and I slave all day long
and for what?

575
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,545
A cculinary masterpiece gone to waste!

576
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,801
Stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.

577
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,951
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

578
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,888
After all, he did say please.

579
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,206
If the master doesn't control
that temper, he'll never break the...

580
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,223
Splendid to see you
out and about, mademoiselle.

581
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,009
lam Cogsworth, head of the household.

582
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:29,765
- This is Lumiere.
- Enchanté, cherie.

583
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:32,995
If there's... Stop that!
Anything we... Please!

584
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,731
..can do to make your stay
more comfortable?

585
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,838
- lam a little hungry.
- You are?

586
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,620
Hear that? She's hungry.

587
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,642
Stoke the fire,
break out the silver, wake the china.

588
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,055
- Remember what the master said.
- Pish posh.

589
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,582
I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.

590
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,194
All right, fine.

591
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,806
- Aglass of water, crust of bread...
- Cogsworth, I'm surprised at you.

592
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,740
She is not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

593
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,043
We must make her feel welcome here.

594
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,008
- Right this way, mademoiselle.
- Well, keep it down.

595
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,998
If the master finds out about this
it will be our necks.

596
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,906
Of course, of course.

597
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:11,146
But what is dinner
without a little music?

598
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,290
Music?

599
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,560
Ma chere, mademoiselle,

600
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,928
it is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

601
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,181
that we welcome you tonight.

602
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,990
And now we invite you to relax.

603
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,542
Let us pull up a chair,

604
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,051
as the dining room proudly presents

605
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,990
your dinner.

606
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,947
Be our guest

607
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,814
Be our guest

608
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,982
Put our service to the test

609
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,328
Tie your napkin round your neck, cherie
and we provide the rest

610
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:47,096
Soup du jour, hot hors d'ouevres

611
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,298
Why, we only live to serve

612
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,647
Try the gray stuff
It's delicious

613
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,896
Don't believe me?
Ask the dishes

614
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,162
They can sing
They can dance

615
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,581
After all, miss, this is France

616
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,926
And a dinner here is never second-best

617
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,080
Go on and fold your menu

618
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,193
Take a glance
and then you'll be our guest

619
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,786
Be our guest, be our guest

620
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,872
Beef ragout, cheese souffle

621
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,029
Pie and pudding en flambé

622
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,984
We'll prepare and serve with flair
a culinary cabaret

623
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,548
You're alone and you're scared

624
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,644
But the banquet's all prepared

625
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:28,623
No one's gloomy or complaining
while the flatware's entertaining

626
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,129
We tell jokes
1 do tricks

627
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,109
With my fellow candlesticks

628
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:37,004
Und it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet

629
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,415
Come on and lift your glass

630
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,644
You've won your own free pass
to be our guest

631
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,774
If you're stressed
it's fine dining we suggest

632
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,757
Be our guest, be our guest
be our guest

633
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,266
Life is so unnerving

634
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,526
For a servant who's not serving

635
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,790
He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon

636
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,404
Get off!

637
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:05,113
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

638
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,667
Suddenly those good old days are gone

639
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:15,606
Ten years we've been rusting
needing so much more than dusting

640
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,787
Needing exercise
A chance to use our skills

641
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,716
Most days we just lay around the castle

642
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,290
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and whoopsy daisy

643
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:33,013
It's a guest, it's a guest
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed

644
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,011
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

645
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,178
With dessert she'll want tea

646
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,220
And my dear, that's fine with me

647
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,199
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubblin’, I'll be brewin'

648
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,007
I'll get warm, piping hot

649
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,384
Heaven's sakes, is that a spot?
Clean that

650
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,087
We want the company impressed

651
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,993
We've got a lot to do
Is is one lump or two?

652
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:57,754
For you, our guest

653
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,569
- She's our guest
- She's our guest

654
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,057
She's our guest

655
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,842
No, people. Song's over.
Over here, line up. Not...!

656
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,009
It's been years since we've had
anybody here and we're obsessed

657
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,623
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

658
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,536
While the candlelight's still glowing

659
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,689
Let us help you, we'll keep going

660
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:22,907
Course by course

661
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,291
One by one

662
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,426
Till you shout
"Enough, I'm done!"

663
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:32,166
Then we'll sing you off to sleep
as you digest

664
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,970
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now let's eat up

665
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,484
Be our guest, be our guest

666
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,224
Be our guest

667
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:45,596
Please be our guest

668
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:56,741
- Bravo. That was wonderful.
- Thank you.

669
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:02,019
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it, everyone?

670
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,490
My goodness, look at the time.

671
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:09,587
- Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
- L couldn't possibly go to bed now.

672
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,151
It's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

673
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,277
Enchanted!

674
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,259
Who said anything
about the castle being enchanted?

675
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,372
It was you, wasn't it?

676
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,980
I figured it out for myself.

677
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,154
I'd like to look around
if that's all right.

678
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,717
- Would you like a tour?
- Wait a second.

679
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,330
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

680
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:35,086
We can't let her go poking around
in certain places,

681
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,850
if you know what I mean.

682
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,518
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

683
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,420
I'm sure you know everything
about the castle.

684
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,439
Oh, well, actually, I...

685
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,092
Yes, I do.

686
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,758
As you can see, the pseudo-facade
was stripped away

687
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,258
to reveal a minimalist Rococo design.

688
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,064
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

689
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:59,754
This is yet another example
of the late neo-classic Baroque period.

690
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:03,317
And, as I always say,
"If it's not Baroque, don't fix it.”

691
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,497
Where was I?

692
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,730
As you were.

693
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:15,185
Now then, if l may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses of the...

694
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:17,087
Mademoiselle?

695
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,107
- What's up there?
- Where? There? Nothing.

696
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,250
Nothing of interest
in the west wing.

697
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,502
Dusty, dull, very boring.

698
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,248
- So that's the west wing?
- Nice going.

699
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,359
l wonder what he's hiding up there.

700
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,742
Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.

701
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,254
- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
- Perhaps...

702
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,779
.. Mademoiselle would like
to see something else?

703
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,840
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way to...

704
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,920
- Maybe later.
- The gardens or the library perhaps?

705
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:55,718
- You have a library?
- Oh, yes!

706
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,330
- Indeed.
- With books.

707
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,408
- Scads of books.
- Mountains of books.

708
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,257
- Forests of books.
- Cascades.

709
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,119
- Cloudbursts.
- Swamps of books.

710
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,807
More books than
you'll be able to read in a lifetime.

711
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,960
Books on every subject ever studied.

712
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,889
By every author
who ever set pen to paper.

713
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,258
Why did you come here?

714
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,307
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,888
- l warned you never to come here.
- [didn't mean any harm.

716
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,562
Do you realize what you could have done?

717
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,476
- Stop.
- Get out!

718
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:05,792
No!

719
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,772
Get out!

720
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,760
- Where are you going?
- Promise or no promise,

721
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,839
- l can't stay another minute.
- No, wait, please.

722
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,516
Please wait.

723
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,904
Here now. Don't do that.

724
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,723
Just hold still.

725
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:07,507
That hurts.

726
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,700
If you'd hold still
it wouldn't hurt as much.

727
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,887
If you hadn't run away
this wouldn't have happened.

728
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:14,705
If you hadn't frightened me
l wouldn't have run away.

729
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,230
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing.

730
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,111
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.

731
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,441
Now hold still.

732
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,623
This might sting a little.

733
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,384
By the way, thank you...

734
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:34,714
..for saving my life.

735
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,497
You're welcome.

736
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:51,398
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night,

737
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:54,736
but he said
you'd make it worth my while.

738
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,008
- I'm listening.
- It's like this.

739
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,237
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.

740
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,361
But she needs a little persuasion.

741
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:08,838
Turned him down flat.

742
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,104
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.

743
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:15,343
He was in here tonight
raving about a beast in a castle.

744
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,243
Maurice is harmless.

745
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:22,025
The point is, Belle would do anything
to keep him from being locked up.

746
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,381
Yeah. Even marry him.

747
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:31,306
So you want me
to throw her father into the asylum

748
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,459
unless she agrees to marry you?

749
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:36,959
Oh, that is despicable.

750
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,799
I love it.

751
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:45,033
If no one will help me
then I'll go back alone.

752
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,522
Is that everything?

753
00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:48,204
I don't care what it takes.

754
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:52,288
I'll find that castle
and somehow I'll get her out of there.

755
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:00,707
Belle? Maurice?

756
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,185
Oh, well.

757
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,356
Guess it's not gonna work after all.

758
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:08,155
They have to come back sometime,
and when they do,

759
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,599
we'll be ready for them.

760
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:14,745
Le Fou, don't move from that spot

761
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,149
until Belle and her father come home.

762
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,994
But... but I...

763
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:22,625
Nuts.

764
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,679
I've never felt this way about anyone.

765
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,596
I want to do something for her.

766
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,403
- But what?
- Well, there's the usual things.

767
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:59,033
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.

768
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,690
No, no.

769
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:03,028
It has to be something very special.

770
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:06,607
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute!

771
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,706
Belle, there's something
I want to show you.

772
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,651
But first you have to close your eyes.

773
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,410
It's a surprise.

774
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,886
- Can I open them?
- Not yet.

775
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:37,827
Wait here.

776
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,380
- Now can I open them?
- All right.

777
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:47,357
Now.

778
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,353
I can't believe it!

779
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,542
I've never seen so many books
in my life.

780
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:03,538
- You... You like it?
- It's wonderful.

781
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:07,701
- Then it's yours.
- Thank you so much.

782
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,065
Would you look at that.

783
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,087
- [knew it would work.
- What?

784
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,789
What works?

785
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:15,838
It's very encouraging.

786
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,710
- Isn't this exciting?
- didn't see anything.

787
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,709
Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done.

788
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,232
What are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.

789
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,839
There's something sweet

790
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:15,817
And almost kind

791
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,250
But he was mean
and he was course and unrefined

792
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,487
And now he's dear

793
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,491
And so unsure

794
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:26,834
! wonder why
! didn't see it there before

795
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,728
She glanced this way

796
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,596
I thought I saw

797
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:47,902
And when we touched
she didn't shudder at my paw

798
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,995
No, it can't be

799
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,156
I'll just ignore

800
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,969
But then she's never looked at me
that way before

801
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:03,306
New and a bit alarming

802
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:07,359
Who'd have ever thought

803
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:11,428
That this could be

804
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,334
True

805
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,549
That he's no Prince Charming

806
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,801
But there's something in him

807
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,723
That I simply didn't see

808
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,679
- Well, who'd have thought
- Well, bless my soul

809
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:32,607
- Well, who'd have known
- Well, who, indeed

810
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,356
And who'd have guessed
they'd come together on their own

811
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:38,106
- It's so peculiar
- We'll wait and see

812
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,792
A few days more

813
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,966
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

814
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:49,319
You know, perhaps there is something
there that wasn't there before

815
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,870
What?

816
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:55,025
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

817
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,982
What's there, Mama?

818
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,058
I'll tell you when you're older.

819
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:07,493
Tonight is the night.

820
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:13,047
- I'm not sure I can do this.
- You don't have time to be timid.

821
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:16,783
- You must be bold, daring.
- Bold, daring.

822
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:23,795
There will be music,
romantic candlelight,

823
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,865
provided by myself.

824
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,020
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.

825
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,151
Yes.

826
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:34,026
Icon... 1... No.

827
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,574
- lL can't.
- You care for the girl, don't you?

828
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,904
- More than anything.
- Well, then, you must tell her.

829
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:45,076
Voila. You look so...

830
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:46,575
So...

831
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:47,853
Stupid.

832
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,825
Not quite the word I was looking for.

833
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:53,694
Perhaps a little more off the top.

834
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,870
Your lady awaits.

835
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,791
Tale as old as time

836
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:31,733
True as itcan be

837
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:37,295
Barely even friends

838
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:39,878
Then somebody bends

839
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:42,277
Unexpectedly

840
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,512
Just a little change

841
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,670
Small, to say the least

842
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,180
Both a little scared

843
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,879
Neither one prepared

844
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,885
Beauty and the Beast

845
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:06,711
Ever just the same

846
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:12,532
Ever a surprise

847
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,534
Ever as before

848
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:18,827
Ever just as sure

849
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,091
As the sun will rise

850
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,757
Tale as old as time

851
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,819
Tune as old as song

852
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:36,433
Bittersweet and strange

853
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,957
Finding you can change

854
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:41,596
Learning you were wrong

855
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:47,307
Certain as the sun

856
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:51,596
Rising in the east

857
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:54,102
Tale as old as time

858
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,864
Song as old as rhyme

859
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,926
Beauty and the Beast

860
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,903
Tale as old as time

861
00:59:06,343 --> 00:59:09,653
Song as old as rhyme

862
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:15,257
Beauty and the Beast

863
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,221
Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.

864
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,397
It's past your bedtime.

865
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:25,794
Good night, love.

866
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:51,457
Belle...

867
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,676
Are you happy here with me?

868
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:58,467
Yes.

869
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,476
What is it?

870
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:08,096
If only I could see my father again.

871
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,748
Just for a moment.

872
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,116
I miss him so much.

873
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,323
There is a way.

874
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:23,501
This mirror will show you anything.

875
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,720
Anything you wish to see.

876
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,667
I'd like to see my father please.

877
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,990
Papa!

878
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,975
Oh, no. He's sick.

879
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,881
He may be dying and he's all alone.

880
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,714
Then you must go to him.

881
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:55,294
What did you say?

882
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,859
l release you.

883
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,759
You're no longer my prisoner.

884
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:00,134
You mean...

885
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:01,497
.l'm free?

886
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,015
Yes.

887
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:05,931
Thank you.

888
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,503
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.

889
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:12,971
Take it with you,

890
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:15,253
so you'll always have a way
to look back...

891
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,796
..and remember me.

892
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:24,045
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

893
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:37,442
Well, your highness, I must say
everything is going just swimmingly.

894
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,024
I knew you had it in you.

895
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,844
I let her go.

896
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:45,442
Yes, yes, splen...

897
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,325
You what?

898
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:51,221
- How could you do that?
- [had to.

899
01:01:51,675 --> 01:01:53,225
Yes, but...

900
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,530
Why?

901
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:55,914
Because...

902
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:58,076
..[ love her.

903
01:01:58,415 --> 01:01:59,755
He did what?

904
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,186
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.

905
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,012
She's going away?

906
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,037
But he was so close.

907
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:10,336
After all this time
he's finally learned to love.

908
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:13,301
That's it, then.
That should break the spell.

909
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:15,037
But it's not enough.

910
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,437
She has to love him in return.

911
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:19,845
Now it's too late.

912
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:30,942
Papa?

913
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:32,658
Papa?

914
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,260
They're back.

915
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,397
Belle.

916
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,339
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

917
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:00,240
I thought I'd never see you again.

918
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,260
I missed you so much.

919
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,795
But the Beast,
how did you escape?

920
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:07,791
I didn't escape, Papa.
He let me go.

921
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:10,877
- That horrible beast?
- He's different now, Papa.

922
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:13,871
He's changed somehow.

923
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,496
- Hi.
- Astowaway.

924
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,486
Why, hello there, little fellow.

925
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,952
I didn't think I'd see you again.

926
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,555
Belle, why'd you go away?

927
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,780
Don't you like us anymore?

928
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,308
Oh, Chip.

929
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,624
Of course I do.
It's just that...

930
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,676
- May I help you?
- I've come to collect your father.

931
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,669
- My father?
- Don't worry, mademoiselle.

932
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:48,459
We'll take good care of him.

933
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:52,928
- My father's not crazy.
- He was raving like a lunatic.

934
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,753
- We all heard him, didn't we?
- Yeah!

935
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,319
No! I won't let you.

936
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:01,513
- Belle?
- Maurice.

937
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,738
Tell us again, old man,
just how big was the Beast?

938
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,630
He was... l mean, he was...

939
01:04:08,912 --> 01:04:10,432
He was enormous.

940
01:04:10,714 --> 01:04:14,174
I'd say at least eight...
No! More like ten feet.

941
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,719
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.

942
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,070
It's true, I tell you!

943
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:23,942
Get him out of here.

944
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,567
Let go of me!

945
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,669
No! You can't do this.

946
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:32,172
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.

947
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,275
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

948
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:38,231
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding.

949
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:41,029
- If...
- If what?

950
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,591
- If you marry me.
- What?

951
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:46,560
One little word, Belle,
that's all it takes.

952
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,413
- Never.
- Have it your way.

953
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:49,945
Belle!

954
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:52,497
Let go of me!

955
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:55,036
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.

956
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:57,035
Show me the Beast.

957
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,694
- ls he dangerous?
- No. He'd never hurt anyone.

958
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,195
Please. I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

959
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:11,877
He's my friend.

960
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:15,508
If didn't know better I'd think
you had feeling for this monster.

961
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,355
He's no monster, Gaston. You are!

962
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:22,433
She's as crazy as the old man.

963
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,932
The Beast will make off
with your children.

964
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,628
- He'll come in the night.
- No!

965
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:29,379
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall.

966
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:32,223
- lsay we kill the Beast.
- Kill him!

967
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:35,439
- We're not safe until he's dead
- He'll come stalking us at night

968
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:39,239
Set to sacrifice our children
to his monstrous appetite

969
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,729
He'll wreak havoc on our village
if we let him wander free

970
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:46,606
So, it's time to take some action, boys

971
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:51,093
It's time to follow me

972
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,660
Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows

973
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,520
It's a nightmare
but it's one exciting ride

974
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:03,022
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle

975
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:06,455
And there's something
truly terrible inside

976
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:09,540
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones

977
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,656
Massive paws,
killer claws for the feast

978
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,772
Hear him roar, see him foam

979
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,761
But we're not coming home
till he’s dead

980
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,758
- Good and dead
- Yeah!

981
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:22,213
- Kill the Beast!
- No, I won't let you do this.

982
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,509
If you're not with us,
you're against us.

983
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:27,538
- Bring the old man.
- Get your hands off me.

984
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,413
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

985
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,750
- Let us out!
- We'll rid the village of this beast!

986
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:36,534
- Who's with me?
- lam!

987
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,149
Light your torch, mount your horse

988
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,359
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

989
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:43,978
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

990
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,027
Through a mist through a wood
Where within a haunted castle

991
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,049
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day

992
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:53,843
It's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain

993
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:56,866
We won't rest tilf
he's good and deceased

994
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,240
Sally forth, tally ho,
grab your sword, grab your bow

995
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,027
Praise the Lord and here we go

996
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:05,274
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head.

997
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,715
l have to warn the Beast.

998
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:11,426
This is all my fault.
Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?

999
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:14,361
Now, now, we'll think of something.

1000
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:25,091
We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us

1001
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:28,444
And this monster is mysterious at least

1002
01:07:28,912 --> 01:07:31,602
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives

1003
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,738
We'll save our village and our lives

1004
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,414
We'll kill the Beast

1005
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:39,993
I knew it. I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1006
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,953
It would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1007
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,234
- Could it be?
- Is it she?

1008
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,019
Sacre bleu! Invaders!

1009
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,361
- Encroachers!
- They've got the mirror.

1010
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:54,361
Warn the master. If it's a fight
they want we'll be ready.

1011
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,504
Who's with me?

1012
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,446
Take whatever booty you can find,

1013
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,521
but remember the Beast is mine!

1014
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:03,288
Hearts ablaze, banners high

1015
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:04,806
We go marching into battle

1016
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:07,767
Unatraid, although
the danger just increased

1017
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,937
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come, we're 50 strong

1018
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:13,437
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

1019
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,537
Let's kill the Beast

1020
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,439
- Pardon me, master.
- Leave me in peace.

1021
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,082
But sir, the castle is under attack.

1022
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,275
Kilf the Beast

1023
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,090
- Kilf the Beast
- This isn't working.

1024
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:29,673
Lumiere, we must do something.

1025
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:32,148
Wait! I know.

1026
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,528
Kilf the Beast
Kilf the Beast

1027
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:38,152
What should we do, master?

1028
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:39,938
It doesn't matter now.

1029
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,146
Just let them come.

1030
01:08:42,484 --> 01:08:45,354
Kilf the Beast
Kilf the Beast

1031
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:47,252
Kilf the Beast

1032
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,202
Now!

1033
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:22,864
Yes!

1034
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,116
Here we go!

1035
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,074
What the devil?

1036
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:35,544
Belle, look out!

1037
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,731
You guys gotta try this thing.

1038
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,872
Up here, you scurvy scum!

1039
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,455
Now!

1040
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,835
And stay out!

1041
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:36,848
Get up.

1042
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,268
Get up!

1043
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,113
What's the matter, beast?

1044
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,020
Too kind and gentle to fight back?

1045
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,270
No!

1046
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,657
- Belle.
- No! Gaston, don't!

1047
01:12:07,957 --> 01:12:09,417
Let's go, Philippe.

1048
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:35,973
Come on out and fight.

1049
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:41,244
Were you in love with her, Beast?

1050
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:46,107
Did you honestly think she'd want you
when she had someone like me?

1051
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,254
It's over, Beast.

1052
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,096
Belle is mine!

1053
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,113
Let me go. Let me go!

1054
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,845
Please, don't hurt me.

1055
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,960
I'll do anything, anything!

1056
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,580
Get out.

1057
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,146
Beast!

1058
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,191
Belle!

1059
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:43,381
Belle.

1060
01:13:49,392 --> 01:13:51,352
You came back.

1061
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,259
You came back.

1062
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:36,232
Of course I came back.

1063
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,089
I couldn't let them...

1064
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:40,273
Oh, this is all my fault.

1065
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:42,339
If only I'd gotten here sooner.

1066
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:45,335
Maybe it's better...

1067
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,151
It's better this way.

1068
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,786
Don't talk like that.

1069
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:51,532
You'll be all right.

1070
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,131
We're together now.

1071
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:55,529
Everything's going to be fine,
you'll see.

1072
01:14:57,259 --> 01:15:01,859
At least I got to see you...

1073
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:04,831
..one last time.

1074
01:15:15,745 --> 01:15:17,885
No. No!

1075
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,707
Please.

1076
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:22,382
Please. Please don't leave me.

1077
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:27,815
I love you.

1078
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,382
Belle.

1079
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:09,887
It's me.

1080
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:26,714
It is you.

1081
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:01,365
Lumiere.

1082
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:03,233
Cogsworth!

1083
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,026
Mrs. Potts!

1084
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,013
Look at us!

1085
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,421
Mama, Mama!

1086
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,977
- My goodness.
- tis a miracle.

1087
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:30,394
L'amour.

1088
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,610
Well, Lumiere, old friend,
shall we let bygones be bygones?

1089
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,690
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.

1090
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,696
l beg your pardon, old friend.

1091
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:45,474
But I believe I told you.

1092
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,348
No, you didn't.
I told you.

1093
01:18:47,623 --> 01:18:51,102
You most certainly did not, you pompous
paraffin-headed pea brain.

1094
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,180
En garde, you overgrown pocket watch.

1095
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:56,326
Take that.
Stop shoving.

1096
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:02,799
Are they gonna live
happily ever after, Mama?

1097
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,079
Of course, my dear.

1098
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:07,485
Of course.

1099
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,450
Do I still have to sleep
in the cupboard?

1100
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:16,943
Certain as the sun

1101
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,905
Rising in the east

1102
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,341
Tale as old as time

1103
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:27,093
Song as old as rhyme

1104
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:30,246
Beauty and the Beast

1105
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:36,079
Tale as old as time

1106
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:39,225
Song as old as rhyme

1107
01:19:39,675 --> 01:19:44,305
Beauty and the Beast
