1
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,360
Earth, birthplace of the human race,

2
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,580
a species much like our own,

3
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,970
capable of great compassion

4
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,620
and great violence.

5
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,990
For in our quest to protect the humans,

6
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,010
a deeper revelation dawns.

7
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,140
Our worlds have met before.

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,890
NEST Seahawks approaching target.

9
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,980
Three minutes
until evacuation is complete, sir.

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,960
Chinese airspace has been locked
and sealed, one-mile radius.

11
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,120
All right, give NEST team the go.

12
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,950
Black Hawks, you're clear to land.

13
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,020
Any bad robot out there
better get ready for an ass-whupping.

14
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,000
For the last two years,
an advance team of new Autobots

15
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,260
has taken refuge here
under my command.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,300
Arcees, get ready to launch.

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,860
We're locked and loaded.

18
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,530
Together, we form an alliance
with the humans,

19
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,750
a secret but brave squad of soldiers.

20
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,660
All right, listen up. China's cover story
on this one is “toxic spill.”

21
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,970
They had to evac the area
for search and rescue.

22
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,420
This makes six enemy contacts
in eight months.

23
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,470
We gotta make sure this one does not
get out in the public eye, so keep it tight.

24
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,920
Move out! Let's go!

25
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,619
A classified strike team called NEST.

26
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,100
We hunt for what remains
of our Decepticon foes

27
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,130
hiding in different countries
around the globe.

28
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
All right, Ironhide.
We got echoes. Vamos.

29
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,240
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.

30
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,240
He's here. I smell him.

31
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,630
It's close. It's getting closer.

32
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,979
Right, everybody, be steady.
We're right on top of it.

33
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
Eagle niner!

34
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
I need an energy proton.

35
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,020
Panther 1, requesting fire mission now!

36
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,530
Gunships on station. Roll in hot!

37
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,349
Dog 1, now we are engaging.

38
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,530
We got a second Decepticon.

39
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,950
Arcee twins! Target coming your way!

40
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,310
I got him, I got him!

41
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,890
I screwed that up. I'm okay. I'm all right.

42
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,180
-This is combat, man.
-Total brain freeze, man.

43
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,390
What's wrong with you?

44
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,550
Bring in Sideswipe!

45
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,810
Clear a path!

46
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
Damn, I'm good!

47
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,359
Air support, we need Big Buddha
to deliver the drop now!

48
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,869
Cyclone 98, final attack hitting in 120.

49
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,790
Clear to drop in
five, four, three, two, one.

50
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,800
Autobots, I'm in pursuit!

51
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,950
Pull over!

52
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Punk-ass Decepticon!

53
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,280
Any last words?

54
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,760
This is not your planet to rule!

55
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,239
The Fallen shall rise again.

56
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,380
That doesn't sound good.

57
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
Not today.

58
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Come on, let's go! All hands on deck!

59
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,400
Frankie, Mojo, out!
Come on, kiddo, we're on a schedule.

60
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,900
Slow down, Dad. Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?

61
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,489
-Did you rent the room out?
-No, I got other ideas for your room

62
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,670
and it rhymes with "home theatre.”

63
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,000
Look what I found.
It's your little baby booties.

64
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,360
-Ma.
-My little baby-bootie boy.

65
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,349
-You can't go.
-You see this, Dad? This is how

66
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
you're supposed to react
when the fruit of your loins

67
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,930
goes out into the cruel world
to fend for himself, okay?

68
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,349
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!

69
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,090
You have to come home every holiday,
not just big ones.

70
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,319
You have to come home for Halloween.

71
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,689
Well, I can't
come home for Halloween, Mom.

72
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,110
-Well, then we'll come to you.
-You're not coming.

73
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,340
-No, we're not going anywhere.
-We'll dress up.

74
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,640
We'll be in costumes.
You'll never know it's us.

75
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,210
-You can't do that, Mom.
-Would you let the kid breathe,

76
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,990
for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.

77
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,540
There's no way you're packed
for a month-long trip.

78
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,540
Come on, chop, chop!
Let's go. March, young lady.

79
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,439
-Dad.
-I love it when you call me "young lady,”

80
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,470
-you dirty old man.
-You ain't seen nothing yet.

81
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,520
-Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
-What?

82
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm watching what you're doing, Dad.
It's not a rap video.

83
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
It's just like a coach thing.

84
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,140
That was
a really creepy move just now, Dad.

85
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,760
Look. You know, your mother and me
are really proud of you.

86
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,470
You're the first Witwicky
ever to go to college.

87
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,930
Now I'm crying again! This sucks!

88
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,950
You're gonna be okay, Ma.

89
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,470
You know, it's just going to be,

90
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,570
you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,

91
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,810
going out to handle the world
on his own.

92
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,130
-You okay, Pop?
-Yeah.

93
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,620
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

94
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,810
Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!

95
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,000
You'll see a lot of that in college, too.

96
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,990
-What are you talking about, Dad?
-There's gonna be a lot of women there.

97
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,810
Yeah, well,
I'm a one-woman kind of guy.

98
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
Look, Mikaela's the greatest,

99
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,690
but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?

100
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,970
You're no different
than any other couple your age.

101
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,140
Except we discovered
an alien race together.

102
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,640
How long you gonna be riding
that scooter?

103
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,910
Dad, listen, ! know what the odds are.
We're the exception, okay?

104
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,750
Wait a second. Who could that be?

105
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,699
In two weeks, it could be Muffy.

106
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,010
Hey, beautiful.

107
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,160
-I'm breaking up with you, Sam.
-Really?

108
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,710
You sure?
I’m not hearing a lot of conviction.

109
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,940
Well, l am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.

110
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,380
Wow, you almost sounded serious
that time.

111
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,010
Guess what? I made you
a long-distance relationship kit.

112
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,510
Yeah, I got you a webcam,
so we can chat 247.

113
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,860
All Witwicky, all the time.

114
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,800
And I got you a couple souvenirs
from the event

115
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,130
that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.

116
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,270
-Some mixes and candles and stuff.
-Sounds cute. I can't wait.

117
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,780
Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?

118
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,940
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

119
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,560
Yeah. Of course, I kept it, Mikaela.

120
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,520
It's like my Super Bowl jersey.
I bled in this thing.

121
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,050
-Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
-No, it's not that.

122
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,470
It's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.

123
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,610
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

124
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,390
You really should come with me.

125
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,070
They got cheap apartments
near Campus.

126
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,340
Well, that's not gonna happen
until 1 get my man-child father,

127
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,090
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.

128
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,410
l heard that.
Where'd you put the clutch covers?

129
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
-Next to the camshafts.
-I love it when you say “camshafts.”

130
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,990
Whisper it to me.

131
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,070
Camshafts.

132
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,180
Why can’t I hate you?

133
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,890
It's my Witwicky charm.

134
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,720
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.

135
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,420
I guess we're not breaking up.
I'll be over in 20.

136
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,930
Mikaela, I think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.

137
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,500
Sam?

138
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,270
There's a fire!

139
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,339
Dad, we got a fire!

140
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,620
Fire!

141
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,650
Ron, did you know
it was gonna be this hard?

142
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,339
Can you just stop?

143
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,880
Yeah, okay, I'll stop. You carry this shit!

144
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,209
-Wow.
-Do you know what?

145
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,490
-What?
-I don't want to go anywhere with you.

146
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,700
I don't wanna go to France with you.

147
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,219
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

148
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,560
-I'm going back inside.
-All right, fine.

149
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,670
I'll call you from Paris.

150
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,830
What is all the racket?

151
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,069
Sam?

152
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,300
Dad!

153
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,449
-What was that?
-That's the whole kitchen!

154
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,720
-Bumblebee... Oh, my...
-Bumblebee!

155
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,199
-911.
-Bumblebee!

156
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,170
-Get in the garage. Go!
-What the freak just happened?

157
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,100
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.

158
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,939
Holy Mother!

159
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,520
-Oh, my God!
-Whatever.

160
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,780
Get in the garage now!

161
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,640
-Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
-Dogs out! Get the dogs out!

162
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,090
This is it! Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?

163
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,640
My house is on fire!

164
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,920
-...very important.
-What happened?

165
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,210
Come here. Listen, I need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.

166
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,850
-What's going on?
-Just take it.

167
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,660
-Sam Witwicky? A word with you.
-Yes, Mom. Yeah.

168
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,780
-Hi, Mikaela. I have a bald spot.
-Hi.

169
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
-An old furnace, I think.
-From a waffle iron.

170
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,500
When you go, he goes. I cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!

171
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,210
Judy... National security.

172
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,580
Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.

173
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,890
Just consider this
the official start of our remodel, okay?

174
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,920
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool and a hot tub!

175
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,430
And I'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!

176
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,270
-Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
-He still having voice problems?

177
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
He's playing it up.

178
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,750
Bee, I want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?

179
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,900
I’m so excited and I just can't hide it

180
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,150
Hey, I'm not taking you with me.

181
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I'm gonna wait outside, okay?

182
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,660
I meant to tell you about this earlier.

183
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,950
It's just that, you know...
Here's the thing.

184
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,180
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.

185
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,050
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

186
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,830
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.

187
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,930
I mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.

188
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,750
This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.

189
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Can you just look at me, please?

190
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,189
Come on, big guy.
Look, the guardian thing is done.

191
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,480
Okay? You did your job.
Look, I'm safe now.

192
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,990
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.

193
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,200
I just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why I'm going to college,

194
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,469
and I can't do that with you.

195
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,300
It's not the last time I'm gonna see you,
you know, Bee.

196
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,830
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

197
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,969
But you'll always be my first car.

198
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,520
Love you, Bee.

199
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,150
Wow!

200
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.

201
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,740
-You got dirt all over you.
-Stop. Stop.

202
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,260
-What?
-Stop, I'm okay.

203
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,680
Look.

204
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,740
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?

205
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,020
You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.

206
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,890
-And?
-And I'll do anything for you.

207
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,970
And?

208
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,800
-l think Sam's about to say the L-word.
-Let's go, kiddo!

209
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,110
Nice timing, Dad.

210
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,040
l adore you.

211
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,430
That's not the word that I want

212
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,870
-to hear right now.
-What are you talking about?

213
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,060
It's the same word as the other word.

214
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,680
-It's not the same word.
-Look, if l say the other word now

215
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,260
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything, plus

216
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,410
you haven't said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.

217
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,930
Yeah, but I haven't said it because guys
always run when you Say it first.

218
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,410
Yeah, well, so do girls.
Especially girls like you, with options.

219
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,360
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?

220
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,030
-It can be.
-I hate that it's working.

221
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,920
Can I have a kiss?

222
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,580
We're going to make it work, I promise.

223
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,010
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.

224
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,210
Retrieve it.

225
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,670
Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.

226
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,590
Bad-ass ice-cream truck
coming through.

227
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,460
-Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
-No, I don't...

228
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,700
-Hold up.
-Those are nice.

229
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,290
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

230
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,679
Yes, sir. Yeah!
Look here, it's my booty call right here!

231
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,430
-Time to get my sexy on with the green.
-Green? No, green is mine!

232
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,120
I call green!

233
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,379
-I got the green.
-That hurt, man.

234
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,460
It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass-kicking.

235
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,409
Present arms!

236
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,470
Director Galloway, what an honour.
I'd love to show you around,

237
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,100
but you gotta be
on the classified access list.

238
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,530
lam now. Presidential order, Major.

239
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,380
I got a message
for your classified space buddies!

240
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,550
You guys made a mess of Shanghai.

241
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,560
All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS

242
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,670
and this area serves
as the Autobots’ hangar.

243
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,940
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.

244
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,659
Secure line to
the Pentagon is now open.

245
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,490
-General?
-Will, 1 saw the Shanghai op.

246
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,060
-We had a rough day out there.
-Yes, sir.

247
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,860
We have intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief.

248
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,060
Now with your permission,
! can't let you see him,

249
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
but I would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.

250
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,629
Proceed.

251
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,980
You gotta wonder,

252
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,090
if God made us in his image,
who made him?

253
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,459
General, our alliance
has countermanded

254
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,010
six Decepticon incursions this year,

255
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,570
each on a different continent.

256
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,450
They're clearly searching
around the world for something,

257
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,690
but last night's encounter
came with a warning.

258
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,440
"The Fallen shall rise again.”

259
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,730
“The Fallen.” Meaning what?

260
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,960
Origin unknown.
The only recorded history of our race

261
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,990
was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.

262
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,860
Excuse me!

263
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,629
With this so-called AllSpark
now destroyed,

264
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,220
why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?

265
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,650
Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.

266
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,530
The President just appointed him liaison.

267
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,100
Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.

268
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,860
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.

269
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,420
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

270
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,640
After all the damage in Shanghai,

271
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,220
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

272
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,170
Now, under the classified Alien‘Autobot
Cooperation Act,

273
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,480
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

274
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,530
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

275
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,060
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good.

276
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,980
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

277
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,120
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

278
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,770
in the field for two years.

279
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,780
We've shed blood,
sweat and precious metal together.

280
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,560
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.

281
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,290
Don't tempt me.

282
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,659
And the newest members of your team.

283
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,000
-Easy.
-l understand they arrived here

284
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,939
after you sent a message into space,

285
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,400
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.

286
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,080
Let me stop you right there,
Mr Galloway. It was vetted right here.

287
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,899
And in my experience, the judgement
of both Major Lennox and his team

288
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,900
has always been above reproach.

289
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,669
Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President

290
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,750
that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.

291
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,179
Now, what do we know so far?

292
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,040
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,

293
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,820
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,

294
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,149
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.

295
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,450
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

296
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,649
is locked in an electromagnetic vault

297
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,770
here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.

298
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,159
Decepticons, we have located the shard.

299
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,560
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

300
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,710
well, there's only one clear conclusion!

301
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,510
You! The Autobots!

302
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,570
They're here to hunt you!

303
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,470
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

304
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,300
“The Fallen shall rise again"?

305
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,540
It sounds to me
like something's coming.

306
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,920
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

307
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,649
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

308
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,540
will you leave peacefully?

309
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,070
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honour it.

310
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,120
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

311
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,950
What if we leave and you're wrong?

312
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,400
That's a good question.

313
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,560
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!

314
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,730
I feel smarter already.

315
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,270
-Ron, can you smell it?
-Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.

316
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,490
-Hey, cheapo!
-Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.

317
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,020
Just go ahead and check out your room.

318
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,150
Yeah, go.

319
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,310
-Hey.
-Hey.

320
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,020
-You must be Sam, right? I'm Leo.
-Hey.

321
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,340
So, I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

322
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,879
-That side.
-l already chose that side.

323
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,110
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

324
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,850
Yeah, see,
you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy.

325
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,169
I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.

326
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,730
Balanced, unmedicated,
nothing under the crawl space.

327
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,120
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.

328
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,229
No criminal record, won't steal anything.

329
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,740
-Including girlfriends.
-Especially girlfriends.

330
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,890
-You got a girlfriend?
-Il do. You?

331
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,210
No, not a chance. You a techie?

332
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,459
Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?

333
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,690
-Server's almost online, Leo.
-Network's up and running.

334
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,230
Beautiful, that's what I like to hear.

335
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,970
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder,
my IT gurus.

336
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,030
Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheRealEffingDeal.com.

337
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,530
That's me, I'm sure you've heard of it.

338
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,790
-No, I haven't.
-Well, that sucks.

339
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,390
-What is all this for?
-See where I'm going, bro.

340
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,130
Look, call me gross,
I want to be a baby billionaire.

341
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,629
Kitten calendars.
That's where I started. Look at me now.

342
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,050
Got to have dreams, bro.

343
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,459
Leo! We got
some brand-new Shanghai vid!

344
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,370
Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!

345
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
-What's "FTJ"?
-"Fuel the Jet.”

346
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,240
Fuel the Jet, bro.

347
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
FTJ. FTJ, legit!

348
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,980
Did you see that? Did you see that?

349
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,300
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak.”

350
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Don't believe the hype, bro.

351
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,090
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

352
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,560
Yeah, I saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

353
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,810
and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...

354
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,840
-It looks fake to me.
-Dude, it's not fake.

355
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,760
The Internet is pure truth.
Video doesn't lie.

356
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,530
-It looks fake.
-No, man, I've seen them.

357
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,540
-They're, like, these robots...
-Look, look, it's fake.

358
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,230
Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?

359
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,200
And I wasn't there,

360
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,410
-so I can't comment or speculate.
-No.

361
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,620
“Comment or speculate"?
And we're supposed to cohabitate?

362
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,450
No, listen, okay?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro!

363
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,280
-Which sack?
-The ball sack.

364
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,860
Dude, what kind of tool are you?

365
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,679
Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?

366
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,080
-It's aliens, man.
-Okay, okay.

367
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,490
Follow me.

368
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,490
Leo, bad news!

369
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,680
We just got scooped.
The video's already up on GFR.

370
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,300
Fassbinder!

371
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,530
Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.

372
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,560
“Effing" was my F-ing idea
and he stole it!

373
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,020
He's been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.

374
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,360
By the way, I read your file.
I'm poor, you're poor.

375
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,390
We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.

376
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,790
I work for you now? That's incredible.

377
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,610
It's first day of college,
I got a career in a dinky Internet firm

378
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,570
with a boss who is made up
of just pure champion stuff.

379
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,680
Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?

380
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,260
That's your one warning patrolling,
dude. Don't make me

381
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,920
have Fassbinder hack your financial aid,
‘cause I'll do it!

382
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,940
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little
intense in my room. Can I switch out?

383
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,470
Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?

384
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,030
-Oh, here we go.
-We made it. Hi.

385
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,220
It's just like Hogwarts.

386
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,420
-Hi.
-Is this co-ed?

387
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,720
This is a co-ed dorm.

388
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,220
-You guys want to meet my roommates?
-Yeah.

389
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,530
Some real swell guys.

390
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,879
-Here's Leo.
-We're the Witwickys.

391
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,030
-I'm Leo.
-I'm Judy.

392
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,780
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.

393
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,220
-Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
-Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma.

394
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,540
What is that in your hand, by the way?

395
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,200
I got this at the bake sale for the
environment that those boys are having.

396
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,220
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.

397
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,970
-Mom?
-Yeah, it's 100% pure,

398
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,570
Hawaiian green for the environment.

399
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,100
-How many of these have you eaten?
-Drop it.

400
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,010
-What is this?
-Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it.

401
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,439
-No, it's...
-Please, give me...

402
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,470
Hey! It's my cheat day.
I can eat what I want.

403
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,409
I'm going to freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

404
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,730
Please do something right now.

405
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,200
I can eat all the fricking brownies I want!

406
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,390
Come on, let's go.

407
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,830
I'm sorry and you're welcome.

408
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,560
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55.”

409
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,300
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and
stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.

410
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,750
Is... Is so nice...

411
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,910
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

412
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,700
She's tied for number one
on my to-do list.

413
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,360
Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me?

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,260
Pretty girls! Hey, you.
My son lives in this dorm.

415
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,540
You should go make friends with him.
He's Sam.

416
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,080
Glad she ain't my mama!

417
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,139
And he recently had his cherry popped!

418
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,449
He didn't know I was in the house!
I heard it all!

419
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,129
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Here he is!

420
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,440
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice!

421
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,830
-Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
-No, like the GPS. OnStar!

422
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,150
-OnStar.
-Frisbee!

423
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,960
No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?

424
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,430
-Give it! Mine, mine, mine!
-Hey! Crazy!

425
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,710
-You want it?
-I want it.

426
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,920
Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down.

427
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
-You gotta control your mother.
-I don't know who this woman is.

428
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,930
Hey, Professor, I'd do anything for an A.

429
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,710
All right, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.

430
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,540
-Did you get the booties? All right.
-Yes, Dad, I got the booties!

431
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,520
I'm upside down!

432
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,680
Black Lion X-Ray,
this is Black Lion Tango.

433
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,190
We have activation of motion sensors
on the western perimeter fence.

434
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,130
Breach at B-14.

435
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,220
Go, go, go, go!

436
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,790
The shard's gone.

437
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,409
Contact!

438
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,660
Take it down!

439
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,830
-Which way?
-Shoot left!

440
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,689
Knock it down!

441
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,970
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.

442
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,729
So, get your game faces on.

443
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,790
I can't stay long.
I have a webcam date with my girlfriend.

444
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,129
-That's so cool!
-No, it's not.

445
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,760
While he's making out
with his MacBook,

446
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,649
I'm gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on.

447
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,780
-Let's roll.
-She's hot.

448
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,659
Bro, we're hunting!

449
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,780
-See you, darling.
-Bye, Dad.

450
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,960
Okay.

451
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,670
This is our first live chat date.
I've never done it before.

452
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,199
I'm kind of nervous.

453
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,800
-Are you okay?
-No.

454
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,290
l was getting a napkin for my drink.

455
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,590
Thanks. Cheers.

456
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,680
-It's Sam, right?
-Yeah.

457
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,050
-I wanna dance.
-What, like... Like dancing?

458
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,240
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?

459
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,639
‘Cause I'm in a permanently semi...
I'm in a relationship, kind of...

460
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,020
-Relax. I just want to have some fun.
-Wanna have some fun?

461
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,889
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there and...

462
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,070
Oh, my...

463
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,330
So, how about tonight
you pretend I'm your girlfriend

464
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,629
and I pretend that you're my boyfriend?

465
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,190
Hey! Who drove
the freaking yellow Camaro?

466
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,620
There is a car on the lawn!

467
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,580
What are you doing?

468
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,030
Houston, we have a probiem.

469
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,190
-What is it?
-Freshman!

470
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,660
-Yeah?
-ls that your car in our bushes?

471
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,180
No, there's a friend of mine,
he just went to get you a tighter shirt.

472
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,000
There isn't a tighter shirt! We checked.

473
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,770
Now how about
I park my foot in your ass?

474
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,440
-What size shoe do you wear?
-Yeah?

475
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,370
-Hold on.
-You wanna try?

476
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,100
-I'll back it up right now.
-Get him out of here.

477
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,800
You have a ride?
Bro, why are you holding out on us?

478
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,140
I've only known you 17 hours.

479
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,270
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.

480
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,340
-l love Camaros.
-I can't do this right now, okay?

481
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,500
-Don't be a wimp.
-Oh, God!

482
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,340
-My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
-Yeah?

483
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Fuel-injected.
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.

484
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,470
We shouldn't stare...

485
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,750
I mean, share stories
with each other at all.

486
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,169
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.

487
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,620
Your cheatin’ heart

488
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,820
Don't. Don't!

489
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,360
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky

490
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,430
-ls your radio broken?
-No, my concentration is.

491
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,350
We're not cheating.

492
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,900
Not yet.

493
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,960
Is something wrong here?

494
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,910
God! You okay?

495
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,790
She's mighty, mighty

496
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,779
I really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...

497
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,790
Oh, God! It's in my mouth!

498
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,160
Are you okay? I got Wetnaps.

499
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,440
I got Wetnaps for your face! Hold on!

500
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,550
I... I'm so sorry!

501
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,150
What are you doing?

502
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,670
You won't give me a day, huh?

503
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,290
-You won't give me one day in college?
-I'm sorry, Sam,

504
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,530
but the last fragment of the AllSpark
was stolen.

505
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,580
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?

506
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,250
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,

507
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,150
but I'm here for your help, Sam,

508
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,279
because your leaders believe we
brought vengeance upon your planet.

509
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,560
Perhaps they are right.

510
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,160
That is why they must be reminded by
another human of the trust we share.

511
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,120
-This isn't my war.
-Not yet,

512
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,450
but I fear it soon will be.

513
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,820
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

514
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,120
Whole generations lost.

515
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,600
I know, and I want to help you, I do,

516
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,640
but l am not some alien ambassador,
you know?

517
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,590
I'm a normal kid with normal problems.

518
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,830
lam where I'm supposed to be.

519
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,080
I'm sorry. l...

520
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,820
I really am.

521
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,230
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

522
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,830
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

523
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,850
We do, more than you know.

524
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,650
Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214, and possible hostile,

525
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,080
confirmed for
Project Deep Six Drop Point.

526
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,680
-What do you got?
-SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,

527
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,090
diving fast.

528
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,040
Never seen anything
dive that deep that fast.

529
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,310
-Man battle stations.
-Chief of the watch, man battle stations!

530
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,380
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead two-thirds.

531
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,990
-Left full rudder, two-thirds.
-Dive, go deep.

532
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,420
The nets protecting NBE One
- -
are screaming, SIr.

533
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,060
That is 9,300 fathoms down.
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?

534
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,390
-None, sir.
-Then, people, we've got a problem!

535
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,870
Need parts! Kill the little one!

536
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,310
The shard make Energon!

537
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,700
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts,
and they're coming up fast!

538
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,120
-Sound collision alarm.
-Left hard rudder.

539
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,990
Five hundred feet.

540
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,770
Angel Six,
we got six hostiles coming up.

541
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,220
-Collision imminent port side.
-One hundred feet.

542
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,430
Brace for impact.

543
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,930
Starscream, I'm home.

544
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,640
Lord Megatron, I was so relieved
to hear of your resurrection.

545
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,830
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.

546
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,510
Only to help spawn our new army.
The Fallen decrees it!

547
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,779
After all, in your absence,
someone had to take command.

548
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,000
-So disappointing.
-Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile!

549
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,920
Even in death,
there is no command but mine.

550
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,020
My master, I failed you on Earth.

551
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,259
The AllSpark is destroyed
and without it, our race will perish.

552
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,470
You have much to learn, my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel.

553
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,290
Its power, its knowledge,
can never be destroyed.

554
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,660
-It can only transform.
-How is that possible?

555
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,300
It has been absorbed
by the human child.

556
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,010
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

557
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,730
Well, then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body!

558
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,149
And you will, my apprentice, in time.

559
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,100
For millennia, ! have dreamed
of my return to that wretched planet

560
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,350
where I, too, was once betrayed
by the Primes I called my brothers.

561
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,680
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now, only one remains.

562
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,640
Optimus! He protects the boy.

563
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,890
Then the boy will lead us to him

564
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,960
-and revenge will be ours.
-Yes.

565
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,110
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

566
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,870
Without more Energon,
the hatchlings will keep dying.

567
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,410
Space. Time. Gravity.

568
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,310
-Thank you.
-Finish that for me.

569
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,150
We're going on a journey together,
you and lI, today.

570
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,770
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

571
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,690
And I shall be your consort, your guide,

572
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,490
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

573
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,330
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

574
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,600
For what do we know about the stars?

575
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,440
Virgo, the virgin.

576
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,500
Orion, the great hunter.

577
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,700
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

578
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,280
No, they are dynamos

579
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,540
filled with a throbbing,
savage and pent-up energy!

580
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,940
Behold the work of Albert Einstein,
a professor once, like moi.

581
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,940
-Energy equals mass...
-What you doing?

582
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,390
Put your hand down.
Put your hand down.

583
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,670
Young man, there are no questions

584
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,690
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

585
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,810
I just finished your book and there's
only one problem. Einstein's wrong.

586
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,040
Energy does equal
mass times the velocity

587
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,190
of light squared in this dimension,

588
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,890
but what about the other 17? We haven't
even talked about the other 17.

589
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,240
Clear example.

590
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,120
Break down the elemental components
of Energon,

591
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,460
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...

592
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,030
Fourteen galactic convergences it took

593
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,300
the Sentinel Prime expedition
to receive an... Echo on its signal,

594
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,450
you wind up with a formula
for inter-dimensional energy increase

595
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,950
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain.

596
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,129
Come on, guys, I can't be
the only one in the class who...

597
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Young man, I will not be
punk’d in front of the dean.

598
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,200
No, this is my universe here.

599
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,210
Do you understand?
lam the alpha and the omega.

600
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,950
-Get out of my class!
-Yes, sir.

601
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,370
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

602
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,509
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi.
You're such a good boy.

603
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,580
What a good boy, you are.

604
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,480
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?

605
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,919
Come on, check that out.

606
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,480
There you go.

607
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,439
-Yes, Samuel?
-Hello? Mikaela?

608
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,930
I can't believe you're gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.

609
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,670
-Something just happened to me, okay?
-What, you finally hit puberty?

610
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,450
No, no, no. Stop laughing.
This is serious. Okay.

611
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,160
Remember I was telling you
about my great-great-grandfather,

612
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,950
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?

613
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,839
Watch it, watch it, watch... No!
Okay, remember how I was telling you...

614
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,210
Okay. Can you stop?
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

615
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,430
Mikaela, okay,

616
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,390
my great-great-grandfather
went on this Arctic mission, right?

617
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,049
And he saw Megatron.
Megatron zapped him,

618
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,900
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols. Okay.

619
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,390
Well, now I'm seeing them, too.
Excuse me.

620
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,710
I just read a 903-page astronomy book
in 32.6 seconds.

621
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,240
I had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

622
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,300
lam seeing symbols ever since I...

623
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,089
-Since what?
-Ever since I touched the Cube splinter.

624
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,359
-Do you have it?
-Yeah, I have it.

625
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,910
-It's in the shop safe. It's fine.
-Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?

626
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,740
-Don't touch it.
-I'm not gonna touch it.

627
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,569
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away.

628
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,800
-No one knows where it is.
-I do!

629
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,370
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.

630
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,390
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.

631
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,600
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

632
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,320
What are you looking at, slobber puss?

633
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,610
What the... This place is
a freaking house of horrors!

634
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,580
Pain... It hurts...

635
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,080
Hold on.

636
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
Right to five, then...

637
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,740
Is that the best you got, huh?
Is that the best you can do?

638
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,310
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

639
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,779
That's my eye, you crazy bitch!

640
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,740
-You gonna talk now?
-l seek knowledge from the Cube.

641
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,790
-The Fallen demands me!
-What knowledge?

642
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,250
You got the shard, I need the shard.
Give me the shard. I need the shard.

643
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,779
They're gonna whack me!
I'm gonna be dead without that shard!

644
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,790
Easy, warrior goddess,
I'm just a little salvage-scrap drone!

645
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,979
-And I'm your worst nightmare.
-Hey, hey, hey!

646
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,630
-What the hell was that?
-I'll tell you later,

647
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,180
just not on an open phone line, okay?

648
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,310
I'm gonna get on a plane right now

649
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,340
and Ill be there later this afternoon.
Just be careful, Sam.

650
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,820
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

651
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,709
Yeah, a live bomb!

652
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,050
-No.
-Good.

653
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,610
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!

654
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,160
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir!

655
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,210
-As in how many?
-Unclear, sir.

656
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,759
Well, get clear.

657
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,870
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.

658
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,190
They're not answering our calls

659
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,730
and they're heading to
New York and Philadelphia.

660
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,670
All right, full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

661
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,890
Move it!

662
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,000
Let's go!

663
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,799
Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.

664
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,790
Alicia, mi amor, can I interest you
in an 18-inch Zookeeper's special?

665
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,380
Extra-large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping.

666
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,480
Basically, I've got,
like, 18 inches of meat.

667
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,970
Unless you're vegetarian.
All right. It's cool. 1 am, too.

668
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,130
-Sam home?
-Sam? I think he died,

669
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,680
but why don't we check?

670
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,500
-Here we are.
-Hey!

671
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,780
You ever have a song stuck
in your head? It's like

672
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,650
the worst song ever,
but you can't help to whistle it or sing it

673
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,050
‘cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats
itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?

674
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,350
Kitten calendar,
kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

675
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,839
-kitten calendar...
-Dude, what the eff?

676
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,830
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

677
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,879
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.

678
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,529
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good.

679
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,550
This is the part that...

680
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,340
Okay, what were you saying?

681
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,400
Alice, I'm horrified you had to see this.
Let's go.

682
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,000
Get out.

683
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,819
Wait, wait, wait!
Can I just sit and watch?

684
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,870
ll... I'll eat my pizza quietly.

685
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,660
Sam, I knew there was
something special about you.

686
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,160
Really?

687
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,580
And I know you know what happens

688
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,380
when two people in the know
get together.

689
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,540
They're genuinely amazing in bed.

690
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,910
Thank you.

691
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,620
All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries.

692
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,130
-Flag on the play. Okay. I'm very ticklish.
-We have needs, Sam. Relax.

693
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,850
Jeez!

694
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,430
What about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

695
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,299
-You are very aggressive.
-Just relax.

696
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,730
You want some turkey meatloaf?

697
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,920
Sam?

698
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,420
-Mikaela!
-ls that your girlfriend?

699
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,750
Ex.

700
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,690
Mikaela! Wait!

701
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,290
I can explain...

702
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,959
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...

703
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,270
All right, come on.

704
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,810
-She's coming!
-She's an alien robot! You gotta move.

705
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,160
-ls this real?
-Just run!

706
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,850
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe
l almost had sex with her in my dream!

707
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,720
I can tell
that you really missed me a lot, Sam!

708
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,160
-Look, it's not my fault, okay?
-It's not your fault?

709
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,590
Listen! Listen, I'm a victim!

710
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,960
-You were a victim? Of what?
-Yeah.

711
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,740
-Of what, a little 80-pound girl?
-Of... Of molestation.

712
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,480
It was like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox!

713
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,880
You didn't have to put your tongue
in her mouth!

714
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,060
-I didn't! Look!
-You did!

715
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,380
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?

716
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,430
It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!

717
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,690
-Like a diesel-y tinge to it!
-You're such a little girl!

718
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,740
We're gonna have
10 seconds of silence right now.

719
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,090
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.

720
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,860
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?

721
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,259
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.
You have three seconds left.

722
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,690
You know what?
You can give me the silent treatment

723
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,390
all you want,
but you can't keep me from talking.

724
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,210
-What were you gonna say?
-I hope you had a lot of fun,

725
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,060
because this, this is over.

726
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,390
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?

727
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,650
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies

728
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,420
are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They're growing right now, probably!

729
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,190
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!

730
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,509
Who are you?

731
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,350
I'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? I'm the key to this.

732
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,130
The aliens,
they want me ‘cause of my site.

733
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,109
Whoa, guys, right there!

734
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,300
Run!

735
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,210
Mikaela!

736
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,040
Come on! We gotta move!

737
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,230
It's a bomb!

738
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,400
You've got to get that box!

739
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,630
-This way.
-What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!

740
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,400
Oh, my God, you know how to
hot-wire a car? That's so hot!

741
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,660
Drive, drive, drive!
She's right there! She's right there!

742
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,320
Come on, come on, come on.

743
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,000
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car!

744
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,450
Now!

745
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,279
Tongue!

746
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,240
Oh, my God!

747
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,880
Kiss this, bitch!

748
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,839
Drive, drive, drive.

749
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,770
Okay, so what else
don't I know, all right?

750
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,080
Since you guys forgot to mention
some minor details.

751
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,730
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...

752
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,240
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Sam!

753
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,630
Sam!

754
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,120
-Sam!
-Hold on!

755
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,440
-Pull me up!
-Hold on!

756
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,410
Sam, get back in!

757
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,910
I don't want to die!
We're gonna die! Oh, my God!

758
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,150
Jesus! Jesus!

759
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,510
Come here, boy.

760
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,040
Closer.

761
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,890
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

762
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,150
You remember me, don't you?

763
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,590
I did what you said, okay?
Just don't hurt us.

764
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,040
Shut up!

765
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,970
Sam!

766
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,410
Yeah! Yes, yes.

767
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,990
It feels good to grab your flesh!

768
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,630
lam going to kill you slowly, painfully,

769
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,100
but first, we have
some delicate work to do.

770
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,220
How I could snap your limbs off!

771
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,759
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.

772
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,589
I'll scan you.
Let's take a look at your face.

773
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,900
I'm the doctor. The odd job. Information!

774
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,570
Yeah!

775
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,970
Beseeching my shard!

776
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,830
Easy or tough way?

777
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,570
-There they are.
-That's what I'm seeing in my head.

778
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,110
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

779
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,120
We must have the brain on the table!

780
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,819
-Chop, chop!
-Brain?

781
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,250
What does he mean by my brain?

782
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,970
Well, you have something on your mind,
something I need.

783
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,050
Hold on. I know you're pissed.
I know you're pissed

784
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,970
because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

785
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,470
If somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset, too.

786
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,890
I think that we have an opportunity here

787
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,910
to start anew
and develop our relationship

788
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,250
and see where it leads us, okay?

789
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,270
So, you just call Doctor Inspector off
and let's just talk for five seconds!

790
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,700
Wait, wait, wait!

791
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,090
-Come on! Go, go!
-Sam!

792
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,080
Go, go, go!

793
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,370
Sam!

794
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,890
Run!

795
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,020
Go, go, go, go!

796
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,260
Here he comes!

797
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,150
Hide, Sam!

798
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,780
Weak!

799
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,600
Puny! Waste of metal!

800
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,870
Junkyard crap!

801
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,180
Decepticons!

802
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,250
Come here, boy.

803
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,009
There is another source of
Energon hidden on this planet.

804
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,230
The boy could lead us to it.

805
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,950
Optimus!

806
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,300
Is the future of our race not worth
a single human life?

807
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,160
-Up! Get up!
-You'll never stop at one!

808
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,630
I'll take you all on!

809
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,940
Piece of tin!

810
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,420
Sam! Where are you?

811
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,190
No!

812
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,180
You're so weak!

813
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,240
The last Prime is dead!

814
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,820
Sam, run. Run.

815
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,620
Autobots, attack!

816
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,320
Bumblebee, get them out of here!

817
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,540
This is Lennox.

818
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,650
-That went well.
-We've lost the boy, Master.

819
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,299
The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.

820
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,259
I can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?

821
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,730
-One insect among seven billion!
-Shut up!

822
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,319
He could be anywhere.

823
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,549
Then we will force them
to find him for us!

824
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,160
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

825
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,230
No more disguises. No mercy!

826
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,000
The time has come
for my master's arrival.

827
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,750
Decepticons, mobilise. It is time.

828
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,129
Speaking French is so exciting!

829
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,920
Oh, God, who is this?

830
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,280
Hello? I mean, bonsoir!

831
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,710
-What? Who is this?
-Where is the boy?

832
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,540
For Pete's sakes. I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.

833
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,350
Jeez!

834
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,700
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.

835
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,090
Would you get out of here?

836
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,210
I didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.

837
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,640
I want to try new things.

838
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,880
Looks like Canadian goose poop.

839
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,640
It's nasty.

840
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,930
Revenge is mine.

841
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,370
Yeah!

842
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,480
..-definitely not a plane...

843
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,520
Look, carriers don't just sink.

844
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,470
..-@ horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...

845
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,839
Negative. NORAD confirmed,

846
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,740
projectile came from beyond our
atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots.

847
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,970
Citizens of the human hive,

848
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,280
your leaders have withheld the truth.

849
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,770
You are not alone in this universe.

850
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,400
We have lived among you, hidden,

851
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,080
but no more.

852
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,569
As you've seen,
we can destroy your cities at will,

853
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,670
unless you turn over this boy.

854
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:08,210
If you resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.

855
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,900
What we’re hearing
from the German government

856
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,580
is that the world broadcast
was a Satellite hacking.

857
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,840
The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,

858
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,810
which is the highest level
we have been at since 911.

859
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,810
President Obama
is being flown to a bunker

860
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,520
somewhere in the middie
of the United States

861
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,560
in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.

862
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,690
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.

863
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,070
Worldwide casualties
are in the neighbourhood of 7,000,

864
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,960
but that number could climb.

865
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,109
It's still too early to tell.

866
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,350
What we need to ask now is,
“Who and why?”

867
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,180
The FBI is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.

868
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,880
We believe they have information
about the attacks.

869
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,240
The FBI, CIA and Interpol

870
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,410
are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcement.

871
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,670
You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.

872
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,210
-They have a traffic-camera spotting...
-They have a picture of me, man.

873
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,480
We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we are wanted fugitives now!

874
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,870
I just need you to focus

875
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:02,950
-for one minute, man.
-Just stop.

876
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,629
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?

877
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,220
You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.

878
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,130
-Do you see this?
-What?

879
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,629
They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?

880
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,680
Okay, I'm not even with you guys!

881
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,880
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...

882
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,290
-Enough is...
-Yo, Leo!

883
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,580
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, I swear.

884
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,920
-That's ‘cause you is a wuss.
-You guys forced me into that car, right?

885
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,190
I think he's scared.

886
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,430
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?

887
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,920
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

888
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,460
and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what I mean?

889
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,180
-Not in my trunk.
-Yo, bumper cars? I'm hearing you.

890
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,460
Okay? I'm right here and I can hear you!

891
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,620
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

892
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,260
I've had a hell of a day!

893
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,510
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

894
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,820
Go whine to your boyfriend!

895
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,900
Listen, Sam, I know what I'm gonna do,
man. Look, I'm just going to go

896
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,149
to the authorities and tell them the truth.

897
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,230
Like, I had nothing to do with this.

898
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,560
-So, I'm not an accomplice.
-Hey, you wanted this, right?

899
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,030
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.

900
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,400
Wake up! You're in the middle of it!

901
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,600
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.

902
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,170
Stop complaining.

903
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,420
What is the meaning of this?

904
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,530
You dare point a gun at me?

905
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,000
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

906
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,330
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!

907
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,950
-Tell them to lower their weapons!
-Tell them first.

908
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,069
Tell them to lower their weapons.

909
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,960
Major, there's nothing I can do.
Talk to him.

910
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,860
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.

911
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,700
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations

912
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,040
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

913
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,400
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

914
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,230
Well, I'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

915
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,660
and I will raise you
a President of the United States.

916
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,270
I have operational command now.

917
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,380
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

918
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,089
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

919
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,130
The secret is out!

920
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,310
This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,

921
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,410
with a coordinated military strategy.

922
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,210
This fool is terribly misinformed.

923
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,800
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.

924
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,479
What we need is to draw up battle plans

925
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,550
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.

926
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,140
Like what, handing over the kid?

927
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,140
All options are being considered.

928
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,290
Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.

929
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,440
-There is no negotiating with them.
-I'm ordering you to stand down.

930
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,319
You won't be needing this any more.
Get your assets back to base!

931
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,580
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.

932
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,240
Let's go!

933
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,870
I really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.

934
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:50,540
Autobots, report to hangar for transport.

935
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,100
-lronhide, we should leave this planet.
-That's not what Optimus would want.

936
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,109
There's nothing
that you could have done.

937
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,520
-You okay?
-Yeah.

938
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,190
Bee, if you hate me, I understand.

939
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,720
I messed up. I'm sorry.

940
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,300
Young fella, you are the person
I care about most in my life.

941
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,400
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

942
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,050
He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead.

943
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,240
There's some things
you just can't change.

944
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,150
So, his sacrifice for us would
not have been in vain. Hallelujah!

945
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,810
I'm gonna make it right.
I'm going to turn myself in.

946
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,950
We... We've got to stick together.

947
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,800
-You're not going to do that.
-Yes, lam.

948
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,309
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!

949
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,099
-You two...
-Huh?

950
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,379
Hey, you know the glyphs?

951
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,670
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?

952
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,060
That's old school, yo.
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.

953
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,960
That's some serious stuff, right there.

954
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,730
They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.

955
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,349
Like a map to an Energon source!

956
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,370
-Can you read this?
-Read?

957
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,770
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.

958
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,800
If you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can.

959
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,519
Look who came sashaying back!

960
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,130
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.

961
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,940
I had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

962
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,179
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

963
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,980
I think I'm allowed that,
considering what I've been through.

964
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,670
I heard you have a problem.

965
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,440
-I think ! know someone who can help.
-Who?

966
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,820
Robo-Warrior.

967
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,450
This guy, Robo-Warrior,

968
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,640
everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

969
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,200
One time we revenge-hacked his site

970
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,129
and maybe I saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.

971
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,260
This is it. Yep.

972
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,500
Deli. Good front!

973
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,150
All right, wait here.
I'll give you the gosno go. All right?

974
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,210
Number 42, we got your kishka, knish,

975
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,230
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.

976
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:39,800
Cash only. Who's next?

977
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,810
I told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.

978
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,610
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

979
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,140
You... You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!

980
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,519
I'm like a ninja with a blade.
It's an art form.

981
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,770
Give me your money. Get out of here!

982
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,260
Hey, Sal! Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.

983
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,480
Robo-Warrior.

984
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,139
-Know him?
-I never heard of him.

985
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,440
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal.com?

986
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,940
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation

987
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,920
-with Game Boy-level security.
-Robo-Warrior.

988
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,790
It's him! It's him!
That's the guy right there! That's him!

989
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,360
No.

990
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,019
-You got to be kidding me.
-All right, meat store's closed!

991
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,360
-Everybody out! Out, right now!
-When he says to go,

992
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,050
-you go.
-That means you, lady, right now.

993
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,110
-Wait a minute. You know this guy?
-We're old friends.

994
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,349
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven,

995
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,960
got the kibosh, disbanded.

996
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,940
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

997
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,860
All ‘cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend.

998
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,929
-Look at her now, so mature.
-Moron! Where's the whitefish?

999
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,060
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.

1000
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,690
-Yakov!
-What?

1001
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,710
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around!

1002
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,550
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1003
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,700
-It's my dream.
-Help her out.

1004
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,430
You live with your mama?

1005
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,760
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.

1006
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,540
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

1007
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,870
-Yeah, I know.
-And NBE One's still kicking, huh?

1008
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,059
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1009
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,400
I don't know what you're hiding,
but I don't want anything to do with it.

1010
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,040
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish.

1011
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,540
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on, I need your help.

1012
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,090
Really? You need my help?

1013
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,690
I need...
Look, I am slowly losing my mind.

1014
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,450
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,

1015
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,470
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1016
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,220
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

1017
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,960
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1018
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,179
You said it projected images
off your brain?

1019
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,660
-Right.
-Meat locker, now!

1020
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,730
Dead pigs.

1021
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,780
What you're about to see is top secret.

1022
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,480
Do not tell my mother.

1023
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,480
-Swine flu. Not good.
-Now you know.

1024
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,290
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.

1025
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,800
Sad little story.

1026
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,019
An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?

1027
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,150
Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?

1028
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,990
Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1029
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,210
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1030
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,900
Okay, Cube-brain.

1031
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,610
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1032
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,080
Where'd you get these?

1033
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,410
Before I got fired,
I poached S-7's crown jewel,

1034
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:59,450
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1035
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,460
The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.

1036
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,259
How do I know?

1037
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,060
Archaeologists found
these unexplained markings

1038
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,219
in ancient ruins all over the world.

1039
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,640
China. Egypt. Greece.

1040
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,170
Shot in 1932.

1041
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,980
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1042
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,450
-Yeah.
-Same ones over here, right?

1043
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,840
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1044
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,929
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed.

1045
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,820
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1046
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,390
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.

1047
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,770
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1048
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:42,190
I pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1049
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,660
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,

1050
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,230
that ! was obsessed.

1051
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,070
Me. Can you imagine that?

1052
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,990
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1053
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,019
-On Earth. Another source?
-On Earth.

1054
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,740
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.

1055
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,630
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1056
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,040
No, no, no, the source is before them.

1057
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,790
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.

1058
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:03,990
It's before them.

1059
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,880
-So, it comes before them.
-Correct.

1060
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,040
Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1061
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,300
I mean,
I'm not on speaking terms with them.

1062
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,000
Actually, l am.

1063
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,880
Let me out!

1064
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,010
-This is going to be a little bit sad.
-Open it.

1065
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,690
I will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1066
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,300
Hey, behave!

1067
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,070
-What is it, a Decepticon?
-Yeah.

1068
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,870
-And you're training him?
-I'm trying to.

1069
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,180
I spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

1070
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,430
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1071
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,429
Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic ‘fro-head?

1072
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,470
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

1073
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,550
but, if you're a good boy,
then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1074
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,190
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.

1075
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,280
Just tell me
what these symbols are, please.

1076
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:53,830
All right.

1077
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,650
I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1078
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,090
I don't read it, but these guys...

1079
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,580
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1080
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,150
-Is this they?
-Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.

1081
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,730
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. I don't know what.

1082
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,150
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll
translate those symbols for you.

1083
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,600
-And I know where to find them.
-Show us.

1084
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,040
Yeah.

1085
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,440
The closest one's in Washington.

1086
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:29,130
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
Land of dreams in there.

1087
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,130
All l ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1088
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,990
-Hold those.
-What is that?

1089
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,870
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.

1090
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,100
So does Giambi, Jeter.
It's a baseball thing. Okay.

1091
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,600
Watches synchronised,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1092
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,490
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1093
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,390
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1094
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,610
It's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1095
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,400
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1096
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,150
Okay. Now, let's get this show
on the road.

1097
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,610
No, listen, I can't do this.

1098
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,490
I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
I'm not gonna do this.

1099
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,970
-Guards have guns. I don't want to die.
-Kid, kid, kid.

1100
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,820
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1101
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,380
Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.

1102
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,770
The museum is now closing.

1103
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,460
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro!
Ran out of toilet paper!

1104
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,960
You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.

1105
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,620
Sir! l suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed!

1106
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,190
Listen, man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1107
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,170
All right? Thumper dumper.
I got to go. All right.

1108
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,940
Sir, you are a grown,
naked man around children.

1109
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,820
-Pull your pants up and exit the building.
-I'm not going anywhere.

1110
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,910
-You got that paper, right, sir?
-You should be embarrassed.

1111
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,110
This is a family museum, sir.

1112
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,900
What is going on here?

1113
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,920
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?

1114
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,380
You are an amateur, man,
a rank amateur.

1115
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,219
We just downed five guards.
Five guards.

1116
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,960
-Get your stuff and get out of here.
-Give me a second here.

1117
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,679
I got to get the tracker, all right.

1118
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,990
-Be good.
-I'm claustrophobic.

1119
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,280
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.
He knows where he's going.

1120
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:39,980
-He knows something.
-What?

1121
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,110
He knows something.

1122
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:47,990
You got what I got?

1123
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,530
-Yeah.
-Blackbird.

1124
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,940
There he is.

1125
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,250
This guy's a legend,
like the Chairman of the Board!

1126
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,310
Yo, freshman, point the shard
and watch the magic happen.

1127
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,350
Shit. It's a Decepticon!

1128
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,630
-Decepticon?
-Decepticon?

1129
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,740
Behind the MiG now!

1130
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,290
What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?

1131
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,610
Answer me, pawns and knaves!

1132
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,730
Show yourselves
or suffer my infinite wrath!

1133
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,740
You little spinal-cord-based organisms!

1134
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,250
Bugger it!

1135
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,670
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!

1136
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,310
Prepare for remote systems override!

1137
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,780
-I tell you, this guy did not age well.
-I don't think he’s gonna hurt us.

1138
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,090
I command these doors to open.

1139
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,769
Fire! I said, fire!

1140
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,200
Bollocks!

1141
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,460
-Damn these worthless parts.
-Wait a second!

1142
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,730
Itchy, wretched rust in my arse!

1143
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,850
The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.

1144
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,690
We gotta catch that plane.

1145
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,440
-Right. I'm on a mission.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1146
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,580
-What do you want?
-Look, we just want to talk!

1147
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,390
I have no time to talk. I'm on a mission.

1148
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,380
I'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am I on?

1149
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,000
-Earth.
-Earth?

1150
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:32,490
Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."

1151
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:36,040
Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?

1152
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,920
-Who's winning?
-The Decepticons.

1153
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:42,000
-Well, I changed sides to the Autobots.
-What do you mean, changed sides?

1154
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,429
It's a choice.
It's an intensely personal decision.

1155
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,010
So much negativity.
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

1156
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,390
You mean you don't have to work

1157
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,000
for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1158
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,259
If Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.

1159
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,130
I'm changing sides. I'm changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.

1160
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,340
-Who's your little Autobot?
-You're cute.

1161
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,240
Name's Wheelie. Yeah.
Say my name, say my name.

1162
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,639
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1163
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:06,830
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1164
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,500
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.

1165
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,269
Can you just... Can you stop?

1166
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,669
-Hey, what are you doing?
-It's just something

1167
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,500
to think about. I won't argue with...
What were you saying?

1168
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,240
I told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.

1169
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,400
-Somebody shit the bed this morning.
-l have issues of my own.

1170
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,100
And it started with my mother!

1171
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,429
My ancestors
have been here for centuries.

1172
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,290
My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.

1173
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,610
-Do you know what he transformed into?
-No.

1174
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:32,830
Nothing!

1175
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,130
But he did so with honour,
dignity, damn it!

1176
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:43,990
Bollocks.

1177
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,259
My boosters are fried.

1178
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,450
I think we can help each other.

1179
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,100
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know, I do.

1180
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,520
I don't think he knows anything.
Honestly, I don't.

1181
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,520
I could do this all day.
It comes in waves, these vivid symbols.

1182
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,340
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind

1183
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,340
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.

1184
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:06,340
-Him and someone called the Fallen.
-The Fallen? I know him.

1185
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,540
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.

1186
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,230
He's terrible to work for.
It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

1187
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,440
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,

1188
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,670
the Fallen's search.

1189
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,790
l remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.

1190
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,070
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?

1191
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,120
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody!
Stay still or you'll die!

1192
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,349
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1193
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,970
I just hope we're still on the right planet.

1194
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,889
Hey, that freaking hurt!

1195
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,480
Oh, my God.

1196
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,620
Oh, God.

1197
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,730
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.

1198
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,410
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.

1199
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,290
Please, get off.

1200
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,429
God, my balls.

1201
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,930
Sam!

1202
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,750
-Where are we? Simmons!
-Hey! Yeah!

1203
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:33,440
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What is this? It's Vegas.

1204
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,590
-You guys okay?
-Yeah.

1205
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,980
Hey, I think we're in Vegas!

1206
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,410
That really, really hurt.
You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt!

1207
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,130
People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1208
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,170
-you would have heard...
-Shut up.

1209
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,099
I told you I was opening a space bridge.
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1210
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,070
When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.

1211
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,950
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1212
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:59,099
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!

1213
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,120
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

1214
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,379
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1215
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,850
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?

1216
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,150
This planet was visited
by our race once before,

1217
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,960
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

1218
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,780
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1219
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,370
the lifeblood of our race.

1220
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,830
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidise
and rust, like my wretched self!

1221
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,780
Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?

1222
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,780
Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?

1223
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,270
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.

1224
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,070
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1225
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:42,230
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1226
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,240
-Destroy suns?
-You mean blow them up?

1227
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,130
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

1228
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,040
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

1229
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,919
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1230
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:58,640
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

1231
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,820
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1232
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:05,790
And his name forevermore
was the Fallen.

1233
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,920
He despised the human race

1234
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,870
and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1235
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,849
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1236
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,000
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1237
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,089
A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.

1238
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,260
The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,

1239
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:44,710
so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.

1240
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,910
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1241
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,190
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,

1242
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,740
a tomb we cannot find.

1243
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:03,250
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1244
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,720
The Fallen knows where it is

1245
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:10,750
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1246
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,170
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1247
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,440
Only a Prime can defeat the Fallen.

1248
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,100
Optimus Prime?

1249
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,430
So, you've met a Prime?

1250
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,360
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1251
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,400
Is he alive, here on this planet?

1252
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,370
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1253
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,340
So, he's dead.

1254
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,040
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop the Fallen.

1255
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,970
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine

1256
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,690
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1257
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:43,990
and bring him back to life?

1258
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:48,130
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1259
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,080
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1260
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,270
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols.

1261
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,930
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.

1262
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:02,710
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1263
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,049
Find the doorway!

1264
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,940
Go now! Go!

1265
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,700
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1266
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:13,740
Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you.

1267
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,570
Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.

1268
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,830
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip.”

1269
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,929
-That's the Dagger's Tip.
-It's part of the Red Sea.

1270
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,059
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1271
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,629
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.

1272
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,200
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1273
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,590
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1274
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:38,900
I'm gonna make a call.

1275
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:42,930
We got cops!

1276
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,030
I can't go to prison, guys.

1277
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,130
Sam, we got to get off this road
and lay low.

1278
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,130
Man, stupid cops!

1279
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,259
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.

1280
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,790
-Shut up or I'll blend my fist in your face.
-They're gone.

1281
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,570
Okay, we're running out of time.
I gotta make the call to Lennox...

1282
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,040
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.

1283
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,530
Try calling one base,
they'll track you here in seconds.

1284
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,090
-CIA is all over this place!
-You're gonna call.

1285
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,890
-Okay. That's a good idea.
-All right.

1286
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,349
I mean, I just had my mind
on other things,

1287
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,910
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.

1288
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,680
NEST departure, 2100 hours.

1289
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,400
So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.

1290
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,860
Major Lennox, phone call.

1291
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,480
Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid. You
know, the one with the attitude, right?

1292
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,250
We need the truck. The truck.

1293
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,840
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1294
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:03,820
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.

1295
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,700
Back of a $1 bill.

1296
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:11,660
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.

1297
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,730
Oh, my God. I got to go. Okay.
Heat comes.

1298
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,420
Wait, who are you?

1299
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,870
Wait. It's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.

1300
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,150
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!

1301
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,870
Move, move, move, move.

1302
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:27,349
Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1303
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,910
Tip of the Red Sea.
Gulf of Aqaba.

1304
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,420
Egypt? Are you serious?

1305
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,190
Sir.

1306
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,860
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,

1307
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,490
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?

1308
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,720
Look, I don't know,
but we got to trust him.

1309
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,480
Okay, let's go over it again.

1310
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,540
When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,

1311
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,810
-the Three Kings...
-Will reveal the doorway.

1312
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,670
That's what he said.
You know what it means?

1313
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,260
-No, what does it mean?
-I have no idea.

1314
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,030
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.

1315
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,509
I don't have my passport.

1316
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,080
Passport!

1317
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,600
They got cameras at the top.

1318
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,510
All right, chill. This is espionage now.
I can handle it.

1319
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,560
These are my people.
I'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.

1320
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,020
Great, a fricking Munchkin.

1321
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,309
Little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1322
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,500
The Dagger's Tip? Right?

1323
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,990
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.

1324
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,099
Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son,

1325
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,650
my other son, my daughter.
We're tourists, from New York.

1326
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,740
-New York?
-Yes. Yes.

1327
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:54,910
Fifty kilometres.

1328
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,120
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.

1329
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,310
-I know. I know you from somewhere.
-Go, Yankees!

1330
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,219
Put it on the wire to the CIA.

1331
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,530
Decepticons, boy's location detected.

1332
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,210
Undercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.

1333
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,600
You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.

1334
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,240
Awesome! I think aliens built that.

1335
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,400
Yeah, yeah.

1336
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,320
Come on. Move it! Move it!

1337
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,430
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?

1338
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,360
Yeah, some of us got work to do!
Dumb Autobots.

1339
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:07,040
Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health.

1340
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:11,670
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.

1341
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,890
-Do they?
-Yeah.

1342
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,620
You might as well just say it.

1343
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,190
Ladies first.

1344
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,040
Okay, so tonight you're going to be
a gentleman.

1345
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,070
-You're really chivalrous.
-Why are you mad at me?

1346
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,470
You know what?
Baby, I'm not... I'm not mad.

1347
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,750
Do you realise that I just flew 3,000
miles to keep you from getting killed?

1348
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:37,339
I know.

1349
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,930
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?

1350
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,599
Look at the things I go through with you.

1351
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,380
And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars

1352
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,580
and the three most beautiful pyramids
on the planet

1353
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,850
and you still can't even tell me that
you love me.

1354
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,320
Pyramids.

1355
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:57,830
What? Why do boys always

1356
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,760
-change the subject?
-Pyramids and stars.

1357
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,269
-Sam?
-Come with me really quick.

1358
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,030
Simmons! Leo! Wake up!

1359
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,370
Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?

1360
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,000
No. I was only in college for two days.
Remember that?

1361
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,190
-Here. Get up. Up, up.
-What is he talking about?

1362
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:27,490
Okay, you see those three stars?

1363
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,160
You see
how the last one touches the horizon?

1364
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,759
That's Orion's belt,
but it's also called the Three Kings.

1365
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:33,700
And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings

1366
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,320
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,

1367
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,300
so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.

1368
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:41,480
They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.

1369
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,440
We've had an engine malfunction.

1370
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:57,360
We're gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.

1371
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,430
Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.

1372
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,790
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?

1373
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,620
-All right, team, grab your chutes!
-Bailout like bailout?

1374
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,509
-You familiar with the standard MC-4?
-Of course not!

1375
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,810
I've never jumped out of
a perfectly good aeroplane before!

1376
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,320
Wait a minute, is this really happening?

1377
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,070
-Yeah.
-All right, here we go.

1378
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,320
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?

1379
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,240
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.

1380
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,750
These guys don't mess around.
This is just standard procedure.

1381
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,950
I'm just following orders to the letter.
Isn't that what you said?

1382
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,520
You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.

1383
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,590
What was that? What was that?

1384
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,880
That's not good. Come on.

1385
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,380
-Right this way!
-I can't jump out of an aeroplane!

1386
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,360
-I have an ulcer! No, no.
-Come on. It's okay.

1387
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,850
I really can't do this.
What are you doing...

1388
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,360
Come here! Come here.

1389
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:53,260
-Why aren't you wearing your chute?
-Because I have to secure the VIPs first.

1390
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:57,420
Okay, I want you to listen very carefully
and memorise everything that I say.

1391
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,460
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

1392
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,670
Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,

1393
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,790
which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed.

1394
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,870
-Okay, are you listening?
-Il can't hear what...

1395
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,389
-Stop that!
-All right. All right.

1396
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,740
All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,

1397
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,910
it pulls the pin
and opens the main.

1398
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,960
Red's your backup, blue'’s your primary.

1399
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,830
I want you to pull the blue.
I need you to pull it really hard!

1400
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,750
Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass!

1401
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,410
-He say good-bye?
-No, he didn't even say good-bye.

1402
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,700
General, we're loaded and ready.

1403
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,460
You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.

1404
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,980
-Excellent.
-Sir, you need to see this now.

1405
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,830
-Have we checked these coordinates?
-Egypt, sir.

1406
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:42,510
-They're airdropping in.
-You've got to be kidding me.

1407
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,080
He knows something.

1408
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,280
We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.

1409
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,780
Copy that.

1410
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,070
CIA just got a hit on the boy,

1411
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,600
100 miles from the location
on that little note there.

1412
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:54,830
It's getting hotter.

1413
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,450
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

1414
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,800
You see the size of this?

1415
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,750
-You see this?
-Spectacular.

1416
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,710
Amazing. Look at that.

1417
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,760
-It's here somewhere, guys.
-Yeah, why?

1418
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:44,450
‘Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird

1419
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,950
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?

1420
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,570
In his defence, this is the biggest
doorway I've ever seen in my entire life.

1421
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,740
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, all right?

1422
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,570
Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys,

1423
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,030
that archaeologists
have been here before?

1424
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,190
There's nothing here.

1425
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,400
Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.

1426
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,580
Sometimes you get to
the end of the rainbow

1427
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,710
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!

1428
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,040
I'm listening to you?
You live with your mother!

1429
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,230
-It's not over.
-It is over. It's done.

1430
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,820
Why are we still listening to you,
little punk-ass?

1431
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,830
I mean, what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?

1432
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,769
Killed Megatron. How about that?

1433
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:16,990
Well, he didn't get the job done,

1434
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,460
you know what I mean,
‘cause he's back now...

1435
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,210
-Are you scared?
-Scared? Scared of your ugly face!

1436
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:23,640
I'm ugly?
Well, we're twins, you stupid genius!

1437
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,510
Bring it, then! Get off me!

1438
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,400
-I'll change your face around!
-I'll get all up in that ass!

1439
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,000
Bring it!

1440
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,860
Guys!

1441
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,650
-You like the way that feels?
-That didn't hurt.

1442
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,180
You like that, don't you?

1443
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,440
-Come on, Bumblebee!
-Bumblebee, listen.

1444
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,030
Now, that's rude.

1445
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,210
Oh, my God. The symbols.

1446
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,180
Bee! Shoot it.

1447
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,450
-Check this out.
-Look at it.

1448
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:31,830
Wow!

1449
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,110
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.

1450
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,530
The tomb of the Primes.

1451
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,250
Yo!

1452
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,660
Yo!

1453
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,360
The Matrix.

1454
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,370
No.

1455
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:15,660
No.

1456
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,220
Thousands of years, turned to dust.

1457
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,800
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

1458
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,059
Hear that?

1459
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,590
US Air Force! C-17s!

1460
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,210
-What's a C-17?
-You can't bring him back, Sam.

1461
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,650
-There's nothing left.
-Look! Look around you.

1462
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,300
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,

1463
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:40,910
to just have it end like this.

1464
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,530
There is a reason that we are here.

1465
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,060
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.

1466
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:54,090
Everyone's after me
because of what I know,

1467
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,260
and what I know is that
this is going to work.

1468
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,640
-How do you know it's gonna work?
-Because I believe it.

1469
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,600
You best let me out of this plane.

1470
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,600
Dropping the big boy. Sam!

1471
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,690
You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?

1472
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,370
Absolutely. Let's go.

1473
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,250
Go!

1474
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,480
Let's move it.
Remember, they're friendlies.

1475
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,300
Cover Optimus!

1476
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:09,070
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1477
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,190
I need snipers and Stingers up high.

1478
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,030
So, we just dropped off 10 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.

1479
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,930
l hope this little kid know
what he's doing.

1480
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,070
Yeah, me too.

1481
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,620
Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks!

1482
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,280
Pop flare!

1483
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,810
-That's them, right there. See the flare?
-Right over there! See it?

1484
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,700
Sam!

1485
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,980
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.

1486
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:02,639
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.

1487
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,110
Shut this guy up, huh?

1488
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:06,360
-Please, just let me live, just let me live!
-Shut up and let him drive!

1489
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:07,800
-Just stop screaming...
-All right, that's it!

1490
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,790
I can't take that guy any more.

1491
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,430
Hide in the dust! Use the dust!

1492
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,610
We've got to split up.
Bumblebee, you're the decoy.

1493
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,170
You lead the Decepticons away,
all right? I'm gonna get Optimus.

1494
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,700
I'll help draw their fire
with Huey and Dewey there.

1495
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,800
You get to those soldiers.

1496
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:46,680
-l hope that dust works, kid.
-Thank you.

1497
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,590
He's turning around. He's coming back.
He's coming back.

1498
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,590
It's up to me.

1499
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,250
One man, alone,
betrayed by the country he loves,

1500
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:00,740
now its last hope
in their final hour of need.

1501
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:04,210
Prepare to be driven like never before,
by the maestro.

1502
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,250
-Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere! Drive.
-You'll never make it, kid.

1503
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:09,780
-I'm coming with you.
-Bravery will only get you so far.

1504
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,620
You tased me, okay? You owe me!
I'm going.

1505
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,510
Okay, okay. That was a test.
You passed. All right?

1506
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,560
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.
That ain't Air Force.

1507
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,740
-What the hell was that?
-Anyone copy?

1508
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,800
-Anyone there? Who's up?
-Copy?

1509
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,050
-Radio's down.
-It's dead. Comms are down.

1510
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,480
EMP burst.

1511
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,420
I see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1512
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,349
Yes, sir?

1513
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,910
-Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
-I know, sir.

1514
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,710
Well, what country am I in right now?

1515
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,200
United States.

1516
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,700
No, not the United States.
I'm from the United States.

1517
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,490
I’m in the middie of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.

1518
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:00,990
Well, that was our good friend,
Galloway. He's less than pleased.

1519
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,850
How is it that we can't reach our men,

1520
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:08,769
but he can reach me,
from some random Egyptian desert?

1521
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:14,290
Nothing.

1522
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,420
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in
the sky know we need some help.

1523
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,520
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, boys, old school time!

1524
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,360
Pop some more flares
so the kid can find us.

1525
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,830
Look. There it is.
We got a couple of miles.

1526
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,950
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1527
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:41,130
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1528
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,090
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1529
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,480
Our satellites in the area have
gone blind. We're working it, sir.

1530
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,890
Damn it. Something's not right.
It doesn't add up.

1531
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,309
Contact the Jordanians, see
what air assets they've got in the area,

1532
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,760
and get Egypt's General Salam.

1533
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:59,380
Ask him to clear some USV overflights
in Egyptian airspace.

1534
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,520
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1535
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:04,450
Scramble Predators now.

1536
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:05,990
V-1, rotate.

1537
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,260
We still have a mile that way.

1538
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,080
Come on.

1539
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,530
This way. This way.

1540
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:38,000
-One man, alone...
-Stop saying that!

1541
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,530
...betrayed by the country he loves!

1542
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,580
Oh, my goodness.
I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.

1543
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,580
Just relax. You're with the maestro.

1544
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,920
I don't think he's still following us.

1545
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,519
That's what you think.

1546
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:17,040
Master, sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

1547
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:20,120
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1548
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,420
The boy must have the Matrix.

1549
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,290
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1550
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:29,330
Decepticons, begin our assault!

1551
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,809
We've got incoming!

1552
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:49,940
We got a whole lot of fight
-
coming our way.

1553
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:52,080
-How many?
-About 13 of them.

1554
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,610
This ain't good. This ain't good.

1555
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,660
We're about to get our asses whupped.

1556
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,510
Bravo-Charlie, kneel!

1557
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:10,220
All right, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1558
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:14,370
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life,

1559
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,190
so our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1560
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,990
All right, we're gonna draw fire
from the left flank. I need a scout team.

1561
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,269
I'm leading.

1562
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,509
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide!

1563
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,140
All right, when you see
the precious cargo,

1564
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,719
I want you to pop green smoke and
come back through those pillars.

1565
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:30,820
We'll have the ambush set. All right.
Let's go. Move out!

1566
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:41,970
You ever see that film
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?

1567
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:46,350
-With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
-No, why?

1568
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,230
-Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
-ls that good?

1569
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:55,980
A lot of people died.

1570
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:14,620
Hide!

1571
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,910
-Vamonos, amigos!
-Oh, my God!

1572
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,660
-Hit the deck!
-Oh, my God!

1573
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,190
Sam, Sam.

1574
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,080
I don't think they saw us.

1575
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,380
Get down. Get down. Get down.

1576
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,290
Okay. Listen.

1577
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:52,090
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus
as fast as we can, okay?

1578
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,020
What if it doesn't work?

1579
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,330
It's gonna work.

1580
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,130
-What if it doesn't?
-It's gonna work. It'll work.

1581
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,190
Up, up, up!

1582
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,320
Get ready to jump!

1583
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,850
We got a half-mile. I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1584
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:09,880
Fall back!

1585
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:13,030
-lronhide, up the middle!
-Ironhide, move it!

1586
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,170
Let's go! Go, go!

1587
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:23,480
Devastator!

1588
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,610
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go.
We're gonna die.

1589
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,810
If we're going out, we're going out
like men, understand?

1590
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,180
Look at this mother...

1591
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:02,849
Mean robots suck!

1592
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:15,410
Hang on! Hang on, okay?

1593
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:22,180
-Simmons!
-Don't let go!

1594
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,509
Hang in there, I got you! Just hang in.

1595
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:29,900
I don't want to die!

1596
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,530
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!

1597
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:34,850
You ain't getting me!

1598
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:41,170
He dead. He got so ate.

1599
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:44,250
-Who's your daddy now, huh?
-He got all ate up.

1600
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:46,470
The only safe place is right under it.

1601
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,850
-Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
-Yeah.

1602
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,690
You should've never eaten me!
I'm gonna bust your face up!

1603
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:05,860
Oh, my God!

1604
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,740
Nobody mess with me! In your face!

1605
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,320
Keep fighting, Mudflap!

1606
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,519
Oh, my God!

1607
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,450
Nobody messes with the twins.

1608
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,420
I got you... My bad!

1609
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:33,040
Man! You shot me in the face!

1610
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,650
-Stay under it!
-Yeah, stay under it!

1611
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:40,800
Come on.

1612
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,299
Judy!

1613
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,070
-Sam! Sam!
-What?

1614
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,929
Sam! Sam!

1615
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:12,490
Sam!

1616
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:13,840
-Sam!
-Dad!

1617
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:22,599
Wait, wait!

1618
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:26,940
Please listen to me!
I want you to run! Run!

1619
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,719
Dad, just stop!
They don't want you, they want me!

1620
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,349
-Oh, God!
-Wait!

1621
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:33,180
Sam Witwicky.

1622
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:37,099
Don't hurt them. This is what you want.
You don't want them.

1623
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:39,050
-Go! Go!
-Please, stop!

1624
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:40,330
-Stop!
-Listen to your father!

1625
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,030
Just get out of here!

1626
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,560
Just don't hurt them.
I know what you want.

1627
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,220
Just go! Just go!

1628
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,639
And I know that you need me
because I know about the Matrix.

1629
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:51,980
-Don't do it, Sam...
-Please, Dad.

1630
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:55,570
-They're going to kill us all anyway!
-Here's what you want, right here.

1631
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,589
Bumblebee!

1632
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,809
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.

1633
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,570
-Stay tight, Ma.
-Come on. Get in here.

1634
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,710
-Bee?
-Yeah.

1635
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,219
-Hey!
-I don't know

1636
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,049
what's going on, but we've got to move!

1637
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:17,860
There's got to be a way out of here!

1638
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:21,080
Judy, get back, get back, get back.

1639
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:25,009
Against the wall! Against the wall!
Against the wall. Against the wall.

1640
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:28,360
Bee! Bumblebee!

1641
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,089
You get them somewhere safe,
all right?

1642
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:34,580
You've got to get in the car
and get to safety.

1643
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,340
No, this isn't up for discussion!

1644
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:38,220
-You're my son! You're my son!
-Il know.

1645
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:39,570
-Dad...
-We all go together!

1646
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,920
-Listen...
-We're all going together!

1647
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:43,930
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.

1648
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:46,290
You know, you run.
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.

1649
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:48,810
You hear what I'm saying, okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1650
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,429
-No.
-You've got to let me go, Dad.

1651
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:53,490
-You have to let me go. You have to.
-Ron.

1652
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:58,509
Ron. Ron, let him go.

1653
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,760
You come back! Come on.

1654
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:04,590
Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!

1655
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:07,020
-Go with my parents.
-I'm not gonna go without you.

1656
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:19,490
Move to cover!

1657
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:25,230
We got Jordanians!

1658
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:26,710
We got help!

1659
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:33,810
Down!

1660
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:51,240
You okay, soldier?

1661
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:54,190
We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's
get these wounded clear of the bird.

1662
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,250
Stay still. Stay still. Don't move.

1663
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,450
You all right, young man?
You have a radio?

1664
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:03,880
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you.
Remember what I did for my country.

1665
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,240
This is my moment.

1666
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:09,070
You're crazy!

1667
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,780
ETA to station, two minutes.

1668
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:14,660
-Put it on the main screen.
-Sir. Yes, sir.

1669
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,150
Predator 01.

1670
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,370
Shit, it's a trick.

1671
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:29,630
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1672
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,170
-Get those Marines on the ground.
-Roll in strike packages...

1673
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,200
Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning.

1674
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,210
-Spotted Sam!
-Sam!

1675
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,000
Ironhide!

1676
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,820
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1677
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,050
Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars!

1678
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:08,500
Let's go.

1679
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:15,150
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built
right over the machine.

1680
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:19,290
If they turn that machine on,
ho more sun.

1681
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:23,320
Not on my watch.

1682
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:26,130
Not on my watch.

1683
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,260
USS Stennis. ldentify.

1684
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,550
Where the hell are you?
Watching the Weather Channel?

1685
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,500
SportsCenter?
I Dream of Jeannie or something?

1686
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:46,130
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?

1687
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:47,980
Identify yourself.

1688
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,650
What is your name, sailor?

1689
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:54,540
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier.

1690
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:57,799
Okay, Captain Wilder.

1691
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:00,040
This is Agent Seymour Simmons
of Sector Seven.

1692
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,400
There is the mother
of all non-biologicals

1693
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,270
getting ready to blow up our sun.

1694
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,070
Do you want to have a throwdown
about my lack of clearance

1695
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:08,080
or do you want to help save
a gazillion lives?

1696
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:11,240
All right, Agent Simmons. I'm listening.

1697
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,679
Five clicks west of the Gulf,

1698
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:23,570
we got ourselves an alien
remodelling a pyramid.

1699
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,560
Our one hope is a prototype weapon
called a rail gun,

1700
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,560
-shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.
-That's classified.

1701
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,020
Don't talk to me about classified,
all right?

1702
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,770
Now, if you've got a battleship
in the Gulf, which I know you do,

1703
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:38,300
you tell them to ready that weapon!

1704
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:41,740
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.

1705
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,280
Alpha Team, flank left!

1706
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,030
This way! Move it!

1707
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:50,010
-Where do you need us, sir?
-Protect those in the line of fire.

1708
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:51,690
Let's go! Go!

1709
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,740
Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps!

1710
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,280
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!

1711
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:06,780
Have troops in contact 20 miles
northwest. Radar contact.

1712
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:08,099
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...

1713
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:13,530
B-1, snap 090.

1714
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:15,800
You are approved to drop your
2,000-pound JDAMs.

1715
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,160
-What you got?
-I couldn't get to them, sir.

1716
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:26,120
They're 600 metres away
and they're heading right for the pillars.

1717
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:28,860
All right. Precious cargo's coming!

1718
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,470
Move!

1719
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:42,140
Curse you!

1720
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:57,510
Sam! Spotted Sam!

1721
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:30,190
-Come on!
-2-2 covering fire.

1722
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:31,669
Two civilians, 12 o'clock!

1723
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:41,340
Cover for us!

1724
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:50,000
Hold the air strike!
We're rescuing civilians!

1725
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:03,490
Keep firing!

1726
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,799
Come on! Mikaela!

1727
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,360
Come on! Get in here!

1728
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,790
Look who showed up.

1729
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:17,720
You better have a good reason for us
to be here.

1730
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:19,480
-Where's Optimus?
-He's right over there,

1731
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:20,950
across the courtyard.

1732
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,760
-I got to get to him right now.
-Not with an air strike coming.

1733
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:25,980
I have to get to him right now.

1734
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:28,840
Go. Back, back, back, back.

1735
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:30,519
-Go.
-Listen up...

1736
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,010
Okay.

1737
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:39,800
Incoming!

1738
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:42,810
Stick the landing.

1739
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,340
Behold the glory of Jetfire!

1740
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:50,940
Now let me show you how we brought
the pain in my day!

1741
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:11,680
I'm too old for this crap.

1742
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,210
Keep going, man, 15 rounds of fighting.

1743
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:36,790
l am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

1744
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:40,730
25.7 metres above sea level,
29.32 north.

1745
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:43,059
-Kill track, 5205...
-Target acquired.

1746
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:45,570
-Killing track.
-Two, one...

1747
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:47,040
Fire!

1748
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,170
Yeah! Yeah!

1749
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:05,850
B-1’s time on target, 30 seconds.
2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.

1750
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:08,110
We're gonna make a break through
the B's on my command, okay?

1751
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:10,900
You guys stick with me, you
understand? You stay on my ass.

1752
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:14,210
-1-1 tally orange smoke.
-I hope these F-16s got good aim.

1753
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:17,660
-Yeah? Why is that?
-I told them to hit the orange smoke.

1754
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:20,820
You mean that orange smoke?

1755
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,410
It wasn't my best toss, okay?

1756
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:25,000
-Viper, thunder.
-Run!

1757
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:35,010
Incoming!

1758
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:39,200
Come on!

1759
02:05:58,760 --> 02:05:59,740
Sam!

1760
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,450
Run!

1761
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:12,309
Die!

1762
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:20,250
Sam!

1763
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:37,260
Hold your fire!

1764
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:40,700
Sam!

1765
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:44,299
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!

1766
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,280
Fucking do something!

1767
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:27,669
-Sam! Sam!
-Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!

1768
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:31,660
-Let me go!
-Come on, you got to move.

1769
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:34,280
-You got to move, come on.
-We got no pulse.

1770
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:35,620
Starting CPR.

1771
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:38,540
-I have to see my kid! I got a son...
-Sammy!

1772
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:40,540
Sam!

1773
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:44,250
-Clear.
-Ready to shock.

1774
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,840
-Clear!
-Ready to shock. One, two, three.

1775
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:51,190
Do it again!

1776
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:57,760
No!

1777
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:04,130
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.

1778
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:08,940
Please. Please, come back to me.
Sam, please!

1779
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:10,740
I love you.

1780
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:23,610
Where am I? Where am I?
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1781
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:28,180
We have been watching you
a long, long time.

1782
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:34,370
You have fought for Optimus,
our last descendant,

1783
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:39,170
with courage and with sacrifice,
the virtues of a leader,

1784
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:42,820
a leader worthy of our secret.

1785
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:47,580
The Matrix of Leadership is not found,
it is earned.

1786
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,139
Return now to Optimus.

1787
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:54,040
Merge the Matrix with his spark.

1788
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:58,710
It is, and always has been, your destiny.

1789
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:04,940
Sam!

1790
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:13,349
I love you. I love you.

1791
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:52,360
Boy, you returned for me.

1792
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,650
A living Prime.

1793
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:59,299
I don't believe it!

1794
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:11,230
My Matrix!

1795
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:18,220
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

1796
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:20,620
Get up, Prime!

1797
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,760
Oh, no.

1798
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:27,610
He's turning on the machine!
You got to stop him! Get up!

1799
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:29,720
Optimus!

1800
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Fallen, my master.

1801
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:38,080
My brothers could not stop me from this.

1802
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:43,169
Yes, now I claim your sun.

1803
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:48,510
-Move!
-Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!

1804
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,260
Engage! Engage!

1805
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:58,140
In moments, we'll be at firing strength.

1806
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:17,269
All my Decepticon life, never did
a thing worth doing until now.

1807
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:20,809
Optimus, take my parts

1808
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:23,870
and you will have a power
you've never known.

1809
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:26,880
Fulfil your destiny.

1810
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:34,740
Jolt! Electrify!

1811
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,009
Transplant those afterburners.

1812
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:56,200
Let's roll.

1813
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:00,480
Fire mission on the pyramids.

1814
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:15,030
This planet will be dark forever.

1815
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:38,790
Die, like your brothers!

1816
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:41,570
They were your brothers, too.

1817
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:11,060
Starscream!

1818
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:25,580
You picked the wrong planet.

1819
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:30,300
Give me your face.

1820
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:40,080
I rise.

1821
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,130
You fall.

1822
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:47,070
No, no.

1823
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:51,389
Not to call you a coward, Master,

1824
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:56,540
but sometimes cowards do survive.

1825
02:13:57,760 --> 02:13:59,410
This isn't over.

1826
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,620
It took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.

1827
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:31,809
You said it first.

1828
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:23,290
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.

1829
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:25,920
Welcome.

1830
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:28,270
Thank you for believing in me.

1831
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:36,950
Our races united by a history
long forgotten

1832
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:40,440
and a future we shall face together.

1833
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:43,389
1 am Optimus Prime,

1834
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:47,970
and I send this message so that our
pasts will always be remembered,

1835
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:51,940
for in those memories, we live on.

1836
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:16,700
So glad you could join us,
Professor Einstein.

1837
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:19,130
Yeah, I was kind of busy.

1838
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:22,930
Okay.
