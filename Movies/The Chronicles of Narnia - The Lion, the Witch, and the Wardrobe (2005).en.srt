1
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,827
Edmund! Get away from there!

2
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,458
Peter! What do you think you're doing?

3
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,477
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!

4
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,912
- Come on!
- Wait...

5
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,600
Come on, leave it!

6
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,874
Mommy!

7
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,428
Lucy, come on!

8
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,581
- Come on, quickly!
- Run!

9
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,114
Run!

10
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,266
- Hurry!
- Mum!

11
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,146
- Wait! Dad!
- Ed!

12
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,842
- Edmund, no!
- I'll get him!

13
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,191
- Peter, come back!
- Ed! Come here!

14
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,308
Edmund! Get down!

15
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,914
Come on, you idiot, run!

16
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,298
Get out!

17
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,328
Come on!

18
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,191
Hurry!

19
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,144
Why can't you think of anyone
but yourself? You're so selfish!

20
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,251
- You could've got us killed!
- Stop it!

21
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,594
It's OK.

22
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,184
Why can't you just do as you're told?

23
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,286
Alms for the poor. Alms for the poor.

24
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:04,987
God bless you, sir.

25
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,148
Children and evacuation staff...

26
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,887
You need to keep this on, darling.
All right?

27
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,565
You warm enough? Good girl.

28
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,846
Say hello to Auntie Laura.
Goodbye, darling, we love you.

29
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,656
- Dad wouldn't make us go.
- If Dad were here,

30
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,969
it'd mean the war was over.
We wouldn't have to.

31
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,614
You will listen to your brother,
won't you, Edmund?

32
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,272
Promise me you'll look after the others.

33
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,061
I will, Mum.

34
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:53,406
- Good man.
- All aboard! All aboard!

35
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,057
- Bye, darling!
- Bye!

36
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,713
Susan.

37
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,730
Be a big girl.

38
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,070
Hold on to your brother's hand.
Don't let it go.

39
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,607
All right. Off you go.

40
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,628
- All aboard!
- Bye-bye. Love you.

41
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,682
Hey, get off. I know
how to get on a train by myself.

42
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,902
Get off me!

43
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,237
May I have your tickets, please?
Tickets, please.

44
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,506
Peter.

45
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:34,954
- That's right. On you go.
- Yes. Thank you.

46
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,210
Come along.
Come along this way, please.

47
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,868
Come on, Lucy.
We have to stick together now.

48
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,063
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be fine.

49
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,801
Bye, Mommy! I love you!

50
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,597
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.

51
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,392
- Llove you, Mum! Bye!
- See you soon!

52
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,358
- Write to us, Mum!
- Love you!

53
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,944
Goosey Station. Goosey Station.

54
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,253
Give me your hand. Let's get going.

55
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,789
The professor knew we were coming.

56
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,532
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled.

57
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,712
Come on, hup!

58
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,659
And whoa. Whoa.

59
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,763
- Mrs. Macready?
- I'm afraid so.

60
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,106
Is this it, then?
Haven't you brought anything else?

61
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,342
No, ma'am.

62
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,585
It's just us.

63
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,541
Small favors.

64
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,932
Come on. Good girl. Come on. Come on.

65
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:31,414
Professor Kirke is not accustomed
to havin' children in this house.

66
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,611
And, as such, there are a few rules
we need to follow.

67
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,962
There will no shoutin’.

68
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,093
Or runnin’.
No improper use of the dumbwaiter.

69
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,319
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!

70
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,201
And above all,

71
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:55,127
there shall be no disturbin'
of the professor.

72
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,711
German aircraft carried out a number
of attacks on Great Britain last night.

73
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,399
The raids, which lasted
for several hours...

74
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,997
The sheets feel scratchy.

75
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,794
Wars don't last forever, Lucy.
We'll be home soon.

76
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,648
- Yeah, if home's still there.
- Isn't it time you were in bed?

77
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,249
- Yes, Mum.
- Ed!

78
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,215
You saw outside. This place is huge.

79
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,591
We can do whatever we want here.

80
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,103
Tomorrow's going to be great.

81
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,546
Really.

82
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,762
"Gastrovascular."

83
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,608
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

84
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,901
- Is it Latin?
- Yes.

85
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,676
Is it Latin for
"worst game ever invented"?

86
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,477
We could play hide and seek.

87
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,734
But we're already having so much fun.

88
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,668
Come on, Peter, please.

89
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,288
Pretty please?

90
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:25,004
- One, two, three, four,
- What?

91
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,935
five, six, seven, eight,

92
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,906
nine, ten, 11...

93
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,699
24, 25, 26...

94
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,941
I was here first!

95
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:12,987
..15, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,

96
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,122
81, 82, 83, 84,

97
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:22,375
85, 86, 85, 86, 87, 88,

98
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,722
89, 90, 91, 92,

99
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,533
93, 94, 95...

100
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,599
Were you hiding from me?

101
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,573
No.

102
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,561
Well...

103
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,501
I just... L..

104
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,259
No. No. I just...

105
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,222
I was just...
I didn't want to scare you.

106
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:49,061
If you don't mind my asking...
what are you?

107
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,735
Well, I'ma...
Well, I'm a faun.

108
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,449
And what about you?

109
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,527
You must be some kind of
beardless dwarf?

110
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,620
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!

111
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,694
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.

112
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,644
You mean to say that
you're a Daughter of Eve?

113
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, my mum's name is Helen.

114
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:20,562
Yes, but you are in fact human.

115
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,764
Yes, of course.

116
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,211
What are you doing here?

117
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,677
Well, l was hiding in the wardrobe
in the spare room, and...

118
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,060
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?

119
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,562
Narnia? What's that?

120
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,179
Well, dear girl, you're in it.

121
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,675
Everything from the lamppost

122
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,074
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Ocean,

123
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,941
every stick and stone you see,

124
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,531
every icicle is Narnia.

125
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,549
This is an awfully big wardrobe.

126
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,509
War Drobe? I'm sorry.

127
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,379
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Tumnus.

128
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:07,403
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus.
I'm Lucy Pevensie.

129
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:15,446
- Oh, you shake it.
- Why?

130
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,486
I... [don't know.

131
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,929
People do it when they meet each other.

132
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:35,276
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie
from the shining city of War Drobe

133
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,568
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

134
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:43,211
how would it be if you came
and had tea with me?

135
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,293
Well, thank you very much, but I...

136
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,050
I probably should be getting back.

137
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,473
It's only just around the corner.
And there'll be a glorious fire

138
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,177
with toast and tea and cakes.

139
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,748
And, perhaps, we'll even
break into the sardines.

140
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,042
- [don't know.
- Come on.

141
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,299
It's not every day
that I get to make a new friend.

142
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,535
Well, l suppose I could come
for a little while.

143
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,491
If you have sardines.

144
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,246
By the bucketload.

145
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,667
You all right?

146
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,427
Well, here we are.

147
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,728
Come along.

148
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,957
- After you.
- May I help you with that?

149
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,379
Thank you very much.

150
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,279
Now, that... that is my father.

151
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,689
He has a nice face.

152
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,002
He looks a lot like you.

153
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,148
No.

154
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,010
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

155
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,543
My father's fighting in the war.

156
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,311
My father went away to war too.

157
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,472
But that was a long, long time ago.

158
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,512
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

159
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,030
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

160
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,185
- And Christmas!
- Not here.

161
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,985
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

162
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,973
What? No presents for a hundred years?

163
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,670
Always winter, never Christmas.

164
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,586
It's been a long winter.

165
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,710
But you would have loved Narnia
.
In summer.

166
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,067
We fauns danced
with the dryads all night,

167
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,041
and, you know, we never got tired.

168
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,977
And music. Oh, such music!

169
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,644
Would... would you
like to hear some now?

170
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,500
Yes, please.

171
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,559
Now, are you familiar

172
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,469
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

173
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,909
Well, that's good.

174
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,772
Because this... probably
won't sound anything like one.

175
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,648
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

176
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,776
I'm such a terrible faun.

177
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,495
Oh, no.

178
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,278
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

179
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,844
Then I'm afraid you've had
a very poor sampling.

180
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:39,334
No. You can't have done
anything that bad.

181
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,577
It's not something I have done,
Lucy Pevensie.

182
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,534
It's something l am doing.

183
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,388
What are you doing?

184
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,040
I'm kidnapping you.

185
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,594
It was the White Witch.

186
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:00,536
She's the one who makes it always
winter, always cold. She gave orders.

187
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,043
If any of us ever find a human
wandering in the woods,

188
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,596
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

189
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,203
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.

190
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,244
I thought you were my friend.

191
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,598
Now. She may already know you're here.

192
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,475
The woods are full of her spies.

193
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,986
Even some of the trees are on her side.

194
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,657
Can you find your way back from here?

195
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,333
- [ think so.
- All right.

196
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,949
Will you be all right?

197
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,837
Hey, hey, hey.

198
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:58,491
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

199
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,373
Here.

200
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:08,283
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

201
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:16,671
No matter what happens, Lucy Pevensie,
lam glad to have met you.

202
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,043
You've made me feel warmer
than I've felt in a hundred years.

203
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,466
Now go.

204
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,099
Go!

205
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,938
..99, 100.

206
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,443
Ready or not, here I come!

207
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,548
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

208
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,125
Shut up! He's coming!

209
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,174
You know, I'm not sure you two
have quite got the idea of this game.

210
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,878
Weren't you wondering where I was?

211
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,070
That's the point.
That was why he was seeking you.

212
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,730
Does this mean I win?

213
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,865
I don't think Lucy
wants to play anymore.

214
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,391
I've been gone for hours.

215
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,711
Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

216
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:25,844
One game at a time, Lu.
We don't all have your imagination.

217
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,012
But I wasn't imagining!

218
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,985
That's enough, Lucy.

219
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,407
wouldn't lie about this!

220
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,290
Well, I believe you.

221
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,529
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

222
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,158
Didn't I tell you about
the field in the cupboards?

223
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,444
Will you just stop?

224
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,090
You just have to make
everything worse, don't you?

225
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,062
- It was just a joke!
- When are you gonna learn to grow up?

226
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,385
Shut up! You think you're Dad,
but you're not!

227
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,545
Well, that was nicely handled.

228
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,510
But... it really was there.

229
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:11,791
Susan's right, Lucy.

230
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,937
That's enough.

231
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,575
Lucy.

232
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,444
Where are you?

233
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,200
Lucy.

234
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,428
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

235
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,189
Lucy?

236
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,643
Lucy?

237
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,740
Lucy!

238
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,067
Lucy.

239
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,963
Where are you?

240
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,353
Lucy.

241
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,809
I think I believe you now.

242
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,391
Lucy.

243
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,562
Lucy?

244
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,460
- Leave me alone!
- What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

245
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,839
Make him let me go!
I didn't do anything wrong!

246
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,294
How dare you address
the Queen of Narnia?

247
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,294
I didn't know!

248
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,279
- You will know her better hereafter!
- Wait!

249
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,923
What is your name, Son of Adam?

250
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,470
Edmund.

251
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:47,309
And how, Edmund,
did you come to enter my dominion?

252
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,389
I'm not sure.
I was just following my sister.

253
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,170
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

254
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,117
Lucy's the only one
that's been here before.

255
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,983
She said she met some faun
called Tumnus.

256
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,217
Peter and Susan didn't believe her.
I didn't either.

257
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:09,794
Edmund, you look so cold.
Will you come and sit with me?

258
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,864
Now, how about something hot to drink?

259
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:33,675
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

260
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,569
Your drink, sire.

261
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,849
How did you do that?

262
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,881
l can make anything you like.

263
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,854
Can you make me taller?

264
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:04,447
Anything you'd like to eat.

265
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,308
Turkish delight?

266
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,534
Edmund?

267
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,690
I would very much like to meet
the rest of your family.

268
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,887
Why?

269
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,773
They're nothing special.

270
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:49,399
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly
as delightful as you are.

271
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,240
But you see, Edmund,
l have no children of my own.

272
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,537
And you are exactly the sort of boy

273
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:02,533
who I could see, one day,
becoming Prince of Narnia.

274
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,535
Maybe even King.

275
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,648
Really?

276
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,841
Of course, you'd have
to bring your family.

277
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,632
Do you mean,
Peter would be king too?

278
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,408
No! No, no.

279
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,245
But a king needs servants.

280
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,939
I guess I could bring 'em.

281
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,326
Beyond these woods,
you see those two hills?

282
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,559
My house is right between them.

283
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,746
You'd love it there, Edmund.

284
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,860
It has whole rooms
simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

285
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,325
- Couldn't l have some more now?
- No!

286
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,378
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

287
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:55,951
Besides, you and I are going to be
seeing each other again very soon.

288
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:59,248
l hope so, Your Majesty.

289
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:04,372
Until then, dear one.
I'm gonna miss you.

290
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,076
Edmund?

291
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,952
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

292
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,701
Isn't it wonderful?

293
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,817
- Where have you been?
- With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.

294
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,802
The White Witch hasn't found out
anything about him meeting me.

295
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,569
The White Witch?

296
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:40,001
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,
but she really isn't.

297
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,860
Are you all right? You look awful.

298
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,777
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, it's freezing.

299
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:52,540
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

300
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,487
This way.

301
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,051
Peter, Peter, wake up!
Peter, wake up!

302
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,101
It's there! It's really there!

303
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,919
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

304
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,415
It's all in the wardrobe
like I told you!

305
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,491
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But l haven't!

306
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,451
l saw Mr. Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

307
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,015
You... You saw the faun?

308
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,765
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

309
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,869
He...

310
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,041
What were you doing, Edmund?

311
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,672
I was just playing along.

312
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,449
I'm sorry, Peter.

313
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,846
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

314
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,790
but you know what little children
are like these days.

315
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:51,403
They just don't know
when to stop pretending.

316
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,888
You children are one shenanigan
shy of sleepin’ in the stable!

317
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:19,645
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them
you were not to be disturbed.

318
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:23,375
It's all right, Mrs. Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

319
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,923
But first of all, l think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

320
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,030
Come along, dear.

321
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:42,937
You seem to have upset the delicate
internal balance of my housekeeper.

322
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,058
We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

323
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,581
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

324
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,660
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,720
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

326
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,406
It's nothing.

327
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,198
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

328
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,819
She thinks she's found a magical land.

329
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,592
In the upstairs wardrobe.

330
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,580
What did you say?

331
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,783
The wardrobe, upstairs.

332
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,403
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

333
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,698
She won't stop going on about it.

334
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:24,002
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

335
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,699
No, no, no, not her. The forest.

336
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,118
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

337
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:31,904
But of course not.

338
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,990
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

339
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,273
What do they teach
in schools these days?

340
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,388
Edmund said they were only pretending.

341
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,500
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

342
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:45,256
No. This would be the first time.

343
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,637
Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

344
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:51,946
then logically we must
assume she's telling the truth.

345
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,747
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

346
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:01,275
She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

347
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:06,404
You might just try acting like one.

348
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,825
Peter winds up,
poised to take yet another wicket!

349
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,639
Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

350
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,696
Why can't we play hide and seek again?

351
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,341
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

352
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:26,604
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

353
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,605
It's not like there isn't air inside.

354
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,071
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

355
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,002
- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

356
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,944
- What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

357
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,797
Come on!

358
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,240
No, no, back, back, back!

359
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:37,308
- Come on!
- You've got to be joking.

360
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,044
Get back!

361
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:53,866
- My toe!
- I'm not on your toe!

362
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,781
- Move back.
- Will you stop shoving?

363
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:11,905
Impossible.

364
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,535
Don't worry.

365
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,850
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

366
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,130
I don't suppose saying we're sorry

367
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,487
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

368
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,920
But that might!

369
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,511
Stop it!

370
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,585
You little liar.

371
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:49,596
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

372
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,729
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

373
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,983
That's all right.

374
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,918
Some children just don't know
when to stop pretending.

375
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:01,648
Oh, very funny.

376
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,533
Maybe we should go back.

377
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,898
But shouldn't we at least
take a look around?

378
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,918
I think Lucy should decide.

379
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,512
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!

380
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,902
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.

381
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,201
But we can't go hiking
in the snow dressed like this.

382
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:21,548
No.

383
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:26,798
But I'm sure the professor
wouldn't mind us using these.

384
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,128
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

385
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,833
we're not even taking them
out of the wardrobe.

386
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,972
- But that's a girl's coat!
- l know.

387
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,169
..lots and lots of lovely food,
and we'll have lots and lots of...

388
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,006
Lu?

389
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,346
Lucy!

390
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:53,812
Who would do something like this?

391
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,429
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged

392
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,526
with High Treason
against Her Imperial Majesty,

393
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,707
Jadis, Queen of Narnia,

394
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:25,033
for comforting her enemies
and fraternizing with humans.

395
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:28,543
Signed Maugrim,
Captain of the Secret Police.

396
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,910
Long Live the Queen."

397
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,283
All right.
Now we really should go back.

398
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,206
But what about Mr. Tumnus?

399
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:40,002
If he was arrested just
for being with a human,

400
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:43,848
- [don't think there's much we can do.
- You don't understand, do you?

401
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:47,393
I'm the human.

402
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,865
She must have found out he helped me.

403
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:53,358
- Maybe we could call the police.
- These are the police.

404
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,825
Don't worry, Lu.
We'll think of something.

405
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,807
Why?

406
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,098
I mean, he's a criminal.

407
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:08,212
Did that bird just "psst" us?

408
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,969
It... It's a beaver.

409
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,044
Here, boy.

410
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,116
Here, boy.

411
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,166
l ain't gonna smell it,
if that's what you want.

412
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,243
Sorry.

413
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,234
Lucy Pevensie?

414
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,386
Yes?

415
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,629
That's the hankie I gave to Mr. Tum...

416
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,921
Tumnus. He got it to me
just before they took him.

417
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,632
Is he all right?

418
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,368
Further in.

419
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,058
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

420
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,208
How do we know we can trust him?

421
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,667
He said he knows the faun.

422
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:55,459
He's a beaver.
He shouldn't be saying anything!

423
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,540
Everything all right?

424
00:45:57,822 --> 00:45:59,842
Yes. We were just talking.

425
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,881
That's better left for safer quarters.

426
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,198
He means the trees.

427
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,835
Come on. We don't want to be
caught out here after nightfall.

428
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,732
Blimey! Looks like the old girl
has got the kettle on.

429
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,622
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

430
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,951
- It's lovely.
- It's merely a trifle.

431
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,474
Still plenty to do.
Ain't quite finished it yet.

432
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,679
It'll look the business
when it is, though.

433
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,506
Beaver, is that you?
I've been worried sick!

434
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,380
If l find you've been
out with Badger again, I...

435
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,938
Well, those aren't badgers.

436
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,386
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

437
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,846
Look at my fur. You couldn't
give me ten minutes warning?

438
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,580
I'd have given a week
if l thought it would've helped.

439
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,826
Oh, come inside, and we'll see
if we can't get you some food,

440
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:22,433
and some civilized company.

441
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:25,828
Now, careful. Watch your step.

442
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,577
Excuse the mess.

443
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,535
Can't get Mr. Beaver
to get out of his chair.

444
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,399
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?

445
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,892
Isn't there anything
we can do to help Tumnus?

446
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,015
They'll have taken him to the Witch's.
You know what they say.

447
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:50,865
There's few that go through
them gates that come out again.

448
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,592
Fish 'n' chips?

449
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:57,695
But there is hope, dear. Lots of hope.

450
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,198
Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

451
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,096
Aslan is on the move.

452
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,566
Who's Aslan?

453
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,464
Who's Aslan?

454
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,391
You cheeky little blighter.

455
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,605
What?

456
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:28,342
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

457
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,949
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

458
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:34,438
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

459
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:38,405
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

460
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,409
And he's waitin’ for you
near the Stone Table!

461
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:44,509
- He's waiting for us?
- You're bloomin' joking!

462
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,235
They don't even know about the prophecy!

463
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,995
- Well, then...
- Look.

464
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:53,459
Aslan's return,

465
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:56,698
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

466
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,038
it's all happening because of you!

467
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,359
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

468
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,240
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

469
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,327
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

470
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:12,437
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

471
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,223
the evil time will be over and done."

472
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,669
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- [know it don't.

473
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,042
You're kinda missin’ the point!

474
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,531
It has long been foretold

475
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,293
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

476
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:30,326
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

477
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,677
And you think we're the ones?

478
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:37,598
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

479
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,772
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

480
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,597
so we wouldn't get caught up in a war.

481
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,174
I think you've made a mistake.

482
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:49,134
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

483
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,442
Thank you for your hospitality.

484
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:58,983
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

485
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,716
He's right. We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

486
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,453
It's out of our hands.

487
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,096
I'm sorry,

488
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,178
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

489
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,600
Ed?

490
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,807
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You may not have to.

491
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:22,944
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?

492
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,220
Hurry!

493
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,078
- Edmund!
- They'll hear you!

494
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,593
No!

495
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,946
- Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

496
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,450
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

497
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,502
He's the bait!
The Witch wants all four of you!

498
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:28,379
- Why?
- To stop the prophecy from coming true.

499
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,149
To kill you!

500
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,167
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

501
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:46,324
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me!

502
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,730
- You knew this would happen.
- [didn't know.

503
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:51,383
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

504
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,675
Stop it!

505
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,254
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- She's right.

506
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,561
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

507
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,049
Then take us to him.

508
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:17,018
Be still, stranger,
or you'll never move again.

509
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,388
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

510
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:22,853
I met the Queen in the woods!
She told me to come back here!

511
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,657
I'm a Son of Adam!

512
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:29,426
My apologies,
fortunate favorite of the queen.

513
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,937
Or else, not so fortunate.

514
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,224
Right this way.

515
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,151
Wait here.

516
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:42,665
Like it?

517
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,408
Yes, Your Majesty.

518
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:52,124
I thought you might.

519
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:55,944
Tell me, Edmund...

520
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,706
Are your sisters deaf?

521
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,520
No.

522
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,320
And your brother, is he...

523
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,238
. unintelligent?

524
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,680
Well, I think so. But Mum says...

525
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:15,672
Then how dare you come alone?!

526
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,646
- [ tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

527
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,599
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

528
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,328
I did bring them halfway.

529
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,957
They're at the little house at the dam
with the Beavers.

530
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,163
Well.

531
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,925
l suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

532
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,839
Well, l was wondering,

533
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:49,491
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

534
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:57,459
Our guest is hungry.

535
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,431
This way for your num-nums.

536
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:11,167
Maugrim?

537
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,741
You know what to do.

538
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:43,232
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

539
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,423
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

540
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,412
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

541
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:50,993
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

542
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:54,265
It's a long journey and Beaver
gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

543
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,085
I'm cranky now!

544
00:56:58,482 --> 00:56:59,622
Take them.

545
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:06,357
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

546
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:22,905
Hurry.

547
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:41,417
Badger and me dug this.
Comes out right near his place.

548
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,881
You told me it led to your mum's!

549
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,058
Lucy!

550
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,141
They're in the tunnel.

551
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,269
- Quick! This way.
- Hurry!

552
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,567
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

553
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,877
You should have brought a map!

554
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:08,583
There wasn't room next to the jam.

555
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:17,279
Come on, Lucy!

556
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:40,511
I'm so sorry, dear.

557
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,973
He was my best mate.

558
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:53,606
What happened here?

559
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,319
This is what becomes
of those who cross the Witch.

560
00:58:56,733 --> 00:59:00,043
You take one more step, traitor,
and I'll chew you to splinters!

561
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,090
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

562
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:07,077
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot
like one of the bad ones.

563
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,694
An unfortunate family resemblance.

564
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,887
But we can argue breeding later.
Right now we've got to move.

565
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,011
What did you have in mind?

566
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,787
Greetings, gents.

567
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:29,723
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

568
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,569
I know where your allegiance lies.

569
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,609
We're looking for some humans.

570
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,289
Humans? Here in Narnia?

571
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:41,102
That's a valuable bit of information,
don't you think?

572
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,396
Your reward is your life.

573
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,919
It's not much,

574
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,275
but still.

575
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,898
Where are the fugitives?

576
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,727
North. They ran north.

577
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,750
Smell them out.

578
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,786
They were helping Tumnus.
The Witch got here before I did.

579
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,246
Are you all right?

580
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:27,268
Well, l wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite.

581
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:31,624
Stop squirming!
You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

582
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:33,538
Worst day of the year.

583
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,017
Thank you for your kindness,

584
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,269
but that's all the cure I have time for.

585
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:39,471
You're leaving?

586
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:42,828
It has been a pleasure, My Queen,
and an honor, but time is short

587
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,120
and Aslan himself has asked me
to gather more troops.

588
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,236
- You've seen Aslan?
- What's he like?

589
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,200
Like everything we've ever heard.

590
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,750
You'll be glad to have him by your side
in the battle against the Witch.

591
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:59,714
But we're not planning
on fighting any witch.

592
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:02,583
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

593
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,893
We can't go to war without you.

594
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,687
We just want our brother back.

595
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,223
If...

596
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,477
If you're not going to eat that...

597
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:51,386
I'd get up, but...

598
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,432
..but my legs.

599
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,700
Mr. Tumnus.

600
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:10,322
What's left of him.

601
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,433
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

602
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,908
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

603
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,329
Is your sister all right?

604
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,487
Is she safe?

605
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:41,366
I don't know.

606
01:02:48,732 --> 01:02:51,862
My police tore that dam apart.

607
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:56,328
Your little family
are nowhere to be found.

608
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,360
- Where did they go?
- [don't know!

609
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,757
Then you're of no further use to me.

610
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,990
Wait! The beaver
said something about Aslan!

611
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,235
Aslan?

612
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:19,662
Where?

613
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,861
el.
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

614
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:26,998
He can't be expected to know anything.

615
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:32,572
I said... where is Aslan?

616
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:39,314
I... [don't know.

617
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,759
I left before they said anything.

618
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:46,601
l wanted to see you!

619
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,772
Guard!

620
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,174
Your Majesty.

621
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:56,888
Release the faun.

622
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,760
Do you know why you're here, faun?

623
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:18,977
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

624
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,610
You're here...

625
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:26,029
..because he turned you in.

626
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,541
For sweeties.

627
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:39,214
Take him upstairs.

628
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,578
And ready my sleigh.

629
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,224
Edmund misses his family.

630
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:16,046
Now, Aslan's camp
is near the Stone Table

631
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:19,676
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

632
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:22,493
The river's been frozen solid
for a hundred years.

633
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,310
- It's so far.
- It's the world, dear.

634
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:32,433
Did you expect it to be small?

635
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,586
Smaller.

636
01:05:52,649 --> 01:05:55,308
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

637
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:34,294
Come on, humans!
While we're still young.

638
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,918
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

639
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:41,668
I'm gonna turn him
into a big, fluffy hat.

640
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,248
Hurry up! Come on!

641
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:47,881
- He is getting a little bossy.
- No! Behind you! It's her!

642
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,074
- Run! Run!
- Run!

643
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:16,638
Hurry!

644
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,062
Inside!

645
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,977
Dive! Dive!

646
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:27,575
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

647
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,275
Maybe she's gone.

648
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:01,665
- Lsuppose I'll go look.
- No!

649
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:04,325
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

650
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,464
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

651
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,712
Thanks, sweetheart.

652
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,029
What's that? What's...?

653
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,517
Come out! Come out!

654
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,612
l hope you've all been good
‘cause there's someone here to see you!

655
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:52,497
Merry Christmas, sir.

656
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:56,335
It certainly is, Lucy,
since you have arrived.

657
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,469
Look, I've put up with a lot
since I got here, but this...

658
01:09:01,037 --> 01:09:04,077
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

659
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:09,403
but in my defense, I have been driving
one of these longer than the Witch.

660
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:12,895
I thought there was
no Christmas in Narnia.

661
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,599
No. Not for a long time.

662
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:19,795
But the hope that you have brought,
Your Majesties,

663
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:23,790
is finally starting
to weaken the Witch's power.

664
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:28,047
Still, l dare say
you could do with these.

665
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,231
Presents!

666
01:09:39,908 --> 01:09:41,959
The juice of the fire-flower.

667
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:44,831
One drop will cure any injury.

668
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:50,264
And though I hope
you never have to use it...

669
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,326
Thank you, sir,

670
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,645
but I think I could be brave enough.

671
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:01,498
I'm sure you could.

672
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:04,038
But battles are ugly affairs.

673
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,554
Susan.

674
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:20,462
Trust in this bow
and it will not easily miss.

675
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:24,465
What happened
to "battles are ugly affairs"?

676
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,866
Though you don't seem to have
a problem making yourself heard,

677
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,986
blow on this and wherever you are,

678
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,223
help will come.

679
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,177
Thanks.

680
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,846
Peter.

681
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:46,022
The time to use these
may be near at hand.

682
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:55,867
Thank you, sir.

683
01:10:56,786 --> 01:11:00,156
These are tools, not toys.

684
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,650
Bear them well and wisely.

685
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,997
Now, I must be off.

686
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:09,646
Winter is almost over,

687
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:13,932
and things do pile up
when you've been gone a hundred years.

688
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,740
Long live Aslan!

689
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,191
And Merry Christmas!

690
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:29,163
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

691
01:11:29,552 --> 01:11:32,482
- See you next year!
- Goodbye!

692
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,765
Told you he was real.

693
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:39,611
He said winter was almost over.

694
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:42,073
You know what that means.

695
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:46,043
No more ice.

696
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:59,312
- We need to cross, now!
- Don't beavers make dams?

697
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,742
- I'm not that fast, dear.
- Come on!

698
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,074
Wait! Will you think
about this for a minute?

699
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,880
- We don't have a minute.
- I'm just trying to be realistic.

700
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:10,390
No, you're trying to be smart.
As usual.

701
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:47,483
Wait. Maybe I should go first.

702
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:49,477
Maybe you should.

703
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:59,209
You've been sneaking
second helpings, haven't you?

704
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:01,859
Well, you never know
which meal's gonna be your last.

705
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:03,915
Especially with your cooking.

706
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,795
If Mum knew what we were doing...

707
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:27,331
Mum's not here.

708
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,405
Oh, no!

709
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:32,971
Run!

710
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:37,855
Hurry!

711
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:50,805
- No!
- Peter!

712
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:53,334
Put that down, boy.

713
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:57,099
- Someone could get hurt.
- Don't worry about me!

714
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:58,766
Run him through!

715
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:02,251
Leave now while you can,
and your brother leaves with you.

716
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,382
Stop, Peter!
Maybe we should listen to him!

717
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,268
Smart girl.

718
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:10,413
Don't listen to him!
Kill him! Kill him now!

719
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,780
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.

720
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:17,320
All my Queen wants is for you
to take your family and go.

721
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,280
Look, just because some man
in a red coat hands you a sword,

722
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:23,820
it doesn't make you a hero!
Just drop it!

723
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:26,607
No, Peter! Narnia needs you!

724
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:29,016
Gut him while you still have a chance!

725
01:14:29,365 --> 01:14:32,965
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam?
I won't wait forever.

726
01:14:33,536 --> 01:14:35,056
And neither will the river.

727
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:38,253
Peter!

728
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,382
Hold onto me!

729
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:49,848
Lovely.

730
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:00,164
What have you done?

731
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:04,635
Lucy!

732
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:07,942
Lucy!

733
01:16:12,468 --> 01:16:14,367
Has anyone seen my coat?

734
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,943
Don't you worry, dear.

735
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:26,115
Your brother's got you
well looked after.

736
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,862
And I don't think you'll be
needing those coats anymore.

737
01:17:05,254 --> 01:17:08,384
It's so warm out.

738
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:14,444
I'll go and check the sleigh.

739
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:18,029
Your Majesty.

740
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,930
We found the traitor. He was rallying
your enemies near the Shuddering Woods.

741
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:25,696
Nice of you to drop in.

742
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:28,111
You were so helpful
to my wolves last night.

743
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:31,064
Perhaps you can help me now.

744
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:34,847
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Oh, don't waste time with flattery.

745
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:39,364
Not to seem rude,
but I wasn't actually talking to you.

746
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,687
Where are the humans headed?

747
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:58,857
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said
something about the Stone Table,

748
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:01,085
and that Aslan had an army there.

749
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,199
An army?

750
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:12,292
Thank you, Edmund.

751
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:15,691
I'm glad this creature
got to see some honesty...

752
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,086
- ...before he dies.
- No!

753
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:33,746
Think about whose side you're on,
Edmund.

754
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,110
Mine...

755
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:39,987
..or theirs.

756
01:18:45,688 --> 01:18:48,708
Go on ahead. Gather the faithful.

757
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,121
If i's a war Aslan wants...

758
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:56,186
.it's a war he shall get.

759
01:19:57,693 --> 01:20:00,033
Why are they all staring at us?

760
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:02,569
Maybe they think you look funny.

761
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:11,129
Stop your fussing. You look lovely.

762
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,871
We have come to see Aslan.

763
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:18,878
Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam.

764
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:22,805
Welcome, Susan and Lucy,
Daughters of Eve.

765
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:26,505
And welcome to you, Beavers.
You have my thanks.

766
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,795
But where is the fourth?

767
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:33,262
That's why we're here, sir.

768
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:34,979
We need your help.

769
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,974
We had a little trouble along the way.

770
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:40,477
Our brother's been captured
by the White Witch.

771
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:43,349
Captured? How could this happen?

772
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,714
He betrayed them, Your Majesty.

773
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,078
- Then he has betrayed us all!
- Peace, Oreius.

774
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:55,339
I'm sure there's an explanation.

775
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:00,536
It's my fault, really.

776
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:04,491
Il was too hard on him.

777
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,519
We all were.

778
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:12,236
Sir, he's our brother.

779
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:14,278
I know, dear one.

780
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,766
But that only makes
the betrayal all the worse.

781
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,154
This may be harder than you think.

782
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:32,737
That is Cair Paravel,
the castle of the four thrones.

783
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:38,089
In one of which you will sit, Peter,
as High King.

784
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:41,361
You doubt the prophecy?

785
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,743
No. That's just it.

786
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:49,237
Aslan, I'm not what you all think l am.

787
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,745
Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley.

788
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:56,728
Beaver also mentioned that you
planned on turning him into a hat.

789
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,909
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,

790
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:05,873
more powerful than any of us,

791
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:08,108
that rules over all of Narnia.

792
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:10,700
It defines right from wrong,

793
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:12,836
and governs all our destinies.

794
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:16,545
Yours... and mine.

795
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,192
But I couldn't even
protect my own family.

796
01:23:19,528 --> 01:23:21,458
You've brought them safely this far.

797
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,004
Not all of them.

798
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:28,109
Peter, I will do what I can
to help your brother,

799
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:31,424
but I need you to consider
what I ask of you.

800
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:35,964
I, too, want my family safe.

801
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:42,918
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

802
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:46,474
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

803
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:52,734
Special treatment for the special boy!

804
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:56,633
Isn't that what you wanted?

805
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:01,291
You look like Mum.

806
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,150
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

807
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:09,338
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

808
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,596
If we ever get back.

809
01:24:16,952 --> 01:24:18,292
I'm sorry I'm like that.

810
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:23,696
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

811
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:28,002
Yes. Before you got boring.

812
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:29,857
Oh, really?

813
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:44,872
Please don't try to run.

814
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:48,513
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

815
01:24:53,889 --> 01:24:55,119
Susan!

816
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:06,032
Get back!

817
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:08,872
Peter!

818
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,102
Come on.

819
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:15,851
We've already been through this before.

820
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,528
We both know you haven't got it in you.

821
01:25:18,914 --> 01:25:20,464
Peter! Watch out!

822
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:33,855
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

823
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:37,800
You may think you're a king,

824
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,153
but you're going to die...

825
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:42,462
- .. like a dog!
- Look out!

826
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:44,902
Peter!

827
01:26:02,391 --> 01:26:03,620
After him.

828
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:06,733
He'll lead you to Edmund.

829
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:12,806
Peter.

830
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,105
Clean your sword.

831
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:24,041
Rise, Sir Peter Wolfs-Bane,

832
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,140
Knight of Narnia.

833
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,292
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

834
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:58,160
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send dwarfs in first.

835
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,165
The prisoner!

836
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,990
You're not going to kill me?

837
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:45,088
Not yet.

838
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:50,629
We have work to do.

839
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:23,563
Edmund!

840
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:57,719
What's done is done.

841
01:28:58,066 --> 01:29:01,666
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

842
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,472
Hello.

843
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:29,411
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

844
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,885
Get some sleep.

845
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:41,981
And Edmund...

846
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:45,842
..try not to wander off.

847
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:01,536
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

848
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:06,558
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

849
01:30:07,035 --> 01:30:08,235
We're going home?

850
01:30:09,337 --> 01:30:10,417
You are.

851
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:14,362
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

852
01:30:15,543 --> 01:30:17,732
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

853
01:30:18,113 --> 01:30:19,373
But they need us.

854
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:23,610
All four of us.

855
01:30:23,952 --> 01:30:25,622
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

856
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:28,171
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

857
01:30:29,224 --> 01:30:31,744
Which is why we have to stay.

858
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:37,985
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

859
01:30:39,968 --> 01:30:43,308
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

860
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:52,256
l suppose that's it then.

861
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,186
Where are you going?

862
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:00,326
To get in some practice.

863
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:26,335
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

864
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:28,861
- En garde!
- Now block.

865
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:33,482
- Hey!
- Peter! Edmund!

866
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:36,519
Whoa, horsie!

867
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:39,128
My name is Philip.

868
01:31:39,461 --> 01:31:41,041
Sorry.

869
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,608
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

870
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:46,436
She's on her way here.

871
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:49,803
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

872
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:51,204
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

873
01:31:51,473 --> 01:31:55,223
- Go away, Witch!
- Empress of the Lone Islands!

874
01:31:56,444 --> 01:31:59,074
You don't belong here! Go away!

875
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:25,518
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

876
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,760
His offense was not against you.

877
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:35,517
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

878
01:32:35,984 --> 01:32:39,054
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

879
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,424
l was there when it was written.

880
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:46,998
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

881
01:32:49,097 --> 01:32:51,647
His blood is my property.

882
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:53,147
Try and take him then.

883
01:32:57,105 --> 01:33:01,235
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

884
01:33:02,444 --> 01:33:03,994
little King?

885
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:10,178
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

886
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:13,617
all of Narnia will be overturned

887
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:16,839
and perish in fire and water.

888
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:20,012
That boy will die

889
01:33:20,462 --> 01:33:22,212
on the Stone Table...

890
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:27,866
..a8 is tradition.

891
01:33:30,505 --> 01:33:32,695
You dare not refuse me.

892
01:33:33,475 --> 01:33:34,705
Enough.

893
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:39,906
I shall talk with you alone.

894
01:34:33,535 --> 01:34:36,025
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

895
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:40,929
How do I know your promise will be kept?

896
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:35,661
Susan!

897
01:36:26,848 --> 01:36:29,338
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

898
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:34,236
We couldn't sleep.

899
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:37,610
Please, Aslan.

900
01:36:38,426 --> 01:36:39,916
Couldn't we come with you?

901
01:36:40,194 --> 01:36:42,944
I would be glad of the company
for a while.

902
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:46,608
Thank you.

903
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:12,312
It is time.

904
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:15,613
From here, I must go on alone.

905
01:37:16,097 --> 01:37:17,357
But Aslan...

906
01:37:17,598 --> 01:37:20,698
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

907
01:37:21,703 --> 01:37:23,253
Thank you, Susan.

908
01:37:23,538 --> 01:37:25,678
Thank you, Lucy.

909
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,850
And farewell.

910
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:36,924
Behold. The great lion.

911
01:39:03,371 --> 01:39:04,831
Do you want some milk?

912
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:08,040
Why doesn't he fight back?

913
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:10,904
Bind him!

914
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,310
Tie him up! Get him!

915
01:39:21,389 --> 01:39:22,819
Wait!

916
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:25,750
Let him first be shaved.

917
01:39:48,082 --> 01:39:49,452
Bring him to me.

918
01:40:50,745 --> 01:40:53,144
You know, Aslan,

919
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:55,538
I'm a little disappointed in you.

920
01:40:57,685 --> 01:41:01,315
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

921
01:41:04,926 --> 01:41:07,446
You are giving me your life

922
01:41:07,862 --> 01:41:09,592
and saving no one.

923
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:14,433
So much for love.

924
01:41:23,544 --> 01:41:25,474
Tonight...

925
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:30,454
..the Deep Magic will be appeased!

926
01:41:34,555 --> 01:41:36,925
But tomorrow,

927
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:42,199
we will take Narnia

928
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,813
forever!

929
01:41:51,973 --> 01:41:53,873
In that knowledge,

930
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:56,758
despair...

931
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:08,383
..and die!

932
01:42:27,274 --> 01:42:28,974
The Great Cat...

933
01:42:29,276 --> 01:42:31,175
.1S dead!

934
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:37,460
General.

935
01:42:37,785 --> 01:42:39,245
Prepare your troops for battle.

936
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:45,964
However short it may be.

937
01:43:33,908 --> 01:43:36,248
It's too late.

938
01:43:36,644 --> 01:43:38,694
He's gone.

939
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:01,232
He must have known what he was doing.

940
01:44:34,702 --> 01:44:37,862
Get away! Get away, all of you!

941
01:44:38,372 --> 01:44:41,062
No. Look.

942
01:45:02,263 --> 01:45:04,603
We have to tell the others.

943
01:45:05,432 --> 01:45:08,652
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

944
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:11,160
They need to know.

945
01:45:17,678 --> 01:45:19,488
The trees.

946
01:46:03,924 --> 01:46:05,674
Be still, my Princes.

947
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:10,594
I bring grave news from your sisters.

948
01:46:26,013 --> 01:46:27,623
She's right.

949
01:46:31,018 --> 01:46:32,658
He's gone.

950
01:46:38,325 --> 01:46:40,224
Then you'll have to lead us.

951
01:46:42,596 --> 01:46:47,255
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

952
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:51,068
- lL can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

953
01:46:54,475 --> 01:46:56,205
And so dol.

954
01:47:04,118 --> 01:47:07,598
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

955
01:47:53,667 --> 01:47:56,857
They come, Your Highness, in numbers
and weapons far greater than our own.

956
01:47:57,371 --> 01:47:59,271
Numbers do not win a battle.

957
01:47:59,606 --> 01:48:02,976
No. But I bet they help.

958
01:49:33,467 --> 01:49:35,687
l have no interest in prisoners.

959
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,679
Kill them all.

960
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:28,744
Go on!

961
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:37,529
Look to the sky!

962
01:51:04,758 --> 01:51:06,458
Are you with me?

963
01:51:07,895 --> 01:51:09,095
To the death.

964
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:16,469
For Narnia and for Aslan!

965
01:51:21,108 --> 01:51:22,568
Go!

966
01:51:23,443 --> 01:51:25,843
Go! For Aslan!

967
01:52:58,338 --> 01:52:59,208
We should go.

968
01:53:05,846 --> 01:53:07,455
I'm so cold.

969
01:53:33,907 --> 01:53:35,517
Susan!

970
01:53:51,892 --> 01:53:53,702
Where's Aslan?

971
01:53:55,395 --> 01:53:57,065
What have they done?

972
01:54:07,407 --> 01:54:08,777
Aslan!

973
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:19,294
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

974
01:54:19,653 --> 01:54:22,753
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

975
01:54:23,256 --> 01:54:26,186
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

976
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:28,970
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

977
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:31,323
is killed in a traitor's stead,

978
01:54:31,665 --> 01:54:34,535
the Stone Table will crack

979
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:38,221
and even death itself will turn
backwards.

980
01:54:38,739 --> 01:54:40,959
We sent the news that you were dead.

981
01:54:41,341 --> 01:54:43,271
Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

982
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:44,839
We have to help them.

983
01:54:45,078 --> 01:54:48,418
We will, dear one, but not alone.

984
01:54:49,282 --> 01:54:50,772
Climb on my back.

985
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:53,451
We have far to go
and little time to get there.

986
01:54:53,854 --> 01:54:56,254
And you may want to cover your ears.

987
01:55:17,477 --> 01:55:19,227
Fire!

988
01:55:39,132 --> 01:55:40,741
Yes!

989
01:55:53,213 --> 01:55:55,793
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

990
01:55:57,818 --> 01:55:59,778
That's the signal. Come on!

991
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:09,121
Where are we going?

992
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:20,938
Hang on!

993
01:56:22,375 --> 01:56:23,745
Fall back!

994
01:56:25,779 --> 01:56:27,069
Go on, fall back!

995
01:57:03,917 --> 01:57:05,087
Stop!

996
01:59:17,751 --> 01:59:19,391
Susan, this is...

997
01:59:19,686 --> 01:59:21,056
Mr. Tumnus!

998
01:59:22,789 --> 01:59:25,659
Come, we must hurry
and search the castle.

999
01:59:26,126 --> 01:59:28,556
Peter will need everyone we can find.

1000
01:59:55,522 --> 01:59:57,802
Edmund! There's too many!

1001
01:59:58,191 --> 01:59:59,561
Get out of here!

1002
01:59:59,826 --> 02:00:02,406
Get the girls and get them home!

1003
02:00:05,231 --> 02:00:07,451
You heard him! Let's go!

1004
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:28,750
Peter said get out of here!

1005
02:00:29,022 --> 02:00:30,632
Peter's not king yet.

1006
02:02:07,887 --> 02:02:09,257
Impossible!

1007
02:03:23,963 --> 02:03:25,133
It is finished.

1008
02:03:26,799 --> 02:03:28,879
- Peter!
- Peter!

1009
02:03:34,774 --> 02:03:36,644
Where's Edmund?

1010
02:03:48,454 --> 02:03:50,063
Edmund!

1011
02:04:42,909 --> 02:04:45,079
When are you gonna learn
to do as you're told?

1012
02:06:20,773 --> 02:06:23,383
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

1013
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:27,760
I give you Queen Lucy, the Valiant.

1014
02:06:53,072 --> 02:06:55,212
To the great Western Wood,

1015
02:06:55,575 --> 02:06:59,385
King Edmund, the Just.

1016
02:07:01,013 --> 02:07:03,853
To the radiant Southern Sun,

1017
02:07:05,318 --> 02:07:08,598
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

1018
02:07:09,856 --> 02:07:12,666
And to the clear Northern Sky,

1019
02:07:13,126 --> 02:07:16,376
I give you King Peter,

1020
02:07:16,896 --> 02:07:18,946
the Magnificent.

1021
02:07:22,668 --> 02:07:25,277
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

1022
02:07:25,705 --> 02:07:28,545
always a King or Queen.

1023
02:07:29,008 --> 02:07:30,558
May your wisdom grace us

1024
02:07:30,843 --> 02:07:33,593
until the stars rain down
from the heavens.

1025
02:07:34,046 --> 02:07:36,126
Long live King Peter!

1026
02:07:36,482 --> 02:07:38,822
Long live King Edmund!

1027
02:07:39,218 --> 02:07:41,468
Long live Queen Susan!

1028
02:07:41,854 --> 02:07:44,814
Long live Queen Lucy!

1029
02:08:09,448 --> 02:08:10,908
Don't worry.

1030
02:08:13,085 --> 02:08:14,815
We'll see him again.

1031
02:08:15,121 --> 02:08:18,281
- When?
- In time.

1032
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:23,011
One day he'll be here
and the next he won't.

1033
02:08:25,398 --> 02:08:27,098
But you mustn't press him.

1034
02:08:28,167 --> 02:08:30,827
After all, he's not a tame lion.

1035
02:08:31,837 --> 02:08:33,827
No.

1036
02:08:34,173 --> 02:08:35,873
But he is good.

1037
02:08:36,842 --> 02:08:38,272
Here.

1038
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:42,068
You need it more than I do.

1039
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:39,969
Are you all right, Philip?

1040
02:09:40,306 --> 02:09:42,326
I'm not as young as I once was.

1041
02:09:45,111 --> 02:09:46,721
Come on, Ed.

1042
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:50,010
- Catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

1043
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:52,529
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

1044
02:09:52,885 --> 02:09:54,785
I'll get the stag myself."

1045
02:10:00,426 --> 02:10:02,036
What's this?

1046
02:10:07,767 --> 02:10:09,876
It seems familiar.

1047
02:10:12,605 --> 02:10:14,304
As if from a dream.

1048
02:10:14,607 --> 02:10:16,417
Or a dream of a dream.

1049
02:10:19,945 --> 02:10:21,965
Spare Oom.

1050
02:10:25,084 --> 02:10:27,334
- Lucy!
- Not again.

1051
02:10:29,355 --> 02:10:31,544
- Lu?
- Come on!

1052
02:10:42,835 --> 02:10:44,205
These aren't branches.

1053
02:10:46,972 --> 02:10:49,661
- They're coats.
- Susan, you're on my foot!

1054
02:10:50,109 --> 02:10:52,039
Peter, move off!

1055
02:10:52,378 --> 02:10:54,277
- Stop shoving.
- Stop it!

1056
02:10:54,613 --> 02:10:56,223
I'm not on your toe!

1057
02:11:14,266 --> 02:11:15,665
There you are.

1058
02:11:18,437 --> 02:11:20,867
What were you all doing in the wardrobe?

1059
02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:25,569
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

1060
02:11:31,684 --> 02:11:32,994
Try me.

1061
02:12:36,048 --> 02:12:38,478
I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

1062
02:12:41,921 --> 02:12:46,021
You see... I've already tried.

1063
02:12:48,627 --> 02:12:50,377
Will we ever go back?

1064
02:12:50,696 --> 02:12:52,186
Oh, I expect so.

1065
02:12:53,532 --> 02:12:56,142
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

1066
02:12:59,038 --> 02:13:00,468
All the same...

1067
02:13:00,739 --> 02:13:02,959
..best to keep your eyes open.
