1
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:34,247
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,908
We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot

3
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,200
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

4
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,000
A pirate's life for me

5
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:54,294
We extort, we pilfer,
we filch and sack

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,848
Drink up

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,166
Quiet, missy.

8
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,671
Cursed pirates sail
these waters.

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,550
You don't want to bring them.

10
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,138
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

11
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,491
She was singing about pirates.

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,353
It's bad luck to be singing
about pirates

13
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,445
with us mired
in this unnatural fog.

14
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:11,791
Mark my words.

15
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,705
Consider them marked.

16
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,155
On your way.

17
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,336
Aye, Lieutenant.

18
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,824
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board, too.

19
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,613
Even a miniature one.

20
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,856
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

21
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,104
Think again, Miss Swann.

22
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,823
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of them.

23
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,914
l intend that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

24
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,762
or wears a pirate brand gets
what he deserves.

25
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,879
A short drop and a sudden stop.

26
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,349
Lieutenant Norrington,
l appreciate your fervor,

27
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,044
but I'm concerned
about the effect

28
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,524
this subject will have
upon my daughter.

29
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,519
My apologies, Governor Swann.

30
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,595
Actually,
I find it all fascinating.

31
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,227
Yes.
That's what concerns me.

32
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,194
Look! A boy!
There's a boy in the water!

33
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,689
Man overboard!

34
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,175
Man the ropes.
Fetch a hook.

35
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,134
Haul him aboard.

36
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,391
He's still breathing.

37
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,980
Mary, Mother of God.

38
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,848
What happened here?

39
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,477
It's the powder magazine.

40
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,826
Merchant vessels run
heavily armed.

41
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,220
A lot of good it did them.

42
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,863
Everyone's thinking it.
I'm just saying it.

43
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,539
Pirates.

44
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,968
There's no proof of that.
It's probably an accident.

45
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,149
Rouse the captain immediately.

46
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,125
Heave to and take in sail.
Launch the boats.

47
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,227
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

48
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,487
He'll be in your charge.

49
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,243
Take care of him.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,580
It's okay.

51
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,332
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

52
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,959
Will Turner.

53
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,041
I'm watching over you, Will.

54
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,822
You're a pirate.

55
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,828
Has he said anything?

56
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,787
His name's William Turner.
That's alll found out.

57
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,234
Take him below.

58
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,852
Are you all right?

59
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,792
Are you decent?

60
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,217
Yes.

61
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,025
Yes.

62
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,004
Still abed at this hour?

63
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,620
Oh, it's a beautiful day.

64
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,587
l have a gift for you.

65
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,132
Oh, it's beautiful.

66
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,598
Isn't it?

67
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,007
May I inquire
as to the occasion?

68
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,293
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

69
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,961
Go on.

70
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,768
Actually, ...

71
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,758
I hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

72
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,317
The ceremony?

73
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,008
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

74
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,148
I knew it.

75
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,219
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

76
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,089
A fine gentleman,
don't you think?

77
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,392
He fancies you, you know.

78
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,589
How's it coming?

79
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,003
It's difficult to say.

80
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,477
I'm told it's the latest fashion
in London.

81
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:46,266
Well, women in London
must've learnt not to breathe.

82
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,224
Milord, you have a visitor.

83
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,174
Mr. Turner.

84
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,796
Good to see you again.

85
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,464
Good day, sir.

86
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,306
I have your order.

87
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,337
Well.

88
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,531
The blade is folded steel.

89
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,687
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

90
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,667
If l may.

91
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,457
Perfectly balanced.

92
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,529
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

93
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,168
Impressive.
Very impressive.

94
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,926
Now, now.

95
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,795
Commodore Norrington is going
to be very pleased with this.

96
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,176
Do pass my compliments on
to your master.

97
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,911
I shall.

98
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,578
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

99
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,001
Elizabeth,
you look absolutely stunning.

100
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,137
It's so good to see you.

101
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,539
I had a dream about you
last night.

102
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:09,587
About me?

103
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,655
Yes, is that entirely proper
for you --

104
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,862
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

105
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,944
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

106
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,922
How many times must! ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

107
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,586
At least once more,
Miss Swann, as always.

108
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,093
There. See?

109
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,383
At least the boy has a sense
of propriety.

110
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,900
We really must be going.
There you are.

111
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,160
Good day, Mr. Turner.

112
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,453
Come along.

113
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,949
Good day.

114
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,667
Hold up, there, you.

115
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,653
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat at the dock.

116
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,762
And I shall need to know
your name.

117
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,006
What do you say
to three shillings,

118
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,062
and we forget the name?

119
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,867
Welcome to Port Royal,
Mr. Smith.

120
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,992
Two paces march!

121
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,480
Right about-face!

122
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,698
Present arms!

123
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,915
This dock is off limits
to civilians.

124
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,891
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't know.

125
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,279
If 1 see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

126
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,679
There's some sort of high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort.

127
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,059
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen such as yourselves

128
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,955
did not merit an invitation?

129
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,992
Someone has to make sure
this dock stays off limits.

130
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,012
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

131
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,959
But it seems to me
that a ship like that

132
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,468
makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

133
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,461
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true.

134
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,837
But there's no ship as can match
the interceptor for speed.

135
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,274
I've heard of one.

136
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,352
It's supposed to be very fast.
Nigh uncatchable.

137
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,368
The Black Pearl.

138
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:40,672
Well, there's no real ship
as can match the Interceptor.

139
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,157
Black Pearl is a real ship.

140
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,043
No.
No, it's not.

141
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,821
Yes, it is.
I've seen it.

142
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,360
You've seen it?

143
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,361
Yes.

144
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,265
You haven't seen it.

145
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,621
Yes, I have.

146
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,679
You've seen a ship
with black sails

147
00:12:56,142 --> 00:13:00,012
that's crewed by the damned
and captained by a man so evil

148
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,543
that Hell itself
spat him back out?

149
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,067
No.

150
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,574
No.

151
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,718
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

152
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,089
No ship that's not crewed
by the damned

153
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,944
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell spat him out

154
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,051
could possibly have black sails,
therefore couldn't be

155
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,638
any other ship
than the Black Pearl.

156
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,295
Is that what you're saying?

157
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:23,692
No.

158
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,423
Like I said,
there's no real ship

159
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,029
as can match the Interceptor.

160
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,209
You!

161
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,438
Get away from there!

162
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,729
You don't have permission
to be there.

163
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,075
I'm sorry.
It's such a pretty boat.

164
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,381
Ship.

165
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,458
What's your name?

166
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,906
Smith.
Or Smithy, if you like.

167
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,252
What's your purpose
in Port Royal, Mr. Smith?

168
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:50,719
Yeah.
And no lies.

169
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,920
Well, then, I confess.

170
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,180
It is my intention to
commandeer one of these ships,

171
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,171
pick up a crew in Tortuga,
raid, pillage, plunder,

172
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,901
and otherwise pilfer
my weaselly black guts out.

173
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,207
-l said no lies.
-l think he's telling the truth.

174
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,897
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

175
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:12,284
Unless you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

176
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,652
May I have a moment?

177
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,246
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

178
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:42,743
l apologize if 1 seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

179
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,175
This promotion throws
into sharp relief

180
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,834
that which I have not yet
achieved.

181
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,195
A marriage to a fine woman.

182
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,117
You have become
a fine woman, Elizabeth.

183
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,266
I can't breathe.

184
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,997
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

185
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,297
And then they made me
their chief.

186
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,450
My God.

187
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,391
The rocks!

188
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,773
Sir, it's a miracle
she missed them.

189
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,741
-Will you be saving her?
-l can't swim.

190
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,722
Pride of the King's Navy,
you are.

191
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,733
Do not lose these.

192
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,924
What was that?

193
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,049
Make way!

194
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,471
I got her!

195
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,670
She's not breathing!

196
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,298
Move!

197
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,209
I never would've thought
of that.

198
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,651
Clearly you've never been
to Singapore.

199
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,335
Where did you get that?

200
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,346
On your feet.

201
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,126
Are you all right?

202
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,523
Yes, I'm fine.

203
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:10,999
Shoot him.

204
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:11,983
-Father.
-What?

205
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,233
Commodore, do you really
intend to kill my rescuer?

206
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,390
I believe thanks are in order.

207
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,411
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we, pirate?

208
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,253
Hang him.

209
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:39,178
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

210
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,749
Well, well.

211
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,070
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

212
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,979
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

213
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,978
Well, 1 don't see
your ship, Captain.

214
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,482
I'm in the market, as it were.

215
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,507
He said he'd come
to commandeer one.

216
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,996
Told you he was telling
the truth. These are his, sir.

217
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,949
No additional shot nor powder.

218
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,371
A compass
that doesn't point North.

219
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,851
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

220
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:20,563
You are without doubt the worst
pirate I've ever heard of.

221
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,939
But you have heard of me.

222
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,641
Commodore,
l really must protest.

223
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,437
Carefully, Lieutenant.

224
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,699
Pirate or not,
this man saved my life.

225
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,824
One good deed is not enough
to redeem a man

226
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,376
of a lifetime of wickedness.

227
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,575
Though it seems enough
to condemn him.

228
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,377
Indeed.

229
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,519
Finally.

230
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,088
No.

231
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,139
No! Don't shoot!

232
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,073
I knew you'd warm up to me.

233
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,412
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

234
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,021
And my hat.

235
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,300
Commodore.

236
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,814
-It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
-It's Miss Swann.

237
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,230
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

238
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:03,033
Come, come, dear.
We don't have all day.

239
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,844
Now if you'll be very kind.

240
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,331
Easy on the goods, darling.

241
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,562
You're despicable.

242
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,580
Sticks and stones, love.

243
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:33,062
I saved your life.
You save mine. We're square.

244
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,641
Gentlemen, milady,
you will always remember this

245
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:41,593
as the day that you almost
caught Captain Jack Sparrow.

246
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,353
Now will you shoot him?

247
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,504
Open fire!

248
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,213
On his heels!

249
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,628
Take cover, man!

250
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,970
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

251
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,851
I would hate for him to miss it.

252
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,760
Search upstairs!

253
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,785
Look lively, men!

254
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,564
Right where I left you.

255
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,603
Not where I left you.

256
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,235
You're the one they're hunting.

257
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,291
The pirate.

258
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:47,227
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

259
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,976
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

260
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,933
It would be a shame to
put a mark on your record.

261
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,980
So if you'll excuse me.

262
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,992
Do you think this wise, boy?

263
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:05,098
Crossing blades with a pirate?

264
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,541
You threatened Miss Swann.

265
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,492
Only a little.

266
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,540
You know what you're doing. I'll
give you that. Excellent form.

267
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,278
But how's your footwork?

268
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,454
If l step here.

269
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,576
Very good.

270
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,594
And now I step again.

271
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,256
That is a wonderful trick.

272
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,014
Except, once again, you are
between me and my way out.

273
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,299
And now you have no weapon.

274
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,475
Who makes all these?

275
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,328
Ido.

276
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:44,586
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

277
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,098
You need to find yourself
a girl, mate.

278
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,724
Or perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

279
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,333
is that you found one

280
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:03,405
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

281
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,933
You're not a eunuch, are you?

282
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,961
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate,

283
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,517
I can kill it!

284
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:28,856
You cheated.

285
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,164
Pirate.

286
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:34,882
Move away.

287
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,264
No.

288
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:37,985
-Please move.
-No.

289
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,923
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

290
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,199
This shot is not meant for you.

291
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,504
There he is!
Over here!

292
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,815
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

293
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,655
You've assisted in the capture
of a fugitive.

294
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,958
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

295
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,648
I trust you will
remember this is the day

296
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,220
Captain Jack Sparrow
almost escaped.

297
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,043
Take him away.

298
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,063
-Can you smell it?
-Come here.

299
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,799
-It's marrowbone.
-Come here.

300
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,658
-Want a juicy bone?
-Come here.

301
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,436
-Come here, boy!
-Come on.

302
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,309
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

303
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:35,843
Oh, excuse us

304
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,924
if we haven't resigned ourself
to the gallows just yet.

305
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,221
There you go, miss.

306
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,809
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

307
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,542
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose.

308
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,188
I must admit,
l wasn't prepared for it.

309
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:59,294
I meant you being threatened by
that pirate. Sounds terrifying.

310
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,730
Yes, it was terrifying.

311
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,885
But the commodore proposed.
Fancy that.

312
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,631
Now, that's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

313
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,555
It is a smart match.

314
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,708
He's a fine man.

315
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,001
He's what any woman should dream
of marrying.

316
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:23,248
Well, that Will Turner.
He's a fine man, too.

317
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,535
That is too bold.

318
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,267
Well, begging your pardon, miss.
It was not my place.

319
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:21,137
Has my daughter given you
an answer yet?

320
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,200
No, she hasn't.

321
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,104
Well, she has had
a very trying day.

322
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,432
Ghastly weather,
don't you think?

323
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,848
Bleak. Very bleak.

324
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,111
What's that?

325
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,190
Cannon fire!

326
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,350
Return fire!

327
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,989
-l know those guns.
-Men to arms!

328
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,437
It's the Peart.

329
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,566
The Black Pearl?

330
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,370
I've heard stories.

331
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,972
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near 10 years.

332
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,839
Never leaves any survivors.

333
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,090
No survivors?

334
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:07,045
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

335
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,694
Coming through!

336
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,658
Sight the muzzle flash!

337
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,918
Aim for the flashes!

338
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,774
I need a full strike,
fore and aft.

339
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,319
Mr. Stephens, more cartridges!

340
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:50,185
Governor, barricade yourself
in my office.

341
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,027
That's an order.

342
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,000
Don't!

343
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,781
Hello, chum.

344
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,337
Up there.

345
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,775
Up there!

346
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,699
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you!

347
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:33,694
What?

348
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,582
You're the governor's daughter.

349
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,177
In here!

350
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,240
Listen.
They haven't seen you.

351
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,665
The first chance you get,
run to the fort.

352
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:52,872
Gotcha.

353
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,763
No! No! No!
It's hot!

354
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,072
You burned me!

355
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,360
Come on!

356
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:50,285
We know you're here, poppet.

357
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:51,789
Poppet.

358
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:56,477
Come out and we promise
we won't hurt you.

359
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,920
We will find you, poppet.

360
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:07,064
You've got something of ours,
and it calls to us.

361
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:15,493
The gold calls to us.

362
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:18,101
Gold.

363
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,695
Hello, poppet.

364
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,781
Parley.

365
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:28,649
What?

366
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,820
Parley.

367
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,875
l invoke the right of parley.

368
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,313
According to the Code
of the Brethren

369
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,237
set down by the pirates Morgan
and Bartholomew,

370
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,800
you have to take me
to your captain.

371
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,442
I know the Code.

372
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,080
If an adversary demands parley,

373
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,364
you can do them no harm
until the parley is complete.

374
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:43,853
To blazes with the Code.

375
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,692
She wants to be taken
to the captain.

376
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,688
And she'll go without a fuss.

377
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,815
We must honor the Code.

378
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,569
Say goodbye.

379
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,015
Goodbye.

380
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,871
Come on!

381
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,335
Out of my way, scum!

382
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,900
My sympathies, friend.

383
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,101
You've no manner of luck at all.

384
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,332
Come on, doggy.

385
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,205
It's just you and me now.

386
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,582
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

387
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,457
Come on.
That's a boy.

388
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,639
Good boy.
Come get the bone.

389
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,375
That's a good boy.
Come on.

390
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,603
A bit closer.
A bit closer.

391
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,645
That's it.
That's it, doggy.

392
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:26,017
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur.

393
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,038
Don't do that.

394
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,959
No, no!
I didn't mean it!

395
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,275
I didn't.

396
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,846
This ain't the armory.

397
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,882
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Twigg.

398
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,660
Captain Jack Sparrow.

399
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,607
Last time I saw you,

400
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,982
you were all alone
on a godforsaken island,

401
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,513
shrinking into the distance.

402
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,069
His fortunes aren't
improved much.

403
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:03,412
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

404
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,607
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

405
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,758
and mutineers.

406
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,517
So there is a curse.

407
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,196
That's interesting.

408
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,832
You know nothing of hell.

409
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,426
That's very interesting.

410
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,006
I didn't know
we was taking on captives.

411
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,199
She's invoked the right
of parley with Captain Barbossa.

412
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,936
-I'm here to --
-You'll speak when spoken to.

413
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,750
And ye will not lay a hand

414
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:21,066
on those under the protection
of parley.

415
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,086
Aye, sir.

416
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,810
My apologies, miss.

417
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:31,316
Captain Barbossa,
lam here to negotiate

418
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,495
the cessation of hostilities
against Port Royal.

419
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,906
There were a lot
of long words in there.

420
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,968
We're naught but humble pirates.

421
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,848
What is it that you want?

422
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,430
I want you to leave
and never come back.

423
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,818
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

424
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,189
Means "no."

425
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,286
Very well.

426
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,206
I'll drop it.

427
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,375
Me holds are bursting with swag.

428
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,080
That bit of shine matters to us?

429
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,970
Why?

430
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:14,649
It's what you've been searching
for. l recognize this ship.

431
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,876
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England.

432
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,403
Did you, now?

433
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,007
Fine.

434
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,815
l suppose if it is worthless,

435
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,937
there's no point
in me keeping it.

436
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,084
You have a name, missy?

437
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,978
Elizabeth Turner.

438
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,462
I'm a maid
in the governor's household.

439
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,287
Miss Turner.

440
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,881
Bootstrap.

441
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,009
How does a maid own
a trinket such as that?

442
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,422
Family heirloom, perhaps?

443
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,486
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

444
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,109
Very well.
Hand it over.

445
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,883
We'll put your town to our
rudder and ne'er return.

446
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:30,954
Our bargain?

447
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,584
Still the guns and stow them.

448
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,731
Wait!
You have to take me to shore!

449
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,370
According to the Code --

450
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,646
First, your return to shore
was not part of our agreement.

451
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,387
So I must do nothing.

452
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,192
You must be a pirate for
the Pirate's Code to apply,

453
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,435
and you're not.

454
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,836
Thirdly, the Code is more
what you'd call guidelines

455
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:56,813
than actual rules.

456
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,398
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

457
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,589
They've taken her.
They've taken Elizabeth.

458
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,698
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

459
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,370
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

460
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,973
And where do you propose
we start?

461
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:34,667
If you have information
concerning my daughter,

462
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,759
please share it.

463
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,156
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

464
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,014
Mentioned it
is more what he did.

465
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,900
Ask him where it is.
He could lead us to it.

466
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,380
No. The pirates
who invaded this fort

467
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,797
left Sparrow locked in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

468
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,965
We will establish
their most likely course.

469
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:02,055
That's not good enough!

470
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,723
Mr. Turner, you are not
a military man.

471
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,717
You are not a sailor.

472
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,130
You are a blacksmith.

473
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,580
And this is not the moment
for rash actions.

474
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,000
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

475
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:20,398
you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

476
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,116
You.

477
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,279
You are familiar with that ship.
The Black Pearl.

478
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:38,542
I've heard of it.

479
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:39,923
Where does it make berth?

480
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,998
Where does it make berth?

481
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,516
Have you not heard the stories?

482
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:49,724
Captain Barbossa
and his crew of miscreants

483
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,578
sail from the dreaded
Isla de Muerta.

484
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,370
It's an island
that cannot be found,

485
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,039
except by those
who already know where it is.

486
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,716
The ship's real enough.

487
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,779
Its anchorage
must be a real place.

488
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,311
Where is it?

489
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,359
Why ask me?

490
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:07,974
Because you're a pirate.

491
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,709
And you want to turn pirate
yourself, is that it?

492
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,026
Never.

493
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:17,908
They took Miss Swann.

494
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,209
Oh, so it is
that you found a girl.

495
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:23,315
Il see. Well, if you're intending
to brave all,

496
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:27,488
hasten to her rescue,
and so win fair lady's heart,

497
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,062
you'll have to
do it alone, mate.

498
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,548
Il see no profit in it for me.

499
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,200
I can get you out of here.

500
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,375
How's that?
They key's run off.

501
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,114
I helped build these cells.

502
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,342
These are
half-pin barrel hinges.

503
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:45,448
With the right leverage and the
proper application of strength.

504
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,197
The door will lift free.

505
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,878
What's your name?

506
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,642
That would be short for William,
l imagine.

507
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,841
Good, strong name.

508
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,600
No doubt named for your father.

509
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:03,767
Yes.

510
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,544
Well, Mr. Turner,
I've changed me mind.

511
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,884
If you spring me from this cell,
l swear on pain of death

512
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,081
I shall take you
to the Black Pearl

513
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,226
and your bonny lass.

514
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:19,634
Do we have an accord?

515
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:23,307
Agreed.

516
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:24,281
Agreed.

517
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:25,892
Get me out.

518
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,507
Hurry.
Someone will have heard that.

519
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,728
Not without my effects.

520
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,060
We're going to steal the ship?

521
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:43,784
That ship?

522
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:45,528
Commandeer.

523
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,805
We're going to commandeer
that ship.

524
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,852
Nautical term.

525
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,824
One question
about your business.

526
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,323
Or there's no use going.

527
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:54,988
This girl.

528
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,599
How far are you willing
to go to save her?

529
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,255
I'd die for her.

530
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,607
Oh, good.

531
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,411
No worries, then.

532
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:24,646
This is either madness
or brilliance.

533
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:29,221
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

534
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,652
Everyone stay calm!
We are taking over the ship.

535
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,943
Aye! Avast!

536
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,817
This ship cannot be crewed
by two men.

537
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,608
You'll never make it
out of the bay.

538
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:17,104
Son, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

539
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,112
Savvy?

540
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:23,747
Commodore.

541
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,498
Sir, they've taken
the Dauntless!

542
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,839
Commodore!

543
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,311
They've taken the ship!

544
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,650
Sparrow and Turner
have taken the Dauntiess!

545
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:38,392
Rash, Turner.
Too rash.

546
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:43,914
That is without doubt the worst
pirate 1 have ever seen.

547
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,311
Here they come.

548
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:56,104
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

549
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,519
Search every cabin, every hull,
down to the bilges.

550
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,815
Sailors,
back to the Interceptor.

551
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:24,037
Now!

552
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,647
Thank you, Commodore, for
getting us ready to make way.

553
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,085
We'd have had a hard time of it
by ourselves.

554
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,069
Set topsails
and clear up this mess.

555
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,125
With the wind,
we won't catch them.

556
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,888
I don't need to. Get them
in range of the long nines.

557
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:48,848
Hands, come about!

558
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:51,033
Run out the guns!

559
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,649
We are to fire
on our own ship, sir?

560
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,788
I'd rather see her
at the bottom of the ocean

561
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:57,857
than in the hands of a pirate.

562
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:02,713
Commodore, he's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

563
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,997
Abandon ship!

564
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,718
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

565
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,509
So it would seem.

566
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,153
When I was a lad
living in England,

567
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,174
my mother raised me by herself.

568
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:37,547
After she died, 1 came out here,
looking for my father.

569
00:48:38,716 --> 00:48:40,446
Is that so?

570
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,265
My father, Will Turner.

571
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,318
It was only after you learnt
my name you agreed to help.

572
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,837
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

573
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:51,944
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

574
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,043
You knew my father.

575
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,414
I knew him.

576
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:04,419
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

577
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,835
Everyone else called him
Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.

578
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,197
Good man.
Good pirate.

579
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,423
I swear, you look just like him.

580
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:15,652
It's not true.

581
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:17,523
He was a merchant sailor.

582
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,722
A respectable man
who obeyed the law.

583
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:23,077
He was a bloody pirate.
A scallywag.

584
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:26,961
My father was not a pirate.

585
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:31,008
Put it away, son. It's not worth
you getting beat again.

586
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,149
You ignored the rules
of engagement.

587
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:35,882
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

588
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,799
Then that's not much incentive
for me to fight fair.

589
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:49,212
Now, as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

590
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:52,207
The only rules
that really matter are these.

591
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:55,663
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

592
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,359
For instance,

593
00:49:57,595 --> 00:50:00,665
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man

594
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,185
or you can't.

595
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,659
Pirate is in your blood,

596
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:06,181
so you'll have to square
with that someday.

597
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,590
Now, me, for example.

598
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:09,475
I can let you drown.

599
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,733
But I can't bring this ship
into Tortuga

600
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:13,336
all by me onesy, savvy?

601
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:14,717
So.

602
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,790
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

603
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,025
Or can you not?

604
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,062
Tortuga?

605
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,591
Tortuga.

606
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,104
More importantly,
it is indeed a sad life

607
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:59,097
that has never breathed deep
this sweet bouquet

608
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,423
that is Tortuga, savvy?

609
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,630
What do you think?

610
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,194
It'll linger.

611
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,890
I'll tell you, mate,

612
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,628
if every town in the world
were like this one,

613
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,998
no man would ever feel unwanted.

614
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,784
Scarlett!

615
00:51:21,045 --> 00:51:22,745
Not sure I deserved that.

616
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,184
Giselle!

617
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,236
Who was she?

618
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,177
What?

619
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,457
I may have deserved that.

620
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,850
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

621
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,252
Mother's love!

622
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,540
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleeping.

623
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,173
It's bad luck.

624
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,424
Fortunately,
I know how to counter it.

625
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,883
The man who did the waking

626
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,098
buys the man who was sleeping
a drink.

627
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,904
The man who was sleeping drinks
while listening to a proposition

628
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,333
from the man who did the waking.

629
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:03,024
Aye, that'll about do it.

630
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,451
Blast!
I'm already awake!

631
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,523
That was for the smell.

632
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,305
Keep a sharp eye.

633
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,000
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of yourn?

634
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,582
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

635
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:45,592
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

636
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:48,976
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

637
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:52,363
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

638
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,555
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

639
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,116
All l need is a crew.

640
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,815
From what I hear of Barbossa,

641
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:02,567
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one.

642
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,150
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool.

643
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,916
Prove me wrong.

644
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,254
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

645
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,243
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage.

646
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,736
The kid?

647
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,416
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

648
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,150
His only child, savvy?

649
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:41,186
Is he, now?

650
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,464
"Leverage," says you.

651
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:49,404
"l think I feel a change
in the wind,” says I.

652
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:51,197
I'll find us a crew.

653
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:53,892
There's bound to be some sailors
crazy as you.

654
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:56,227
One can only hope.

655
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,527
Take what you can.

656
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,875
Give nothing back.

657
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,864
You'll be dining
with the captain.

658
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,913
And he requests you wear this.

659
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,416
You tell the captain

660
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,624
that 1 am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

661
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,183
He said you'd say that.

662
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,710
He also said,
if that be the case,

663
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:40,686
you'll be dining with the crew.

664
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:43,148
And you'll be naked.

665
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,079
Fine.

666
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:10,897
There's no need to stand on
ceremony, nor call to impress.

667
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,352
You must be hungry.

668
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:31,964
Try the wine.

669
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,430
And the apples.

670
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,594
One of those next?

671
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,133
It's poisoned.

672
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,911
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

673
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,650
Release me.
You have your trinket.

674
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,138
I'm of no further value to you.

675
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,854
You don't know what this is,
do you?

676
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,821
It's a pirate medallion.

677
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:09,116
This is Aztec gold.

678
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,819
One of 882 identical pieces

679
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:16,332
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortés himself.

680
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,844
Blood money paid
to stem the slaughter

681
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:21,486
he wreaked upon them
with his armies.

682
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,808
But the greed of Cortés
was insatiable.

683
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:32,022
So the heathen gods placed
upon the gold a terrible curse.

684
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,257
Any mortal that removes

685
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,515
but a single piece
from that stone chest

686
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,986
shall be punished for eternity.

687
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,531
I hardly believe in ghost
stories anymore, Captain.

688
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,499
That's exactly what I thought
when we were told the tale.

689
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,440
Buried on an island of dead
what cannot be found,

690
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:58,216
except for those
who know where it is.

691
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,029
Find it, we did.

692
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,002
There be the chest.

693
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:06,368
Inside be the gold.

694
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,833
And we took them all.

695
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,032
We spent them and traded them

696
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,551
and frittered them away
on drink and food

697
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,481
and pleasurable company.

698
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:21,216
The more we gave them away,
the more we came to realize,

699
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,759
the drink would not satisfy,

700
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,308
food turned to ash
in our mouths,

701
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,862
and all the pleasurable company
in the world

702
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,404
could not slake our lust.

703
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:38,308
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

704
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:45,080
Compelled by greed, we were,
but now we are consumed by it.

705
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:00,194
There is one way
we can end our curse.

706
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,627
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

707
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:11,094
must be restored
and the blood repaid.

708
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:17,475
Thanks to ye,
we have the final piece.

709
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,319
And the blood to be repaid?

710
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:26,115
That's why there's no sense
to be killin’ you yet.

711
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:30,067
Apple?

712
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,078
No!

713
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:47,386
I'm curious.

714
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,691
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

715
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,035
Look!

716
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,389
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

717
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,706
We are not among the living,
and so we cannot die.

718
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,096
But neither are we dead.

719
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:09,516
For too long I've been parched
and unable to quench it.

720
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:14,353
Too long I've been starving
to death and haven't died.

721
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:17,061
l feel nothing.

722
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:20,724
Not the wind on my face
nor the spray of the sea

723
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:24,411
nor the warmth
of a woman's flesh.

724
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,932
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

725
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,979
You're in one!

726
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,659
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

727
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,185
You heard the captain.
Back to work.

728
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,427
Feast your eyes, Captain.

729
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:04,976
All of them faithful hands
before the mast.

730
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:08,292
Every man worth his salt.

731
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,515
And crazy to boot.

732
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,874
So this is
your able-bodied crew?

733
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,746
-You, sailor!
-Cotton, sir.

734
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:25,328
Mr. Cotton, do you have
the courage to follow orders

735
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:28,479
and stay true in the face
of danger and death?

736
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:31,788
Mr. Cotton!
Answer, man!

737
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,565
He's a mute. Poor devil
had his tongue cut out.

738
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,948
He trained the parrot
to talk for him.

739
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,433
No one's yet figured how.

740
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,854
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

741
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,378
Same question.

742
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:49,593
Wind in the sails!
Wind in the sails!

743
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,523
Mostly we figure
that means "yes."

744
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:53,926
Of course it does.

745
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,783
Satisfied?

746
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,979
Well, you've proved they're mad.

747
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:00,505
And what's the benefit for us?

748
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,170
Anamaria.

749
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,744
I suppose
you didn't deserve that.

750
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:17,732
No, that one I deserved.

751
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,964
You stole my boat!

752
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,643
Actually --

753
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,499
Borrowed.
Borrowed without permission.

754
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,689
But with every intention
of bringing it back.

755
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:29,321
But you didn't!

756
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,099
You'll get another one.

757
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:33,245
I will.

758
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,726
A better one.

759
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:36,445
A better one!

760
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,419
That one.

761
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,017
What one?

762
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:42,741
That one?

763
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,312
Aye, that one.

764
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,997
What say you?

765
01:02:50,734 --> 01:02:52,314
Anchors aweigh!

766
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:56,382
No, no, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

767
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,933
It'll be far worse
not to have her.

768
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:36,036
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find

769
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,245
with a compass
that doesn't work?

770
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,388
Aye, the compass
doesn't point North,

771
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:43,847
but we're not trying
to find North, are we?

772
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,304
We should drop canvas, sir.

773
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,156
She can hold a bit longer.

774
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:04,094
What's in your head that's
put you in such a fine mood?

775
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,337
We're catching up.

776
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:23,307
Time to go, poppet.

777
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:23,607
Dead men tell no tales.

778
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:27,219
Puts a chill in the bones

779
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:30,917
how many honest sailors have
been claimed by this passage.

780
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:48,119
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

781
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:51,198
Not a lot's known about Jack
fore he showed up in Tortuga

782
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:54,168
with a mind to go after the
treasure of the Isla de Muerta.

783
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:55,694
That was before I'd met him.

784
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:58,549
Back when he was Captain
of the Black Pearl.

785
01:05:58,988 --> 01:05:59,857
What?

786
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,920
He failed to mention that.

787
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:07,155
He plays things
closer to the vest now.

788
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,307
And a hard-learned lesson
it was.

789
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,802
Three days out,
the first mate comes to him

790
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:13,978
and says everything's
an equal share.

791
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,474
That should mean the location
of the treasure.

792
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,860
Jack gives up the bearings.

793
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:21,989
That night, there was a mutiny.

794
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,195
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die,

795
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,368
but not before he'd gone mad
with the heat.

796
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,228
So that's the reason
for all the...

797
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:38,766
Reason's got nothing
to do with it.

798
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,118
Now, Will,
when a pirate's marooned,

799
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,154
he's a given a pistol with
a single shot. One shot.

800
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:47,351
Well, that won't do much good
hunting or to be rescued.

801
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:50,824
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

802
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:54,026
that pistol will start
to look real friendly.

803
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:57,636
But Jack escaped the island, and
he still has that single shot.

804
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:01,167
Oh, he won't use it,
though, save on one man.

805
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,520
His mutinous first mate.

806
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,543
How did Jack get off the island?

807
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:10,165
Well, I'll tell ye.

808
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,006
He waded out into the shallows.

809
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:14,465
He waited there
three days and three nights

810
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:16,441
till all manner of sea creatures

811
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:19,163
‘came acclimated
to his presence.

812
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:21,089
And on the fourth morning,

813
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,241
he roped
a couple of sea turtles,

814
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:26,413
lashed them together,
and made a raft.

815
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,360
He roped a couple
of sea turtles?

816
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,986
Aye, sea turtles.

817
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,549
What did he use for rope?

818
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,986
Human hair.

819
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:44,906
From my back.

820
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,149
Let go the anchor!

821
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,502
Aye, Captain, aye!

822
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:52,476
Young Mr. Turner and I
are to go ashore.

823
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,092
Captain, what if the worst
should happen?

824
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:57,596
Keep to the Code.

825
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:59,647
Aye, the Code.

826
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:26,084
Move.

827
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:28,322
10 years of hoarding swag.

828
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,861
And now we finally
get to spend it.

829
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,110
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men.

830
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,901
You can buy an eye what actually
fits and is made of glass.

831
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:48,031
This one does splinter
something terrible.

832
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,125
Stop rubbing it.

833
01:09:10,345 --> 01:09:12,975
What Code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

834
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,286
Pirate's Code.

835
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:19,688
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

836
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:23,502
No heroes amongst thieves?

837
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:26,697
For having such
a bleak outlook on pirates,

838
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:29,583
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

839
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,578
Sprung a man from jail,

840
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,082
commandeered a ship
of the fleet,

841
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:38,368
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga.

842
01:09:40,475 --> 01:09:43,435
And you're completely
obsessed with treasure.

843
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:50,422
That's not true.
lam not obsessed with treasure.

844
01:09:57,427 --> 01:09:59,857
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

845
01:10:00,263 --> 01:10:02,723
Gentlemen, the time has come!

846
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:05,762
Our salvation is nigh!

847
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:10,282
Our torment is near an end.

848
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:13,087
For 10 years
we've been tested and tried,

849
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:15,056
and each man jack of you here

850
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:18,304
has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

851
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,121
and a hundred times again!

852
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,972
Suffered, I have!

853
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:28,251
Punished, we were,
the lot of us.

854
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:32,325
Disproportionate to our crime!

855
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,759
Here it is!

856
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:42,125
The cursed treasure
of Cortés himself.

857
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,340
Every last piece that went
astray, we have returned.

858
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,088
Save for this.

859
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:55,555
Not yet. We wait
for the opportune moment.

860
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:59,745
881 we found, but despaired
of ever finding the last.

861
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:01,903
When's that?

862
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:04,411
When it's
of greatest profit to you?

863
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:07,193
May I ask you something?

864
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,786
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

865
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,470
Do us a favor.

866
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:16,182
I know it's difficult for you,
but please stay here

867
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,369
and try not to do
anything stupid.

868
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,498
And who among us has paid
the blood sacrifice

869
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:26,221
owed to the heathen gods?

870
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:27,062
Us!

871
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,706
And whose blood
must yet be paid?

872
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,579
Hers!

873
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,050
You know the first thing
I'm gonna do

874
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,912
after the curse is lifted?

875
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,930
Eat a whole bushel of apples.

876
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,814
Begun by blood.

877
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,543
By blood undone.

878
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:03,800
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not gonna be your leverage.

879
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:15,523
That's it?

880
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:17,205
Waste not.

881
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,550
Did it work?

882
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:00,030
-I don't feel no different.
-How do we tell?

883
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,086
You're not dead.

884
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:10,775
No.

885
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:13,105
He shot me!

886
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:14,599
It didn't work.

887
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,197
The curse it still upon us!

888
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:24,019
You, maid!
Your father, what was his name?

889
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,893
Was your father William Turner?

890
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:28,153
No.

891
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,497
Where's his child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

892
01:13:32,008 --> 01:13:35,168
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

893
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,465
You two!

894
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,717
You brought us the wrong person!

895
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,330
No!

896
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:52,018
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

897
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,598
She said her name was Turner.

898
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,573
l think she lied to us.

899
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:03,463
You brought us here for nothing.

900
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:07,062
I won't take questioning or
second guesses from you, Twigg.

901
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:08,656
Who's to blame?

902
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:12,098
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse.

903
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:16,239
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

904
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:18,526
Yeah!

905
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:23,423
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place.

906
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:28,494
If any coward here dare
challenge me, let him speak!

907
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:33,075
l say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood,

908
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:34,362
just in case.

909
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:35,847
Yeah!

910
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:45,693
The medallion!

911
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,085
She's taken it!

912
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:51,215
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

913
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:57,248
No oars here!

914
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,606
Where's the oars?

915
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,892
The oars have gone missing.

916
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,721
Find them!

917
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,570
Find the oars!

918
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:13,824
You.

919
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:16,821
You're supposed to be dead!

920
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:18,693
Am I not?

921
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:42,282
Parsnip, parsley,
partner, partner.

922
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:43,642
Parley?

923
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,856
That's the one!
Parley!

924
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,228
Parley!

925
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:49,523
Parley?

926
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:54,219
Damn to the depths whatever man
that thought up "parley"!

927
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,491
That would be the French.

928
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:10,538
Not more pirates.

929
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,880
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

930
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,259
Mr. Gibbs?

931
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:17,437
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

932
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,824
He fell behind.

933
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,256
Keep to the Code.

934
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:34,963
Weigh anchor!

935
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:37,941
Hoist the sails!
Make quick!

936
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:47,763
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

937
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,894
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

938
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:55,154
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

939
01:16:56,579 --> 01:16:59,209
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

940
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:03,778
Well, ! won't be making
that mistake again.

941
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:07,610
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

942
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:10,915
Kill him.

943
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:15,338
The girl's blood
didn't work, did it?

944
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,269
Hold your fire!

945
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:28,214
You know whose blood we need.

946
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,075
I know whose blood you need.

947
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:41,111
What sort of a man trades
a man's life for a ship?

948
01:17:41,524 --> 01:17:42,544
Pirate.

949
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,352
Here. Let me.

950
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,255
Thank you.

951
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:52,725
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

952
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:55,106
Why?

953
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,669
I don't know.

954
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,257
I'm sorry. Blacksmith's hands.
I know they're rough.

955
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,190
No.
I mean yes, they are, but...

956
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,700
But don't stop.

957
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:40,301
It's yours.

958
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:47,490
l thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

959
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:50,130
It was a gift from my father.

960
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:52,102
He sent it to me.

961
01:18:57,433 --> 01:18:59,273
Why did you take it?

962
01:19:00,803 --> 01:19:03,963
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

963
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,881
That would have been awful.

964
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:12,726
It wasn't your blood
they needed.

965
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,588
It was my father's blood.

966
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,085
My blood.

967
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:28,506
The blood of a pirate.

968
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,044
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

969
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,059
You expect to leave me
on some beach

970
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:49,222
with nothing but a name and
your word it's the one I need

971
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:52,905
and watch you sail away
in my ship?

972
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:54,291
No.

973
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,660
l expect to leave you
standing on some beach

974
01:19:57,026 --> 01:19:58,576
with absolutely no name at all,

975
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:01,111
watching me sail away
on my ship,

976
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:03,607
and then I'll shout the name
back to you.

977
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,136
Savvy?

978
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,707
That still leaves the problem
of me on some beach

979
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,153
with naught but a name
and your word

980
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:12,696
it's the one I need.

981
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:14,655
Of the two of us,

982
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:18,133
I'm the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

983
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:22,157
Therefore, my word is the one
we'll be trusting.

984
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:26,617
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

985
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:29,942
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

986
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:33,612
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

987
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:36,767
Funny old world, isn't it?

988
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,459
Captain, we're coming up
on the Interceptor.

989
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,164
I'm having a thought here,
Barbossa.

990
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:00,254
What say we run up
a flag of truce,

991
01:21:00,556 --> 01:21:02,165
Il scurry over
to the Interceptor,

992
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:05,768
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

993
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:09,805
Now, that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

994
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:13,736
People are easy to search
when they're dead.

995
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:15,849
Lock him in the brig.

996
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,130
Hands aloft to loose t'gallants!

997
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:33,262
With this wind, she'll carry
every sail we've got!

998
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:34,621
What's happening?

999
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:37,813
The Black Pearl.
She's gaining on us.

1000
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,034
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

1001
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:47,022
You can tell them that
after they've caught us.

1002
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:49,019
We're shallower on the draft?

1003
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:50,064
Aye.

1004
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,818
Well, then can't we lose them
amongst those shoals?

1005
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:56,679
We don't have to outrun them
long, just long enough.

1006
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:59,299
Lighten the ship, stem to stern!

1007
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:02,960
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost.

1008
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,064
Apparently, there's a leak.

1009
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:32,004
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

1010
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:35,031
And run out the sweeps.

1011
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:36,351
Pull!

1012
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:04,411
We're gonna need that.

1013
01:23:12,588 --> 01:23:13,958
It was a good plan.

1014
01:23:14,223 --> 01:23:15,893
Up till now.

1015
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,768
We have to make a stand.

1016
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:20,760
We must fight!

1017
01:23:21,063 --> 01:23:22,083
Load the guns!

1018
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:23,257
With what?

1019
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,135
Anything. Everything!

1020
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:27,214
Anything we have left.

1021
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,537
Load the guns!

1022
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,299
Case shot and langrage!

1023
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:34,654
Nails and crushed glass!

1024
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:38,448
With a will!

1025
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:01,668
The Peari’s gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

1026
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:04,469
She'll rake us without
ever presenting a target.

1027
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,623
Lower the anchor
on the right side.

1028
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,379
On the starboard side!

1029
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,261
It has the element of surprise.

1030
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,767
You're daft, lady!
You both are!

1031
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:15,849
Daft like Jack!

1032
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,111
Lower the starboard anchor!

1033
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:21,933
Do it, you dogs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

1034
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,138
Let go!

1035
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,173
They're clubhauling!

1036
01:24:50,519 --> 01:24:52,509
Hard to port!
Rack the starboard oars.

1037
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,814
Hard to port!

1038
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,494
Keep us steady, man.

1039
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,206
Now!

1040
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:16,309
Fire!

1041
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:18,411
Fire all!

1042
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,802
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

1043
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,921
We could use
a few more ideas, lass.

1044
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:19,236
Your turn.

1045
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:21,431
We need us a devil's dowry.

1046
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:23,737
We'll give them her.

1047
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:26,039
She's not what they're after.

1048
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,353
The medallion.

1049
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:53,792
Raise your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

1050
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:56,675
Hands, grapnels, at the ready.

1051
01:26:57,079 --> 01:26:59,129
Prepare to board!

1052
01:27:33,215 --> 01:27:35,295
Blast all to carcasses, men!

1053
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:37,580
Forward clear
to the powder magazine.

1054
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:42,429
And the rest of you,
bring me that medallion!

1055
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:52,406
Help!

1056
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:12,779
Below!

1057
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:34,017
Thanks very much.

1058
01:28:49,257 --> 01:28:50,807
Bloody empty.

1059
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:08,701
That's not very nice.

1060
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:14,531
Where's the medallion?

1061
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:16,329
Wretch!

1062
01:29:18,954 --> 01:29:20,683
Where's dear William?

1063
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,883
Monkey!

1064
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,483
I can't move it!

1065
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:41,825
Come on!

1066
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,368
Why, thank you, Jack.

1067
01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:00,123
You're welcome.

1068
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,645
Not you.
We named the monkey "Jack."

1069
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:08,035
Gents, our hope is restored!

1070
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:46,735
Any of you so much as thinks
the word "parley,"

1071
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:50,248
I'll have your guts for garters.

1072
01:30:59,321 --> 01:31:01,601
You've got to stop it!

1073
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:03,920
-Stop it!
-Welcome back, miss.

1074
01:31:04,259 --> 01:31:06,659
You took advantage
of our hospitality last time.

1075
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:10,282
It holds fair now
you return the favor.

1076
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,074
She goes free.

1077
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:27,463
What's in your head, boy?

1078
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:29,526
She goes free!

1079
01:31:29,751 --> 01:31:33,061
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

1080
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:35,258
Don't do anything stupid.

1081
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,990
You can't.

1082
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:41,721
I can.

1083
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:44,330
Like that.

1084
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:47,173
Who are you?

1085
01:31:47,469 --> 01:31:48,809
No one.
He's no one.

1086
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:52,110
A distant cousin of
my aunt's nephew twice removed.

1087
01:31:52,607 --> 01:31:54,447
Lovely singing voice, though.
Eunuch.

1088
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:56,206
My name is Will Turner.

1089
01:31:56,478 --> 01:31:58,878
My father was
Bootstrap Bill Turner.

1090
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,559
His blood runs in my veins.

1091
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:04,380
He's the spitting image
of old Bootstrap Bill

1092
01:32:04,786 --> 01:32:05,956
come back to haunt us.

1093
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:09,617
On my word, do as I say,
or I'll pull this trigger

1094
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:12,968
and be lost
to Davy Jones' locker.

1095
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:15,448
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

1096
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:16,786
Elizabeth goes free.

1097
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:19,367
Yes, we know that one.
Anything else?

1098
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:25,637
And the crew.
The crew are not to be harmed.

1099
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:32,008
Agreed.

1100
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:39,796
Go on, poppet, go!

1101
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:41,425
Walk the plank!

1102
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:54,849
Barbossa, you lying bastard!
You swore she'd go free!

1103
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:57,800
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.

1104
01:32:58,206 --> 01:32:59,576
l agreed she'd go free,

1105
01:32:59,841 --> 01:33:03,241
but it was you who failed
to specify when or where.

1106
01:33:09,117 --> 01:33:13,097
Though does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it?

1107
01:33:14,489 --> 01:33:17,449
So I'll be having that dress
back before you go.

1108
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:23,613
l always liked you.

1109
01:33:27,402 --> 01:33:28,952
Goes with your black heart.

1110
01:33:30,672 --> 01:33:32,812
Ooh, it's still warm.

1111
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,080
Off you go!

1112
01:33:37,879 --> 01:33:39,489
Come on!

1113
01:33:42,884 --> 01:33:44,224
Too long!

1114
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,806
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

1115
01:34:03,538 --> 01:34:04,827
Did you not notice?

1116
01:34:05,073 --> 01:34:07,503
That be the same island
we made you governor of

1117
01:34:07,909 --> 01:34:09,779
on our last little trip.

1118
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:12,155
I did notice.

1119
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,640
Perhaps you'll be
able to conjure up

1120
01:34:13,882 --> 01:34:16,192
another miraculous escape.

1121
01:34:16,584 --> 01:34:18,104
But I doubt it.

1122
01:34:21,055 --> 01:34:22,425
Off you go.

1123
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:23,450
Yeah.

1124
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:25,905
Last time, you left me
a pistol with one shot.

1125
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:28,074
By the powers, you're right.

1126
01:34:28,396 --> 01:34:31,465
Where be Jack's pistol?
Bring it forward.

1127
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:38,026
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman would give us

1128
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:39,616
a pair of pistols.

1129
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:41,331
It'll be one pistol as before,

1130
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:43,749
You can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady

1131
01:34:44,112 --> 01:34:46,692
and starve to death yourself.

1132
01:35:10,405 --> 01:35:11,365
That's the second time

1133
01:35:11,573 --> 01:35:14,613
I've had to watch that man
sail away with my ship.

1134
01:35:16,778 --> 01:35:19,058
But you were marooned
on this island before.

1135
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:20,847
We can escape
the same way you did.

1136
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:23,635
To what point and purpose,
young missy?

1137
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,722
The Black Pearl is gone.

1138
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:29,150
Unless you have a rudder and
sails hidden in that bodice.

1139
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:31,587
Unlikely.

1140
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:35,026
Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

1141
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:39,515
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

1142
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:43,264
You vanished from seven agents
of the East India Company.

1143
01:35:43,805 --> 01:35:46,465
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot.

1144
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:49,598
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

1145
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:53,575
How did you escape last time?

1146
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:04,420
Last time, was here a grand
total of three days, all right?

1147
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,500
Last time...

1148
01:36:09,197 --> 01:36:11,807
The rumrunners
used this island as a cache,

1149
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:14,843
came by, and I was able to
barter passage off.

1150
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:16,440
From the looks of things,

1151
01:36:16,671 --> 01:36:18,721
they've long been out
of business.

1152
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:23,023
Probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

1153
01:36:24,178 --> 01:36:26,608
So that's it, then?

1154
01:36:27,015 --> 01:36:28,825
That's the secret
grand adventure

1155
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:31,370
of the infamous Jack Sparrow?

1156
01:36:31,753 --> 01:36:36,143
You spent three days lying
on a beach, drinking rum?

1157
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:41,006
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1158
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:51,638
We're devils, we're black sheep

1159
01:36:51,906 --> 01:36:53,246
We're really bad eggs

1160
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:55,968
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

1161
01:36:58,780 --> 01:36:59,980
A pirate's life for me

1162
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:01,964
l love this song!

1163
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:08,089
Really bad eggs!

1164
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:13,900
When I get the Pearl back,

1165
01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:16,535
I'm gonna teach it
to the whole crew.

1166
01:37:16,931 --> 01:37:18,300
We'll sing it all the time.

1167
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:21,965
You'll be the most fearsome
pirate in the Spanish Main.

1168
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,963
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

1169
01:37:25,373 --> 01:37:26,742
The entire ocean.

1170
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:29,348
The entire world.

1171
01:37:29,744 --> 01:37:32,904
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is, you know.

1172
01:37:33,414 --> 01:37:35,904
It's not just a keel
and a deck and sails.

1173
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:37,627
That's what a ship needs.

1174
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:44,655
But what a ship is,
what the Black Pearl really is,

1175
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,210
is freedom.

1176
01:37:49,764 --> 01:37:53,394
Jack, it must be
really terrible for you

1177
01:37:53,968 --> 01:37:56,138
to be trapped on this island.

1178
01:37:56,504 --> 01:37:57,674
Oh, yes.

1179
01:37:57,905 --> 01:38:01,745
But the company is infinitely
better than last time,

1180
01:38:02,343 --> 01:38:03,423
I think.

1181
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:07,239
The scenery
has definitely improved.

1182
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:08,892
Mr. Sparrow.

1183
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:11,370
I'm not entirely sure
I've had enough rum

1184
01:38:11,753 --> 01:38:13,652
to allow that kind of talk.

1185
01:38:14,856 --> 01:38:17,135
I know exactly
what you mean, love.

1186
01:38:24,132 --> 01:38:25,501
To freedom.

1187
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:30,142
To the Black Pearl.

1188
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,780
No! Not good!

1189
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:04,416
Stop! Not good!

1190
01:39:04,806 --> 01:39:05,795
What are you doing?

1191
01:39:06,007 --> 01:39:08,286
You burned all the food,
the shade! The rum!

1192
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:10,136
Yes, the rum is gone.

1193
01:39:10,411 --> 01:39:11,931
Why is the rum gone?

1194
01:39:12,213 --> 01:39:13,763
One, because it is a vile drink

1195
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,538
that turns even the most
respectable men into scoundrels.

1196
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,671
Two, that signal is over
a thousand feet high.

1197
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,081
The entire Royal Navy
is looking for me.

1198
01:39:22,423 --> 01:39:25,612
Do you think there is the
slightest chance they won't see?

1199
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,737
But why is the rum gone?

1200
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:30,710
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1201
01:39:31,032 --> 01:39:33,462
You give it one hour, maybe two,
and you will see

1202
01:39:33,868 --> 01:39:35,978
white sails on that horizon.

1203
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:46,540
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

1204
01:39:47,081 --> 01:39:49,191
Well, it bloody is now!

1205
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:58,670
There'll be no living
with her after this.

1206
01:39:59,694 --> 01:40:01,424
-But we've got to save Will.
-No.

1207
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:03,279
You're safe now.

1208
01:40:03,564 --> 01:40:05,054
We will return to Port Royal,

1209
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,062
not go gallivanting
after pirates!

1210
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:09,098
Then we condemn him to death.

1211
01:40:10,538 --> 01:40:12,998
The boy's fate is regrettable,

1212
01:40:13,407 --> 01:40:15,627
but so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

1213
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,260
To rescue me. To prevent
anything from happening to me.

1214
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:22,849
If l may be so bold as to inject
my professional opinion.

1215
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:25,981
The Pearl was listing near
to scuppers after the battle.

1216
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:29,000
It's very unlikely she'll
be able to make good time.

1217
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:31,032
Think about it.

1218
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:33,025
The Black Pearl.

1219
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:37,077
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1220
01:40:37,665 --> 01:40:39,835
How can you pass that up, right?

1221
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:44,229
By remembering that I serve
others, Mr. Sparrow.

1222
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:45,809
Not only myself.

1223
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,000
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this.

1224
01:40:48,342 --> 01:40:49,602
For me.

1225
01:40:49,844 --> 01:40:51,834
As a wedding gift.

1226
01:40:54,415 --> 01:40:57,285
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

1227
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:00,770
lam.

1228
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:02,598
A wedding!
l love weddings!

1229
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:04,560
Drinks all around!

1230
01:41:07,028 --> 01:41:08,018
I know.

1231
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,279
"Clap him in irons," right?

1232
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:16,089
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1233
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:19,451
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1234
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:21,307
You will spend the rest
of the voyage

1235
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,716
contemplating all meanings
of the phrase

1236
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:26,008
"silent as the grave."

1237
01:41:26,347 --> 01:41:27,717
Do I make myself clear?

1238
01:41:27,982 --> 01:41:30,262
Inescapably clear.

1239
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,898
Shiver me timbers.

1240
01:41:37,358 --> 01:41:39,168
Cotton here says
you missed a bit.

1241
01:41:43,798 --> 01:41:45,577
You knew William Turner?

1242
01:41:46,901 --> 01:41:49,090
Ol' Bootstrap Bill.

1243
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:51,050
We knew him.

1244
01:41:51,339 --> 01:41:54,818
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow.

1245
01:41:55,376 --> 01:41:57,596
The mutiny and all.

1246
01:41:57,979 --> 01:42:00,469
He said it wasn't right
with the Code.

1247
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:04,361
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you.

1248
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:08,873
He said we deserved
to be cursed.

1249
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:11,200
And remain cursed.

1250
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:12,424
Stupid blighter.

1251
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:14,237
Good man.

1252
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:16,869
Well, as you can imagine,

1253
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:19,688
that didn't sit too well
with the captain.

1254
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:22,941
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all.

1255
01:42:23,404 --> 01:42:27,034
-Tell him what Barbossa did.
-I'm telling the story!

1256
01:42:29,377 --> 01:42:32,777
So, what the captain did.

1257
01:42:33,314 --> 01:42:35,714
He strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1258
01:42:36,117 --> 01:42:37,427
Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1259
01:42:37,685 --> 01:42:40,375
And last we saw
of Ol' Bill Turner,

1260
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:42,961
he was sinking to
the crushing, black oblivion

1261
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:45,844
of Davy Jones' locker.

1262
01:42:47,128 --> 01:42:48,617
‘Course it was only after that

1263
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:51,476
we learned we needed his blood
to lift the curse.

1264
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:54,009
That's what you call ironic.

1265
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:00,346
Bring him.

1266
01:43:07,114 --> 01:43:08,983
I don't care for the situation.

1267
01:43:09,316 --> 01:43:12,446
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn to an ambush.

1268
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:15,883
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1269
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:19,987
I convince Barbossa to send his
men out with their little boats.

1270
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:22,521
You and your mates return
to the Dauntless

1271
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:25,823
and blast the bejesus out of
them with your little cannons.

1272
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,260
What do you have to lose?

1273
01:43:28,602 --> 01:43:31,472
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1274
01:43:32,707 --> 01:43:35,017
Now, to be quite honest
with you,

1275
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:37,108
there's a risk to those
aboard the Dauntless,

1276
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:40,481
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

1277
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:42,880
Sorry, but it's
for your own safety.

1278
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,297
The commodore ordered!
I have to tell him!

1279
01:43:45,653 --> 01:43:46,733
The pirates!

1280
01:43:46,954 --> 01:43:48,624
They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

1281
01:43:48,923 --> 01:43:50,822
Don't worry.
He's informed of that.

1282
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:54,818
A mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story.

1283
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:57,795
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1284
01:44:08,809 --> 01:44:10,009
No reason to fret.

1285
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,853
Just a prick of the finger.
A few drops of blood.

1286
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,710
No mistakes this time.

1287
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:18,492
He's only half Turner.
We spill it all!

1288
01:44:20,788 --> 01:44:22,428
Guess there is reason to fret.

1289
01:44:36,537 --> 01:44:38,347
Beg your pardon.
Beg your pardon.

1290
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:40,281
-Begun by blood.
-Excuse me.

1291
01:44:40,574 --> 01:44:43,004
By blood --

1292
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:48,670
It's not possible.

1293
01:44:48,883 --> 01:44:50,753
Not probable.

1294
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:53,789
Where's Elizabeth?

1295
01:44:54,155 --> 01:44:56,344
She's safe,
just like I promised.

1296
01:44:56,724 --> 01:44:59,154
She's set to marry Norrington,
like she promised.

1297
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,610
You get to die for her,
like you promised.

1298
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:04,302
So we're all
men of our word, really.

1299
01:45:04,698 --> 01:45:07,158
Except for Elizabeth who is,
in fact, a woman.

1300
01:45:07,568 --> 01:45:09,708
Shut up!
You're next.

1301
01:45:12,006 --> 01:45:14,816
You don't want to
be doing that, mate.

1302
01:45:15,276 --> 01:45:17,675
No, I really think I do.

1303
01:45:19,013 --> 01:45:20,793
Your funeral.

1304
01:45:24,251 --> 01:45:26,421
Why don't I want to be doing it?

1305
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:28,397
Well, because...

1306
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:33,169
Because the HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1307
01:45:33,861 --> 01:45:38,401
is floating just offshore,
waiting for you.

1308
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:48,271
What we doing here?

1309
01:45:49,977 --> 01:45:53,517
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1310
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:59,001
We catch them in a crossfire,
send them down to see Old Hob.

1311
01:45:59,753 --> 01:46:01,242
I know why we're here.

1312
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:02,982
I meant, why aren't we doing

1313
01:46:03,257 --> 01:46:06,656
what Mr. Sparrow said we should
do with the cannons and all?

1314
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:10,384
Because it was
Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1315
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:15,687
You think he wasn't
telling the truth?

1316
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:18,000
Just hear me out, mate.

1317
01:46:18,339 --> 01:46:20,239
You order your men
to row to the Dauntless.

1318
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:22,443
They do what they do best.

1319
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:24,526
Robert's your uncle.
Fannie's your aunt.

1320
01:46:24,845 --> 01:46:27,215
There you are with two ships.

1321
01:46:27,615 --> 01:46:29,545
The makings of
your very own fleet.

1322
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:33,044
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship, and who's to argue?

1323
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:35,284
But what of the Pearl?

1324
01:46:36,657 --> 01:46:38,207
Name me captain.

1325
01:46:38,492 --> 01:46:41,072
I'll sail under your colors.
I'll give you 10% of me plunder.

1326
01:46:41,495 --> 01:46:46,565
And you get to introduce
yourself as Commodore Barbossa.

1327
01:46:47,334 --> 01:46:48,154
Savvy?

1328
01:46:48,335 --> 01:46:51,525
I suppose in exchange, you
want me not to kill the whelp.

1329
01:46:52,039 --> 01:46:54,759
No, no, no. Not at all.
By all means, kill the whelp.

1330
01:46:55,209 --> 01:46:57,229
Just not yet.

1331
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:02,558
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1332
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:07,669
For instance...

1333
01:47:09,290 --> 01:47:12,310
After you've killed
Norrington's men.

1334
01:47:12,793 --> 01:47:17,072
Every last one.

1335
01:47:27,308 --> 01:47:29,528
You've been planning this
from the beginning.

1336
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,660
Ever since you learned my name.

1337
01:47:31,979 --> 01:47:32,939
Yeah.

1338
01:47:35,382 --> 01:47:36,932
I want 50% of your plunder.

1339
01:47:37,217 --> 01:47:38,477
-15%.
-40%.

1340
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,499
25%.

1341
01:47:40,821 --> 01:47:41,991
I'll buy you the hat.

1342
01:47:42,222 --> 01:47:45,682
A really big one, Commodore.

1343
01:47:48,996 --> 01:47:51,516
We have an accord.

1344
01:47:51,932 --> 01:47:54,182
All hands to the boats!

1345
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:56,459
Apologies.

1346
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,160
You give the orders.

1347
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:03,200
Gents, take a walk.

1348
01:48:08,282 --> 01:48:09,952
Not to the boats?

1349
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,125
Hold fire.

1350
01:49:13,414 --> 01:49:17,103
Oh, this is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy.

1351
01:49:17,684 --> 01:49:21,054
Except they was in a horse
instead of dresses.

1352
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:22,817
Wooden horse.

1353
01:49:35,836 --> 01:49:37,296
A moment, please.

1354
01:49:45,312 --> 01:49:47,742
I just want you to know

1355
01:49:48,148 --> 01:49:50,778
I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1356
01:49:51,218 --> 01:49:53,088
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1357
01:49:54,354 --> 01:49:56,284
But, you know,
even a good decision,

1358
01:49:56,623 --> 01:50:00,102
if made for the wrong reasons,
can be a wrong decision.

1359
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:08,561
Look into that.
Report back.

1360
01:50:08,836 --> 01:50:09,916
Lieutenant?

1361
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:33,602
Are you there?

1362
01:50:35,863 --> 01:50:38,173
Elizabeth, are you
even listening to me?

1363
01:51:04,758 --> 01:51:07,308
Oh, what have you done?

1364
01:51:08,529 --> 01:51:09,349
Stop that!

1365
01:51:09,530 --> 01:51:11,840
Already feel like a fool.

1366
01:51:12,232 --> 01:51:13,752
Look nice, though.

1367
01:51:18,105 --> 01:51:20,065
l look nice?

1368
01:51:56,476 --> 01:51:59,436
I must admit, Jack,
l thought I had you figured.

1369
01:51:59,913 --> 01:52:02,602
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1370
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,750
Me?
I'm dishonest.

1371
01:52:05,052 --> 01:52:07,892
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

1372
01:52:08,355 --> 01:52:09,405
Honestly.

1373
01:52:09,623 --> 01:52:11,793
It's the honest ones
you want to watch for,

1374
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:14,179
because you can never predict

1375
01:52:14,528 --> 01:52:18,188
when they're going to do
something incredibly stupid.

1376
01:52:51,832 --> 01:52:53,912
You're off the edge
of the map, mate.

1377
01:52:54,268 --> 01:52:56,878
Here there be monsters.

1378
01:53:01,141 --> 01:53:03,661
Right!

1379
01:53:04,077 --> 01:53:05,807
What would you pick
to eat first?

1380
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:07,923
I think we should decide now.

1381
01:53:08,248 --> 01:53:10,857
Just so we're ready
when the time comes.

1382
01:53:35,642 --> 01:53:37,132
What was that?

1383
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,156
Miss Elizabeth!

1384
01:54:20,754 --> 01:54:23,304
Make for the ship!
Move!

1385
01:54:32,366 --> 01:54:33,946
To the ship!

1386
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:38,700
Row, men!

1387
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:18,870
You can't beat me, Jack.

1388
01:55:42,569 --> 01:55:44,529
That's interesting.

1389
01:55:54,915 --> 01:55:56,644
1 couldn't resist, mate.

1390
01:57:03,283 --> 01:57:04,303
Sorry!

1391
01:57:13,527 --> 01:57:14,867
So what now, Jack Sparrow?

1392
01:57:15,128 --> 01:57:17,558
Are we to be two immortals
locked in an epic battle

1393
01:57:17,964 --> 01:57:21,004
until judgment day
and trumpets sound?

1394
01:57:21,501 --> 01:57:23,341
Or you could surrender.

1395
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:51,196
All of you with me!

1396
01:57:51,431 --> 01:57:53,241
Will is in that cave.
We must save him.

1397
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:56,407
Ready.
And heave!

1398
01:58:02,309 --> 01:58:04,529
Please, I need your help!
Come on!

1399
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:07,101
Any port in a storm.

1400
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:09,700
Cotton's right.
We've got the Pearl.

1401
01:58:10,083 --> 01:58:11,893
What about Jack?
Are you gonna leave him?

1402
01:58:12,218 --> 01:58:13,827
Jack owes us a ship.

1403
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:15,900
There's the Code to consider.

1404
01:58:16,222 --> 01:58:17,392
The Code?

1405
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:20,352
You're pirates.

1406
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:22,964
Hang the Code,
and hang the rules!

1407
01:58:23,363 --> 01:58:26,143
They're more like
guidelines anyway.

1408
01:58:29,135 --> 01:58:31,415
Bloody pirates!

1409
01:58:42,215 --> 01:58:43,035
What?

1410
01:58:43,216 --> 01:58:44,946
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1411
01:58:45,251 --> 01:58:47,741
They're stealing our ship!

1412
01:58:48,154 --> 01:58:50,204
Bloody pirates!

1413
01:58:51,825 --> 01:58:54,075
Boarders, away!

1414
01:59:01,935 --> 01:59:04,155
Come on!

1415
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:30,849
Me eye!

1416
01:59:51,051 --> 01:59:52,921
I'm gonna teach you
the meaning of pain!

1417
01:59:53,253 --> 01:59:54,623
Do you like pain?

1418
01:59:56,523 --> 01:59:58,483
Try wearing a corset.

1419
02:00:08,401 --> 02:00:10,421
Whose side is Jack on?

1420
02:00:10,770 --> 02:00:12,060
At the moment?

1421
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:49,063
No fair.

1422
02:01:12,899 --> 02:01:17,729
Ten years you carry that pistol,
and now you waste your shot.

1423
02:01:18,471 --> 02:01:20,080
He didn't waste it.

1424
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:47,712
l feel...

1425
02:01:52,172 --> 02:01:53,462
Cold.

1426
02:02:55,735 --> 02:02:57,075
Parley?

1427
02:02:58,304 --> 02:03:00,414
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1428
02:03:48,454 --> 02:03:50,504
We should return
to the Dauntless.

1429
02:03:53,293 --> 02:03:56,013
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1430
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:09,269
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1431
02:04:10,743 --> 02:04:12,053
That was it.

1432
02:04:13,813 --> 02:04:14,803
If you'd be so kind,

1433
02:04:15,014 --> 02:04:17,854
I'd be much obliged if you'd
drop me off at my ship.

1434
02:04:23,289 --> 02:04:25,279
I'm sorry, Jack.

1435
02:04:27,493 --> 02:04:31,713
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1436
02:04:47,113 --> 02:04:49,803
"Jack Sparrow,
be it known that you..."

1437
02:04:50,249 --> 02:04:52,389
Captain.
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1438
02:04:52,752 --> 02:04:56,792
"For your willful commission
of crimes against the crown."

1439
02:04:57,657 --> 02:04:59,967
"Said crimes being numerous
in quantity

1440
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:02,440
and sinister in nature.

1441
02:05:02,795 --> 02:05:06,075
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith.

1442
02:05:06,599 --> 02:05:08,789
Piracy, smuggling..."

1443
02:05:09,168 --> 02:05:11,188
This is wrong.

1444
02:05:11,537 --> 02:05:13,967
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law.

1445
02:05:14,374 --> 02:05:16,594
As are we all.

1446
02:05:16,976 --> 02:05:19,316
"Impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy.

1447
02:05:19,712 --> 02:05:22,432
Impersonating a cleric
of the church of England."

1448
02:05:22,882 --> 02:05:23,902
Ah, yeah.

1449
02:05:24,117 --> 02:05:27,367
"Sailing under false colors,
arson, kidnapping,

1450
02:05:27,887 --> 02:05:34,067
looting, poaching, brigandage,
pilfering, depravity,

1451
02:05:34,994 --> 02:05:38,424
depredation,
and general lawlessness.

1452
02:05:38,965 --> 02:05:41,015
And for these crimes

1453
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:43,617
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

1454
02:05:44,003 --> 02:05:47,253
hung by the neck until dead.

1455
02:05:47,774 --> 02:05:49,854
May God have mercy
on your soul."

1456
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:52,289
Governor Swann.

1457
02:05:52,645 --> 02:05:54,165
Commodore.

1458
02:05:57,650 --> 02:06:00,719
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you.

1459
02:06:03,589 --> 02:06:04,609
Il love you.

1460
02:06:21,707 --> 02:06:22,637
Marines.

1461
02:06:22,842 --> 02:06:24,362
I can't breathe.

1462
02:06:29,749 --> 02:06:30,679
Move!

1463
02:06:42,628 --> 02:06:43,737
What...

1464
02:06:55,208 --> 02:06:56,607
Move!

1465
02:07:15,795 --> 02:07:17,055
Come on!

1466
02:07:17,296 --> 02:07:19,166
-Right!
-Come on, lads!

1467
02:07:44,524 --> 02:07:48,804
l thought we might endure some
ill-conceived escape attempt.

1468
02:07:49,462 --> 02:07:50,752
But not from you.

1469
02:07:50,997 --> 02:07:54,337
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1470
02:07:54,867 --> 02:07:56,327
And this is how you thank me?

1471
02:07:56,602 --> 02:07:58,972
By throwing in
your lot with him?

1472
02:07:59,372 --> 02:08:00,192
He's a pirate!

1473
02:08:00,373 --> 02:08:02,123
And a good man.

1474
02:08:03,676 --> 02:08:05,346
If alll have achieved
is the hangman

1475
02:08:05,645 --> 02:08:08,865
will earn two pairs of boots
instead of one, so be it.

1476
02:08:09,382 --> 02:08:10,932
My conscience will be clear.

1477
02:08:11,217 --> 02:08:14,527
You forget your place, Turner.

1478
02:08:15,888 --> 02:08:19,168
It's right here
between you and Jack.

1479
02:08:23,663 --> 02:08:24,973
As is mine.

1480
02:08:27,433 --> 02:08:29,423
Lower your weapons.

1481
02:08:29,769 --> 02:08:31,909
For goodness sake,
put them down!

1482
02:08:36,609 --> 02:08:39,769
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then?

1483
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:42,450
It is.

1484
02:08:51,157 --> 02:08:54,467
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1485
02:08:54,994 --> 02:08:57,214
l think we've all arrived
at a special place.

1486
02:08:57,597 --> 02:08:58,527
Spiritually.

1487
02:08:58,731 --> 02:09:00,571
Ecumenically.

1488
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,679
Grammatically.

1489
02:09:03,603 --> 02:09:06,823
I want you to know that
l was rooting for you, mate.

1490
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:08,540
Know that.

1491
02:09:15,915 --> 02:09:18,815
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1492
02:09:20,553 --> 02:09:21,693
I'm sorry.

1493
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:28,720
Nice hat.

1494
02:09:30,363 --> 02:09:32,203
Friends.

1495
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:37,320
This is a day that you will
always remember

1496
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:38,970
as the day that...

1497
02:09:44,610 --> 02:09:47,769
Idiot. He has nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1498
02:09:49,382 --> 02:09:51,432
Sail ho!

1499
02:09:59,292 --> 02:10:01,602
What's your plan of action?

1500
02:10:02,561 --> 02:10:03,701
Sir?

1501
02:10:08,134 --> 02:10:10,124
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1502
02:10:10,469 --> 02:10:14,009
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1503
02:10:14,573 --> 02:10:18,113
piracy itself
can be the right course?

1504
02:10:22,648 --> 02:10:24,348
Mr. Turner.

1505
02:10:29,955 --> 02:10:32,415
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1506
02:10:38,664 --> 02:10:40,534
This is a beautiful sword.

1507
02:10:42,935 --> 02:10:46,005
I would expect the man who
made it to show the same care

1508
02:10:46,505 --> 02:10:49,085
in every aspect of his life.

1509
02:10:51,444 --> 02:10:52,994
Thank you.

1510
02:10:55,848 --> 02:10:57,548
Commodore!

1511
02:10:57,850 --> 02:10:59,400
What about Sparrow?

1512
02:11:00,786 --> 02:11:04,036
Well, I think we can afford to
give him one day's head start.

1513
02:11:10,229 --> 02:11:10,959
So.

1514
02:11:12,498 --> 02:11:15,657
This is the path
you've chosen, is it?

1515
02:11:17,436 --> 02:11:21,746
After all, he is a blacksmith.

1516
02:11:22,408 --> 02:11:23,608
No.

1517
02:11:28,514 --> 02:11:30,324
He's a pirate.

1518
02:11:55,474 --> 02:11:56,994
Heave!

1519
02:12:07,052 --> 02:12:09,632
Thought you were supposed to
keep to the Code.

1520
02:12:10,055 --> 02:12:13,685
We figured they were
more actual guidelines.

1521
02:12:18,297 --> 02:12:19,847
Thank you.

1522
02:12:21,066 --> 02:12:22,736
Captain Sparrow.

1523
02:12:26,772 --> 02:12:28,702
The Black Pearl is yours.

1524
02:12:44,156 --> 02:12:45,676
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

1525
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,478
Hands to braces!

1526
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:49,930
Let down and haul to run free!

1527
02:12:51,597 --> 02:12:55,376
Now, bring me that horizon.

1528
02:13:02,441 --> 02:13:04,961
And really bad eggs.

1529
02:13:08,180 --> 02:13:10,140
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho!
