1
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,968
Now, where to begin?

2
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,930
How ‘bout, "Once upon a time"?

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,730
How many times have you
heard that to begin a story?

4
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,619
Let's do somethin’ else.

5
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,708
! got it, l got it, here we go.
Here's how to open a movie!

6
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,956
No, ! don't think so.
It sounds familiar. Doesn't it, to you?

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,318
Oh, no, no, not the book.

8
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,123
How many have seen
"opening the book" before?

9
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,356
Close the book.
We're not doing that.

10
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:48,581
Here's what we're gonna do.

11
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,519
Why don't I just
go back to the day

12
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,515
things took a turn for the worse?

13
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,760
Run for your lives!
Everyone run for cover!

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,811
SOS! Mayday! Mayday!

15
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,604
Code red! Duck and cover!

16
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,233
You're all in danger!

17
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,052
Run for cover!

18
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,399
Run for your lives!

19
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,646
Emergency! Emergency!

20
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,029
Look out! Take cover!

21
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,727
Run for cover!

22
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,137
Chicken Little!
What is it? What's going on?

23
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,977
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,190
- The sky is falling?
- Are you crazy?

25
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,320
No, no, no!
It's true! Come with me!

26
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,718
No. Son? What?

27
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,152
It happened under the old oak tree!

28
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,391
I'm not making this up.
I know it's here.

29
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,596
There's a piece
of the sky somewhere...

30
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,448
.. somewhere
on the ground here.

31
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,369
It was shaped like that!

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,890
- Like a stop sign?
- Yes!

33
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,478
Only it doesn't say "stop"
and it's blue and it has a cloud on it.

34
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,785
And it hit me on the head!

35
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,327
- It looked like a stop sign.
- Wait! What's that?

36
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,440
- Son, is this what hit you?
- What?

37
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,085
No, Dad. It was definitely
a piece of the sky!

38
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,351
Piece of the sky.
It's OK, everyone!

39
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,264
- Dad, no.
- There's been, like, a little mistake.

40
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,847
It was just an acorn that hit my son.
A little acorn.

41
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,647
- No! Dad, no.
- Quiet, son.

42
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,852
This is embarrassing enough already.

43
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,004
Chicken Little!
What were you thinkin'?

44
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,109
Why put your town's safety
in jeopardy?

45
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,452
How could you mistake
a stop sign for an acorn?

46
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:24,231
- But it... a big acorn level fluh.
- What did he say?

47
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,810
- Abig acorn level fluh...
- It was a big acorn?

48
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,998
- It was an ape throwing coleslaw?
- Abig acorn level fluh...

49
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,449
Gesundheit!

50
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,637
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just gibberish,

51
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,672
- gibberish of an insane person.
- Come on, Buck!

52
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,229
Your kid went and
scared us all half to death!

53
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,428
Well, what can I tell you, folks,
my son,

54
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,400
you know... Kids do crazy stuff.
You have kids. It's...

55
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,952
No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn.

56
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,152
It was... it was a piece of the sky.
Really, it was.

57
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,542
You gotta believe me.

58
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,399
A movie. A movie.

59
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,218
They're makin' a movie.

60
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,425
When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?

61
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,467
First it was all over the papers,
then they wrote a book about it,

62
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,214
then the book on tape,
then the board game,

63
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,620
the spoons with your face on it...

64
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,851
.. the Web site,
the commemorative plates.

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,850
- You saw them, right?
- lsaw them.

66
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,252
Can't eat off 'em.

67
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,936
- They're not microwave-safe.
- You saw the billboards?

68
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,806
l saw them.

69
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,193
There's a bumper sticker.
I knew it was only a matter of time.

70
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,744
Billboards I could live with.
Posters I could even live with.

71
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,974
But a bumper sticker.
It's... it's like glued on forever.

72
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,506
It doesn't matter. You know why?
Because I've got a plan.

73
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,716
Yeah, about that.
Well, remember how I told you

74
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,980
it would be better
for you to lay low,

75
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,005
don't call attention to yourself?

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,237
- Yes, but I...
- See, it's like a game.

77
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:13,996
Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek, except
the goal is never to be found, ever!

78
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,080
Great! Now,
we've got a plan, right?

79
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,324
I'll see ya later!
Remember, lay low.

80
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,356
Yeah. OK.

81
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,486
Bye.

82
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,906
Look, Mama!
There's the crazy chicken!

83
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,548
Yes, itis! Crazy chicken. You're so
smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye!

84
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,537
That's it. Today is a new day.

85
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:59,709
It was a recipe for disaster

86
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,663
A four-course meal of "No sirree"

87
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,493
It seemed that happily ever after

88
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,963
Was happy everyone was after me

89
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,947
it was a cup of good intentions

90
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,137
A tablespoon of one big mess

91
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:21,118
A dash of overreaction

92
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,884
And I assume you know the rest

93
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,015
One little slip

94
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,398
One little slip

95
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,575
It was a fusion of confusion

96
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,584
With a few confounding things

97
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,138
I guess I probably took
the wrong direction

98
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,889
Well 1 admit 1 might've
missed a sign or two

99
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,479
! took a right turn at confusion

100
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,818
A left when I should've gone
straight on through

101
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,383
! ran ahead with my assumptions

102
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,846
And we all know
what that can do

103
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,393
One little slip

104
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,383
One little slip

105
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,695
It was a fusion of confusion

106
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:16,192
And a few confounding things

107
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,116
! get the feeling in this town
I'll never live ‘till live down

108
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,510
The one mistake that seems
to follow me around

109
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,697
But they'll forget about the sky
When they aif realize

110
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,046
This guy's about to try
to learn to fly

111
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,372
Or hit the ground

112
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,491
How's it going?

113
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,366
it was a cup of good intentions

114
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:54,337
A tablespoon of one big mess

115
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,594
A dash of overreaction

116
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,524
And I assume you know the rest

117
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,892
One little slip

118
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,995
One little slip

119
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,200
lt was a humble little stumble

120
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,693
With a big ungraceful

121
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,959
One little slip

122
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,768
One little slip

123
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:24,265
It was a fusion of confusion
with a few confounding things

124
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,155
Very well. Foxy Loxy.

125
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,737
- Present, pretty and punctual.
- Goosey Loosey.

126
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,877
Master Runt of the Litter.

127
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,735
Present and accounted for,
Mr. Woolensworth.

128
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,909
Dropped my pencil!

129
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,116
- Loser!
- Henny Penny.

130
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,394
- Here.
- Ducky Lucky.

131
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,599
- Here.
- Fuzzy Wuzzy.

132
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,060
- Here.
- Morkubine Porcupine.

133
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,616
- Yo.
- Fish Out of Water.

134
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,233
Quite. Abby Mallard.

135
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:20,616
Ugly duckling.

136
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,488
Class! I will not tolerate rude behavior

137
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,832
- at the expense of a fellow...
- Hey, no worries, Mr. Woolensworth.

138
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,617
You mustn't sneak up on me, Ugly...
Abby.

139
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,224
- Where was I?
- Ugly duckling.

140
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,007
Oh, yes.

141
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,717
Chicken Little.

142
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:48,158
- Tardy again.
- Tardy again.

143
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:53,485
Class, turn to page 62
and translate each word in Mutton.

144
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,807
He.

145
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,616
She.

146
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,597
They.

147
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,649
We.

148
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,602
OK, everyone. Listen up!

149
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,473
OK, everyone. Listen up!

150
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,251
I don't wanna hear any quacks,
tweets, oinks, whinnies

151
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:12,214
or cocklee-doodle-doos
when I say... dodgeball.

152
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,607
Oh, man.

153
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,959
Pump it up!
Pump it, pump it, pump it!

154
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,218
Split into two teams.
Popular versus unpopular.

155
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,148
- Coach?
- Yeah, unpopular?

156
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,823
Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?

157
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,336
Sure! Hit the pig, kids!

158
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,327
Look out!

159
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,036
Calm down, Runt. Just...

160
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,917
Just do what Fish is doing.

161
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,794
Everybody dance now

162
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,214
- Tough morning?
- Arun-in with my old nemesis.

163
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,293
- Gum in the crosswalk?
- He won.

164
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,205
Your old foe!

165
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,107
- Incoming on your right.
- Thank you.

166
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,598
Yeah, I heard about the movie.
Tough break.

167
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,235
- Yeah.
- Maybe it'll just go straight to video.

168
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,166
That's the least of my problems.

169
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:30,052
This morning... this morning my dad
told me I should basically disappear.

170
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,203
But that's not gonna get me down.

171
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,421
I've got a plan.
You want to hear about it?

172
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,131
No, no, no! this one's good.

173
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,026
Look, one moment destroyed my life,
right? One moment.

174
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,395
- Warthog at 3:00!
- lsee him!

175
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,349
- Yes!
- So I figure all l need is a chance...

176
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,202
All l need is a chance
to do something great

177
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,647
to make everyone forget the
"sky falling" thing once and for all.

178
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,574
Then my dad'll finally
have a reason to be proud of me.

179
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,181
Time out!

180
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,089
Nurse!

181
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,503
- Hi, Tiffany!
- Hey, man, what's goin' on?

182
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,826
So, what do you think?

183
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,682
OK, listen.

184
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,604
You said the sky was falling.

185
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,889
- Your dad didn't support you.
el.

186
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,805
And you have been
hurting inside ever since, right?

187
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,651
- It's hurt. It stung. OK?
- It's hurt, but... Yes.

188
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,651
- That's the nutshell.
- Yes, but...

189
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,492
- No..
- But, it's...

190
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:29,408
What's got to happen now is
the nut needs to be cracked open.

191
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,353
And not one little chip
at a time, but... bam!

192
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,911
Smash! Bits of emotion flying
everywhere! Anger! Frustration!

193
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,612
Denial! Fear! Deep depression, in fact!
You see what I'm saying?

194
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,523
All right, forget the nut part.
Here's the main thing.

195
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,306
You have got to stop messing around,
and deal with the problem.

196
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,537
- But...
- Here's the real solution.

197
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,149
You and your dad
talk-talk-talking... closure!

198
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,801
- Closure?
- Closure,

199
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,093
talking about something
until it's resolved.

200
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,585
Wait! Hold on! See? Look.

201
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,848
There's a whole section about it
in this month's Modern Mallard.

202
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,308
- Incredibly appropriate!
- [ told you, I have a plan.

203
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,488
Yeah, but according to Cosmo Duck,

204
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,189
you should
"stop the squawk and try the talk."

205
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,902
Beautiful Duckling says,

206
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,290
"Avoiding closure with your
parents can cause early molting."

207
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,058
See? Closure.

208
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,584
Come on, repeat after me.
You, your dad, talk-talk...

209
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,463
Abby, Abby, Abby, listen!
Talking's a waste of time.

210
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,713
I got to do something great
so my dad doesn't think I'm a loser.

211
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,956
Come on. You are not a loser.

212
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,968
You're inventive and resourceful
and funny and cute and...

213
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,858
What?

214
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,223
Yeah... Runt!

215
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,772
Should Chicken Little have a good talk
with his dad and clear the air

216
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,482
or keep searching for Band-Aid solutions
and never deal with the problem?

217
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,726
Band-Aid solutions!

218
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,700
- Runt!
- Well, I'm sorry!

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm very bad at reading facial cues.

220
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,118
Fish, help me out here.

221
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,225
Men.

222
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,187
‘Twas beauty that killed the beast.

223
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:20,119
I guess only girls are good at honest
communication and sensitivity.

224
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,039
That does it!
We were in a time-out, Foxy!

225
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,426
Prepare to hurt. And I don't
mean emotionally, like I do.

226
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,048
We will save you!

227
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,737
Fall back! Mad goose!

228
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,299
Chicken Little!

229
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,274
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

230
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,675
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

231
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,708
picking fights in gym class
and the fire alarm?

232
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,988
Ever since that "sky falling" incident,
he's been nothing but trouble!

233
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,225
Now look, Buck.

234
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,613
You know I have
the utmost respect for you.

235
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,362
I mean, you were Buck "Ace" Cluck,

236
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,481
our school baseball star.

237
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,371
But let's face the facts.

238
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,273
Your kid, he's nothing like you at all.

239
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,822
OK.

240
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,643
Thank you for talking to me.
I'll take care of my son.

241
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,317
I... Dad, it wasn't my fault.

242
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,143
- It was Foxy. She's always...
- All right. It's fine.

243
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,046
You don't have to explain anything.

244
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,419
Hey, Dad?

245
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:26,074
I was thinkin’.
Yeah, what if I...?

246
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,271
What if...?

247
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,804
What if I joined the baseball team?

248
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,304
Hey, why don't you
watch where you're going?!

249
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,529
Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry.

250
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,112
Baseball? Son, we talked about this.

251
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,031
Yeah, right. But, you know,
that was when I was small.

252
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,625
I put on five ounces this year.
I've really bulked up.

253
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,478
Really, son?
Baseball. Are you sure?

254
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,455
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean,
you know, hey, why not, right?

255
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,658
- Yeah, why not, but why?
- Well, Dad,

256
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,230
you were such a big
baseball star in high school.

257
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,076
You could give me some pointers.

258
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,464
But son, I'm just wondering...

259
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,475
Maybe baseball isn't exactly
your thing, you know?

260
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,247
Have you considered the chess team
or the glee club?

261
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,300
And some teenagers, you know, they
get quite a rush from stamp collecting.

262
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,565
- No.
- Wanna stop? We'll get stamps.

263
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,206
- [don't like stamps.
- Colors, colorful things...

264
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,893
No, I was thinkin’ baseball!

265
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,867
I can't wait to see
the look on your face

266
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,483
when I smack that ball in
for a touchdown!

267
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,829
Dad... I'm kidding.

268
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,824
That was a... that was a joke.

269
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,264
Just do me one favor, son.

270
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,581
Why, sure, Dad. Anything.

271
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:41,584
Just please try not
to get your hopes too high.

272
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,771
Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...

273
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,451
I mean, I think I can...

274
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,906
OK, Dad.

275
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,812
! bruise you

276
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,483
You bruise me

277
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,636
We both bruise so

278
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,164
Easily

279
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,079
Too easily

280
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,397
To let it show

281
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,064
I love you

282
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,553
And that's alf 1 know

283
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,332
Oh, Chloe. If only you were here.

284
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,833
You'd know what to do.

285
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,431
And all my plans

286
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,838
Keep fallin’ through

287
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,482
Alf my plans, they

288
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,695
Depend on you

289
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,457
Depend on you

290
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,354
To help them grow

291
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,819
I love you

292
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,754
- That's my boy!
- Gee, thanks, Dad!

293
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,809
And that's alf

294
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:28,532
It's really alll know

295
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,833
It's alll know

296
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,736
Come on. All l need is a chance.

297
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,837
It's all

298
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,999
I know

299
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,838
Yeah

300
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,716
Ohh

301
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:14,302
I can't sit here
while l go nowhere

302
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,249
Chase my dreams
through the polluted air

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,740
Chase my dreams
through the polluted air

304
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,251
I'm walking on a wire

305
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,562
I'm walking on a wire

306
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,811
Running out of time

307
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:28,286
There's no room
in this ol' heart of mine

308
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:32,828
Hungry minds
just stare you in the eyes

309
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:37,092
Spread it thick
and lay the biggest lies

310
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,860
Words jump off the pages

311
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,109
Passion hits the street

312
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:46,421
Anger's cooking
in the city heat

313
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,796
World's too crazy
! can't take no more

314
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,893
! won't stay here
locked behind the door

315
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,323
Got to stir it up

316
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,706
1 got to break it up now

317
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,249
When I think about tomorrow

318
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,937
Ooh, I can't wait to

319
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,640
Stir it up
Got to shake it up now

320
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,469
If have to beg or borrow

321
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,274
I'm not gonna take it anymore

322
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,941
Oh-oh oh-ohh-oh oh-ohh-oh
Come on

323
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,132
Oh-oh oh-ohh-oh oh-ohh-oh
Come on

324
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,002
So much pressure
to keep holding on

325
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,464
Whoa

326
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,992
Pack my clothes up, baby

327
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,935
I'll be gone

328
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,820
Stir it up
Got to break it up now

329
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,158
When I think about tomorrow

330
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,329
When I think about tomorrow

331
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,662
I can't wait to
Stir it up

332
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,623
I can't wait to
Stir it up

333
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,831
! got to shake it up now

334
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,352
! got to shake it up now

335
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,334
If have to beg or borrow

336
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:43,765
If have to beg or borrow

337
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,971
I'm not gonna take it no more

338
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,522
Lean to the left
Lean to the right

339
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,728
C'mon Acorns
Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!

340
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,734
There's excitement
in the air, ladies and gentlemen.

341
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,053
It's been two decades since
Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals

342
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,193
the Spud Valley Taters.

343
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,392
Down by only a single run,
with a player in scoring position,

344
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,672
we have a chance.

345
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,927
This excitement isn't about
the fun of baseball, the prize.

346
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,831
It's about the gloating
and rubbing their noses in it,

347
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,607
the "Nah-nah-na-na-na!
We beat you!" taunting

348
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,556
- that comes with the winning.
- Yeah!

349
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,175
That's right. Oakey Oaks
and Mayor Turkey Lurkey

350
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:33,042
will finally have bragging rights
again for one full year!

351
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,437
This battle has taken a heavy toll
on our hometown heroes.

352
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,401
After nine grueling innings
and several players out with injuries,

353
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,685
the Acorns are scraping
the bottom of the roster.

354
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,944
Hopefully, there's just enough muscle
on the bench to pull out a win.

355
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,879
Up next... Chicken Little.

356
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,326
Clearly a long shot, folks.

357
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,278
Little hasn't been up to bat once
since joining the team.

358
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,618
- He's gonna lose the game for us!
- But wait!

359
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,853
If he can just get a walk
and advance to first, that powerhouse,

360
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,753
Foxy Loxy can step up
and save us all.

361
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:19,074
She's had a terrific game so far.
A shoo-in for the MVP trophy.

362
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,206
OK, kid, listen up.

363
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,803
You have an itty-bitty,
teeny-tiny strike zone.

364
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:28,134
There's no way he can throw you out!
Take the walk. Don't swing.

365
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,976
- [have a good feeling...
- Look at me. Don't swing.

366
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,456
Take the walk. You hear me?
Just take the walk!

367
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,952
- But, coach, wait!
- Don't swing!

368
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,219
Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold
the pine, Little advances to the box.

369
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,400
He's going to bat from the right.

370
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,410
Make it the left. No, the right.

371
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,820
- The right.
- Easy out!

372
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,822
Looks like left field's
found something better to do,

373
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,635
center field's got a hunger pang
in his second stomach

374
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,645
- and right field's digging for grubs.
- Play ball!

375
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,965
Why him? Why now?

376
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,760
l won't embarrass you, Dad.
Not this time.

377
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,138
Here's the wind-up, the pitch!
It's a high cutter.

378
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,920
Ball!

379
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,111
Strike one!

380
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:23,293
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.

381
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,380
The catcher lays down the signals.
Here's the pitch.

382
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,763
Curve ball low and outside, he swings!

383
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,706
Strike two!

384
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,641
I said, don't swing!

385
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,251
Don't swing!

386
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,942
- No!
- Batter up!

387
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:47,886
Two in the hole!

388
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,837
One more strike, it's a punch out,
folks, and we're all going home.

389
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,951
Today is a new day.

390
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,418
Don't swing!

391
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,604
Well, take away my squeaky toy!
It's a hit!

392
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:23,952
- Ahit?
- Ahit?

393
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,525
A hit?

394
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,206
But wait! The batter
is still at home plate.

395
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,587
He's standing in a daze.
Run, kid, run!

396
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,662
Go, son! Run! Run!

397
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,813
There he goes,
headed the wrong way.

398
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,977
- Wait, wait, wait!
- No, no! Not that way!

399
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,030
- Run the other way!
- Turn around!

400
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,260
Wait, wait! He's turned!
I've never said these words before,

401
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,587
but he's actually
rounding home plate!

402
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,499
- Goosey Loosey steps on home...
- Today's a new day!

403
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,412
We have a tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.

404
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,695
Looks like Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the center fielder!

405
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:07,002
Mayhem in the outfield,
as Rodriguez is fired to second.

406
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,289
Catch is complete,
but where's the ball?

407
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,316
Little touches the bag
and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.

408
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,259
The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!

409
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,455
- It's stuck! It's stuck!
- Tip the cow!

410
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,662
It's the old tip-the-cow play.

411
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,170
The kid heads for the hot corner,
a stand-up triple!

412
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,280
- Yes!
- Hold up! No!

413
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,455
He's going for the whole enchilada!

414
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,487
The ball of wax,
kit and the caboodle!

415
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,689
Go back!
You're never gonna make it!

416
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,812
He's trying to lighten his load!

417
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,205
The outfield behind,
Little's on all cylinders!

418
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:39,554
He slides for the dish!

419
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:43,165
It's going to be a photo finish at home!

420
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,506
You're out!

421
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,002
Oh, folks.
Folks, what a heartbreaker.

422
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,032
- Wait!
- Wait, wait!

423
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,930
Wait a cotton-picking second.
Hold your horses, here,

424
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:08,697
and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over. He...

425
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,978
He's...

426
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,354
Safe! The runner is safe!

427
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:23,528
It's all over, folks!
The Acorns have done the impossible!

428
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,606
For the first time in 20 years,
we won the pennant!

429
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:30,581
Mothers, kiss your babies!
You've witnessed a miracle!

430
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,620
Remember where you were at this
moment. The smells! The sounds!

431
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:38,307
There's a new winner in town
and his name is Chicken Little!

432
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,964
That was just a lucky hit!

433
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,532
Yes, Chicken Little, it's all yours!

434
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,178
The victory, the triumph, the glory!

435
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,524
And getting doused with a sticky drink
that soaks into your undies

436
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,641
and chafes for hours!

437
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:54,416
This is one memory you'll savor forever!

438
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,632
Yeah!

439
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:06,014
Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won!
That's my boy out there!

440
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:08,455
That's my boy!

441
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:20,286
lam the champion, my friend

442
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:27,491
And I'll keep on fightin’
till the end

443
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:34,193
lam the champion

444
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,783
lam the champion

445
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,092
But gone is the loser

446
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,423
‘Cause lam the champion

447
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,789
Of the world

448
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:56,802
Here's the wind-up and the pitch!

449
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,706
- Aknuckleball!
- He swings!

450
00:28:58,971 --> 00:28:59,931
- Crack!
- It's going.

451
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,538
- He rounds first, to second!
- It hits high off the wall!

452
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,811
He flies past third
and heads for the plate!

453
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,723
It's a scramble for the ball!
It's gonna be close!

454
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,046
He is safe!

455
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,043
- The mighty Acorns win!
- Yes! Acorns win!

456
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,875
The mighty Acorns win!

457
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,552
Geez, you know,

458
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,831
I guess that puts the whole
"sky is falling" incident

459
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:36,235
behind us once and for all.
Hey, kiddo?

460
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,548
You bet, Dad.

461
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,187
Unless you think we need... closure?

462
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:48,084
Closure? What's to close here?

463
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,097
Unless you think we need to close...

464
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,498
- Not me.
- It's closed!

465
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,503
- lagree. Vacuum sealed.
- Shut tight!

466
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,545
OK, great, Dad. You...
Closure, I dunno.

467
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,358
All right. Enough fun.

468
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,694
Good talk. Good talk, son.

469
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:13,004
- Here, I'll give you a push.
- Rock me a little. Help me.

470
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,326
- OK.
- OK, I'm up.

471
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,087
Hey.

472
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,524
Good night, Ace.

473
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,647
Here's the wind-up...
and the pitch!

474
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,485
Thanks.

475
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,591
Thanks for the chance.

476
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,026
No!

477
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:34,222
A piece of the sky?!
Shaped like a stop sign?! Not again!

478
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,632
Hey! Son!
You all right? I'm coming!

479
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,772
I'm coming! I'm comin’ upstairs!

480
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,064
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

481
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,083
You sure?
I thought I heard you yell.

482
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,482
No.

483
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,038
I fell out of bed.

484
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,490
- How'd you get over there?
- Over where?

485
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:54,952
- There. There!
- Where?

486
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,200
How'd you get over there?

487
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:58,809
Who're we talking about?

488
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:05,256
Never mind. What's the difference?
Look, the past is behind us, right?

489
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,261
Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.

490
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,675
Please be gone,
please be gone, please be gone...

491
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,708
Good.

492
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,718
No.

493
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:10,708
No.

494
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,747

00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,221
All right, guys. Watch this.

514
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,244
Bizarre.

515
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,332
OK. Lemme guess.
You haven't told your dad yet.

516
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,116
- Well...
- [knew it!

517
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:38,513
Why haven't you told him?
There hasn't been

518
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,536
- "you, your dad, talk-talk-talking."
- There was talking.

519
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,080
- There was definitely talking.
- Really? What did he say?

520
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:49,826
What?

521
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,835
All right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!

522
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,981
You have got to stop messing
around and deal with the problem!

523
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,917
- She's right!
- Abby, please.

524
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,096
This is what
fell on me the first time.

525
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,452
There's no way I'm
bringing this up again.

526
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:03,881
- No, he's not.
- Runt!

527
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,241
Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flopper.

528
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,765
OK. I'm sure there's
a simple, logical explanation.

529
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,325
I mean, it could be
a piece of weather balloon,

530
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,807
or maybe it's part of some
experimental communications satellite.

531
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,654
I don't care. I want it
out of my life, gone for good.

532
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,570
Everything back to normal.

533
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,984
Hey, remember when that
icy blue stuff fell from the sky?

534
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,804
Everybody thought
it was from space and stuff?

535
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:33,114
And it just turned out to be
frozen pee from a jet airplane.

536
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,162
Yeah, that's right.
It's frozen pee.

537
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:39,498
Yeah. It's frozen pee.
Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.

538
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,141
- Could you stop saying that?
- What? Pee?

539
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,467
- Pee.
- Tinkle?

540
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:44,815
- Piddle? Wee-wee?
- Whiz?

541
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:46,413
OK, subject change.

542
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,196
- Make pishee?
- [don't care what it is!

543
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,131
Are you gonna help me
get rid of it or not?

544
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,316
Flying Fish! Take cover!

545
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,912
Fish!

546
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:22,786
- No!
- Fish!

547
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:35,893
Come on, come on, come on!

548
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:40,622
Wait, wait, whoa, son!
Where's the fire here?

549
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,313
Chicken Little has something to
tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.

550
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,599
Who're we talkin’ about?

551
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,076
Gotta go, Dad! Bye!

552
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,551
You got to be ready
to listen to your children,

553
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,195
even if they have nothing to say.

554
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,402
- Sit tight, Fish!
- Fish! We will try to save you!

555
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,185
I'm sorry! Wait!

556
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,601
Sorry!

557
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,973
Curb!

558
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,406
Fish!

559
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,871
Abby!

560
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,622
Abby! Wake up!

561
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,830
Come on! Let's get outta here!

562
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,263
Oh, poor Fish!

563
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,621
He's probably stuffed and mounted
like an intergalactic trophy or...

564
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:01,958
..maybe he's a half-living host
implanted with face-hugging babies.

565
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,761
One thing's for sure, man. He's gone!

566
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,630
- Gone, man!
- Not yet!

567
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,933
Oh, snap.

568
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,246
Fish.

569
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:21,136
Hey! What are you doing? Come on!

570
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,912
Fish.

571
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,942
Fish.

572
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,690
Fish.

573
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:38,922
Fish.

574
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,590
Where are you, Fish?!

575
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,450
I can't handle the pressure!
Go on without me!

576
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,145
- Runt.
- You're just fine.

577
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:48,484
I'll jeopardize the mission!
Endanger us all!

578
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,090
Throw me overboard
while you still have a chance!

579
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:55,546
Just leave me some ammo, little
water, some chips if you have ‘em.

580
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,609
Calm. OK, all right. Listen.

581
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,612
- Where's your bag?
- Everything's OK.

582
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,497
- Now breathe.
- Breathe.

583
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,891
- No, slowly.
- Slowly.

584
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,359
Slowly.

585
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:10,491
OK. Now, just do
the thing you do to relax.

586
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,083
Well, you can tell by the way

587
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:21,309
l use my walk I'm a woman's man

588
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,763
No time to talk

589
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,720
Stayin’ alive, stayin’ alive’

590
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,928
Fish!

591
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,764
Fish! Are you OK?

592
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,673
Did they hurt you? Say something!

593
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,364
Don't tap the glass.
They hate it when you do that.

594
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,047
All right, let's get out of here.
Where's Runt?

595
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,553
We're next.

596
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,734
Run!

597
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,307
OK! That's it!

598
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,648
We're running back to your house.
Tell your dad!

599
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,467
OK! You're right, you're right!

600
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,230
Stayin’ alive, stayin’ alive

601
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,938
Stayin’ alive

602
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,404
Oh, Runt!

603
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,774
Push! Push! No!

604
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,480
- Runt!
- No! Not pull! Push!

605
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,801
We gotta get outta here right now!
Come on...

606
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,616
No! Come on, you guys! Hu...

607
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,073
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

608
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,915
OK, time out!

609
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:27,264
So... have you been to the mall?

610
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,573
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.

611
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:38,955
I'm sorry.

612
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,817
Tension makes me bloat.

613
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,363
Come on, guys! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

614
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,410
Look out!

615
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:28,405
Thanks! Curse these
genetically tiny legs!

616
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,966
What's that noise?

617
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,057
Sorry. Nervous eater.

618
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,288
- Run!
- Wait! Fish!

619
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,750
The school bell! We've got to ring
the school bell to warn everyone!

620
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,091
Come on!

621
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,725
Hurry! Hurry!

622
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,016
Go! Go!

623
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,658
It's locked!

624
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:22,395
They're... they're comin’.

625
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:28,945
I need a soda.

626
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:32,665
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy!

627
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,120
- The corner's wrinkled!
- Why are we doing this?

628
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,909
Come on, take it, take it!

629
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,247
Yes!

630
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,435
Come on! Work! Work!

631
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:48,901
Work! You work!

632
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:53,595
What happened?
I blacked out there for a second.

633
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:18,302
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!

634
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:21,203
It was just an acorn. A little acorn!

635
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,789
I can't tell you
how embarrassed I am, folks.

636
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:27,158
Ring the bell!

637
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,622
Come on, Chicken Little!
Ring the bell!

638
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,684
What?

639
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:02,694
Let's check the weather with Riz.

640
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,263
A cold front is moving in so...

641
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,548
The alarm bell has been activated!
Quick! Get a camera crew!

642
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:28,262
Chicken Little! You better
have a good explanation for this!

643
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,609
There's, there's... It's a...
You have to... D'oh! Doo wah!

644
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:32,939
What did he say?

645
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,887
There's... It's a... You have to...
D'oh! Doo wah!

646
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,000
Follow me! Come on!
Hurry! Hurry! Aliens here!

647
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:42,478
Aliens here!

648
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:46,188
It's... it's happening again.

649
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,953
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

650
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,749
Come on. Come on.
You're about to see it!

651
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,528
Quick! Quick! It's taking off!

652
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:01,937
Come on! If you don't hurry,
you're gonna miss it!

653
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,199
Oh, look! A penny!

654
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:07,404
- Guys!
- Oh, right.

655
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,999
Hurry! Hurry!

656
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:17,316
Come on! Quick! It's taking off!

657
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:19,924
Come on! Hurry up! Please!
It's right in...

658
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,373
- What are we lookin’ for?
- [don't know.

659
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,381
Yeah. OK. I know this looks bad,

660
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:32,277
but there's an
invisible spaceship right there

661
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,596
with aliens
who are here to invade Earth!

662
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:36,542
Let me show you.

663
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,529
Bad throw.

664
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,547
OK, let me try again.

665
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,182
- Bad throw.
- We all know I don't have a good arm,

666
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,825
but there's these
cloaking panels on the bottom.

667
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,430
They make it disappear. One fell out
of the sky and hit me right on the head.

668
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:53,377
It's the acorn thing all over again.

669
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:54,774
There's no story here.

670
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,265
At least we can sell
the video to Chickens Gone Wild.

671
00:50:57,688 --> 00:51:00,728
- I'm telling ya, it was here!
- No, wait! There were aliens!

672
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:04,211
It's true! They had eyes...
They're glowing and then tentacles!

673
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:07,625
And maps with planets
with X's through them!

674
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,148
Runt, that's enough!

675
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,996
Don't make Mommy take away
your Streisand collection!

676
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,956
Mom? You leave Barbra out of this!

677
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:18,801
Why can't you keep that
child of yours under control?

678
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:22,413
- What kind of parent are you?
- Everybody, I'm telling the truth.

679
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,833
Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up!

680
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,591
You gotta believe me this time.

681
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,783
No, son. I don't.

682
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:49,413
I can't tell you
how embarrassed I am, folks.

683
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,713
I'm really sorry about this, everyone.

684
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:54,727
Looks like this is just

685
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,672
a big, crazy misunderstanding.

686
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:03,183
Well, other than the penny,
this whole evening was a wash!

687
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:08,794
Mr. Cluck, don't take it so hard.
No one blames you.

688
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,880
Emergency, emergency!

689
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,102
Reports of panic and mayhem
. .
are pouring in

690
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:27,045
after yet another
Chicken Little incident last night.

691
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:30,251
In one instance, a family
of lemmings was sent running in fear,

692
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,748
but unable to find a cliff,
they instead began throwing themselves

693
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,464
- from the nearest park bench.
- Hello? I'm sorry.

694
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:39,627
Hello? I apologize.
Hello? Give me break! Hello?

695
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:42,453
What? You were trampled?
That's terrible.

696
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,633
I thought rabbits' feet
were supposed to be lucky.

697
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,380
You have hate mail.

698
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,723
- I'm truly sorry. That wasn't funny.
- You have more hate mail.

699
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,868
Hi. What are you saying, sir?

700
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,943
Your hate mail box is full.

701
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,754
Oh, yes.
I do see the skywriting there.

702
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:02,269
Thank goodness the cloud
blocked the last letter. Hello?

703
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,390
Hey, hey, hey!
Watch your mouth. Yeah?

704
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:09,029
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'd like to see you try.

705
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,066
OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye.

706
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,353
Hello? Really. Well...

707
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:37,199
If there was ever a time
to talk to your dad, it's now.

708
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,721
It's too late for that.

709
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,701
It's too late, baby,
now it's too late.

710
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,056
Though they really
did try to make it.

711
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:52,785
Runt.

712
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:55,194
Just think about it.

713
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,678
Something inside has died
and they just can't hide

714
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:03,356
and they just can't fake it.
Oh, no, no.

715
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:10,321
Runt, I just really want
to be alone right now.

716
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,761
Abby! Runt! Fish!

717
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,049
Look! There!
Look there! Look there!

718
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,245
- What is that thing?!
- Look at that!

719
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,334
- His name is Kirby?
- They left him behind?

720
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,130
Darth Vader is Luke's father?

721
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:45,153
No, don't...
Come on, come on, don't cry.

722
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:49,285
We're here for you. We're gonna do
whatever it takes to get you back home.

723
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,190
Here, blow.

724
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,043
OK.

725
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:05,422
See, guys? He's cool.
He was just freaked out. That's all.

726
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:01,077
Run!

727
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,319
Those are your parents?

728
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:18,066
And they brought the galactic armada?

729
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:25,499
- Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
- There you are. Get in the car.

730
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,589
- [ gotta tell you something.
- What?

731
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,948
I know, I know! You were right!
Alien invasion. I see that now.

732
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,058
- Look up! There it is!
- Dad, you know, about that...

733
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:37,034
- It's actually just a rescue mission.
- Rescue mission?

734
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,914
This alien kid was left
and they're coming back to get him!

735
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,664
We have to help him,
‘cause if we don't, who else will?

736
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,430
What?!

737
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,019
Forget it.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

738
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:50,899
Son!

739
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:54,648
Son, come back!
Son! Chicken Little!

740
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,605
Mr. Cluck! Wait!
He's telling the truth!

741
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:02,607
He is! Though, given his track record,
we understand why you don't believe him!

742
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:07,644
It's the end of the world
as we know it

743
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,178
It's the end of the world
as we know it

744
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,235
Is there any sign of him?

745
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:14,493
Negative.

746
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,390
We'll have to send in the ground troops.

747
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:20,613
And I feel fine

748
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:26,226
It's the end of the world
as we know it

749
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:30,750
It's the end of the world
as we know it

750
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:35,535
It's the end of the world
as we know it

751
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,519
And I feel fine

752
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:52,498
Watch out for the kid! No! Don't!
Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out!

753
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,589
Chicken Little!

754
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,045
What? Where's your head?

755
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,160
We gotta get outta here!
Come on! Come o...

756
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,862
- You, with the running and the jumping!
- Dad. No, wait.

757
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,402
What are you guys doing?
We gotta get outta here!

758
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,374
It's like
War of the Worlds out there!

759
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,856
- Stop pulling!
- Just listen to me for one second!

760
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,165
- It's not dangerous!
- We are under attack!

761
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,723
Will you two stop messing around
and deal with the problem?

762
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,417
- You're never there for me!
- What?

763
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,446
OK, that's not what
l had in mind, but...

764
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,498
You're never there for me.
I mean,

765
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:49,597
you were when I won the game,
but not when I thought the sky fell.

766
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,663
And not at the ball field
and not now!

767
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,625
This is good!
Keep going. Keep going!

768
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,913
You've been ashamed
since the acorn thing.

769
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,979
We have to talk because
Modern Mallard says avoiding closure

770
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,159
can lead to molting.
I'm already small

771
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:03,775
and I don't think
Il could handle being bald!

772
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:13,319
I didn't... realize, son.

773
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,140
I never meant to...

774
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,397
The acorn, the sky,
I mean, the whole...

775
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,140
You're right. You're right.

776
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,442
Your mom, she was...

777
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:39,309
You know, she was
always good with stuff like this.

778
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,666
Me...

779
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:48,243
..l'm gonna need a lot of work.

780
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:53,054
But you need
to know that I love you,

781
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,700
no matter what.

782
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,196
And I'm sorry l....

783
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,139
And I'm sorry if l ever made
you feel like that was something...

784
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,380
..you had to earn.

785
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,535
And we're good. Let's go. Let's go.

786
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:29,852
OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

787
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,283
OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

788
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:38,583
Return this whatever it is?

789
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:41,362
This is crazy! Crazy!

790
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:43,315
Crazy wonderful!

791
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,380
Just tell me what you need me to do.

792
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,802
- Do you really mean it?
- You bet! Anything, son.

793
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:53,523
Come on, Dad.
We've got a planet to save!

794
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:58,625
Crazy supportive. That's me!

795
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,982
This thing likes to nibble, doesn't it?

796
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:08,618
By the way, I'd like to say I've
always found you extremely attractive!

797
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,684
Now that's closure.

798
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:26,794
Wait! Wait! What's goin’ on?!

799
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:34,348
They've given her
an alien mind-wipe!

800
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:38,926
OK, son. What do we do now?

801
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:40,712
OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad.

802
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:44,271
All we have to do is take the kid down
the street to the giant metal alien.

803
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:49,866
We surrender! Here!
Take the key to the city!

804
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,437
Key to my car?

805
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,283
Tic Tac?

806
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,640
Forget plan A!

807
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,048
OK, OK, what now, son?

808
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:19,467
Who, by the way,
l support 100 percent.

809
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:24,019
- Plan B?
- Of course! Plan B! What is plan B?

810
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,215
What? You have to go to the bathroom?
You want juice?

811
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,415
A snack?
Corn dog on a stick?

812
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,640
Want to play some golf?
What do you want?!

813
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,696
I stink at this.
I'm a horrible father.

814
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,456
No, no, no, am. 1am.

815
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:45,343
Is that your parents?

816
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:48,907
That's it, Dad! Plan B!

817
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:52,032
All we have to do is weave
through traffic through town square

818
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,545
while avoiding death rays
from alien robots.

819
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:57,118
We get to Town Hall,
climb up to the roof

820
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,780
and give the kid
back to its parents.

821
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:03,138
Yeah!

822
01:04:04,374 --> 01:04:06,154
Charge!

823
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:32,202
Now that's what
I call takin’ out the trash!

824
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,661
OK, son. Now what?

825
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,090
Fire truck!

826
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:51,783
Plan C!

827
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:57,832
Runt, no! Turn around!

828
01:04:58,161 --> 01:05:00,881
- Go back to Town Hall!
- But they'll vaporize us!

829
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,702
- You want me to do what?
- Runt, just do it! It'll work!

830
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,919
We'll survive!

831
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:11,255
I will survive?

832
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,531
Brake, Abby!

833
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,420
OK.

834
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:17,909
Floor it!

835
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,182
Deploy ladder, Fish!

836
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:33,912
I'll survive

837
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:36,887
will survive
Hey, hey

838
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,642
Plan D.

839
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,560
Thighs hurting.
Drumsticks burning.

840
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:53,928
But loving you!
Full support!

841
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,803
I can't get out!
Come back, son!

842
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:08,006
We can't go out this way!
It's dangerous.

843
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:10,321
- No, Dad, I can do this!
- It's too dangerous.

844
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,447
I can do this. I can.

845
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,859
You gotta believe me this time.

846
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:17,576


847
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:21,883
I do, son.

848
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,350
OK, hang on tight.

849
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,847
- Yes!
- Here's your kid! Look over here!

850
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:39,821
Here's your kid!

851
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,586
He's OK!

852
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:51,238
He's all right!
Stop the invasion!

853
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,405
Son! Son!

854
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:05,852
- I'm here, son!
- Dad! Look out!

855
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:08,902
Get away from my boy! Get away!

856
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,978
The mighty Acorns...

857
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,257
Tic Tac?

858
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,151
Why did you take our child?

859
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:37,768
Just... Just hold on there, buddy!

860
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,151
My son did not take your kid!

861
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,160
You were the one
that left him behind!

862
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,918
That's bad parenting!
And I should know!

863
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:47,198
Silence!

864
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:50,365
Release the child!

865
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,327
- OK.
- OK, OK.

866
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:59,868
Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby,
I'm so happy to see you! My darling!

867
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:04,028
- That was close.
- At least they're back together.

868
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,374
They got their kid.

869
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:09,122
You have violated
intergalactic law 90210!

870
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:13,996
A charge punishable
by immediate particle disintegration!

871
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,894
Oh, snap.

872
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:24,095
What's that?

873
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:28,358
I don't quite...

874
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:31,774
Melvin, honey? He's saying
they're telling the truth.

875
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,915
It was just a misunderstanding.

876
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,119
Well, then. This is awkward.

877
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,245
- Yes, it is.
- [suppose I should...

878
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,921
- Put the big guns away?
- Yes, yes.

879
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,779
- Now put them down.
- Of course.

880
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,655
- And turn off your big voice.
- But I don't...

881
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,231
- Turn it off.
- But...

882
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,652
But I don't get to use
the big voice very often!

883
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:57,375
Melvin.

884
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,560
Yes, dear.

885
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:07,629
Hi. Anyone want
to try the big voice?

886
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:16,522
Again, I cannot tell you how sorry
we are for this whole misunderstanding.

887
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,203
Oh, dear goodness.
We are so very sorry.

888
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,695
We are. And if it
hadn't been for your son there,

889
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:24,548
well, we might have
vaporized the whole planet.

890
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:25,951
What?

891
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,092
Goodness!
What a shame that would have been.

892
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,100
- Tell ‘em!
- Where would we pick acorns?

893
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,129
We stop here
on the way to the in-laws.

894
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:34,895
- Every year.
- Looked on all the other planets.

895
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,234
- You only find them on Earth.
- It says here.

896
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:40,825
That caught our eyes.

897
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:43,876
OK, everything's
been put back to normal,

898
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,210
except for this one, over here.

899
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,099
Hi, y‘all!

900
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:49,254
Foxy?

901
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:51,972
Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli lolli folfi

902
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:53,258
Lollipop...

903
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:56,066
She got her brainwaves
scrambled during reconstitution.

904
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,572
No worries!
We can put her back the way she was.

905
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:01,148
No! She's perfect.

906
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,201
Lollipop!
Lollipop!

907
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,019
Scary.

908
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:08,245
Darling! Look at the time!
We better get a move on.

909
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,628
All right, then.
It was good meetin’ ya.

910
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,531
Sorry for the whole
full-scale invasion thing.

911
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,984
But, hey, I'm a dad.
You know how it is with your kids.

912
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:22,081
When they need ya,
you do whatever it takes.

913
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,365
There goes that panel again.

914
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:30,628
Every year we come,
this thing falls off.

915
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,860
Seriously, honey, someday it's
going to hit somebody on the head.

916
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,670
- Nonsense!
- You can't return the panel, can you?

917
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,696
- Now that's ridiculous.
- You threw away the receipt again.

918
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:41,006
Silence!

919
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:44,134
Melvin, did you just try
and use the big voice on me?

920
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:49,484
Who we talkin’ about?

921
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,281
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

922
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,472
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

923
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:58,105
I just hope they stay true
to what really happened.

924
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:01,089
Oh, son, these people
are from Hollywood!

925
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,080
One thing they'll never do...

926
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,128
..1S mess with a good story.

927
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:06,709
..1S mess with a good story.

928
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,381
Red alert! Man your battle stations!
Status report, Mr. Fish.

929
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,746
Commander Little,
the evil Foxloxian Army

930
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,065
has broken through
the planet's atmosphere.

931
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:20,905
But that means...

932
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:24,807
Yes, I know.
The sky... is falling.

933
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:26,871
Commander Little! No!

934
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:29,610
Please... call me...

935
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:31,333
Ace.

936
01:11:31,554 --> 01:11:33,074
Oh, Ace! No!

937
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:37,135
I never intended
to bring you into this... Abby.

938
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,777
- Runt, do you copy?
- Yes, commander?

939
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,729
Runt, my friend, an alien fleet
is about to invade Earth.

940
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,490
Civilization as we know it
depends on me

941
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:51,224
and, to a lesser extent... you.

942
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:54,871
So I've just got one question for you:

943
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:57,567
Are you ready to rock?

944
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:01,667
Ain't no mountain high enough,
ain't no valley low...

945
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:04,861
Ain't no mountain high enough

946
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:08,157
Raise your pork shield, Runt.
Prepare to engage.

947
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,035
Stay on target.
Stay on target!

948
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:17,358
Give 'em a taste
of the other white meat!

949
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,164
Cap'n! Look out!

950
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:21,339
Runt!

951
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:22,877
Runt, are you all right?

952
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:26,709
No, no. Ya gotta go on
without me, commander.

953
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,657
Just leave me some ammo,
a little water,

954
01:12:33,216 --> 01:12:34,946
some chips if you have ‘em.

955
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:37,801
This is amazingly accurate.

956
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,573
He was my good friend.

957
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:45,483
Oh, Abby.

958
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,921
At least I still have you... Abby.

959
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:51,182
- Ace!
- Abby.

960
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,630
- Ace!
- Abby.

961
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:56,807
Ace!

962
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:00,291
Good people of Oakey Oaks.

963
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:04,653
Though at times it may feel
like the sky is falling around you,

964
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:06,481
.
never give up.

965
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:10,666
For every day... is a new day!

966
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:13,427
A new day!

967
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,980
Ain't no mountain high enough

968
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:18,785
Ain't no valley low enough

969
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:21,155
Oh, Ace!

970
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,397
To keep me from you

971
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,663
Ain't no mountain high enough

972
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,112
Ain't no valley low enough

973
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:30,281
Ain't no river wild enough

974
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,776
To keep me from you

975
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,952
Ain't no mountain high enough

976
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,886
Nothing can keep me

977
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:42,093
Keep me from you

978
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:46,518
Ain't no mountain high enough

979
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:48,906
Nothing can keep me

980
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:51,685
Keep me from you

981
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,204
Ain't no mountain high enough

982
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:56,553
Ain't no valley low enough

983
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:58,709
Ain't no river wild enough

984
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:01,937
To keep me from you

985
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:02,698
To keep me from you

986
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:05,422
Nothing in this world

987
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,591
Nothing in this world

988
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,660
Can keep me from you, babe

989
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,393
Just call my name

990
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,645
Don't go breaking my heart

991
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,306
! couldn't if I tried

992
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:36,759
Oh, honey, if! get restless

993
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:40,463
Baby, you're not that kind

994
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,561
And nobody knows it

995
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,935
- When I! was down
- l was your clown

996
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:57,924
And nobody knows it

997
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,160
Nobody knows

998
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,196
Right from the start

999
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,367
I gave you my heart

1000
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:08,692
I gave you my heart

1001
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,987
Don't go breaking my heart

1002
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:17,617

Don't go breaking my heart

1009
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,309
Come on, Runt. You can do it.

1010
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:38,788
Don't go breaking my
! won't go breaking your heart

1011
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:42,371
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my

1012
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,622
You got to act quickly, Dad.
Try this.

1013
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,519
- Don't go breaking my
- There you go!

1014
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:48,359
- Don't go breaking my
- There it is!

I'm having fun now!

1017
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:56,223
Don't go breaking my heart

1018
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,989
That was great!

1019
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,788
Let's sing it again!
