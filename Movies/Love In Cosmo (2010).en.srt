Try it

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,890

How about it

22
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,670

just like choosing a husband

23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,200
you must choose the right one

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,030

publication is going to be delayed

Shun Jia let’s split up

84
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
LuoYi you are still alive

85
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,050
Wu Ju Yuan don’t give up

86
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,729
We can sleep together afterwards

87
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,969
He could go with you

88
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,550
Shun Jia

89
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,910
Cat Mummy couldn't bear to be away from you

90
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,189
Where did you come from boy

91
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,200
You haven't been in touch with me for years

92
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,050
It's time to get up Wu Ju Yuan

93
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Cheeky I'll give you an injection

94
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,780
First to wipe a little alcohol cotton

95
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,719
Inject your penicillin

96
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,830
Does it hurt

97
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,780
I'll give you a massage

98
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,870
You lasted a long time today

99
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,750

Don't hit me 1 am really Wu Ju Yuan

102
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,840
It's a typical head trauma

103
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,670
that leads to thickening of the brain membrane

104
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,770
water in the brain

105
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,150
and reduced blood circulation
which will eventually lead to cancer

106
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,040
The pituitary gland is under pressure
and the situation will continue to
worsen until the point of death

107
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,209
Do you remember when you were injured

108
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,760
You probably didn’t realize it at the time

109
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,829
Who let you in here Go and queue

110
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,870

111
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,790
In 1958

113
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,040
and his girlfriend had just split
up with him after he was fired

114
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,949
I didn’t realize you had suffered so much

115
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,910
you should have told me about it earlier

116
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,699
It's all your fault I nearly lost my virginity to you

117
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,010
Didn’t you know Shun Jia

118
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,800

Kiss me

122
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,000
Shun Jia

123
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,970
If you don’t kiss me 1’ll kiss you

124
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,980
Shun Jia

125
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,780
We haven't even mentioned breaking
up and you want to commit suicide

126
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,689
Even now you both want to split up

127
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,280
why

128
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,720

and then I lost a lot of
money on the stock market

132
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,569
No contact for all these years why

133
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,650
I can't live with you any more

134
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,210
I'll go and stay in a hotel

135
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,140
If you have 500 yuan you
can afford to move out

136
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,790
Here you are you can use this

137

Are they all girls

147
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,780
The kicking action should be merciless and fast

148
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,430
I can’t do that

149
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,020
The men are arriving

150
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,970
Il can’t hit a stranger

151
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,490

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,000
OK come on

153
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,150

Ya Ya

158
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,430
I didn’t kick you you just fell over yourself

159
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,430
What's the matter with your
leg What kind of leg is that

160
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,000
Is this really a leg It looks like a piece of ham

161
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,480
You are an adult now

162
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,770
But you don’t have any sense

163
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,060
Isn't someone supposed
to be taking care of you

164
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,040
Who brought them in

165
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,599
Children the earth is a speck of dust

166
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,720
It takes just 8 minutes for light
from the sun to reach the earth

167
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,710
but it is 25,000 light years"

168
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,870
from the sun to the edge of the Milky Way

169
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,350
Does everyone understand

170
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,260
Yes

171
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,300
The earth is just a speck of dust in the universe

172
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,880
We are completely insignificant in the universe

173
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,340
So such a small problem is really nothing

174
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,250
Zhang Jun Hao what are you trying to say

175
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,620
Teacher can I ask how many
years are there in a light-year

176
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,770
Auntie one day in the sky is
equal to one year on the ground

177
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,050
of course one light-year is equal to 365 days

178
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,840
Really So how many years
are there really in a light-year

179
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,089
A light-year is the distance
that light travels in one year

180
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,460
Oh I see

181
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,140
You know so much

182
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,480
I'd like to ask you another question

183
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,900
You told me you are a chef
so why do you hate cooking

184
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,380
You are so sloppy is it also a matter of fashion

185
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,590
Oh me

186
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,350
Hey

187
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,990
overtime again

188
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,900
So what time in the evening is it now

189
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,290
I don't care Wu Ju Yuan

190
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,830
We won't get married if you
don’t get home before 11 o'clock

191
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,290
If can't see you every day I don't
know why I should marry you

192
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,639
Honestly do you really want
to break up with Shun Jia

193
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,780
Leaving a woman because of another woman

194
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,740
It is not breaking up it is called abandoning her

195
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,860
Can I ask you a question too

196
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,919
If

197
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,780
l mean if you two break up what should you do

198
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,510
The universe is so huge It’s the
same for anyone that breaks up

199
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,919
right

200
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Who's there

201
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,190
Why don't you close the door
when you're taking a shower

202
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,240
Come in

203
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,550
I think Shun Jia is very well

204
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,820
What are you two doing closing the door

205
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,830
You won't

206
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,280
You can have a rinse before going out

207
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,740
I’m going to have a body scrub

208
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,879
Ok

209
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,550
Wu Junyuan don't forget
to send an invitation card

210
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,679
I’m going to get married soon

211
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,990
What should I give you

212
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,100
when you get married

213
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,000
Otherwise I’m going to pull out of this deal

214
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,230
The 13 ways to die for love
is a really funny article

215
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,360
But the aim of my article is

216
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,400
To stop lovelorn people
from committing suicide

217
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,110
It's really bad taste

218
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,140
to laugh at others’ lives and feelings

219
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,429
That doesn't make me want
to work in the warehouse

220
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,889
I think you don't appreciate your time

221
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,150
The work of a warehouse
manager is too easy for you

222
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,100
I think it is very appropriate

223
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,420
And as for The 13 ways to die for love

224
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,420
you ought to try each one

225
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,250
Shun Jia

226
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,050
That's really unreasonable

227
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,810
No it’s not Didn't you know that she once tried
to commit suicide because of her ex-boyfriend

228
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,700
Sister

229
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,370
why didn’t you tell me earlier
Please tell me earlier next time

230
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,050
I'm come back

231
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,379
It's really awful for unmarried women

232
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,530
Especially working with an unmarried editor

233
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,439
Ah that’s

234
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,640
Woo

235
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,979
you swear you never cooked

236
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,360
Go ahead I will charge you three
months rent if you don’t cook it well

237
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Bring me red wine hurry up

238
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,649
You won't be told will you

239
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Do you believe I will put you in
order after marriage in 2 days

240
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,110
Please sit down I have something to tell you

241
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,020
What are you two doing you’re
being so tender to each other

242
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,460
Hurry up

243
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,390
Wait a moment let’s warm up first

244
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,980
Come on sing with us let’s warm up

245
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,260
Happy Birthday to you

246
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,600
Happy Birthday to you

247
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,600
Shun Jia let’s break up ok

248
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,360
What

249
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,300
What is he saying

250
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,900
Let's break up ok

251
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,060
We both aren't really suited for marriage

252
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,490
This joke isn’t funny at all

253
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,310
I'll tell you a joke

254
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,550
l brought in my just-finished
article to the office this morning

255
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,240
13 Ways to Die for Love

256
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,850
And gave it to our chief editor to review

257
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,669
Then she said Wang Shun Jia
Wang Shun Jia Wang Shun Jia

258
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,820
You really are low you know

259
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,110
Someone like you is suitable
Suitable to manage a warehouse

260
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
I think she’s really unreasonable

261
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,780
Then Xiao Chi told me Don’t
you know Wang Shun Jia

262
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,500
that our chief editor

263
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,639
was abandoned by her ex-boyfriend
She tried to commit suicide

264
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,469
so she cannot stand to hear
people mention suicide

265
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,950
Jun Hao do you really want to leave

266
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,070
1 do want to leave

267
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,040
Why didn’t you tell me until today

268
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,660
Sorry

269
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,680
Zhang Jun Hao you knew
about it before didn’t you

270
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,120
Go to hell

271
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,740
Shun Jia

272
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,170
Ju Yuan

273
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,280
Ju Yuan Ju Yuan you can't leave

274
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,160
If someone should go and if you must go I will

275
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,170
Please let us tidy up together then

276
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,710
You can't leave now

277
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,020
If 1 don’t leave what am I going to do

278
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,970
Jun Hao

279
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,730
help me to calm her down

280
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,950
How can I help you to calm her down Ju Yuan

281
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,209
The earth is immense

282
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,010
The earth appears to be huge but
compared to the universe it's tiny

283
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,699
The earth is too small in the universe

284
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,129
Looks like a speck of dust

285
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,570
So people are even smaller

286
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,939
Therefore forget your
worrying it won't be missed

287
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,120
Right

288
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,760
Light-year

289
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,470
Light-year

290
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,190
is light light

291
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,189
l

292
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,350
wanna

293
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,750
get

294
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,760
married

295
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,200
Are those you two

296
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,110
Divorced or married if you're
married you sit closer together

297
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,550
Wang Shun Jia are you crazy

298
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,010
Do you think you can get back at me this way

299
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,220
I must be crazy

300
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,820
It's not just because of the
marriage no matter who he is

301
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,639
Wu Ju Yuan let me tell you

302
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,360
I don’t have to have you to get married

303
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,629
Shun Jia

304
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,560
Shall we eat now

305
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,230
Shun Jia are you still using that knife

306
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,210
Who's there What are you
doing Come down now

307
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,879
Quickly

308
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,530
Quickly come down now

309
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,490
You're Zhang Jun Hao

310
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,110
and you’re Wang Shun Jia

311
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,960
didn’t you get married yesterday

312
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,889
Everything is hard at the beginning young man

313
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,480
Take care

314
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,520
You can go now

315
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,449
You’re mad

316
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,899
No you’re mad

317
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,040
l heard there are many definitions of fashion

318
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,050
What does being fashionable mean

319
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,260
Being fashionable is probably an attitude to life

320
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,159
Shun Jia

321
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,740
Shangbie Du the global artistic director is
going to give a lecture Come quickly with me

322
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,590
lam only a warehouse worker
why should I listen to him

323
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,430
No he is a great master and we
should respect him Hurry up hurry up

324
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,410
don't loiter Come on come on

325
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,060
For example if you can distinguish between
the different years of the classic LV styles

326
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,910
you are very fashionable

327
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,080
But if you wear an LV style to participate
in a primary school alumni association

328
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,030
you are not very fashionable

329
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,700
If you can tell the difference

330
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,430
In his mind David Beckham
is Victoria's eldest son

331
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,510
you aren't fashionable

332
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,000
Otherwise if you are going to count the number
of wrinkles for Victoria instead of Backham

333
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,600
you aren't fashionable Can I say it like this OK

334
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,680
I don't know if it is very fashionable

335
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,810
that was abandoned by one man

336
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,520
and then got married to
another within 24 hours

337
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,000
Of course

338
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,480
it is fashionable and it is much more
fashionable than crying for 24 hours

339
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,250
l have been married six times

340
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
and now I’m 60 years old and still single

341
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,720
Maybe a lot of people think
that l am very fashionable

342
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,400
but every time I went through a divorce

343
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,000
My heart felt like it had been taken out

344
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,230
That's so strange

345
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,969
You see I work at the bottom

346
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,520
You have just been abandoned

347
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,300
and then you jump into the fiery pit again

348
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,920
But my heart is tired

349
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,949
But why don't I feel sad

350
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,819
I don't even have the strength to cry

351
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,139
l even want to laugh

352
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,260
Is that fashionable

353
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,209
Let me tell you

354
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,430
you are in the numb phase where you

355
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,089
you don’t realize what has happened

356
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,750
Then it is the anger phase

357
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,170
the feeling of pain increases

358
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,889
and you will enter a suffering phase

359
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,930
also called the plateau phase

360
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,160
a dull stuggling feeling

361
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,770
until death or until rebirth

362
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,950
Sorry

363
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,850
we have gone beyond the scope
of fashion with this conversation

364
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,970
So when you judge everything by
fashion You are not fashionable

365
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,190
Taste it slowly

366
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,480
Cheers

367
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,160
Have a look let's go

368
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,290
This is the new champagne from
the French Pommery wine makers

369
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,910
let's taste it

370
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,990
What do you think

371
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,170
It's quite special

372
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,810
It looks like a wedding veil

373
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,740
What's wrong

374
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,060
What's the matter with you

375
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,720
Are you okay

376
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,390
Ha

377
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,220
Shun Jia what’s wrong with you

378
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,310
Are you playing your strange tricks on us again

379
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,410
No I will not! I’m stuffed

380
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,640
What's up

381
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,180
Why are the rims of your eyes all red

382
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,250
I didn’t think that the champagne
could also move me

383
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,140
and make me cry

384
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,759
I think you are a very sensitive person

385
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,540
you can tell that

386
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,060
this wine is also one of the elements of feelings

387
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,600
Is she your editor

388
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,350
Oh yes

389
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,970
lam going to ask come up with a main
theme for the sequel in next issue

390
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,590
It's going to be about feelings and emotions

391
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,520
Ok

392
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,529
I’m looking forward to reading that article

393
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,830
Are you ok

394
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,070
Shun Jia did you hear that

395
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,070
You have to come up with the main
theme of the article in the next issue

396
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,890
Here’s your big chance

397
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,510
Why do I always manage to
lose face at these occasions

398
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,600
No didn’t the expert just say

399
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,600
that feelings are more important than fashion

400
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,260
Why

401
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,380
What have I got for people to look at

402
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,779
"Your cousin brother or grandmother will
all come to see, do we need to go this far"

403
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,020
Besides we're not being honest are we

404
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,120
Once they've seen us we can get a divorce

405
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,790
Now can you tell me how long they will stay

406
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,040
Just two or three months

407
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,340
Two or three

408
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,890
In fact there is another way

409
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,670
Come on smile! Isn’t she the
woman you love most in the world

410
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,740
That looks great just relax and hold it there

411
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,510
Can you communicate with each other please

412
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,180
Okay you both need to communicate
Communicate by eye contact

413
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,279
Girl look at your husband
Come on smile please

414
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,880
Look over there

415
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,819
Good you look like you’re
longing for a perfect future

416
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,070
Make your fingers into an orchid
shape and point over there

417
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,010
Good beautiful

418
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,740
Can you tilt down the board a little

419
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,609
Prince and Princess try to
make it look like you’re running

420
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,670
Hold hands running swing
your hair up and around

421
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,089
Right follow my gaze come running over

422
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,770
Can you see that bird’s nest

423
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,630
Right you need that type of
“hey” expression in your eyes

424
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,940
Good come on Nice be aware of your eyes

425
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,070
You must have the dynamic feeling of running

426
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,040
Look your running is making me feel hot

427
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,440
Come come over here

428
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,320
The key of this pose is in your eyes

429
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,900
This type of eye expression
usually has two levels of meaning

430
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,689
One is deep hate

431
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,940
and the other is burning love

432
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,800
Get ready

433
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,060
Goodbye Bye bye

434
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,090
Xiao Jiang are you here yet

435
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,310
Boss I’ve already photographed that for you

436
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,770
You've done it again

437
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,580
You can go on sleeping

438
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,250
I’m going to buy some ice-cream

439
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,490
This is tonight’s special relationships program

440
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,790
and our topic tonight

441
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,680
is the 10th anniversary special
issue about Men’s Health

442
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,540
Every man needs to be a tough guy

443
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,990
The new tough guy is not only strong

444
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,290
but also should know about caring

445
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,140
Get up Begin your painful life now

446
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,700
The magazine will stop receiving articles
the day after tomorrow Don’t forget
the special column about newlyweds

447
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,460
En

448
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,820
Please look forward to

449
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,340
NanShang that will wake
up for the desire of love

450
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:53,860
even though it is 3 o’clock in the late night

451
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:08,860
The sensation won't be stopped

452
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:23,860
Everything is settled

453
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:38,860
the peaceful look of a needle going down

454
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:53,860
as if the most sweet tasting

455
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:08,860
is a soft mash

456
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:23,860
and strong beef

457
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:38,860
it breaths quickly

458
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:53,860
The whole city seems like a
bed covered in a silk sheet

459
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:08,860
The top of tongue is hot

460
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:23,860
let me release my sensation

461
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:38,860
The city is under our bodies

462
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:53,860
at this moment Fragrance Hill smells amazing

463
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:08,860
Hou River over the stone bridge

464
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:23,860
The cars in the circle road turn to liquid

465
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:38,860
Driving to the second third and fourth ring road

466
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,830
even though to fifth or sixth ring road

467
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,830
it will travel through my hair

468
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,830
my throat and my ears

469
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,830
but it doesn’t end

470
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,630
Thank you

471
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:07,990
Orgasm

472
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,600
you have a fake marriage don’t you

473
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,770
Other people will hate you
you know that don’t you

474
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,730
More than 70% of women have
not experienced an orgasm

475
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,919
So you need help

476
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,190
Why aren't you a chef anymore
You're good at cooking

477
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,060
Did you try Tom Pizza It's very delicious

478
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,370
My dad was a pastry chef before

479
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,029
and he was best at making
something called Tom Pizza

480
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,270
One day my dad and a young waitress
that worked in their restaurant

481
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,310
was about the same as this one
and he took me to have a ride on
the merry-go-round in the park

482
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,410
l was really happy at the time

483
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,200
When I was playing my
dad suddenly asked me

484
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,400
whether I was willing to let
that waitress be my mother

485
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,529
Later on my dad bought me
enough tickets for me to ride on the
merry-go-round for the whole day

486
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,890
Then gave me back a Tom Pizza

487
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,819
As I grew up I gradually came to understand

488
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,690
about that day with my dad
and that young waitress

489
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:14,960
He ran away

490
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,970
No way that’s terrible

491
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,350
My mum fell in love with my
dad because of Tom Pizza

492
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,070
but I ate the last few pieces of Tom
Pizza that my dad gave to my mum

493
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,029
Many years passed

494
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,170
my mum still couldn't stop
thinking about Tom Pizza so I was
wondering whether I could make it

495
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,200
So I went to work as a cook even though
l hadn’t yet graduated from university

496
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,550
But I didn't work at Tom Pizza

497
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,850
until after my mum had passed away

498
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,450
This is the HaoxiShi

here’s mine

508
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,220
It is true that what a man
writes reflects his personality

509
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,020
“The Sweet Smell of Success”
is the name of our company

510
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,240
It is also one of our core values

511
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,140
l like to have a cultural platform
to convey this cultural concept

512
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,820
It wasn’t until 1 read your articles

513
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,600
that the truth suddenly came to me in a flash

514
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,900
Your work is rich and full of
flavor like a sumptuous feast

515
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,650
it is lively but not too strong
and colorful yet not flashy

516
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,090
It's almost

517
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,980
a state of mind

518
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,940
Can I have a word

519
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,930

Haven't I already explained it to you

600
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,370
I don’t need your explanation

601
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,060
This is all thanks to our fake marriage

602
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,680
l like being cheated on

603
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,200
What you are saying

604
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,050
I think I worry far too much

605
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,730
You enjoyed that didn’t you

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,580
Yes I'm really happy But
its none of your business

607
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,130
It's none of my business

608
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,810
I just want to tell you Wang Shun Jia

609
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,240
as a woman you should
have a bit more self-respect

610
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,090
We just got divorced

611
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,759
I don’t want to get involved in that
monkey business with you again

612
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,900
I should have never spent any
time with you in the first place

613
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,200
My girl

614
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,160
I’m coming

615
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,700
What do you mean

616
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,290
Do you think I’ve changed

617
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,790
Have you put on weight

618
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,330
Beat you

619
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,800
The magazine needs the draft
tomorrow don’t you know

620
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,870
Everyone in the world is waiting for you

621
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,129
Why are they waiting for me I won't do it

622
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,550
I noticed that as soon as Jun Hao left you
not only didn’t show up for a few days

623
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,640
but you also became slack in your work

624
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,170
Have you fallen in love with him

625
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,830
"lL can confirm 1,000% that he likes you"

626
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,270
This is so annoying

627
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,950
Right

628
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,760
Look

629
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:42,950
Did you buy it yourself

630
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,830
No

631
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,150
Du Shang Bie has proposed marriage to me

632
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,800
Really

633
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,150
Of course it’s true

634
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,049
If you offer me dinner so when I am eating

635
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,040
he suddenly showed me a diamond
ring with nine diamonds in it

636
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,940
and told me he had fallen in love with me

637
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,790
So I said ok

638
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,640
but first ! would check to see
whether this diamond ring was real

639
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,250
and then I would confirm whether
or not Il agreed with his proposal

640
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,600
Have you really thought about this He
has already been divorced six times

641
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,270
Do you want to be the seventh one

642
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,890
lam ready

643
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,000
l have even asked my lawyer to
draw up the prenuptial agreement

644
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,920
Once he finds the eighth one
all his assets will belong to me

645
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,490
There are no words in this world I
have no words to say in such a world

646
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,920
Beautiful

647
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,319
You really like it right

648
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,630
You can get Zhang Jun Hao to buy one for you

649
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,850
lam going to get divorced from
Zhang Jun Hao tomorrow afternoon

650
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,320
Ah

651
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,069
Both sides are willing and there
is no dispute over the assets

652
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,690
but why do you want to divorce

653
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,940
What do you two think Have
you thought it over carefully

654
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,780
Don't cry

655
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,490
Both of you if Il stamp this document

656
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,890

657
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:27,850
Don't cry girl

658
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,890

can go home to think about it first

659
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,669
Don't cry don’t cry

You managed to make it

664
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,790
It probably won't taste the same as your dad’s

665
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,910
but I think you'll like it

666
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,000

667
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,620

01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,160
l have forgotten about it

671
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,359
Do you still want to divorce

672
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,790
