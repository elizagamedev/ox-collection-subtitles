00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,482
Free from his pain

2
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,547
Cut his hair

3
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,820
We will go back to KORYO

4
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,806
I will return it to his hometown

00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,702
AD 1375
457 years into the establishment of KORYO

6
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,702
The 31st King,
GONGMIN has been assassinated

7
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,575
by HONG Yoon and CHOI Man-saeng
and replaced by King WOO

8
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,508
In China, it was a time of chaos when
CHU Yu an-chang had founded

9
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,966
the MING Empire in Nanjing

10
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:33,183
forcing the WON Empire
from its century-old

11
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,697
rulership in the great plains of China

12
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:42,678
to the north of the Great Wall

22
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,757
Stop!

23
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,684
They say, the castle is too disordered...

24
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,564
they will lead us to
the temporary reception hall

25
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,527
Here is too large

26
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,252
This place does not look like
a reception hall Let me find out

27
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,496
General, behave honorably

28
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,177
lam General CHOI Jung of Yongho troop,
the protectors of the Koryo's envoys

29
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,054
Where is the MING's officials to greet us?

30
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,393
Remove your weapons and official attires!

31
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,692
KORYO murdered our diplomatic envoy

32
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,353
then keep dispatching spies

33
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,082
Now, you send us a military
in the name of the envoys

34
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,524
You will pay for it!
Tie them up!

35
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,172
Don't panic, and stop moving

36
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,725
Stay back

37
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,070
Throw your weapons away
Anyone to disobey I will slash him!

38
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,127
General CHOI!

39
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,272
General, Don't

40
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,387
My duty is protecting the envoys

41
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,709
General CHOI Jung!

42
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:49,288
Everyone, follow what they said

43
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:43,876
General!

44
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,229
we are almost in the exile

45
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,536
Sorry for my impertinent

46
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,393
It's my fault---

47
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,128
No, it is our destiny for imprisonment

48
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,134
Exile is better than in prison

49
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,797
suffocating prison--- This is better---

50
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,450
but here is

51
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,388
too hot. Ugh!

52
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,071
Hello

53
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,480
We are from KORYO

54
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,776
We were in the middle of exile, by MING

55
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,501
Are you a general from YUAN
the MONGOL imperial?

56
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,054
the great Cokotemure's cavalry!

57
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,491
General, no--- do not step forward this time
Don't be offensive

58
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,990
We don't have any grudge against the KORYO

59
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:45,484
but we cannot keep alive these MING's dogs!

60
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:59,092
Leave the KORYO’'s fate in their own hands.
Let's go!

61
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,870
eneral, including the ambassador and a general Seh,
we have 12 casualties and 23 survivors

62
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,276
among survivors, five are severely injured

63
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,475
Have everyone gather here!

64
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,432
How about preparing to camp out here?

65
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,252
Since the ambassador died
we cannot carry the duty of the envoys anymore

66
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,314
Now, such responsibility
O

67
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,521
If we stay here
the MING troops will come

68
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,498
-We then explain whole story to them---
-You want to keep the exile journey again?

69
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,059
We should not go off our exile path

70
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,175
Let's follow what MING ordered.
Anyway, we are the envoys of the country

71
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:06,722
We don't bring any official letter and flag.
How can we prove our credibility?

72
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,670
Besides, MING troops might blame us
as murderer, instead of Mongols

73
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,817
General, we caught the stangers

74
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,750
Here is two

75
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,632
The duty of the Protector troops end now
Get ready to leave, immediately!

76
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,602
-Get ready to leave, immediately!
-Yes sir!

77
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,258
Here is an endless desert

78
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,884
Where are we going?

79
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,647
To KORYO!

80
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:22,115
General, three are missing
the others are all injured

81
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,692
Find water and food at first

82
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:31,294
Hey, Interpreter!

83
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,289
We must hurry and leave
We all die if we stay here!

84
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:39,589
-Wake up! Hold your mind!
-Let me out, let me out!!

85
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,573
We are leaving

86
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,781
General, we should look for the missing first

87
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:56,055
This trip is too hard for me

88
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,790
l always wanted to be buried at my home

89
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,360
Are you in much pain?

90
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,398
Would you rest here for a while?

91
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,245
No

92
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,918
Even if we make it to Shandong
we still need a boat

93
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,313
It is not about time you worried

94
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,059
Get up

95
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:31,753
What are you doing?

96
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,372
YEESOL

97
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,819
General, please forgive my man

98
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,246
He is a foolish one---
He just wants to care for me

99
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,821
He is a slave of the vice-ambassador

100
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,410
This is the Great Wall connecting to the east

101
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,795
It is where the MING and the YUAN are at battle

102
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,550
Below are villages
where the MING troops are based

103
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,371
Avoid the village and the MING troops

104
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,156
Let's eliminate any chance to meet anyone

105
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,689
General, if we head towards the north
we must confront YUAN's troops

106
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,146
What about here in the middle?

107
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,992
It's impossible It's a desert of death

108
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,605
In the daytime, everything is burned

109
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,217
Also, it takes at least twenty days to cross

110
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,217
Besides, our remaining food and water
will last only 6 days

111
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,496
To that place

112
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,016
we will cross within ten days

113
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,108
If necessary we will eat once a day
and walk during the mid-night

114
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,169
in that case, southern desert is better
we can gain three or four days

115
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:11,863
Whose territory is that?

116
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,016
that is an abandon land
No one could conquer the area

117
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,504
However, my concern is the vice-ambassador

118
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,200
-He is already exhausted
-No one here free from suffer!

119
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,007
From now on, you guide us

120
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,722
Don't block our march

121
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,088
Whoever bothers our way will die by my sword!

122
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,248
Son of bitch!

123
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,052
He makes us human fry. He will kill us

124
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,616
Did you called me?

125
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:41,332
As a vice-ambassador, I'm ashamed
lam in such a wretched state

126
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,715
Take care of the group

127
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,003
I hope you all safely return to home....

128
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:55,624
I see

129
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,395
One thing that I must say

130
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,693
This man here

131
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,434
He is not a slave anymore

132
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:14,908
As I set him free, he is a freeman
Treat him accordingly

133
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,069
Please get some sleep

134
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,197
Hey you, stop there!

135
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,760
He stole the food while standing guard

136
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,963
Sorry, sir

137
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,080
Please forgive me

138
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,423
No mercy to a thief in the battle

139
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,099
The same goes for one who is taken

140
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,228
Beat them twenty floggings each

141
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,540
Our Joojin troops only eat one piece a day
We are equal to your Yongho troops

142
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,589
I will receive the floggings instead of him!

143
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,731
Do what he wants

144
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,164
All right. You, receive all floggings for both

145
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,376
Watch carefully!

146
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,876
You'd served in many battles with my father

147
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,370
Am I quite different to him?

148
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,110
The times were not as difficult as now

149
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,531
But I am sure you will do well, sir

150
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,173
Will we make it safely reach at Shandong?

151
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,878
Even if we return to KORYO, people scoff at--

152
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:45,224
I failed to protect the envoys
I even failed to enter the castle of Nanjing

153
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,379
Here you go

154
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,433
Use when you need it

155
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,372
Take it

156
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,592
In this situation, dying is better

157
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,840
The vice-ambassador disappeared!

158
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,308
Stop him and search what he brings

159
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,976
The vice-ambassador has passed away!

160
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,955
Bury the body
The horse will belong to Yongho troops

161
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:23,145
You may bury him yourself
but we will take the horse

162
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,401
General

163
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,753
Keep follow the line
Stop all!

164
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:42,994
Good afternoon?

165
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,585
Please give us water and food

166
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:57,299
I cannot distinguish who you are

167
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,715
What should I do?
Should I tell them that we are the KORYO's envoys

168
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,660
Don't do that
They don ‘t believe us anyway

169
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,680
If you want to eat
you should pay for it!

170
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,236
-What are they saying, bastard?
-Do something. We're starving

171
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,712
-Tell something---
-Calm down!

172
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,634
I cannot bear!

173
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,216
if you move one more step
then I'll kill you right now

174
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,143
Would you be from KORYO?

175
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,083
Monk, are you also from KORYO?

176
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,967
Sir, serve food to these people
I will pay for it

177
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,752
lam quite obliged
lama general, CHOI Jung

178
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,678
My Buddhist name is Jisan
lam glad to have company on the way home

179
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,605
You, thief. How dare you touch my property?

180
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,930
Uh? You're a Mongolian soldier!

181
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:03,822
Sir

182
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,052
How come you bring a Mongolian sword?

183
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,285
General!

184
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,832
A few days ago, we passed the battlefields

185
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:30,825
There were only the dead there

186
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,894
..Are you a Buddhist monk?
Yes

187
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,248
Do you know how to hold ceremony for the dead?

188
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:47,447
Yes, I learned the Buddhist incantations as well

189
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,766
Would you write down the name of the dead?

190
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,297
All my men were brave warriors

191
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,875
Just write The sons of the blue wolf

192
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,636
Treat the injured first

193
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,838
The General is coming

194
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,199
Have some, Princess

195
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,805
Would you keep refusing food?

196
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,327
Did you hear that he called her princess?

197
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,828
"Escape me"

198
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,120
my friend, what do you wish for?

199
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:54,420
Shit! Who bring this filthy thing in here?

200
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,141
You bring this thing here, didn't you?

201
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,672
Get rid of it, right now

202
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,171
Don't kill him

203
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:11,607
He's a real fighter with spears!

204
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,848
Where are you from?

205
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,188
Don't move. We might lose everything

206
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:32,370
he YUAN troops and the Central Asians
are the confederates. They might kill us all

207
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,042
He has the eyes of a lion

208
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:40,987
I want to make him as my man

209
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,735
General he already killed five of our men

210
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,114
I will give you ten horses in return

211
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:20,954
You've buried this strange place
You met with a wrong place and time. God bless you!

212
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:27,685
If you insist on the difficult path I will joint you

213
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,498
No need for that

214
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,999
lam familiar with these locations
and might be help to you

215
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,558
Now we finished to bury Shall we leave now?

216
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,139
We should wait here

217
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,019
The YUAN troops will pass through this place

218
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,899
we will save the princess!

219
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,954
Don't you say that we are heading towards KORYO sir?

220
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,081
That was my intention until yesterday

221
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,735
However, we are the diplomatic envoys

222
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:05,473
If we help the MING dynasty
we could enter the castle of Nanjing with grand welcome

223
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,382
It won't be late for us to return home after that

224
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,498
a reckless plan!
YUAN troops are the strongest one in the world

225
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,144
Please reconsider General

226
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,019
I made my decision during whole night

227
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:17,168
Let's try

228
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,516
Daejung!

229
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,634
We have to save Yeesol man as well

230
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,181
We will attack them on both sides
The Yongho troops and I will attack from the bottom

231
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,838
You with others ambush them from another side

232
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,981
-Now go
-Shit, no! They are coming right there

233
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,533
We will attack them all together!

234
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,690
General, we don't have any chance to win

235
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,397
We can do it

236
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,229
General

237
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,432
All hide yourselves

238
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:22,073
Daejung!

239
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,006
Now is our chance

240
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,271
Attack the horses first

241
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,026
Save the Princess

242
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:58,642
Interpreter, Interpreter, sir...
Go away get away from me I say

243
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,531
what an idiot

244
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:18,284
lam General CHOI Jung
to protect the KORYO's envoys

245
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,710
Get up

246
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,982
The emperor calls me princess Buyong

247
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,750
You do not look like the envoys

248
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:39,446
I also thought a princess lived in the palace
your highness

249
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,447
Take me to the castle of Nanjing
as soon as possible

250
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,316
If you safely escort me at there
the emperor will award you greatly

251
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:53,057
We did save you, now
we are responsible for you to protect as well

252
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,185
Your highness

253
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:58,654
board the carriage without any worries

254
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,901
It is our total victory, sir

255
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,134
Are you 0k?

256
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,286
hey you!
You said you are an interpreter, aren't you?

257
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:25,432
lam PARK Jumyung
Il haven't entered official post yet

258
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:26,667
-but sooner or later I will enter---
-Deliver my words

259
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,314
to that man in black

260
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:37,158
Hey! The princess wants you
to guard her carriage

261
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,354
Sir, the princess wants
that man to guard the carriage

262
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,645
I will give you a mission

263
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,209
Guard the princess carriage

264
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,148
I will go to see the place
where master is buried

265
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,970
You can talk---
you can talk---

266
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,444
lam ordering you again
guard the carriage

267
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,798
lam a free man now
I will do as I please

268
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,405
General, don't be upset

269
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,377
I don't need a slave who forgot his place

270
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,694
But the vice-ambassador has set him free, sir

271
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,463
He was out of mind on the brink of death

272
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:41,236
Once is a slave will be forever a slave
That is the law of KORYO!

273
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,007
Stop it

274
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:07,957
We will leave this bastard here

275
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,259
Everyone, mount your own horses

276
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:15,895
General, there is one girl who has survived

277
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,331
She is a Chinese slut. Leave her behind

278
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,644
General, mercy is the virtue of the great man

279
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:30,101
This is not any of your concern
All decisions will be mine

280
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,712
Take all with us

281
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:11,377
General

282
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:16,593
General

283
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,131
The general is coming

284
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,487
Honorable Cookoo

285
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,989
I lost the princess of MING

286
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,662
KOROY took her...

287
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,700
Lay him down at my tent

288
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,042
Princess

289
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,039
It may be below you, but please eat this

290
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,251
I didn't have time to say this---

291
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,208
Thank you

292
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,202
Please get some rest, your highness

293
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:31,625
I'm Yooran

294
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,036
Yooran?

295
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,952
meaning of a dancing orchid?

296
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,982
That is the most beautiful name
I've ever heard

297
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,423
lam PARK Jumyung

298
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:45,858
You have cute eyes

299
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:47,894
You wicked one! As a person of the envoys

300
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,638
you don't have any regret in this predicament

301
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,093
play with a woman instead

302
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:56,962
What responsibilities do I carry?

303
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,465
lam just an interpreter

304
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,020
How come you regret at all
These miscellaneous readings are in vain

305
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:04,208
what?

306
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:11,120
you are the one who ruined the country
and accumulated wealth in Buddhist temple---

307
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,430
How dare you mention the Confucius
as miscellaneous readings?

308
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,320
What an egotistic views the Confucius is best

309
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:20,562
Hope for wonderful world is in every teaching

310
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:25,033
The Confucius's words were spread
all over the world

311
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,050
Open your eyes
you should know the principles of the world?

312
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:34,158
The first time I made a love
was under the full moon

313
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,286
She was sixteen, I was eighteen

314
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:41,933
Every evening we met on the hills

315
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,614
Then one day, she became pregnant

316
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,044
and we got married
Five days later, l was gone on an expedition

317
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,361
Was it a son or a daughter?

318
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:57,091
When I left, she was eight months pregnancy
she might give a birth now

319
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:03,916
I miss my wife so much

320
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,990
Is he ok?

321
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,656
Get some sleep. I will take care of him

322
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:24,738
Tomorrow, he can recover, your highness

323
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:29,195
Where are you heading?

324
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,211
To KORYO, your highness

325
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:37,757
The general team and yours seem not
get along well

326
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:45,203
In this kind of long journey
many things might happen

327
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,703
Take good care of him

328
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,415
Thank you, your highness

329
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,647
Do not worry about the vice ambassador

330
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:10,426
He was buried the place open to sunshine

331
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,441
Do you have any family at home?

332
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,528
lam alone

333
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:27,973
From now on, you are not alone

334
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:32,973
We will go together

335
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:34,851
until KORYO

336
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,371
MING'II seek every corner for princess

337
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,598
we must head north

338
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:56,808
Get out, everyone
I have something to talk with Rambulhwa

339
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:07,023
Do me a favor

340
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,092
Please name it

341
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:18,935
MING kidnapped my sister
I want to take revenge on MING's princess

342
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,304
Bring her in front of me

343
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:00,990
Why did you help me?

344
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:04,106
You might have resent the MING Empire for exile

345
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:07,759
Personal concerns and the public affair
That ’s two different issues

346
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,198
If you help us see the emperor

347
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,582
I can resolve the misunderstanding about our envoys

348
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,279
What is the name of that man walking behind?

349
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:23,977
He is a just slave, your highness

350
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,819
l asked his name

351
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,848
They're coming

352
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:46,569
They're after us

353
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:48,134
Where are they now?

354
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:50,015
They're moving really fast, sir

355
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,114
How many are they?

356
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,725
Over a hundred, sir

357
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,190
We don't have much time
We have to leave at once

358
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,636
We cannot avoid them
What can we do, General?

359
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,240
We'll lure them to the carriage

360
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,881
That's good idea, sir

361
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,716
Who will carry this carriage

362
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:15,618
il do

363
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,950
Give me two soldiers of Yongho troop

364
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,238
No, in this time,
drive it by the person who didn't fight

365
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,390
no, no I'm just an interpreter

366
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,896
And I never drove a carriage before

367
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,904
He is too young, sir

368
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:50,375
It has been decided

369
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:52,018
How come it's always us, the Joojin soldiers?

370
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:54,233
Why do you keep quiet, captain?

371
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,535
He even didn ‘t know his baby

372
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,715
Someone has to drive the carriage

373
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,753
Put that boy on the carriage

374
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:06,756
Daejung Captain

375
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:15,379
We'll make them think
the princess is in the carriage

376
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:34,464
Wear it

377
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,904
Please help me

378
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,844
-You can help me, can't you?
-lam sorry

379
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:06,289
Let me go with you

380
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,945
Make a detour on the mountain,
after that’ you can see the Hwangho River

381
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,701
We will wait for you there

382
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:30,722
Please take these, return to the master ’s family

383
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,740
We will meet

384
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,227
Take care of Dansaeng

385
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,120
You go for the princess

386
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:47,569
Never forget your duty is to protect
the princess. It's me

387
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,341
Be sure, you return to me

388
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:26,896
Stop

389
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,559
We will walk from here

390
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:32,447
Put together your horses for
them not to discover us

391
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,268
What if Dansaeng doesn't come back?

392
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:04,081
The Mongolians are not stupid.
They ‘Il come after us sooner or later

393
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,238
I'll be right behind you

394
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,202
The princess isn't in the carriage

395
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,661
There can't be only one soldier guarding her

396
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,827
They are heading for the Hwangho river
to crosse the mountain

397
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:28,691
If so, it's impossible for us to find them

398
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:33,005
They eventually will cross the Hwangho river

399
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:38,655
Burn all village and the ferry beyond the mountain

400
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,503
so make nobody cross the river

401
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:41,871
yes!

402
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:43,093
What about him?

403
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:47,933
follow and kill him

404
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,748
Hurry, lets go

405
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,201
Hurry, lets go

406
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:04,928
It's the Mongolian soldiers

407
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:16,879
Dansaeng

408
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:18,477
Dansaeng

409
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,120
Throw that robe away and run. Now

410
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:23,846
Go, now! Hurry, run

411
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,873
Go! And run

412
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,225
Yeosol

413
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:22,959
Yeosol

414
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:25,832
Yeosol

415
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:31,498
Yeosol

416
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,240
lam so sorry

417
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,250
Get up

418
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:46,409
Il served two years against the north

419
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,110
and two years to fighting the Japanese

420
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,493
Altogether it was four years in the military

421
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:55,622
When I got back
only rat shit was in the kitchen

422
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,803
Shit! So I went to the head officer

423
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,310
and hit him with my head, bang

424
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,365
So did they force you to choose
between imprisonment or military service?

425
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,468
How did you know that?

426
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,740
It is so obvious

427
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,344
Don't go back at all

428
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:17,733
I heard that there is a KORYO village in Beijing

429
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:19,078
I will go back no matter what

430
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,954
My wife is waiting for me

431
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,189
Guess your wife is awfully pretty?

432
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,333
She is like a fat bear

433
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:35,271
Yet, for me, she is the prettiest one in the world
tH] HC}

434
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:39,814
What about you? Don't you miss your wife?

435
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:44,795
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not married, yet

436
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:47,310
I see

437
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:51,964
What happen?

438
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:53,846
As we expected

439
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:56,511
Sir, come

440
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,189
Be patient, even if it may be freezing
That is if you don't want to call the Mongolian troops

441
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:10,619
It was not my intention to wake you up.
l apologize, your highness

442
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:18,689
I had a dream

443
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:20,479
I was already in the Royal Palace

444
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,880
Once we cross the Hwangho river,
we will escort you to the castle of Nanjing

445
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:30,488
Daejung tells me
that this group is heading towards Shandong

446
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:34,836
Believe me. I will keep my word,
your highness

447
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,260
Does the carriage return to us?

448
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:46,703
lam sure it will do, your highness

449
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:20,339
They aren't here, sir

450
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,203
Divide the soldiers into smaller groups
and search them each area

451
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:24,517
What about the people here?

452
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:28,354
We should kill them as they have seen us

453
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,310
Not a single soul is at the ferry

454
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:50,335
check again for sure

455
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,015
Why aren't we going down?

456
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:56,438
first we will move under the valley

457
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:57,867
Ha-il

458
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:00,379
Go round to check and return

459
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,186
What is it?

460
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,908
the enemy are hiding near the ferry

461
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,529
Kill everyone who tries to cross the river

462
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,044
It seems that we have to give up
Dungju as well as Nanjing

463
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:07,783
Who are they, huh?

464
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:11,087
I didn't have any intention

465
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:13,471
to bring them here

466
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:16,391
They just followed me from the ferry

467
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,320
Now, the YUAN troops will find us any moment

468
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,248
We should have kicked them out then

469
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,035
stop

470
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:31,197
Stop it

471
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:33,582
Don't you hear the word, ‘stop’ ?

472
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:46,779
I never thought I would see you here, your highness

473
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,517
I have something
to discuss with both of you

474
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:58,226
Let's cross the river when a night falls

475
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:01,119
Yes-- it is too far to Dungju

476
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:05,872
It would be better to go to Balhae Bay
and find a ferry boat there

477
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,886
Are you saying that we
should cross the sea by a ferry boat?

478
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,350
If you can pass through the YUAN cavalry,
then go by yourself

479
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,721
after crossing the Hwangho river

480
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:19,817
What if does the general insist on escort
the princess to the castle of Nanjing then?

481
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:22,707
Are you crazy? We have to return to KORYO

482
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,819
In fact, the princess brings us all problems

483
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:28,626
Besides, now it seems we have to take
all those people along as well

484
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:31,994
We have a good news

485
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:36,473
Five days later, we'll meet the fortress
on the coast where the MING troops are based

486
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,521
The princess says
if we escort her and her people there

487
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,540
she will arrange for us a boat,
which will take us to KORYO

488
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:44,847
Let us accept her offer

489
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,756
Do we wait for the carriage, don't you?

490
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:52,504
Do you think they will come back alive?

491
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,067
Nobody go back to KORYO without a boat

492
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,902
With the MING troops, we are safe enough

493
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,945
Also, MING's emperor would know
what we help her

494
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,421
The YUAN troops never give the princess up

495
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,953
but it is true that we need a boat

496
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,714
I will follow your opinion, general

497
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:11,237
Good

498
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:12,687
Get up

499
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:13,622
But

500
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,471
we do have to wait
for the people who was in carriage

501
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,663
We all agreed, your highness

502
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,762
If your decision is out of pity,
then return everything back to where it was

503
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,266
It is not the time for pity

504
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:35,264
Prepare to leave

505
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,102
Stay Joojin troops here

506
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:41,449
You will leave when Yeosol and Dansaeng return

507
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,631
You've been in the military long enough to know

508
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:51,321
what the result of disobey
to a general's orders...

509
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:53,455
General
to a general's orders...

510
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,654
we should wait
until this evening passes

511
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:11,577
Dansaeng is coming

512
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,078
You came back alive

513
01:05:18,782 --> 01:05:20,272
You're alright?
are you 0k?

514
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:27,242
I've been waiting for you so much

515
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,517
Welcome to return

516
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,600
It stained with the YUAN troops

517
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:06,825
lam glad you returned alive

518
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,975
I did not wish to award a slave
such an honorable death

519
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,924
The noble tend to have useless thoughts

520
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,395
Shouldn't we arrange a horse
for the princess?

521
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,808
She is not the princess of KORYO

522
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:38,328
The princess wants to ride in a palanquin
It is out of the question

523
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:41,900
Get thick wood, now

524
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:43,525
It is foolish

525
01:06:59,015 --> 01:06:59,444
Daejung

526
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:17,516
Let's carry it

527
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:19,001
Hey, captain

528
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,019
Why should we carry that thing

529
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:22,394
Someone has to carry it

530
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:23,569
Hurry

531
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,013
My soles are as parched as
the back of a turtle

532
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:27,556
We don't have much time

533
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:29,011
shit

534
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:33,909
I'll carry it

535
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:09,076
A the morning mountain at home,
white bird sing a song x

536
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:14,833
i l want to hear the song,
wish to go back home

537
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:18,455
idiot! Remember the YUAN troops
right behind us

538
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:20,012
lam sorry

539
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,241
Your voice is louder than hers, monk

540
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,557
She's just trying to comfort the children
why are you so picky?

541
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,082
Aren't you worried about the children?

542
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,846
If you are that thoughtful,
you wouldn't be playing around with the prostitute

543
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:34,715
if the YUAN troops catch us
those children are the first victims

544
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,501
and you are also the first one who runs off

545
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:39,471
What?

546
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:44,124
What do you know about me?

547
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:45,171
Silly one

548
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:47,992
Look at yourself

549
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:01,951
We've walked all day,
but only come 12 kilometers

550
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:05,649
With this speed
it'll take more than twenty days

551
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,837
Brother, I don't understand at all

552
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:46,459
How can be you still alone with this age?
no one waiting for you at home?

553
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:50,241
I really don't have anyone. Really

554
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,676
Do you have any girl of your heart?

555
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:56,049
HA II, you also miss your wife, don ’t you?

556
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:58,483
He's still a bachelor

557
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,590
How many times I told you?

558
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,473
You haven't sex with a girl, don't you?

559
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,428
why don't you get married until now?

560
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,921
I took the wrong pills when he was young

561
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,804
Yeah, he has still a child's

562
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,869
Would you like to try this?

563
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:22,974
No

564
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,339
Hey, hey---

565
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,509
hey granny
comes back

566
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:44,415
She is an distracted old lady

567
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,706
Since her son was killed at the ferry
No one can take care of her

568
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,468
How can we care about an old one like her?

569
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,600
Bring her here. She is also one of my people

570
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:58,025
Who are you? Let me go

571
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,557
I'll carry her on my back

572
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:13,554
Tens of soldiers are coming to this way, sir

573
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:15,157
Did they find us?

574
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:16,412
lam afraid so

575
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:19,304
Then let's just take the princess

576
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,479
If we take the others along, we'll all die

577
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,982
He's right
We'll just take the princess and Yooran

578
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:26,975
We must keep the promise to the princess

579
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:29,434
We bring all of them along

580
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,143
The YUAN cavalry are faster than the wind

581
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,402
Even a hunter takes care of an animal

582
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:45,294
who lost their way. That's a basic moral---

583
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,856
I will stay with them if you want to leave
without them

584
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:51,663
bastard

585
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:53,948
Don't you miss your mother?

586
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:57,806
my ma will be proud of me

587
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:03,978
Let's go together, as far as we can

588
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,280
What don't you hurry?
The YUAN troops are coming!

589
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:16,825
The princess will start first with the Joojin troops

590
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:17,926
Joojin Troops

591
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:42,814
Order them to carry the palanquin. Now

592
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:44,603
quickly

593
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:49,122
This palanquin is holding us back

594
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:51,954
General

595
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:55,503
Are you waiting for the YUAN troops to get us?

596
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:58,342
They ask you for give up the palanquin

597
01:12:58,875 --> 01:12:59,395
Who said so?

598
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:05,224
Get out

599
01:13:12,288 --> 01:13:13,458
Order them to carry my palanquin at once

600
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:22,768
Stop

601
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:27,464
The princess will be target by the enemy
because of this palanquin

602
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:37,862
The Yongho troops and I will go at them

603
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,098
Wait here

604
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:43,503
You don ‘t have to go to meet them
who are chasing after us

605
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,007
lam the one who makes a decision

606
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:47,782
You just follow my orders

607
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:49,685
Let's go

608
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:37,879
In the forest, the cavalry have less advantage

609
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,394
Let's follow me with same intervals of one meters

610
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:44,561
If you lost the distances, you will be
faced alone on the group of the enemy

611
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:49,331
Are you afraid?

612
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,160
Then, stay here until you hear something.
You can rush out then

613
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:55,956
I will go down instead of you, general

614
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:57,291
Watch the hill

615
01:14:58,194 --> 01:14:59,454
If they pass through here,
the princess will be in great danger

616
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:56,873
On my signal, everyone rush at them

617
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:34,041
Do as I said. You hear?

618
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:38,341
Dansaeng

619
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:40,912
yes

620
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:11,309
is that you?

621
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,570
We'll take care of here
Go and protect the princess

622
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:35,770
Look, the Byuljang is coming

623
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:45,455
It is very important. You should deliver it

624
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:47,681
Please trust my husband

625
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:50,776
Now, go

626
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,123
They are coming

627
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:08,272
Go, hurry

628
01:21:08,464 --> 01:21:11,714
Be careful

629
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,422
Move, princess

630
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,240
There is the princess

631
01:22:57,606 --> 01:22:58,596
Stand back

632
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,321
Stop it! Don't move

633
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,305
Take away your filthy hands, you slave

634
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:41,621
You could have killed me! I'm a princess

635
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:42,910
Stop screaming

636
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,773
Don't think you can do anything
because you are a princess

637
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:53,144
Leave me alone

638
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:06,668
Take this

639
01:24:25,928 --> 01:24:26,418
Byuljang--- Byuljang

640
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:28,049
How's your feeling?

641
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:29,637
What about the Yongho troops?

642
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:37,598
Help me up

643
01:24:41,143 --> 01:24:42,373
What happened to the enemy?

644
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,825
Daejung wiped out them with
the Joojin troops, sir

645
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:53,171
What about the princess?

646
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:54,905
She is coming this way, sir

647
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:58,972
We will resume the journey
We are leaving

648
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:01,792
It is quite late

649
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,374
and you must take rest a bit more, sir

650
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,121
it's better leaving early in the morning, sir

651
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:12,768
I said get up

652
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,300
If you wish to leave, go yourself, sir

653
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:18,282
We will get some rest and then leave

654
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,668
I know that you are the agitator

655
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,237
until now, I let you have your own way

656
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,970
but now I will not tolerate you

657
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:46,529
- Leave him alone
- Dochoong, Seat down...

658
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:51,915
General, please remove your sword

659
01:25:52,848 --> 01:25:53,698
How dare you

660
01:26:04,126 --> 01:26:07,166
Byuljang, arrest these men at once

661
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:11,793
Now

662
01:26:16,438 --> 01:26:17,228
Look here

663
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,463
How about having captain Daejung
as our leader from now on?

664
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,576
That's only way to reach the castle
won't we?

665
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:24,609
Dochoong

666
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:31,089
General...

667
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,349
Pass your authority to Daejung

668
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,019
Do you think you came here by yourself?

669
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,835
under this hard situation

670
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,669
Someone had to make tough decisions

671
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:14,952
Do you know that?

672
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,360
I made these decisions on
behalf of the group

673
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:50,074
From now on, whoever bothers my way
I will cut your throat under the name of the king

674
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:55,880
General, you are still in recovering---

675
01:27:58,073 --> 01:27:59,883
Don't You are the one who I want to kill most

676
01:28:01,176 --> 01:28:01,996
It's you

677
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,229
Why don’t you anyone detain the general?

678
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:25,503
General, come back

679
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:42,264
You may lead these poor people,
but that doesn't change our situation

680
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:46,972
Do you think these all happening
caused because of him?

681
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:52,720
lam not bright enough to know the future

682
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,459
You should have hold onto the general

683
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,900
The only thing I desire most
is for us all to go home

684
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,250
We must leave this place

685
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,810
Your highness, did you have a nightmare?

686
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:30,846
The clay fortress is not too far away
We should prepare to leave

687
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,737
But your highness, everyone is asleep

688
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:52,982
Don't worry too much

689
01:29:55,657 --> 01:29:57,177
He couldn't have gone too far

690
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:01,267
Even if he desired to come back
he is a person who would never do so

691
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:21,214
This is Princess BuYong

692
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:23,539
chased by YUAN,
lam heading to the clay fortress

693
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:24,905
Send the soldiers there immediately

694
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:25,790
Wehae!

695
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,793
We will go around the forest

696
01:30:34,296 --> 01:30:35,226
We cannot sir

697
01:30:35,463 --> 01:30:37,652
If we don't chase them now
we will lose them in the woods

698
01:30:38,066 --> 01:30:39,736
Their destination is
where the forest ends

699
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:45,128
I vowed never to return
without capturing the princess

700
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:49,134
we've all prepared to death
when we've started the battle

701
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,040
The Mongolian are not afraid of the death

702
01:30:55,450 --> 01:31:00,900
Not afraid of the death

703
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:18,093
Be careful, you carry with a baby

704
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:19,923
Thank you

705
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:21,762
Your welcome

706
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:24,709
Daejung

707
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:37,961
How are the wounds?

708
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:40,156
the poison in his body is almost neutralized

709
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:45,862
-Why aren't you helping the general up?
- It is not necessary! I can get up by myself

710
01:31:47,769 --> 01:31:49,199
General, get up

711
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,406
Do not call me a general anymore

712
01:31:56,378 --> 01:31:58,958
Whatever you may say,
you are still a general

713
01:32:00,782 --> 01:32:02,652
You led the group very well.
Please go with us

714
01:32:06,321 --> 01:32:07,141
Go with me

715
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:14,523
A welll

716
01:33:56,064 --> 01:33:57,964
Where are all the boats?

717
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:59,680
What about the MING troops?

718
01:33:59,901 --> 01:34:02,861
Where is the princess? We came all the way
because of that bitch ’s words. Now what?

719
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:04,988
It's not the princess fault

720
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:06,983
Then whose fault is it?

721
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:10,652
Was it you?

722
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:13,432
Stop it
Who could know this kind happening?

723
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:16,798
The YUAN troops will come soon
Decide whether we will leave or stay

724
01:34:21,723 --> 01:34:22,452
Let's leave this place

725
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:38,936
Close the gates

726
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:46,215
Go get a bar

727
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:51,431
Hurry

728
01:34:54,923 --> 01:34:56,652
Call a man who can speak KORYO

729
01:35:12,574 --> 01:35:16,884
Listen! For years, KORYO has been
the vassal of the Great WON Empire

730
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:21,939
If you hand over the princess,
we will let you all live

731
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:25,724
Daejung, we are out matched

732
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:28,814
The princess is

733
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:30,654
none of our business any more

734
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:39,403
What they want is me

735
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,300
You have escorted me here,
$0 you kept your promise

736
01:35:44,372 --> 01:35:46,042
You don't need to sacrifice
people anymore for me

737
01:35:47,175 --> 01:35:48,785
If you refuse to hand her over,

738
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:50,753
we will destroy you all

739
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,090
Daejung, you must decide

740
01:35:57,252 --> 01:35:58,102
Help us

741
01:36:03,324 --> 01:36:04,494
Uh? The gates are opening

742
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,240
the great fighter is still alive

743
01:36:30,385 --> 01:36:32,725
He ruins everything

744
01:36:54,242 --> 01:36:57,232
Those who wish to leave may do so
Those who wish to stay, may stay

745
01:37:10,358 --> 01:37:12,908
Honey, honey

746
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:29,378
Pitch the tents. We will prepare the battle

747
01:37:33,448 --> 01:37:35,378
father

748
01:37:47,328 --> 01:37:48,788
What the hell are you doing?

749
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:29,804
Daejung, Daejung I found the bamboos

750
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:36,733
Hey, Go away Go away

751
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:43,576
You look still pale

752
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:46,919
I'm alright ! wanna help you

753
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:49,072
Water! Water comes!

754
01:38:49,323 --> 01:38:53,073
Here is water Come here

755
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:56,448
water comes

756
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:58,931
so happy

757
01:39:11,312 --> 01:39:13,652
Their attacking skills are speedy and quick

758
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:18,392
First, they will attack the gate
Then will be surround it and climb up

759
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:22,394
It is a very difficult situation

760
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:29,407
General, please lead us

761
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:35,181
I don't want to become a fool again

762
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:38,733
Everybody knows, the KORYO troops are
outstanding the protecting skills for the castle

763
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:42,237
But it is because they had excellent leaders

764
01:39:46,714 --> 01:39:47,704
General!

765
01:39:56,891 --> 01:39:58,031
I will fight by myself

766
01:39:59,794 --> 01:40:01,284
I was the one who made us head to KORYO

767
01:40:02,263 --> 01:40:03,992
and save the princess
I started everything

768
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:07,699
Whether we go home or
fight for a name

769
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:09,362
this is the time for all of us to unite

770
01:40:11,572 --> 01:40:12,652
It is none of your business

771
01:40:14,876 --> 01:40:15,896
This is my war

772
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:26,651
Distribute liquor to the soldiers and
let them sleep until the sun is fully up

773
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:30,212
We have to capture the princess
and return to the base as soon as possible

774
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:33,924
For the past three months,
we haven't been rest for a single day

775
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:37,246
We need to attack them as quickly as we can!
What if the MING troops come...

776
01:40:37,832 --> 01:40:41,082
Here is only two They and us

777
01:40:43,271 --> 01:40:45,880
How many one can be alive among us?

778
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:49,579
stay with me

779
01:40:51,579 --> 01:40:55,039
Wow! Thank you brother

780
01:40:55,683 --> 01:40:58,373
it is relatively safe at the coast and sides
of the castle Let's protect the front

781
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:01,724
Monk, take care of the princess
and the elderly people

782
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:03,817
The Interpreter and I will
take care the central gate

783
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:05,728
you and Dochoong in the east

784
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:09,200
- Yeosol and HA-II will protect in the west....
- Dochoong and I will cover the east

785
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,410
what about me, sir?

786
01:41:15,937 --> 01:41:17,077
Dansaeng has something to do

787
01:41:18,873 --> 01:41:21,062
Never come out, never! You hear?

788
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:26,632
Stay there

789
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:28,821
You'll be in big trouble
if you make one move

790
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,650
if you come out---

791
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:33,590
Pul

792
01:41:39,827 --> 01:41:41,437
Wow, you've made the spares a lot

793
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:45,174
Huh? They start to move...

794
01:42:23,104 --> 01:42:25,624
Dochoong, don't shoot your arrows
without my signal

795
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:28,895
Wait until they come closer

796
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:43,993
Shoot!!

797
01:42:56,637 --> 01:42:59,536
The YUAN troops are coming

798
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:07,607
Sit down

799
01:43:52,093 --> 01:43:53,492
Cut the ropes

800
01:44:01,836 --> 01:44:03,296
Attack

801
01:44:15,149 --> 01:44:18,609
Don't retreat! Keep your place

802
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:24,810
Bring all the shields
Break the fortress gate Go!

803
01:44:41,642 --> 01:44:43,371
Daejung, Hurry up

804
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:01,792
General, the messenger has arrived

805
01:45:44,638 --> 01:45:46,038
Stop the attacking

806
01:46:24,645 --> 01:46:26,575
We received orders to withdraw. Shit

807
01:46:27,281 --> 01:46:29,061
We almost win What the hell---

808
01:46:36,757 --> 01:46:38,456
Kill them all

809
01:46:38,926 --> 01:46:43,556
Saori... Saori

810
01:47:17,998 --> 01:47:21,277
Look over there
A white flag at the YUAN's side

811
01:47:24,004 --> 01:47:25,554
It is to mourn the death of someone
in high position

812
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,824
If they attack once again

813
01:47:30,644 --> 01:47:31,984
It will be difficult for us to beat them

814
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:37,272
General!
why did you order us to withdraw?

815
01:47:38,085 --> 01:47:39,345
Dig deep wells in the middle of the hill

816
01:47:40,154 --> 01:47:41,464
We almost win...

817
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,857
Cookoo has passed away

818
01:47:47,494 --> 01:47:49,044
at right after we left headquarters

819
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:55,806
Held memorial ceremony, first
Then, we will resume our attack

820
01:48:07,014 --> 01:48:08,534
Why did you leave your place!

821
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:11,715
Because of you,
So many people died

822
01:48:36,477 --> 01:48:39,407
Stop chanting that
It is making people angrier

823
01:48:49,156 --> 01:48:53,316
Stop crying
Anyway, we've beaten the enemy

824
01:48:58,632 --> 01:48:59,942
Your family is like the loyalist
to the MING Empire

825
01:49:00,601 --> 01:49:01,420
The Emperor will award you greatly

826
01:49:03,103 --> 01:49:03,863
Award? Hey, who made us

827
01:49:04,138 --> 01:49:07,648
come all the way over here?

828
01:49:08,575 --> 01:49:11,065
First killed my husband
and now it is my daughter---

829
01:49:11,512 --> 01:49:14,382
How dare you speak like
so to the princess

830
01:49:14,915 --> 01:49:17,255
You go! Then, we're all safe

831
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:20,998
Because of you, we all die like dogs

832
01:49:54,054 --> 01:49:54,954
Byuljang!

833
01:50:04,098 --> 01:50:05,618
What the hell are they doing?

834
01:50:11,972 --> 01:50:13,371
The water channel is blocked

835
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:18,230
Everything will be over by tomorrow

836
01:50:32,426 --> 01:50:35,856
Cookoo started a losing war

837
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:39,193
The dreams of the great Ghengis Khan

838
01:50:40,734 --> 01:50:44,134
may fade away forever

839
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:49,572
Don't say. Your words have

840
01:50:50,043 --> 01:50:52,093
great influences on the fighting sprits

841
01:50:55,549 --> 01:50:56,809
Let's return to the prairies

842
01:50:57,918 --> 01:50:59,147
You mean we should just leave like this?

843
01:51:01,722 --> 01:51:02,742
We are taking the princess with us

844
01:51:07,628 --> 01:51:09,088
The children are waiting for you

845
01:51:11,398 --> 01:51:12,828
Why did they find me?

846
01:51:14,201 --> 01:51:16,041
I have no business with them, right?

847
01:51:27,114 --> 01:51:29,254
It is not your fault to avoid a battle

848
01:51:30,951 --> 01:51:31,651
You told me

849
01:51:33,187 --> 01:51:35,907
that I was irresponsible, didn't you?

850
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:39,482
You were right

851
01:51:41,628 --> 01:51:45,438
lam-- mean and coward

852
01:51:48,135 --> 01:51:51,235
In this situation, it is more difficult
for one not to fight than to fight

853
01:51:53,407 --> 01:51:56,657
If you disagree a useless cruelty,
keep the conviction

854
01:51:58,412 --> 01:52:00,312
I think that is courage too?

855
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:03,282
At one time

856
01:52:04,952 --> 01:52:07,262
Il was a student of Confucianism,
dreaming of the righteous world

857
01:52:09,756 --> 01:52:11,946
But for a countryman like me

858
01:52:13,327 --> 01:52:15,817
I was not even given the chance to
apply for a position of government official

859
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:19,211
That is why I joint this journey

860
01:52:21,201 --> 01:52:23,981
which no one else want to go

861
01:52:24,504 --> 01:52:27,084
I wanted to create an opportunity...

862
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:34,175
l always end up with bad luck...why?

863
01:52:39,553 --> 01:52:40,782
Pray for a hundred days to Buddha

864
01:52:42,155 --> 01:52:43,884
He will help you

865
01:52:47,194 --> 01:52:48,744
Does it really work?

866
01:52:51,031 --> 01:52:52,491
Aren't you going to the children?

867
01:52:54,401 --> 01:52:55,691
She is giving birth!

868
01:53:01,174 --> 01:53:03,224
We need hot water--
What shall we do?

869
01:53:04,544 --> 01:53:06,244
We don't even have drinking water

870
01:53:06,647 --> 01:53:07,847
What the hell you guys all doing here

871
01:53:08,815 --> 01:53:10,775
Get out, get out

872
01:53:27,267 --> 01:53:28,057
Isn't that Dansaeng?
Where is he going?

873
01:53:28,268 --> 01:53:29,848
That son of bitch
He is out of mind

874
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:31,130
Dansaeng!

875
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:32,401
Call the people

876
01:53:32,839 --> 01:53:34,099
I'll go and get him

877
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,208
What can we do?

878
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:55,497
shit, be careful

879
01:53:58,265 --> 01:54:01,635
Here is thieves

880
01:54:04,237 --> 01:54:06,487
General,
two men stole water from our well

881
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:44,590
What about Dansaeng?
Where is he?

882
01:54:45,645 --> 01:54:46,845
Uh? He were right behind

883
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:49,765
Where is he? Uh, over there

884
01:54:50,417 --> 01:54:51,557
Dansaeng!

885
01:54:54,087 --> 01:54:54,907
Dansaeng stnad up

886
01:54:55,188 --> 01:54:56,038
Give me that

887
01:54:56,356 --> 01:54:57,116
Dochoong

888
01:54:58,825 --> 01:54:59,695

889
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:04,493
-Dansaeng

01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:11,452

Climb up! Climb up

894
01:55:21,615 --> 01:55:22,635
Dansaeng

01:55:23,850 --> 01:55:25,140
Hurry up

896
01:55:25,485 --> 01:55:26,184
Wait

897
01:55:27,954 --> 01:55:29,824
what the hell he's doing?

898
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:33,295
Dansaeng, come back

899
01:55:33,693 --> 01:55:34,653
Come on. Hurry up

900
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,160
Get this one first

901
01:55:49,876 --> 01:55:51,106
Hurry up

902
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:56,379
pretty clever
Do you want to try?

903
01:56:08,728 --> 01:56:10,158
Dansaeng. That's alright
Give me your hand

904
01:56:19,272 --> 01:56:21,292
No+>

905
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:44,320
Dansaeng

906
01:57:27,407 --> 01:57:30,777
Shit Stop crying

907
01:57:31,778 --> 01:57:32,888
Let him cry

908
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:46,637
How dare you come here, huh?

909
01:57:47,661 --> 01:57:50,271
You want to kill all, huh?

910
01:57:50,764 --> 01:57:51,084
Dochoong!

911
01:57:51,231 --> 01:57:54,481
Then, give me back my eye!
Give me

912
01:57:55,035 --> 01:57:55,415
Dochoong

913
01:57:55,936 --> 01:57:57,545
You told us you would give us a boat,
didn't you?

914
01:57:57,971 --> 01:58:00,080
What is the princess of the MING Empire?
You even can give us a small boat?

915
01:58:00,507 --> 01:58:02,727
Because of your words
we come all the way over here

916
01:58:03,176 --> 01:58:05,636
where's the boat? The boat!

917
01:58:09,049 --> 01:58:13,119
What did you hit me? why? Why me?

918
01:58:13,954 --> 01:58:15,474
How come you hit me?

919
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:18,795
Then, hit me. Hit me more!

920
01:58:19,526 --> 01:58:20,726
Don't blame the princess

921
01:58:22,562 --> 01:58:23,852
Everything was my decision

922
01:58:24,531 --> 01:58:25,821
The general will take responsibility?

923
01:58:28,335 --> 01:58:30,085
How do you take responsibility for
the situation like this?

924
01:58:30,437 --> 01:58:32,957
We just have to send the princess out
alone Why can't we do so?

925
01:58:33,406 --> 01:58:34,016
Why?

926
01:58:34,207 --> 01:58:36,897
Why don't you sent her out?

927
01:58:37,344 --> 01:58:37,634
That's enough...

928
01:58:37,744 --> 01:58:39,114
Let me go, you son-of-a-bitch

929
01:58:46,052 --> 01:58:48,422
Someone has to tell the
princess about this

930
01:58:49,022 --> 01:58:49,982
Just shut up

931
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:53,750
Daejung! Don't stop them
It's better them to say what's on their minds

932
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:57,521
General, what are they talking about?

933
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,680
You are all cowards

934
01:59:04,671 --> 01:59:06,281
Then, let's just cut the princess head off

935
01:59:08,408 --> 01:59:09,278
You keep out of this

936
01:59:09,876 --> 01:59:12,046
If we hang her head outside the fortress
wall, they might turn back

937
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:14,041
If you all wish, I'll do that

938
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,209
interpreter, what's Yeesol saying?

939
01:59:28,428 --> 01:59:31,117
Tell me! I order

940
01:59:32,298 --> 01:59:35,398
That you should be sent to the enemy

941
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:36,682
Shuts your mouth

942
01:59:37,537 --> 01:59:39,677
Then, do you want me to tell her
that he offered to cut her head off?

943
01:59:59,092 --> 02:00:01,432
Do you know that your words
make her hurt a lot?

944
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:05,399
I came all the way here for only her

945
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:09,433
Never wish for something
you can never get

946
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:12,040
Don't forget you are a slave

947
02:00:14,674 --> 02:00:16,344
Have you ever heard of the slave,
Manjuk?

948
02:00:18,178 --> 02:00:19,758
He said, People are all the equal

949
02:00:20,413 --> 02:00:22,373
Is there any special blood for
king or others?

950
02:00:22,949 --> 02:00:24,818
After saying those words, he were hanged

951
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:29,870
Whoever aims at my neck
will be cut off his arm first

952
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:38,219
My sword carries no mercy

953
02:00:41,735 --> 02:00:42,495
Do you want to match?

954
02:01:22,842 --> 02:01:26,062
Too many have died so far, too many--

955
02:01:28,214 --> 02:01:29,824
Now you want us to kill each other?

956
02:01:55,809 --> 02:01:59,409
whatever happens do me
Don't help me

957
02:02:18,731 --> 02:02:20,981
It's a boy!

958
02:02:40,787 --> 02:02:43,127
the princess
Bless the child

959
02:02:43,723 --> 02:02:47,473
for luck and health

960
02:02:54,901 --> 02:02:56,361
What are you doing here?

961
02:02:56,769 --> 02:02:57,729
Are you planning to freeze him?

962
02:02:57,937 --> 02:02:59,987
She's always take care of herself,
she doesn't deserve to do that

963
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,400
Hurry and take the child inside

964
02:03:02,775 --> 02:03:04,504
Before he catches cold

965
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:14,348
Your highness

966
02:03:16,189 --> 02:03:17,419
Your highness

967
02:03:17,857 --> 02:03:18,587
forgive me

968
02:03:21,628 --> 02:03:22,388
Bring me a horse

969
02:03:26,032 --> 02:03:26,732
lam leaving this fortress

970
02:03:42,115 --> 02:03:46,535
Stop this, your highness
You are the reason we fight for up to now

971
02:03:47,854 --> 02:03:50,664
As you all watch, everybody hope me
to leave this place as soon as possible

972
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:55,991
As a princess of the Great MING Empire
I will end this war with my own hands

973
02:03:57,030 --> 02:04:00,429
Your highness,
please don't go Please

974
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,260
Do you want me to take
my own life right here?

975
02:04:04,771 --> 02:04:06,201
No one may step forward

976
02:04:06,873 --> 02:04:07,923
I will go by myself

977
02:04:11,177 --> 02:04:12,227
General...

978
02:04:13,413 --> 02:04:14,022
Get out of my way

979
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:23,350
The KORYOs wont give up you,
your highness

980
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:25,410
Please trust me!

981
02:04:27,727 --> 02:04:28,867
How dare you block me?

982
02:05:36,095 --> 02:05:38,345
Wait for her
they are coming towards us

983
02:05:53,746 --> 02:05:54,676
You can't go

984
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:26,030
Will you watch guard
outside the fortress?

985
02:09:34,333 --> 02:09:35,003
Kill him!

986
02:09:35,167 --> 02:09:35,897
Wait

987
02:09:49,515 --> 02:09:51,065
Let him pick up the sword

988
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:19,290
What happened others?

989
02:10:22,948 --> 02:10:23,618
What about Yeesol?

990
02:10:35,895 --> 02:10:37,235
Just stay where you are

991
02:10:42,468 --> 02:10:44,718
Daejung, Daejung

992
02:10:48,341 --> 02:10:50,011
You can't move sir, not now

993
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:52,911
can't move

994
02:11:55,207 --> 02:11:56,407
The royal castle was too
suffocating for me

995
02:11:58,110 --> 02:12:00,070
I thought that if I left there
I would be free

996
02:12:02,515 --> 02:12:04,035
This is all my fault

997
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:08,980
I'm so scared

998
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:16,190
I don't think I can bear it any longer

999
02:12:19,398 --> 02:12:20,738
So do I lam also a coward

1000
02:12:23,436 --> 02:12:24,986
I was always afraid

1001
02:12:28,607 --> 02:12:29,897
that people would notice that

1002
02:12:33,979 --> 02:12:35,819
I do not deserve being called general

1003
02:12:42,855 --> 02:12:43,934
Everyone come here

1004
02:12:57,002 --> 02:12:58,082
He may die

1005
02:13:01,574 --> 02:13:02,534
He moves...

1006
02:13:08,848 --> 02:13:11,428
His life is long enough...

1007
02:13:18,257 --> 02:13:20,567
General,
what is the meaning of this?

1008
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:24,380
When they open the gate doors
to rescue him, we'll easily enter the fortress

1009
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:28,850
If they decide not to come out for him
then I will be able to acquire a great warrior

1010
02:13:42,982 --> 02:13:44,682
Is there anyone who save him?

1011
02:13:49,755 --> 02:13:52,035
-I'll go down to get him
-General

1012
02:13:52,825 --> 02:13:54,695
if we open the door now
we'll all die

1013
02:13:55,127 --> 02:13:56,327
It's the enemy's trap

1014
02:13:57,429 --> 02:13:58,799
Then you're saying
we just stand back and watch?

1015
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:22,650
That's better idea!

1016
02:14:23,155 --> 02:14:24,585
Let's just kill him with our own hands

1017
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:25,894
Should I throw the torch?

1018
02:14:29,161 --> 02:14:30,031
The moonlight is bright...

1019
02:14:35,501 --> 02:14:36,201
Daejung... Daejung

1020
02:14:47,746 --> 02:14:48,596
Don't shoot

1021
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:53,280
You like him too don't you?

1022
02:15:10,536 --> 02:15:11,146
Daejung

1023
02:15:18,043 --> 02:15:19,853
Do you still consider me general?

1024
02:15:26,518 --> 02:15:28,268
I want to lead the battle at tomorrow

1025
02:15:37,963 --> 02:15:40,103
Until now
we have gone through so much

1026
02:15:42,368 --> 02:15:44,068
It is a miracle
that we've made it so far

1027
02:15:46,271 --> 02:15:47,291
However

1028
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:49,890
according to the Chinese proverb

1029
02:15:51,477 --> 02:15:54,057
if we attempt to live, we die,
and if we attempt to die, we live

1030
02:15:55,681 --> 02:15:57,141
Let us trust each other, and unite

1031
02:15:59,184 --> 02:16:01,204
Even if we all die---

1032
02:16:16,468 --> 02:16:18,638
Tomorrow they will break
the gate and enter

1033
02:16:19,638 --> 02:16:22,248
If they come in
we will use these bomb!!

1034
02:16:23,942 --> 02:16:25,252
Be careful

1035
02:16:25,911 --> 02:16:26,491
Come here...

1036
02:16:48,666 --> 02:16:51,626
All stand up

1037
02:17:05,183 --> 02:17:06,933
Tomorrow,
we will protect you, your highness

1038
02:17:32,111 --> 02:17:33,921
Do you wish to become
a general of the Great YUAN Empire?

1039
02:17:36,348 --> 02:17:40,038
lam a free man Kill me

1040
02:17:43,888 --> 02:17:47,198
They never took your
existence seriously

1041
02:17:55,166 --> 02:17:58,707
In order to rebuild the Great YUAN Empire
we need courageous warriors like you

1042
02:18:10,182 --> 02:18:27,892
A the morning mountain at home,
white bird sing a song x

1043
02:18:30,502 --> 02:18:36,982
i l want to hear the song,
wish to go back home

1044
02:18:37,976 --> 02:18:46,296
i l want to hear the song,
wish to go back home

1045
02:18:58,230 --> 02:19:02,510
Sir, you resemble my father
who had passed away

1046
02:19:04,937 --> 02:19:08,947
The KORYOs and the HAN's look
very much alike We're like brothers

1047
02:19:09,575 --> 02:19:11,885
We're like brothers

1048
02:19:35,066 --> 02:19:36,026
We have dragged on this too long

1049
02:19:38,437 --> 02:19:39,257
everyone will die

1050
02:19:41,639 --> 02:19:45,420
Before sunset comes
we return to the prairie

1051
02:20:29,321 --> 02:20:30,111
No, no, wait a minute

1052
02:20:30,856 --> 02:20:32,586
Fire, fire, fire! They use fire first

1053
02:20:43,135 --> 02:20:44,335
Don't move

1054
02:20:54,813 --> 02:20:55,713
Everyone run for cover

1055
02:21:11,463 --> 02:21:12,393
General

1056
02:21:13,432 --> 02:21:14,572
we've failed

1057
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:19,510
Daejung....

1058
02:21:30,882 --> 02:21:32,492
I always want to have an
honorable death

1059
02:21:37,789 --> 02:21:39,659
That's my dream

1060
02:23:02,474 --> 02:23:03,904
Jaosinwe! Jaosinwe!

1061
02:23:50,622 --> 02:23:52,872
We must go out and fight together!

1062
02:26:24,442 --> 02:26:26,081
Dochoong!!

1063
02:26:30,882 --> 02:26:32,312
Dochoong!!

1064
02:28:07,879 --> 02:28:10,279
Protect the princess
Go out this fortress with her

1065
02:28:44,883 --> 02:28:49,193
So many warriors have died
because of you!

1066
02:29:30,028 --> 02:29:32,248
Yesol...

1067
02:30:52,277 --> 02:30:55,557
My son

1068
02:32:24,502 --> 02:32:25,402
It's too dangerous

1069
02:32:27,271 --> 02:32:29,201
You cannot cross the sea with that boat

1070
02:32:31,242 --> 02:32:33,582
I must go

1071
02:33:47,885 --> 02:34:00,405
Only those who have a long journey
will see the long roads to go home
