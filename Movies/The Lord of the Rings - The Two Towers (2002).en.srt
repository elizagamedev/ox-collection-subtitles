1
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,355
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!

2
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:28,374
! ama servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,394
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,974
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udiin!

5
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:52,258
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,433
No! No!

7
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,572
Gandalf!

8
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,938
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,427
No!

10
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,434
Gandalf!

11
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,971
Gandalf!

12
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,158
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,888
Nothing.

14
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,217
Just a dream.

15
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,279
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

16
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,930
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

17
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,490
It's just where we can't get.

18
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,786
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

19
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,908
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

20
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,782
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

21
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,310
...but they did.

22
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,405
Mr. Frodo?

23
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,736
It's the Ring, isn't it?

24
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,179
It's getting heavier.

25
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,489
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.

26
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,371
Oh, yes. Lovely.

27
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,226
Lembas bread. And look!

28
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,991
More lembas bread.

29
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,778
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

30
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,827
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

31
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:57,123
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

32
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,349
Those rain clouds might.

33
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,442
This looks strangely familiar.

34
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,569
It's because we've been here before.

35
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,301
We're going in circles.

36
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,995
What is that horrid stink?

37
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,320
warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

38
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,459
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.

39
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,690
l can smell it.

40
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,375
We're not alone.

41
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,891
The thieves. The thieves.

42
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,035
The filthy little thieves.

43
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,092
Where is it?

44
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,899
Where is it?

45
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,739
They stole it from us.

46
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,993
My precious.

47
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,278
Curse them, we hates them!

48
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,444
It's ours, itis, and we wants it!

49
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,517
This is Sting.

50
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,279
You've seen it before...

51
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,844
... haven't you, Gollum?

52
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,284
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

53
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,347
It burns!

54
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,755
It burns us!

55
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,769
It freezes!

56
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,732
Nasty Elves twisted it.

57
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,518
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!

58
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,001
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

59
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,968
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!

60
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,628
That would kill us! Kill us!

61
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,598
It's no more than you deserve!

62
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,409
Maybe he does deserve to die.

63
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,091
But now that I see him, ! do pity him.

64
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:42,286
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

65
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,545
Take it off us.

66
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:52,448
We swears to do what you wants.

67
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,793
We swears.

68
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,468
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

69
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,983
We swears...

70
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,594
...to serve the master
of the precious.

71
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,891
We will swear on...

72
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,074
...on the precious.

73
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,410
Gollum. Gollum.

74
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:19,479
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

75
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,990
Yes...

76
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,912
...on the precious.

77
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,734
On the precious.

78
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,507
I don't believe you!

79
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,771
-Get down! ! said, down!
-Sam!

80
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,898
He's trying to trick us.

81
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,966
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

82
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,767
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.

83
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,715
You've been there before?

84
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,331
Yes.

85
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,752
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

86
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,264
Merry!

87
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,713
Merry!

88
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,520
What is it? What do you smell?

89
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,333
Man-flesh.

90
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,301
Aragorn.

91
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,325
They've picked up our trail.

92
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,394
Let's move!

93
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,664
Their pace has quickened.

94
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,741
They must have caught our scent.

95
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,695
Hurry!

96
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,102
Come on, Gimli!

97
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,144
Three days and nights pursuit.

98
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,203
No food. No rest.

99
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,240
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

100
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,941
Not idly do the leaves of Lérien fall.

101
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,750
They may yet be alive.

102
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,185
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

103
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,314
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

104
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,593
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

105
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,489
Very dangerous over short distances.

106
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,154
Rohan.

107
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,996
Home of the Horse-lords.

108
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,726
There's something strange at work here.

109
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,852
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

110
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,989
Sets its will against us.

111
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,107
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

112
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,873
The Uruks turn northeast.

113
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,927
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

114
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,173
Saruman.

115
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,583
The world is changing.

116
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:42,063
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

117
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,846
...and Mordor?

118
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:52,804
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...

119
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,849
...and the union of the two towers?

120
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,366
Together, my Lord Sauron...

121
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,976
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.

122
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,242
The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.

123
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,200
The forests will fail.

124
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,021
A new order will rise.

125
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:44,782
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

126
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:49,005
...and the iron fists of the Ore.

127
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:03,384
We have only to remove
those who oppose us.

128
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,847
The Horse-Men took your lands.

129
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:11,246
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

130
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,264
Murderers!

131
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,180
Take back the lands they stole from you.

132
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,222
Burn every village!

133
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,531
It will begin in Rohan.

134
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,688
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

135
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,871
But no more.

136
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,250
. .
Eothain! Eothain!

137
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,038
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

138
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,074
.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

139
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,030
He is too big for him.

140
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,049
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

141
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,799
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.

142
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,960
I don't want to leave.
1 don't want to go, Mama.

143
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,761
Freda, I will find you there.

144
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,546
Quickly!

145
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,533
Go, child.

146
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,374
Rohan, my lord...

147
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,339
.. 48 ready fo fall.

148
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,703
Théodred.

149
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,349
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

150
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,282
He was ambushed by Orcs.

151
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,319
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

152
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,323
That is a lie.

153
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:30,151
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

154
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,128
Grima.

155
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,515
Grima.

156
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,626
Grima.

157
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,278
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

158
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,218
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

159
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,879
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

160
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,110
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

161
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,149
Can you not see?

162
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:14,065
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

163
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,074
.
... your warmongering.

164
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,322
Warmongering?

165
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,627
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

166
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,810
What was the promised price, Grima?

167
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,553
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

168
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,822
Too long have you watched my sister.

169
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,068
Too long have you haunted her steps.

170
00:19:56,362 --> 00:20:00,172
. .
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

171
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,886
Too much.

172
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,530
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

173
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,429
...under pain of death.

174
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,045
Keep breathing. That's the key.

175
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,102
Breathe.

176
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,787
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

177
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,154
We're not going no further...

178
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,337
...Until we've had a breather.

179
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,873
Get a fire going!

180
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,552
Merry!

181
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,287
Merry!

182
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:32,724
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

183
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,732
What's making that noise?

184
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,895
It's the trees.

185
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,708
What?

186
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,579
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

187
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:58,163
Folk used to say there was something
in the water that made the trees grow tall...

188
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,174
...and come alive.

189
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,076
Alive?

190
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,645
Trees that could whisper...

191
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,028
...talk to each other...

192
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,134
. even move.

193
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,924
I'm starving.

194
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,936
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

195
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,918
Yeah!

196
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:23,176
Why can't we have some meat?!

197
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,875
What about them?

198
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,984
They're fresh.

199
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,193
They are not for eating.

200
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,356
What about their legs?

201
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,811
They don't need those.

202
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,341
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!

203
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,587
-Carve them up!
-Just a mouthful.

204
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,396
No!

205
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,745
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

206
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,896
Pippin.

207
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,711
Let's go.

208
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,670
Go on.

209
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,342
Call for help.

210
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:24,863
Squeal.

211
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,987
No one's going to save you now.

212
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,880
Pippin!

213
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,445
A red sun rises.

214
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,588
Blood has been spilled this night.

215
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,086
Riders of Rohan...

216
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,888
.. what news from the Mark?

217
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:16,747
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

218
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,193
Speak quickly!

219
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,784
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

220
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,745
! would cut off your head, Dwarf...

221
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,581
.. if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

222
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,718
You would die before your stroke fell.

223
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,386
lam Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

224
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,641
This is Gimli, son of Gloin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

225
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,101
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

226
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,504
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

227
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,128
Not even his own kin.

228
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,668
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

229
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,774
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

230
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,587
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

231
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,697
And for that, we are banished.

232
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,884
The White Wizard is cunning.

233
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,064
He walks here and there, they say...

234
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,303
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

235
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,772
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

236
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,359
We are no spies.

237
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,380
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

238
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,091
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

239
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,378
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

240
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,624
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

241
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,790
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

242
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,170
We left none alive.

243
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,636
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

244
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,543
Dead?

245
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:18,192
lam sorry.

246
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,029
Hasufel! Arod!

247
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:32,213
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

248
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,452
Farewell.

249
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,816
Look for your friends.

250
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,489
But do not trust to hope.

251
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,716
It has forsaken these lands.

252
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,985
We ride north!

253
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,464
It's one of their wee belts.

254
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,200
We failed them.

255
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,419
A Hobbit lay here.

256
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,020
And the other.

257
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,403
They crawled.

258
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,618
Their hands were bound.

259
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,666
Their bonds were cut.

260
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,213
They ran over here.

261
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,196
They were followed.

262
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,070
The belt!

263
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,179
Run!

264
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,197
Tracks lead away from the battle...

265
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,072
...into Fangorn Forest.

266
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,496
Fangorn?

267
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,151
What madness drove them in there?

268
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,818
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

269
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,908
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

270
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:20,428
Come here!

271
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,334
Trees. Climb a tree.

272
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,516
He's gone.

273
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,893
Merry!

274
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:09,427
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

275
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,437
Run, Merry!

276
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:32,256
Little Orcs.

277
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,001
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

278
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,124
Tree?

279
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,152
lam no tree!

280
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,655
lam an Ent.

281
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,362
A tree-herder.

282
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,527
A shepherd of the forest.

283
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,133
Don't talk to it, Merry.

284
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,091
Don't encourage it!

285
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,190
Treebeard, some call me.

286
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,637
And whose side are you on?

287
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,847
Side?

288
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,764
lam on nobody's side...

289
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:08,172
... because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

290
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:13,691
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

291
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,735
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

292
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,215
Hobbits?

293
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:25,012
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

294
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,758
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

295
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,440
They come with fire.

296
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:36,162
They come with axes.

297
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,901
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

298
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,025
-Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
-No!

299
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,180
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

300
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,307
Halflings!

301
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,685
Shire-folk!

302
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,047
Maybe you are...

303
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,823
...and maybe you aren't.

304
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,774
The White Wizard will know.

305
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,742
The White Wizard?

306
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,802
Saruman.

307
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,049
See? See?

308
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,571
We've led you out.

309
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,250
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

310
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,855
Very lucky we find you.

311
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,399
Nice Hobbit.

312
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,386
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

313
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,264
A swamp, yes, yes.

314
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:56,484
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

315
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,354
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

316
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,317
I found it. I did.

317
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,183
The way through the marshes.

318
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:14,783
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

319
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19,017
They go around for miles and miles.

320
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:20,978
Come quickly.

321
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,923
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

322
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,147
There are dead things!

323
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,092
Dead faces in the water.

324
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,629
All dead. All rotten.

325
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,930
Elves and Men and Orcses.

326
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:02,721
A great battle long ago.

327
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,482
Dead Marshes.

328
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,297
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

329
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,851
This way.

330
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,667
Don't follow the lights.

331
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:20,175
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

332
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,444
...and light little candles
of their own.

333
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,499
Frodo!

334
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:41,255
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.

335
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,633
-Gollum!
-Mr. Frodo!

336
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,667
Are you all right?

337
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:17,336
So bright.

338
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:21,236
So beautiful.

339
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:25,236
Our precious.

340
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,515
What did you say?

341
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,867
Master should be resting.

342
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,849
Master needs to keep up his strength.

343
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,218
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

344
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,095
Gollum. Gollum.

345
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,033
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

346
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:48,022
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

347
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,063
He said your life was a sad story.

348
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:54,441
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

349
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,796
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

350
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,825
Were you?

351
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,233
Sméagol.

352
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,433
What did you call me?

353
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,513
That was your name once, wasn't it?

354
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,500
A long time ago.

355
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,524
My name.

356
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,171
My name.

357
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,459
Sméagol.

358
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,309
Black Riders!

359
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:40,881
Hide! Hide!

360
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,643
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

361
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:57,282
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

362
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,836
- thought they were dead.
-Dead?

363
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,912
No, you cannot kill them. No.

364
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,422
Wraiths!

365
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,694
Wraiths on wings!

366
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,754
They are calling for it.

367
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:48,313
They are calling for the precious.

368
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,785
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

369
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,327
I'm here.

370
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,770
Hurry, Hobbits.

371
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,997
The Black Gate is very close.

372
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:24,988
Orc blood.

373
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,776
These are strange tracks.

374
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,042
The air is so close in here.

375
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,571
This forest is old.

376
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,415
Very old.

377
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,459
Full of memory...

378
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,394
..and anger.

379
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,336
The trees are speaking to each other.

380
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,166
Gimli!

381
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,223
Lower your ax.

382
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,549
The White Wizard approaches.

383
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:37,798
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

384
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,888
We must be quick.

385
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,903
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

386
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,184
Where are they?

387
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,652
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

388
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,009
They met someone they did not expect.

389
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,567
Does that comfort you?

390
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,729
Who are you?

391
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,186
Show yourself!

392
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,094
It cannot be.

393
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,935
You fell.

394
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:52,814
Through fire...

395
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,437
...and water.

396
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,287
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

397
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:02,019
...¢ fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.

398
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,722
Until at last { threw down
my enemy...

399
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:25,145
..and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

400
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,952
Darkness took me...

401
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,609
...and { strayed out of thought
and time.

402
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,596
Stars wheeled overhead...

403
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:47,163
..and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

404
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,723
But it was not the end.

405
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:54,712
! felt life in me again.

406
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,214
I've been sent back...

407
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,007
...Until my task is done.

408
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,302
Gandalf.

409
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,952
Gandalf?

410
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,187
Yes.

411
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,788
That was what they used to call me.

412
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,870
Gandalf the Grey.

413
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,033
That was my name.

414
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:22,679
Gandalf.

415
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,632
lam Gandalf the White.

416
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,617
And I come back to you now...

417
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:35,354
...at the turn of the tide.

418
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,443
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

419
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,839
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.

420
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:06,723
That is one of the Mearas...

421
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,524
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

422
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,508
Shadowfax.

423
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:34,663
He is the lord of all horses...

424
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:40,054
..and has been my friend
through many dangers.

425
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,872
My home lies deep in the forest...

426
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,953
... near the roots of the mountain.

427
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,923
I told Gandalf ! would keep you safe.

428
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:12,927
And safe is where I'll keep you.

429
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:17,508
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

430
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:21,316
Anger festers in their hearts.

431
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:24,125
They will harm you if they can.

432
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,189
There are too few of us now.

433
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:32,966
Too few of us Ents
left to manage them.

434
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:45,772
The Black Gate of Mordor.

435
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,356
Oh, save us.

436
00:47:57,475 --> 00:48:00,255
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

437
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,800
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

438
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:10,538
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

439
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:12,202
did.

440
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,878
That's it, then.

441
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:25,808
We can't get past that.

442
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,352
Look!

443
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:13,973
The gate.

444
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,368
It's opening!

445
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:24,677
l can see a way down.

446
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,499
Sam, no!

447
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,134
Master!

448
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:58,352
-! do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-l Know, Mr. Frodo.

449
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:02,276
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

450
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,700
-Now!
-No!

451
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:07,246
No! No, master!

452
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:10,295
They catch you! They catch you!

453
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:14,186
Don't take it to him.

454
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,874
He wants the precious.

455
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:23,007
Always he is looking for it.

456
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:27,011
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

457
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:31,147
But we mustn't let him have it.

458
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,857
No! There's another way.

459
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,637
More secret. A dark way.

460
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,486
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.

461
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,368
He's up to something.

462
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,389
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

463
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:54,309
Yes. There's a path...

464
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:56,982
...and some stairs.

465
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:58,974
And then...

466
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,220
...a tunnel.

467
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,180
He's led us this far, Sam.

468
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:19,799
Mr. Frodo, no.

469
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,428
He's been true to his word.

470
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,528
No.

471
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,243
Lead the way, Sméagol.

472
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,510
Good Sméagol always helps.

473
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,910
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

474
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,458
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

475
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:14,035
... whose mind is overthrown.

476
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:18,308
Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

477
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:22,243
My lord, your son...

478
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,730
..he is dead.

479
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,087
My lord?

480
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:30,596
Uncle?

481
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,571
Will you not go to him?

482
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,063
Will you do nothing?

483
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,272
Be careful what you say.

484
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,595
Do not look for welcome here.

485
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,577
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

486
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,155
What a tragedy for the king...

487
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:23,234
...to lose his only son and heir.

488
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:28,675
understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

489
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:33,709
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

490
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:35,795
Leave me alone, snake!

491
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,841
Oh, but you are alone.

492
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:44,901
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

493
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,669
..in the bitter watches of the night...

494
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:52,503
...when all your life seems to shrink.

495
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,813
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

496
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:01,444
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

497
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,904
So fair.

498
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,607
So cold.

499
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:12,534
Like a morning of pale spring...

500
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,030
...Still clinging to winter's chill.

501
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:32,384
Your words are poison.

502
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,378
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

503
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,445
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

504
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:29,661
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

505
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,847
Your staff.

506
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,539
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

507
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:17,278
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

508
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:27,306
He's a herald of woe.

509
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:31,604
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

510
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,503
.. Théoden King.

511
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:37,598
He's not welcome.

512
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:43,509
Why should I welcome you...

513
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:47,874
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

514
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:51,392
A just question, my liege.

515
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:54,482
Late is the hour...

516
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:58,478
..in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

517
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,520
Lathspell 1 name him.

518
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:04,522
Ill news is an ill guest.

519
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:09,052
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

520
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,480
l have not passed
through fire and death...

521
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,722
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

522
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:17,955
His staff.

523
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:22,018
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

524
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,562
Théoden...

525
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,615
...$on of Thengel...

526
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,782
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

527
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,944
would stay still if 1 were you.

528
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,351
Hearken to me!

529
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,986
l release you...

530
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,151
...from the spell.

531
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,595
You have no power here...

532
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,330
... Gandalf the Grey.

533
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:21,663
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

534
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:33,035
Wait.

535
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:38,034
If l go, Théoden dies.

536
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,132
You did not kill me...

537
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,505
. you will not kill him.

538
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:49,200
Rohan is mine.

539
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:52,051
Be gone.

540
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,563
I know your face.

541
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,510
.
Eowyn.

542
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,083
.
Eowyn.

543
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,596
Gandalf?

544
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,741
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

545
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,744
Dark have been my dreams of late.

546
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,518
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

547
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,785
...if they grasped your sword.

548
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:14,973
I've only...

549
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:18,082
...ever served you, my lord.

550
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:23,018
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

551
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,334
Send me not from your sight.

552
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,275
No, my lord! No, my lord.

553
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:32,861
Let him go.

554
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:36,583
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

555
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,498
Get out of my way!

556
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:45,799
Hail, Théoden King!

557
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,000
Where is Théodred?

558
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,509
Where is my son?

559
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,246
Simbelmyné.

560
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,759
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

561
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:39,683
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

562
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:45,578
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

563
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:50,685
The young perish and the old linger.

564
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,661
That ! should live...

565
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,050
...to see the last days of my house.

566
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:02,035
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

567
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,524
No parent should have to bury
their child.

568
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,328
He was strong in life.

569
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:31,788
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

570
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,510
They had no warning.

571
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,018
They were unarmed.

572
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:25,317
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

573
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,479
Rick, cot and tree.

574
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,978
Where is Mama?

575
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:35,741
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

576
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:40,296
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

577
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:45,062
Ride out and meet him head on.

578
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:49,239
Draw him away from your women
and children.

579
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,439
You must fight.

580
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,211
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

581
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,274
.
Eomer is loyal to you.

582
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,957
His men will return
and fight for their king.

583
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,879
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

584
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,984
.
Eomer cannot help us.

585
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,440
know what it is you want of me...

586
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:15,699
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

587
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,256
I will not risk open war.

588
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,664
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

589
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,774
When last I looked...

590
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:34,604
.. Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

591
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,915
Then what is the king's decision?

592
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:50,936
By order of the King...

593
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:52,557
...the city must empty.

594
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,423
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

595
01:07:57,106 --> 01:08:00,476
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

596
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:02,433
Helm's Deep.

597
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,912
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

598
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:08,246
Who will defend them if not their king?

599
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,821
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

600
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:12,866
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

601
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,685
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

602
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:19,257
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

603
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,595
What they will get is a massacre.

604
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,589
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

605
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,699
fear for the survival of Rohan.

606
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:33,127
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

607
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,403
The people of Rohan will need you.

608
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,283
The defenses have to hold.

609
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:42,537
They will hold.

610
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,776
The Grey Pilgrim.

611
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,535
That's what they used to call me.

612
01:08:52,028 --> 01:08:56,508
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now ! have no time.

613
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,604
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

614
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,307
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

615
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,978
At dawn, look to the east.

616
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,818
Go.

617
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,148
You have some skill with a blade.

618
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:58,733
Women of this country learned long ago:

619
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:01,472
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

620
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:03,574
fear neither death nor pain.

621
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,904
What do you fear, my lady?

622
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,183
A cage.

623
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:17,080
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

624
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:21,144
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

625
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,834
You're a daughter of kings...

626
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:31,257
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

627
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:39,153
1 do not think that would be your fate.

628
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,495
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

629
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:17,882
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

630
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:20,891
He will expect an attack on the city.

631
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:25,415
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

632
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:28,032
.. the great fortress of Rohan.

633
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:33,389
it is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

634
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:36,878
They will be slow.

635
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:41,360
They will have women and children
with them.

636
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:47,758
Send out your Warg-riders.

637
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:05,435
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

638
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:08,295
-Why do you do that?
-What?

639
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,011
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

640
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:13,541
Because.

641
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,201
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

642
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,563
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

643
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,699
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

644
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,199
You have no idea what it did to him...

645
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,845
... What it's still doing to him.

646
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:32,219
l want to help him, Sam.

647
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:33,758
Why?

648
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:41,972
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

649
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:48,295
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

650
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,098
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

651
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:02,037
I'm sorry, Sam. 1 don't know
why I said that.

652
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,369
I do.

653
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,189
It's the Ring.

654
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:10,355
You can't take your eyes off it.

655
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:13,017
I've seen you.

656
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:17,093
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

657
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:21,288
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

658
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,101
-You have to fight it.
- Know what ! have to do, Sam.

659
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,180
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

660
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,227
Mine! My own!

661
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:32,146
Can't you hear yourself?

662
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,038
Don't you know who you sound like?

663
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,423
We wants it.

664
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:49,226
We needs it.

665
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:53,945
Must have the precious.

666
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:57,717
They stole it from us.

667
01:13:58,301 --> 01:14:01,201
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

668
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:05,234
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

669
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:08,745
No. Not master.

670
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:12,682
Yes, precious. False.

671
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:17,266
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

672
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:21,125
Master's my friend.

673
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:26,040
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

674
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,120
Not listening. I'm not listening.

675
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:34,109
You're a liar and a thief.

676
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:36,611
No.

677
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,290
Murderer.

678
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:43,982
Go away.

679
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,393
Go away?

680
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:51,144
l hate you.

681
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,764
l hate you.

682
01:14:54,357 --> 01:14:57,257
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

683
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,437
I saved us.

684
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:03,749
It was me. We survived because of me.

685
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,661
Not anymore.

686
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:11,813
What did you say?

687
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:17,480
Master looks after us now.

688
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:21,183
We don't need you.

689
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:23,688
What?

690
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:25,603
Leave now...

691
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:29,328
...and never come back.

692
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:30,858
No.

693
01:15:31,494 --> 01:15:35,183
Leave now and never come back.

694
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:43,520
Leave now and never come back!

695
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,588
We told him to go away.

696
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:01,638
And away he goes, precious.

697
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:03,908
Gone! Gone! Gone!

698
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,816
Sméagol is free!

699
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,343
Look.

700
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:16,651
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

701
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,009
They are young.

702
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,570
They are tender. They are nice.

703
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:34,153
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

704
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:38,692
You'll make him sick, you will...

705
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,026
...behaving like that.

706
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,130
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

707
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:52,713
What's it doing?

708
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,982
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

709
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,409
It ruins it.

710
01:16:58,848 --> 01:17:01,978
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

711
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,805
What we need is a few good taters.

712
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,682
What's taters, precious?

713
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:14,749
What's taters? Eh?

714
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,651
Po-ta-toes.

715
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:20,039
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

716
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:26,771
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

717
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:30,447
Even you couldn't say no to that.

718
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:32,943
Oh, yes, we could.

719
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:36,451
Spoil a nice fish.

720
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,464
Give it to us raw...

721
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:43,616
..and wriggling.

722
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,910
You keep nasty chips.

723
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,040
You're hopeless.

724
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,068
Mr. Frodo?

725
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:24,504
-Who are they?
-Wicked Men.

726
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,170
Servants of Sauron.

727
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:30,204
They are called to Mordor.

728
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:33,303
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

729
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:36,656
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

730
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:41,834
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.

731
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:46,991
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

732
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,580
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

733
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,206
Mr. Frodo.

734
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,291
Look.

735
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,090
It's an oliphaunt.

736
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:11,237
No one at home will believe this.

737
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,398
Sméagol?

738
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:07,204
We've lingered here too long.

739
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:11,709
Come on, Sam.

740
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:30,167
Bind their hands.

741
01:20:39,468 --> 01:20:41,867
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

742
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:45,594
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

743
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:49,021
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

744
01:20:49,812 --> 01:20:51,482
It's the beards.

745
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:53,784
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

746
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,736
...that there are no Dwarf women...

747
01:20:57,252 --> 01:21:00,942
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

748
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,765
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

749
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,090
It's all right. Nobody panic.

750
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:16,411
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

751
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:38,720
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

752
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:43,035
It is mine to give to whom { will.

753
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,376
Like my heart.

754
01:21:49,138 --> 01:21:51,478
Go to sleep.

755
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:54,177
lam asleep.

756
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,616
This is a dream.

757
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,897
Then it is a good dream.

758
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:22,142
Sleep.

759
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,037
Arwen...

760
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:18,362
Where is she?

761
01:24:19,755 --> 01:24:21,895
The woman who gave you that jewel.

762
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:27,924
Our time here is ending.

763
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:31,181
Arwen's time is ending.

764
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,344
Let her go.

765
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:35,449
Let her take the ship into the west.

766
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,564
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

767
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:40,721
There it will be ever green.

768
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,524
But never more than memory.

769
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,741
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

770
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:52,473
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.

771
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,108
She belongs with her people.

772
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,715
Why are you saying this?

773
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:17,319
lam mortal. You are Elf-kind.

774
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:22,909
It was a dream, Arwen.

775
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:24,848
Nothing more.

776
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,505
This belongs to you.

777
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,900
It was a gift.

778
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:44,081
Keep it.

779
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:47,828
My lord?

780
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:54,822
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

781
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:20,097
What is it?

782
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:23,557
-Hama?
-l'm not sure.

783
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,205
Wargs!

784
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,500
A scout!

785
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:05,171
-What is it? What do you see?
-Warg! We're under attack!

786
01:27:06,822 --> 01:27:08,752
Get them out of here!

787
01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:15,541
All riders to the head of the column.

788
01:27:16,498 --> 01:27:18,248
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

789
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:20,187
Come on!

790
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,387
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

791
01:27:34,883 --> 01:27:36,173
-l can fight.
-No!

792
01:27:39,054 --> 01:27:40,864
You must do this, for me.

793
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:44,525
Follow me!

794
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:52,009
-Forward. ! mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!

795
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:55,074
-That's it! Go on!
-Stay together!

796
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:09,295
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

797
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:13,750
That one counts as mine!

798
01:29:30,632 --> 01:29:32,062
Stinking creature.

799
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,231
Aragorn!

800
01:31:06,161 --> 01:31:07,451
Aragorn?

801
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:24,223
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

802
01:31:24,746 --> 01:31:26,006
He's...

803
01:31:26,748 --> 01:31:28,147
... dead.

804
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,534
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

805
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:36,630
You lie.

806
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,092
Get the wounded on horses.

807
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:16,375
The wolves of Isengard will return.

808
01:32:17,165 --> 01:32:19,035
Leave the dead.

809
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:28,031
Come.

810
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:39,820
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.

811
01:32:40,188 --> 01:32:42,738
There it is, Helm's Deep.

812
01:32:45,627 --> 01:32:47,237
We're safe!

813
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:51,483
We're safe, my lady.

814
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,050
Thank you.

815
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:38,775
-Mama!
.
-Eothain!

816
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:40,483
Freda!

817
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:48,326
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

818
01:33:56,698 --> 01:33:59,918
So few. So few of you have returned.

819
01:34:03,171 --> 01:34:05,131
Our people are safe.

820
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:08,994
We have paid for it with many lives.

821
01:34:10,178 --> 01:34:11,488
My lady.

822
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,406
Lord Aragorn...

823
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:18,932
... where is he?

824
01:34:21,089 --> 01:34:22,429
He fell.

825
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,955
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

826
01:34:48,483 --> 01:34:51,063
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

827
01:34:51,653 --> 01:34:54,373
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

828
01:34:54,923 --> 01:34:57,202
Get them into the caves.

829
01:34:58,393 --> 01:35:02,613
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

830
01:35:05,233 --> 01:35:08,223
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

831
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:10,856
its outer wall is solid rock...

832
01:35:11,339 --> 01:35:14,029
...but for a smail culvert
at its base...

833
01:35:14,609 --> 01:35:17,039
... Which is little more than a drain.

834
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:23,875
How? How can fire undo stone?

835
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:28,562
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

836
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:36,237
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

837
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:39,998
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

838
01:35:40,602 --> 01:35:42,852
... thousands, to storm the Keep.

839
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:44,631
Tens of thousands.

840
01:35:44,973 --> 01:35:48,513
But, my lord, there is no such force.

841
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:03,608
A new power is rising.

842
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:06,788
Its victory is at hand.

843
01:36:12,834 --> 01:36:14,644
This night...

844
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:19,176
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

845
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:22,804
March to Helm's Deep!

846
01:36:23,378 --> 01:36:26,418
Leave none alive!

847
01:36:29,384 --> 01:36:31,574
To war!

848
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:39,710
There will be no dawn for Men.

849
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:59,288
Look. There's smoke to the south.

850
01:36:59,714 --> 01:37:02,434
There is always smoke rising...

851
01:37:03,017 --> 01:37:06,387
...from Isengard these days.

852
01:37:07,088 --> 01:37:08,487
Isengard?

853
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:10,530
There was a time...

854
01:37:11,092 --> 01:37:14,192
... when Saruman would walk in my woods.

855
01:37:14,796 --> 01:37:17,756
But now he has a mind of metal...

856
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,973
..and wheels.

857
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:25,986
He no longer cares for growing things.

858
01:37:26,741 --> 01:37:28,321
What is it?

859
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,474
It's Saruman's army.

860
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,287
The war has started.

861
01:38:15,757 --> 01:38:19,597
May the grace of the Valar
protect you.

862
01:39:20,388 --> 01:39:21,438
Arwen.

863
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:33,012
l have made my choice.

864
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:42,227
He is not coming back.

865
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:46,941
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

866
01:39:48,249 --> 01:39:50,879
There is still hope.

867
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:58,699
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

868
01:40:02,563 --> 01:40:05,173
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

869
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,889
..and all that you hope for
comes true...

870
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:12,499
.. you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

871
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:15,983
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

872
01:40:16,544 --> 01:40:19,124
.. Aragorn will die.

873
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:24,566
And there will be no comfort
for you...

874
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:28,772
...0 comfort fo ease the pain
of his passing.

875
01:40:32,093 --> 01:40:34,492
He will come to death...

876
01:40:34,996 --> 01:40:37,276
...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...

877
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:41,865
..in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

878
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:55,026
But you, my daughter...

879
01:40:56,317 --> 01:41:00,677
... you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...

880
01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:05,025
...a8 nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

881
01:41:07,929 --> 01:41:10,039
Here you will dwell...

882
01:41:10,498 --> 01:41:14,808
... bound to your grief
under the fading trees...

883
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:18,901
...until all the world is changed...

884
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:23,260
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

885
01:41:32,386 --> 01:41:33,406
Arwen.

886
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:42,184
There is nothing for you here...

887
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:44,970
..only death.

888
01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:21,816
The power of the enemy is growing.

889
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:24,740
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...

890
01:43:25,232 --> 01:43:28,252
...fo destroy the people of Rohan.

891
01:43:30,771 --> 01:43:33,931
lsengard has been unleashed.

892
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:41,673
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...

893
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,847
...the last free kingdom of Men.

894
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:50,257
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

895
01:43:54,495 --> 01:43:57,215
He senses the Ring is close.

896
01:43:57,765 --> 01:44:00,755
The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.

897
01:44:01,335 --> 01:44:04,905
In his heart, Frodo begins
fo understand...

898
01:44:06,974 --> 01:44:10,374
...the quest will claim his life.

899
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:12,911
You know this.

900
01:44:13,781 --> 01:44:16,271
You have foreseen it.

901
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,759
It is the risk we ail took.

902
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,250
in the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.

903
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:35,831
it works hard now fo find its way back
into the hands of Men.

904
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:41,349
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

905
01:44:42,243 --> 01:44:45,343
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

906
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:49,580
...fake the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

907
01:44:52,486 --> 01:44:54,096
It is close now.

908
01:44:54,488 --> 01:44:58,238
So close to achieving its goal.

909
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:04,986
For Sauron will have dominion
over ail life on this Earth...

910
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:09,229
...even unto fo the ending
of the world.

911
01:45:11,605 --> 01:45:13,214
The time of the Elves...

912
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,340
.
. AS Over.

913
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:19,570
Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?

914
01:45:21,949 --> 01:45:24,818
Do we let them stand alone?

915
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:31,023
What news?

916
01:45:31,358 --> 01:45:33,818
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

917
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:36,848
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

918
01:45:37,364 --> 01:45:40,904
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

919
01:45:41,569 --> 01:45:43,679
Sauron is marshaling an army.

920
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:46,178
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

921
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,630
-How many?
-Some thousands. More come every day.

922
01:45:51,145 --> 01:45:54,275
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

923
01:45:54,882 --> 01:45:57,571
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

924
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,920
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

925
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:04,726
Sauron from Mordor.

926
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:09,200
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

927
01:46:09,763 --> 01:46:11,253
Gondor is weak.

928
01:46:11,632 --> 01:46:14,382
Sauron will strike us soon.

929
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:17,142
And he will strike hard.

930
01:46:17,838 --> 01:46:21,407
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

931
01:46:35,856 --> 01:46:37,816
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

932
01:46:38,259 --> 01:46:40,659
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

933
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:43,151
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

934
01:46:50,337 --> 01:46:51,827
Speak.

935
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:55,423
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

936
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:58,740
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

937
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:00,836
Your bodyguard?

938
01:47:01,181 --> 01:47:02,760
His gardener.

939
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:05,334
And where is your skulking friend?

940
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:09,107
That gangrel creature.

941
01:47:09,723 --> 01:47:11,452
He had an ill-favored look.

942
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:15,097
There was no other.

943
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:21,483
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

944
01:47:25,139 --> 01:47:27,799
One we lost in Moria...

945
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:30,586
...two were my kin...

946
01:47:30,978 --> 01:47:34,258
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

947
01:47:34,882 --> 01:47:38,312
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

948
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:45,341
You're a friend of Boromir?

949
01:47:47,995 --> 01:47:49,305
Yes.

950
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:51,524
For my part.

951
01:47:58,205 --> 01:48:00,725
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

952
01:48:03,110 --> 01:48:04,400
Dead?

953
01:48:04,745 --> 01:48:06,555
How? When?

954
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:09,387
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

955
01:48:15,522 --> 01:48:17,102
He was my brother.

956
01:48:36,577 --> 01:48:38,307
Captain Faramir!

957
01:48:39,847 --> 01:48:41,717
We found the third one.

958
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:55,377
You must come with me. Now.

959
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:07,770
Down there.

960
01:49:22,856 --> 01:49:25,376
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

961
01:49:36,336 --> 01:49:37,646
They wait for my command.

962
01:49:43,343 --> 01:49:44,273
Shall 1 shoot?

963
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:48,339
The rock and pool
is nice and cool

964
01:49:48,882 --> 01:49:50,491
So juicy sweet

965
01:49:51,351 --> 01:49:53,960
Our only wish
To catch a fish

966
01:49:54,488 --> 01:49:56,858
So juicy sweet

967
01:50:04,198 --> 01:50:05,428
Wait.

968
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:09,590
This creature is bound to me.

969
01:50:10,571 --> 01:50:12,271
And I to him.

970
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:16,916
He is our guide.

971
01:50:21,815 --> 01:50:23,044
Please...

972
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:25,023
...let me go down to him.

973
01:50:36,530 --> 01:50:37,990
Sméagol.

974
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:41,159
Master is here.

975
01:50:42,636 --> 01:50:43,626
Come, Sméagol.

976
01:50:46,673 --> 01:50:48,952
Trust master. Come.

977
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:55,849
We must go now?

978
01:50:56,683 --> 01:50:59,643
Sméagol, you must trust master.

979
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,450
Follow me. Come on.

980
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:04,223
Come.

981
01:51:06,927 --> 01:51:07,977
Come, Sméagol.

982
01:51:08,629 --> 01:51:10,439
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

983
01:51:11,198 --> 01:51:12,538
Come on.

984
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:18,601
Don't hurt him!

985
01:51:19,006 --> 01:51:21,376
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

986
01:51:21,909 --> 01:51:23,049
Master!

987
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:35,981
No! No!

988
01:51:42,396 --> 01:51:44,295
Where are you leading them?

989
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:47,826
Answer me.

990
01:51:48,835 --> 01:51:51,675
Sméagol.

991
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:59,672
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

992
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:03,791
Cruel Men hurts us.

993
01:52:04,284 --> 01:52:06,914
Master tricksed us.

994
01:52:07,454 --> 01:52:10,584
Of course he did.

995
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:14,641
I told you he was tricksy.

996
01:52:15,262 --> 01:52:17,922
I told you he was false.

997
01:52:18,465 --> 01:52:20,835
Master is our friend.

998
01:52:21,335 --> 01:52:23,415
Our friend.

999
01:52:23,904 --> 01:52:25,774
Master betrayed us.

1000
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,849
No. Not its business.

1001
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:32,450
Leave us alone!

1002
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:35,022
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1003
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:37,502
They stole it from us!

1004
01:52:37,951 --> 01:52:39,211
No. No.

1005
01:52:39,953 --> 01:52:41,383
What did they steal?

1006
01:52:43,724 --> 01:52:48,414
My precious!

1007
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:54,196
We have to get out of here.

1008
01:52:55,002 --> 01:52:56,732
You go. Go, now.

1009
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:01,186
You can do it.

1010
01:53:02,843 --> 01:53:04,133
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1011
01:53:04,478 --> 01:53:06,058
Just this once.

1012
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:07,996
Put it on.

1013
01:53:08,649 --> 01:53:10,429
Disappear.

1014
01:53:11,718 --> 01:53:12,678
I can't.

1015
01:53:15,889 --> 01:53:17,849
You were right, Sam.

1016
01:53:19,559 --> 01:53:21,749
You tried to tell me but...

1017
01:53:26,767 --> 01:53:28,666
I'm sorry.

1018
01:53:33,507 --> 01:53:36,027
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1019
01:53:37,778 --> 01:53:39,238
If l put it on...

1020
01:53:39,613 --> 01:53:41,663
...he'll find me.

1021
01:53:43,617 --> 01:53:45,347
He'll see.

1022
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,549
Mr. Frodo....

1023
01:53:53,727 --> 01:53:57,477
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1024
01:54:00,133 --> 01:54:02,763
Here in the Wild I have you...

1025
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:05,007
...two Halflings...

1026
01:54:05,405 --> 01:54:08,155
...and a host of men at my call.

1027
01:54:11,878 --> 01:54:14,947
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1028
01:54:25,058 --> 01:54:28,338
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1029
01:54:30,397 --> 01:54:33,057
...to show his quality.

1030
01:54:54,588 --> 01:54:55,987
No!

1031
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:00,469
Stop it!

1032
01:55:00,794 --> 01:55:01,724
Leave him alone.

1033
01:55:03,196 --> 01:55:05,385
Don't you understand?

1034
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,670
He's got to destroy it!

1035
01:55:09,069 --> 01:55:11,909
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1036
01:55:12,506 --> 01:55:13,936
To the Mountain of Fire!

1037
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:17,932
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1038
01:55:18,512 --> 01:55:21,142
Please. It's such a burden.

1039
01:55:23,683 --> 01:55:25,523
Will you not help him?

1040
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:28,790
Captain?

1041
01:55:29,689 --> 01:55:31,649
Prepare to leave.

1042
01:55:36,863 --> 01:55:39,003
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1043
01:56:52,339 --> 01:56:54,619
-He's alive!
-Where is he? Where is he?

1044
01:56:55,141 --> 01:56:57,800
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1045
01:56:58,378 --> 01:57:01,628
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1046
01:57:02,249 --> 01:57:05,789
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1047
01:57:06,953 --> 01:57:08,263
Bless you, laddie.

1048
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:10,542
Gimli, where is the king?

1049
01:57:24,571 --> 01:57:25,711
You look terrible.

1050
01:58:07,614 --> 01:58:09,424
A great host, you say?

1051
01:58:09,849 --> 01:58:12,189
-All Ilsengard is emptied.
-How many?

1052
01:58:13,186 --> 01:58:15,816
Ten thousand strong at least.

1053
01:58:17,724 --> 01:58:18,984
Ten thousand?

1054
01:58:19,593 --> 01:58:21,782
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1055
01:58:24,764 --> 01:58:26,634
To destroy the world of Men.

1056
01:58:29,402 --> 01:58:31,152
They will be here by nightfall.

1057
01:58:37,277 --> 01:58:38,417
Let them come!

1058
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,510
l want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1059
01:58:43,016 --> 01:58:45,766
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1060
01:58:54,394 --> 01:58:56,974
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1061
01:58:57,497 --> 01:58:59,637
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1062
01:59:00,033 --> 01:59:02,433
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1063
01:59:02,936 --> 01:59:05,045
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1064
01:59:05,972 --> 01:59:07,871
These are Uruk-hai.

1065
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:11,361
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1066
01:59:13,413 --> 01:59:16,633
l have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1067
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:20,410
I know how to defend my own keep.

1068
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:30,450
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1069
01:59:31,031 --> 01:59:35,631
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1070
01:59:36,469 --> 01:59:38,809
Crops can be resown...

1071
01:59:39,339 --> 01:59:41,949
...homes rebuilt.

1072
01:59:42,942 --> 01:59:45,162
Within these walls...

1073
01:59:45,879 --> 01:59:47,169
...we will outlast them.

1074
01:59:47,547 --> 01:59:49,656
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1075
01:59:50,116 --> 01:59:51,486
They come to destroy its people...

1076
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:54,040
...down to the last child.

1077
01:59:55,221 --> 01:59:57,210
What would you have me do?

1078
01:59:57,657 --> 01:59:59,177
Look at my men.

1079
01:59:59,559 --> 02:00:01,079
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1080
02:00:03,496 --> 02:00:07,366
If this is to be our end, then ! would
have them make such an end...

1081
02:00:08,068 --> 02:00:10,728
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1082
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:16,444
Send out riders, my lord.

1083
02:00:16,976 --> 02:00:19,496
You must call for aid.

1084
02:00:23,116 --> 02:00:25,106
And who will come?

1085
02:00:25,785 --> 02:00:27,184
Elves?

1086
02:00:27,554 --> 02:00:29,364
Dwarves?

1087
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:32,910
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1088
02:00:34,094 --> 02:00:36,084
The old alliances are dead.

1089
02:00:36,796 --> 02:00:39,256
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?!

1090
02:00:39,766 --> 02:00:41,696
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1091
02:00:42,936 --> 02:00:45,776
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1092
02:00:46,372 --> 02:00:48,072
Where was Gon--?

1093
02:00:50,977 --> 02:00:52,677
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1094
02:00:54,514 --> 02:00:56,684
...we are alone.

1095
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:05,310
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1096
02:01:05,692 --> 02:01:06,802
We need more time
to lay provisions--

1097
02:01:07,127 --> 02:01:10,197
There is no time. War is upon us.

1098
02:01:10,897 --> 02:01:12,387
Secure the gate.

1099
02:01:17,837 --> 02:01:19,647
We Ents have not troubled...

1100
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:23,100
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1101
02:01:24,277 --> 02:01:26,887
...for a very long time.

1102
02:01:28,515 --> 02:01:32,705
But now, something
is about to happen...

1103
02:01:33,453 --> 02:01:35,503
..that has not happened...

1104
02:01:35,989 --> 02:01:38,159
..for an age.

1105
02:01:39,659 --> 02:01:41,648
Entmoot.

1106
02:01:42,362 --> 02:01:43,232
What's that?

1107
02:01:43,763 --> 02:01:46,253
'Tis a gathering.

1108
02:01:47,801 --> 02:01:50,051
A gathering of what?

1109
02:02:08,254 --> 02:02:10,334
Beech. Oak.

1110
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:12,460
Chestnut. Ash.

1111
02:02:12,959 --> 02:02:14,688
Good. Good. Good.

1112
02:02:15,094 --> 02:02:17,174
Many have come.

1113
02:02:25,038 --> 02:02:27,437
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1114
02:02:27,974 --> 02:02:30,194
...Will go to war.

1115
02:02:39,485 --> 02:02:42,174
Move back! Move to the caves!

1116
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:45,520
-Keep moving.
-Quickly now.

1117
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:43,179
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1118
02:03:44,651 --> 02:03:46,231
These are no soldiers.

1119
02:03:48,454 --> 02:03:51,494
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.

1120
02:03:55,862 --> 02:03:58,412
Look at them. They're frightened.

1121
02:03:58,932 --> 02:04:00,161
You can see it in their eyes.

1122
02:04:21,287 --> 02:04:23,217
Then I shall die as one of them!

1123
02:04:29,929 --> 02:04:31,539
Let him go, lad.

1124
02:04:32,332 --> 02:04:34,002
Let him be.

1125
02:04:35,768 --> 02:04:40,568
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1126
02:04:45,545 --> 02:04:47,215
My lord?

1127
02:04:49,515 --> 02:04:51,765
Who am I, Gamling?

1128
02:04:55,455 --> 02:04:58,885
You are our king, sire.

1129
02:05:02,295 --> 02:05:05,165
And do you trust your king?

1130
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:09,880
Your men, my lord...

1131
02:05:10,436 --> 02:05:12,896
...Will follow you to whatever end.

1132
02:05:20,146 --> 02:05:21,816
To whatever end.

1133
02:05:31,891 --> 02:05:35,021
Where is the horse and the rider?

1134
02:05:35,628 --> 02:05:38,317
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1135
02:05:40,199 --> 02:05:44,119
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1136
02:05:45,671 --> 02:05:48,481
Like wind in the meadow.

1137
02:05:52,578 --> 02:05:55,888
The days have gone down in the West...

1138
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:59,360
... behind the hills...

1139
02:06:01,521 --> 02:06:02,951
..into Shadow.

1140
02:06:11,597 --> 02:06:14,617
How did it come to this?

1141
02:06:19,172 --> 02:06:21,781
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1142
02:06:39,692 --> 02:06:40,862
Give me your sword.

1143
02:06:50,503 --> 02:06:51,553
What is your name?

1144
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:54,351
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

1145
02:06:56,776 --> 02:06:59,086
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1146
02:07:01,314 --> 02:07:03,044
They say that it is hopeless.

1147
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:22,530
This is a good sword.

1148
02:07:24,804 --> 02:07:26,824
Haleth, son of Hama...

1149
02:07:31,477 --> 02:07:33,376
.. there is always hope.

1150
02:07:56,602 --> 02:07:59,562
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1151
02:08:00,106 --> 02:08:01,446
Forgive me.

1152
02:08:01,841 --> 02:08:03,101
l was wrong to despair.

1153
02:08:12,485 --> 02:08:14,945
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1154
02:08:18,724 --> 02:08:20,534
It's a little tight across the chest.

1155
02:08:26,966 --> 02:08:28,696
That is no Orc horn.

1156
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:36,250
Send for the king.

1157
02:08:36,642 --> 02:08:39,802
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!

1158
02:09:11,877 --> 02:09:13,337
How is this possible?

1159
02:09:14,547 --> 02:09:17,736
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1160
02:09:18,351 --> 02:09:21,191
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1161
02:09:22,288 --> 02:09:26,008
Long ago we fought and died together.

1162
02:09:28,794 --> 02:09:31,344
We come to honor that allegiance.

1163
02:09:40,206 --> 02:09:41,906
You are most welcome.

1164
02:09:47,513 --> 02:09:50,973
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1165
02:10:25,117 --> 02:10:27,987
You could have picked a better spot.

1166
02:10:33,259 --> 02:10:36,949
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1167
02:10:43,602 --> 02:10:45,182
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1168
02:10:46,072 --> 02:10:48,242
Let's hope they last the night.

1169
02:12:29,975 --> 02:12:32,435
-What's happening out there?
-Shall 1 describe it to you?

1170
02:12:34,046 --> 02:12:35,626
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1171
02:13:39,044 --> 02:13:40,624
So it begins.

1172
02:14:07,673 --> 02:14:08,873
Did they hit anything?

1173
02:14:09,708 --> 02:14:11,437
Give them a volley.

1174
02:14:11,877 --> 02:14:13,687
-Fire!
-Fire!

1175
02:14:29,695 --> 02:14:31,184
Send them to me! Come on!

1176
02:14:52,217 --> 02:14:53,147
Good!

1177
02:15:00,025 --> 02:15:02,634
Swords! Swords!

1178
02:15:33,058 --> 02:15:34,928
Legolas! Two already!

1179
02:15:35,361 --> 02:15:37,231
I'm on 17!

1180
02:15:37,663 --> 02:15:39,913
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1181
02:15:47,072 --> 02:15:48,562
Nineteen!

1182
02:16:26,011 --> 02:16:27,271
Merry.

1183
02:16:30,049 --> 02:16:33,388
We have just agreed.

1184
02:16:41,894 --> 02:16:43,184
Yes?

1185
02:16:43,861 --> 02:16:47,521
[ have told your names to the Entmoot...

1186
02:16:49,168 --> 02:16:52,008
..and we have agreed...

1187
02:16:52,905 --> 02:16:56,415
.. you are not Orcs.

1188
02:16:57,843 --> 02:16:59,713
Well, that's good news.

1189
02:17:00,079 --> 02:17:03,708
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1190
02:17:04,850 --> 02:17:08,190
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1191
02:17:08,821 --> 02:17:10,161
Hasty?

1192
02:17:10,923 --> 02:17:12,593
Our friends are out there.

1193
02:17:12,991 --> 02:17:16,651
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1194
02:17:17,495 --> 02:17:19,485
War? Yes.

1195
02:17:19,932 --> 02:17:21,602
It affects us all.

1196
02:17:22,634 --> 02:17:26,174
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1197
02:17:26,905 --> 02:17:28,605
..it takes a long time...

1198
02:17:29,007 --> 02:17:33,316
..to say anything in Old Entish...

1199
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:37,798
...and we never say anything...

1200
02:17:38,484 --> 02:17:41,914
...Unless it is worth taking...

1201
02:17:42,554 --> 02:17:46,034
...a long time to say.

1202
02:17:47,392 --> 02:17:50,322
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1203
02:17:50,896 --> 02:17:51,826
Nineteen!

1204
02:17:52,531 --> 02:17:54,171
Twenty!

1205
02:17:54,566 --> 02:17:56,026
Twenty-one!

1206
02:18:06,278 --> 02:18:08,008
Causeway!

1207
02:18:16,054 --> 02:18:18,134
Is this it?

1208
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:21,170
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1209
02:19:47,546 --> 02:19:48,746
Brace the gate!

1210
02:20:07,232 --> 02:20:09,222
Hold them! Stand firm!

1211
02:20:17,409 --> 02:20:18,579
Aragorn!

1212
02:20:23,382 --> 02:20:24,431
Gimli!

1213
02:21:12,998 --> 02:21:16,457
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1214
02:21:17,703 --> 02:21:21,243
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1215
02:21:22,574 --> 02:21:24,384
How can that be your decision?!

1216
02:21:25,344 --> 02:21:28,534
This is not our war.

1217
02:21:29,281 --> 02:21:31,211
But you're part of this world!

1218
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:37,230
Aren't you?!

1219
02:21:41,526 --> 02:21:43,606
You must help. Please.

1220
02:21:45,197 --> 02:21:47,627
You must do something.

1221
02:21:48,233 --> 02:21:52,013
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1222
02:21:53,772 --> 02:21:57,022
But your part in this tale is over.

1223
02:21:57,676 --> 02:21:59,635
Go back to your home.

1224
02:22:09,855 --> 02:22:11,845
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1225
02:22:12,290 --> 02:22:13,930
We don't belong here, Merry.

1226
02:22:14,326 --> 02:22:16,315
It's too big for us.

1227
02:22:16,762 --> 02:22:19,102
What can we do in the end?

1228
02:22:21,733 --> 02:22:24,043
We've got the Shire.

1229
02:22:24,903 --> 02:22:27,123
Maybe we should go home.

1230
02:22:29,307 --> 02:22:32,147
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1231
02:22:32,711 --> 02:22:37,020
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1232
02:22:37,783 --> 02:22:39,183
And...

1233
02:22:41,186 --> 02:22:43,876
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1234
02:22:47,793 --> 02:22:50,373
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1235
02:23:10,215 --> 02:23:11,295
Aragorn!

1236
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:13,696
Fall back to the Keep!

1237
02:23:14,152 --> 02:23:16,872
Get your men out of there!

1238
02:23:26,898 --> 02:23:28,357
Haldir!

1239
02:23:32,704 --> 02:23:35,544
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1240
02:23:55,193 --> 02:23:56,273
Haldir!

1241
02:24:37,135 --> 02:24:38,445
Brace the gate!

1242
02:24:41,573 --> 02:24:42,713
Hold them!

1243
02:24:44,709 --> 02:24:47,669
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1244
02:25:11,870 --> 02:25:13,600
Make way!

1245
02:25:16,741 --> 02:25:18,261
We cannot hold much longer!

1246
02:25:24,449 --> 02:25:27,579
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?

1247
02:25:28,186 --> 02:25:30,436
As long as you can give me.

1248
02:25:30,922 --> 02:25:32,382
Gimli!

1249
02:25:34,059 --> 02:25:35,259
Timbers!

1250
02:25:35,594 --> 02:25:37,323
Brace the gate!

1251
02:25:52,377 --> 02:25:53,867
Come on. We can take them.

1252
02:25:54,913 --> 02:25:56,343
It's a long way.

1253
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:03,269
Toss me.

1254
02:26:04,656 --> 02:26:06,266
-What?
-! cannot jump the distance!

1255
02:26:06,658 --> 02:26:08,028
You'll have to toss me!

1256
02:26:13,832 --> 02:26:14,942
Don't tell the Elf.

1257
02:26:15,634 --> 02:26:17,184
Not a word.

1258
02:26:32,684 --> 02:26:33,944
Shore up the door!

1259
02:26:34,286 --> 02:26:36,126
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.

1260
02:26:36,554 --> 02:26:37,484
Watch our backs!

1261
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:43,720
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!

1262
02:27:33,945 --> 02:27:35,175
Hold fast the gate!

1263
02:27:39,584 --> 02:27:42,164
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1264
02:27:47,258 --> 02:27:48,658
Aragorn!

1265
02:28:22,260 --> 02:28:24,400
Pull everybody back.

1266
02:28:25,063 --> 02:28:26,643
Pull them back.

1267
02:28:27,399 --> 02:28:28,689
Fall back!

1268
02:28:29,033 --> 02:28:31,223
Fall back!

1269
02:28:32,737 --> 02:28:34,196
They have broken through!

1270
02:28:34,606 --> 02:28:36,565
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1271
02:28:37,041 --> 02:28:39,000
-Fall back!
-Retreat!

1272
02:28:39,444 --> 02:28:41,724
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1273
02:28:42,213 --> 02:28:44,203
Into the Keep!

1274
02:28:55,927 --> 02:29:00,237
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1275
02:29:00,999 --> 02:29:05,128
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1276
02:29:11,476 --> 02:29:12,586
Wait! Stop!

1277
02:29:13,645 --> 02:29:14,935
Stop!

1278
02:29:18,249 --> 02:29:19,769
Turn around.

1279
02:29:20,885 --> 02:29:23,255
-Turn around. Take us south.
-South?

1280
02:29:23,755 --> 02:29:28,144
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1281
02:29:29,093 --> 02:29:31,463
Yes. Exactly.

1282
02:29:31,963 --> 02:29:34,803
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1283
02:29:35,366 --> 02:29:37,706
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1284
02:29:38,203 --> 02:29:39,953
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1285
02:29:42,841 --> 02:29:45,471
That doesn't make sense to me.

1286
02:29:46,044 --> 02:29:47,064
But then...

1287
02:29:47,378 --> 02:29:49,748
.. you are very small.

1288
02:29:50,248 --> 02:29:51,797
Perhaps you're right.

1289
02:29:54,652 --> 02:29:55,992
South it is, then.

1290
02:29:57,689 --> 02:30:00,619
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1291
02:30:03,061 --> 02:30:05,491
I always like going south.

1292
02:30:05,997 --> 02:30:09,777
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1293
02:30:10,902 --> 02:30:13,072
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1294
02:30:13,571 --> 02:30:15,271
No, we won't.

1295
02:30:16,241 --> 02:30:18,021
Not this time.

1296
02:30:25,149 --> 02:30:26,049
Look!

1297
02:30:27,819 --> 02:30:29,958
Osgiliath burns!

1298
02:30:30,421 --> 02:30:31,681
Mordor has come.

1299
02:30:32,991 --> 02:30:35,101
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1300
02:30:36,728 --> 02:30:38,658
It has only the power to destroy.

1301
02:30:39,831 --> 02:30:41,091
Please...

1302
02:30:41,432 --> 02:30:42,862
..let me go.

1303
02:30:44,102 --> 02:30:45,502
Hurry.

1304
02:30:49,207 --> 02:30:50,437
Faramir!

1305
02:30:50,775 --> 02:30:52,945
You must let me go!

1306
02:30:53,711 --> 02:30:56,731
And those little family of field mice...

1307
02:30:57,315 --> 02:30:59,745
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1308
02:31:00,818 --> 02:31:03,717
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they....

1309
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:17,880
Many of these trees were my friends.

1310
02:31:18,970 --> 02:31:23,010
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1311
02:31:24,776 --> 02:31:25,826
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1312
02:31:26,144 --> 02:31:28,574
They had voices of their own.

1313
02:31:31,149 --> 02:31:33,399
Saruman.

1314
02:31:34,052 --> 02:31:36,742
A wizard should know better!

1315
02:31:51,402 --> 02:31:54,592
There is no curse in Elvish...

1316
02:31:55,273 --> 02:31:57,582
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1317
02:31:58,109 --> 02:32:00,099
...for this treachery.

1318
02:32:01,479 --> 02:32:05,229
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1319
02:32:05,917 --> 02:32:08,226
...With rock and stone.

1320
02:32:32,510 --> 02:32:33,470
Yes.

1321
02:32:34,746 --> 02:32:36,006
Come, my friends.

1322
02:32:37,515 --> 02:32:41,205
The Ents are going to war.

1323
02:32:41,886 --> 02:32:43,436
It is likely...

1324
02:32:43,821 --> 02:32:46,921
..that we go to our doom.

1325
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:50,930
Last march...

1326
02:32:51,763 --> 02:32:53,543
...of the Ents.

1327
02:33:41,913 --> 02:33:45,193
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1328
02:33:45,817 --> 02:33:47,626
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1329
02:33:50,655 --> 02:33:51,945
Mr. Frodo?

1330
02:33:52,423 --> 02:33:56,023
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1331
02:33:56,694 --> 02:33:58,884
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1332
02:34:13,478 --> 02:34:14,707
Take them to my father.

1333
02:34:16,447 --> 02:34:19,077
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1334
02:34:21,853 --> 02:34:24,512
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1335
02:34:26,057 --> 02:34:28,427
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1336
02:34:29,393 --> 02:34:31,823
You want to know
why your brother died?

1337
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:35,910
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1338
02:34:36,534 --> 02:34:38,204
He tried to kill him!

1339
02:34:38,603 --> 02:34:40,652
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1340
02:34:41,739 --> 02:34:43,378
Watch out!

1341
02:34:54,519 --> 02:34:55,509
Mr. Frodo?

1342
02:34:58,289 --> 02:34:59,839
They're here.

1343
02:35:03,161 --> 02:35:05,331
They've come.

1344
02:35:08,199 --> 02:35:09,869
NazgAdl!

1345
02:35:32,256 --> 02:35:34,155
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1346
02:35:36,227 --> 02:35:38,187
Take cover!

1347
02:35:55,813 --> 02:35:57,183
The fortress is taken.

1348
02:35:58,149 --> 02:35:59,198
It is over.

1349
02:35:59,517 --> 02:36:02,917
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1350
02:36:03,554 --> 02:36:06,134
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1351
02:36:09,227 --> 02:36:10,457
They're breaking in!

1352
02:36:13,264 --> 02:36:15,454
They're past the door!

1353
02:36:19,136 --> 02:36:22,736
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1354
02:36:25,943 --> 02:36:27,643
Is there no other way?

1355
02:36:29,447 --> 02:36:32,137
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1356
02:36:33,184 --> 02:36:35,114
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1357
02:36:40,258 --> 02:36:42,368
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1358
02:36:42,827 --> 02:36:45,347
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.

1359
02:36:47,865 --> 02:36:50,855
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1360
02:36:55,973 --> 02:36:57,233
Ride out with me.

1361
02:37:01,445 --> 02:37:02,875
Ride out and meet them.

1362
02:37:03,848 --> 02:37:05,748
For death and glory.

1363
02:37:06,183 --> 02:37:07,413
For Rohan.

1364
02:37:09,086 --> 02:37:10,376
For your people.

1365
02:37:11,289 --> 02:37:12,989
The sun is rising.

1366
02:37:17,728 --> 02:37:20,357
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

1367
02:37:20,898 --> 02:37:22,127
At dawn...

1368
02:37:22,466 --> 02:37:23,956
...l00k to the east.

1369
02:37:28,406 --> 02:37:29,806
Yes.

1370
02:37:32,510 --> 02:37:33,970
Yes.

1371
02:37:35,513 --> 02:37:37,623
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1372
02:37:38,082 --> 02:37:40,542
... Shall sound in the Deep...

1373
02:37:41,319 --> 02:37:43,069
...one last time.

1374
02:37:43,487 --> 02:37:44,796
Yes!

1375
02:37:48,025 --> 02:37:51,365
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1376
02:37:59,637 --> 02:38:00,717
Fell deeds, awake.

1377
02:38:02,106 --> 02:38:03,036
Now for wrath...

1378
02:38:03,374 --> 02:38:06,364
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1379
02:38:13,818 --> 02:38:15,808
Forth Eorlingas!

1380
02:39:03,834 --> 02:39:04,914
Gandalf.

1381
02:39:12,376 --> 02:39:15,596
Théoden King stands alone.

1382
02:39:16,647 --> 02:39:18,547
Not alone.

1383
02:39:19,216 --> 02:39:20,206
Rohirrim!

1384
02:39:26,257 --> 02:39:27,277
.
Eomer.

1385
02:39:27,591 --> 02:39:29,811
To the king!

1386
02:40:47,838 --> 02:40:49,358
Yes!

1387
02:40:58,749 --> 02:41:01,708
A hit. A fine hit.

1388
02:41:26,710 --> 02:41:28,880
Break the dam!

1389
02:41:29,346 --> 02:41:32,366
Release the river!

1390
02:42:00,077 --> 02:42:02,476
Pippin! Hold on!

1391
02:42:08,085 --> 02:42:10,664
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1392
02:42:52,396 --> 02:42:54,176
What are you doing?

1393
02:43:02,973 --> 02:43:04,313
Where are you going?

1394
02:44:02,666 --> 02:44:03,836
It's me.

1395
02:44:06,537 --> 02:44:08,437
It's your Sam.

1396
02:44:13,077 --> 02:44:15,386
Don't you know your Sam?

1397
02:44:33,430 --> 02:44:36,390
I can't do this, Sam.

1398
02:44:37,701 --> 02:44:39,451
I know.

1399
02:44:40,738 --> 02:44:42,787
It's all wrong.

1400
02:44:43,841 --> 02:44:45,591
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1401
02:44:53,283 --> 02:44:55,123
But we are.

1402
02:45:01,725 --> 02:45:04,385
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1403
02:45:04,928 --> 02:45:07,038
The ones that really mattered.

1404
02:45:08,365 --> 02:45:10,994
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1405
02:45:11,535 --> 02:45:14,164
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1406
02:45:14,705 --> 02:45:17,285
... because how could the end be happy?

1407
02:45:20,210 --> 02:45:22,140
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

1408
02:45:22,579 --> 02:45:24,309
...when so much bad had happened?

1409
02:45:25,149 --> 02:45:27,108
Victory!

1410
02:45:27,551 --> 02:45:29,600
We have victory!

1411
02:45:31,622 --> 02:45:35,192
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...

1412
02:45:35,859 --> 02:45:37,119
... this shadow.

1413
02:45:37,461 --> 02:45:40,151
Even darkness must pass.

1414
02:45:40,697 --> 02:45:42,837
A new day will come.

1415
02:45:44,001 --> 02:45:47,781
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

1416
02:45:50,007 --> 02:45:52,087
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

1417
02:45:52,543 --> 02:45:53,913
... that meant something.

1418
02:45:54,311 --> 02:45:56,921
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1419
02:45:58,215 --> 02:46:01,525
But I think, Mr. Frodo, do understand.

1420
02:46:02,152 --> 02:46:03,642
{ know now.

1421
02:46:04,788 --> 02:46:06,718
Folk in those stories...

1422
02:46:07,157 --> 02:46:10,786
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1423
02:46:11,462 --> 02:46:13,421
They kept going...

1424
02:46:14,364 --> 02:46:17,234
... because they were holding
on to something.

1425
02:46:19,236 --> 02:46:21,256
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1426
02:46:33,517 --> 02:46:36,976
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1427
02:46:37,621 --> 02:46:39,930
And it's worth fighting for.

1428
02:47:07,117 --> 02:47:10,897
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1429
02:47:12,155 --> 02:47:15,635
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1430
02:47:16,293 --> 02:47:18,223
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1431
02:47:22,866 --> 02:47:24,096
Then it is forfeit.

1432
02:47:27,037 --> 02:47:28,587
Release them.

1433
02:47:39,383 --> 02:47:43,953
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1434
02:47:51,728 --> 02:47:54,357
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1435
02:47:55,399 --> 02:47:58,499
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1436
02:48:04,041 --> 02:48:07,061
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1437
02:48:08,445 --> 02:48:11,285
... somewhere in the wilderness.

1438
02:48:14,985 --> 02:48:17,975
l wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1439
02:48:18,555 --> 02:48:19,755
What?

1440
02:48:20,090 --> 02:48:23,570
l wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1441
02:48:24,227 --> 02:48:27,097
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1442
02:48:27,664 --> 02:48:30,244
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1443
02:48:30,767 --> 02:48:32,226
"Yes, my boy.

1444
02:48:32,603 --> 02:48:35,943
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1445
02:48:36,607 --> 02:48:38,797
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1446
02:48:39,309 --> 02:48:40,979
"Samwise the Brave."

1447
02:48:41,378 --> 02:48:43,778
l want to hear more about Sam.

1448
02:48:48,418 --> 02:48:51,047
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1449
02:48:52,756 --> 02:48:56,296
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
was being serious.

1450
02:48:57,894 --> 02:48:59,094
So was I.

1451
02:49:08,105 --> 02:49:10,445
"Samwise the Brave."

1452
02:49:15,078 --> 02:49:16,248
Sméagol?

1453
02:49:16,580 --> 02:49:19,130
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1454
02:49:19,650 --> 02:49:21,350
Master.

1455
02:49:21,752 --> 02:49:24,362
Master looks after us.

1456
02:49:25,489 --> 02:49:27,948
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1457
02:49:28,458 --> 02:49:30,628
Master broke his promise.

1458
02:49:31,094 --> 02:49:32,993
Don't ask Sméagol.

1459
02:49:33,430 --> 02:49:36,240
Poor, poor Sméagol.

1460
02:49:36,800 --> 02:49:39,289
Master betrayed us.

1461
02:49:39,836 --> 02:49:42,526
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1462
02:49:43,106 --> 02:49:46,536
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1463
02:49:47,177 --> 02:49:49,577
Kill him! Kill him!

1464
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:51,370
Kill them both!

1465
02:49:51,748 --> 02:49:54,938
And then we take the precious...

1466
02:49:55,552 --> 02:49:58,652
...and we be the master!

1467
02:49:59,756 --> 02:50:02,096
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1468
02:50:02,592 --> 02:50:04,932
Eyes always watching.

1469
02:50:05,429 --> 02:50:08,559
Then we stabs them out.

1470
02:50:09,166 --> 02:50:13,116
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1471
02:50:13,870 --> 02:50:16,890
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1472
02:50:17,507 --> 02:50:19,847
Kill them both.

1473
02:50:20,377 --> 02:50:22,547
Yes. No! No!

1474
02:50:23,046 --> 02:50:26,296
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1475
02:50:27,451 --> 02:50:29,731
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1476
02:50:30,220 --> 02:50:32,500
-Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
-Sméagol?

1477
02:50:32,989 --> 02:50:37,739
We could let her do it.

1478
02:50:39,362 --> 02:50:42,991
Yes. She could do it.

1479
02:50:43,667 --> 02:50:47,677
Yes, precious, she could.

1480
02:50:48,438 --> 02:50:53,708
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1481
02:50:55,412 --> 02:50:57,902
Once they're dead.

1482
02:51:02,586 --> 02:51:05,836
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1483
02:51:06,456 --> 02:51:08,266
Sméagol will show you the way.

1484
02:51:08,692 --> 02:51:10,651
Follow me.
