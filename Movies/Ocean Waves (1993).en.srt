THE OCEAN WAVES

00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:10,723
“Thank you for your patience,
the plane is about to take off.”

7
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:23,516
Yutaka and! first met Rikako
two years ago.

8
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,684
it was the summer
of our junior year.

9
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,772
Yutaka called me at work.

10
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,217
Hurry up kid!
More dishes! Keep'em coming!

11
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,813
OK!

12
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,082
Taku, telephone!

13
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,465
Coming.

14
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,238
Hello.

15
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,343
- Taku?
- Hey, Yutaka.

16
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,699
Come to school
as soon as you finish today.

17
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,112
i be here waiting for you.

18
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,829
OK.

19
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,498
Sorry. have to leave
early today.

20
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,432
Now wait a minute!

21
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,078
See you tomorrow!

22
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,780
You can't rely on kids!

23
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,553
See you!

24
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,333
Yutaka!

25
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,111
You got here fast.

26
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,786
You told me to!

27
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,954
Take a look.

28
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,653
Who is it? l can’t see.

29
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,969
Just transferred to my class.

30
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,659
Her name's Rikako Muto.

31
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,660
- From next semester?
- Yeah.

32
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,386
A mid-year transfer?
That's unusual.

33
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,546
She moved here
from Tokyo, that's why.

34
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,647
[ just showed her
around the school.

35
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,927
That's right,
you're on the student council.

36
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,447
You really like her, huh?

37
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,459
Anyone would,
she's really good looking.

38
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:47,813
Really?

39
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,700
l can't tell, and we can't just
walk down and look.

40
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,159
If you want,
we can go down...

41
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,182
...and say we have a question.

42
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,094
Nah, let's not
go that far.

43
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,858
The teachers know
I'm working this summer...

44
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,211
...and not taking classes.

45
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,977
Still mad about
the jr. high school trip?

46
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,988
I don't like the way
they just cancelled it...

47
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,452
...and tried to buy us off
with Hawaii in high school.

48
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,071
Do they think we're stupid?

49
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:28,296
Everyone's excited.
l think it was a good move.

50
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,549
A relaxing trip will help us
cram for college entrance exams.

51
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:40,917
Hawaii's expensive.
I need to make some money.

52
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:46,476
Just remember to keep up
with your studies.

53
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,223
Don't fall behind.

54
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,471
Sure. By the way...

55
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:53,595
...was there something
you wanted to talk about?

56
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,907
Not really.
I just felt like seeing you.

57
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,974
I'll get my bike.
Wait by the gate.

58
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,327
All through jr. high school
and high school...

59
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,227
... Yutaka and!
were never in the same class.

60
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,762
Even so, ! always felt
he was a close friend.

61
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,165
it all started in our last year
of jr. high school...

62
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:28,397
...When the school trip to Kyoto was
suddenly cancelled.

63
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:32,892
“We regret to announce
that this year's jr. high school trip...”

64
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,756
“..bas been cancelled.”

65
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:40,248
‘In future. jr. high and high school
trips will be combined.”

66
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,982
“Last year, our college
placement results...”

67
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,263
“... were lower than the
prefectural high school.”

68
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,885
“Our school's proud traditions
and your obligations to your parents...”

69
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,529
“..make this completely unacceptable. ”

70
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,178
“To restore our school's honor...”

71
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,587
“... the high school seniors
must redouble their efforts.”

72
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,175
“You must set an example
for our jr. high school seniors. ”

73
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,961
Let's go see Miss Sayama.
Come on, Taku!

74
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,448
The whole thing was so stupid...

75
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,627
...we decided to complain
to our home room teacher.

76
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,197
We all think this is unfair.

77
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,457
Canceling the trip
won't help our grades.

78
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,865
The school owes us
a detailed explanation.

79
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,046
Ask for one
when your grades are better!

80
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,311
I'm already a top student!

81
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:54,596
Don't pressure Miss Sayama
just because she's a woman!

82
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,254
We thought that was the end
of the matter.

83
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,301
But a week later,
at the morning assembly —

84
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:16,415
Your parents have also approved
the trip cancellation.

85
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:22,053
lf you're still not satisfied,
we'll explain the decision.

86
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,729
Raise your hand
if you're still not satisfied.

87
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,712
He's got guts.

88
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,275
it was Yutaka Matsuno.

89
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,257
OK.

90
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,453
We'll explain the decision for students
who raised their hands.

91
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,980
Go to the art room
after classes. Dismissed!

92

TAKU MORISAKI

95
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,607
THE TRIP CANCELLATION
MAKES NO SENSE.

96
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,199
IT'S ONLY TO MAKE THE TEACHERS
AND PARENTS FEEL BETTER.

97
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,923
Iran into Yamao
and the others just now.

98
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,890
They're sorry for not coming.

99
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,617
Don't hold it against them.

100
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,533
Those jerks...

3RD YEAR, CLASS 4
YUTAKA MATSUNO

102
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,291
[ CAN'T AGREE WITH THIS
UNREASONABLE DECISION.

103
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,074
EVEN 20 YEARS AFTER I GRADUATE...

104
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:41,194
LL STILL THINK
THE SCHOOL WAS WRONG.

105
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,573
Wow!

106
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,226
You're already thinking
20 years into the future.

107
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:03,301
After that, l always thought
of Yutaka...

108
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,367
...@ bit differently
from my other friends.

109
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,311
This is my friend Taku Morisaki.

110
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:39,165
This is Rikako Muto.
She's transferring to my class.

111
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,127
See you, then!

112
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,456
See you next semester.

113
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,843
What, you made your move already?!

114
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,890
Huh? No, she asked me
where the bookstore was.

115
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,084
She needs to buy her textbooks.

116
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,629
OBIYAMACHI MALL

117
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,924
The cook where I work is
this former gang member.

118
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,666
Sometimes his old habits come out...

119
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,911
... like, the way he smokes.

120
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,186
What?

121
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:38,204
Do you think there's something
behind her transfer?

122
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,488
Ah, so that's it!

123
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,298
That's the real reason
Yutaka wanted to see me.

124
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,165
Maybe her dad got transferred
or something like that.

125
00:12:59,112 --> 00:12:59,722
See you!

126
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,932
It really irritated me
when ! realized...

127
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,528
...that Yutaka was
interested in Rikako.

128
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,478
Better forget it!
Girls only care about looks.

129
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,106
i never thought
she'd see his real value.

130
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,949
When the new term started...

131
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:30,791
...Rikako was a bit of a sensation
with us simple country boys.

132
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,117
Hey Taku.
get a look at the girls!

133
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,671
Ariga, right?

134
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,458
l know, they're big.

135
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,964
No! The other court!

136
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,418
She's really cool.

137
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,559
She didn’t even break a sweat.

138
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,309
She's really something!

139
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,587
She plays like a pro!

140
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,407
Tokyo kids can really hit the ball!

141
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,207
- She stands out.
- Nice legs too!

142
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,915
Bet that type's hard to handle.

143
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,321
Rikako really stands out, huh?

144
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,739
I don't know why
you'd say that.

145
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,733
Hey, Yutaka!

146
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,358
Sorry.

147
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,963
Rikako's out of place in class.

148
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,819
I think it's because
she stands out too much.

149
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,117
Out of place, huh?

150
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,172
Yeah...in lots of ways.

151
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,408
RIKAKO MUTO

152
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,334
She really stands out, huh?

153
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,397
She's already 12th in the school!

154
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,867
Sports and study—
she's a super woman!

155
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,461
- Let's see Taku. you're...
- Number 92!

156
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,034
You were a better student
in jr. high.

157
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,199
What an attitude!

158
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,531
She's so stuck up!

159
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,299
That's enough!
Stop gossiping.

160
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,753
Time for class!

161
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,019
What's wrong?
Got a crush on Rikako?

162
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,566
No, but she doesn't seem
very happy.

163
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:15,077
Oh. come off it.
She's 12th in the school.

164
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,723
l hear you have a new student?

165
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,401
Yeah. Why?

166
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,577
l hear her grades are excellent.

167
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,323
Tokyo students really are top notch.

168
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,969
How did you hear?

169
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,155
They were talking about it in town.

170
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,294
Rikako's family
is related to the Mutos...

171
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,088
...0f Muto Fruit Packing.

172
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,028
Her mother moved back
for family reasons.

173
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,388
She brought
the two children with her.

174
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,293
Maybe her parents got divorced.

175
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,342
Is her father still in Tokyo?

176
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,291
l wonder.

177
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,424
I'm full.

178
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,978
Atsushi, mind your manners!

179
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,585
Poor Rikako.
With her grades...

180
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,038
... She'll just go back
to Tokyo for college.

181
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,831
Kids sure get jerked around.

182
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,018
Now don't talk like that!

183
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,950
A mother needs
her children with her!

184
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,026
You don't need
to get upset about it.

185
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,337
Relocating is a tough decision!

186
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,899
She can't leave them
behind just for school!

187
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,103
[t's natural for her
to want them with her!

188
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,566
Speaking from experience, huh?

189
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:02,051
Now you be nice to Rikako!

190
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,368
She must be having
a hard time adjusting.

191
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,341
Sure, sure.

192
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,428
Taku!

193
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,499
Taku! Telephone!

194
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,415
OK!

195
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,003
Hello? Hey, Yutaka.
What's going on?

196
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:56,937
Well...

197
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,770
What?

198
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,292
It's not really that important.

199
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,683
! visited Rikako today!

200
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,035
Where? At her house?

201
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,907
She was out sick.
! heard she lives alone.

202
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,034
! was worried.

203
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,903
She lives alone? Her mother's
house isn't that far from school.

204
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,226
And you went
to see her? Alone?

205
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,693
Yeah. And...she was
alone in bed!

206
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,671
She was in bed. So?

207
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,367
Nothing. That's it.

208
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:36,855
That's all.

209
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,444
So you like that kind of girl.
do you Yutaka?

210
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,580
The year ended,
and March came...

211
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,597
...and with it,
the long-awaited school trip.

212
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,177
Taku!

213
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,277
HAWAII

214
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,807
You're not going swimming?

215
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,670
Today's our last day!

216
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,641
I've had an upset stomach
all morning.

217
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,168
Too bad! See you, then!

218
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:22,644
So long.

219
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,500
And that's when
all the trouble started.

220
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,496
Taku!

221
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,149
Could you land me some money?

222
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,519
Money?

223
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,908
What happened?
Did you run out?

224
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,844
Well...not exactly.

225
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,353
I lost all the money
Il had with me!

226
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,327
That's awful!

227
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,786
Did you tell the teacher?

228
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,467
With traveler's checks.
you can get your money back.

229
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,080
I'll get in trouble.

230
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,539
Don't be silly!
You've got to report it!

231
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,304
I'm sorry. Your Kochi dialect
reminds me of samurai movies.

232
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,986
Want to sit down?

233
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,914
Let me tell you what happened.

234
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:37,672
I mostly brought cash. Travelers
checks are a pain, right? So...

235
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,976
Cash? You mean dollars?

236
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,549
Right, about $400 in cash.

237
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,368
I must have left it somewhere.

238
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,995
We were supposed to bring
less than ¥20,000 in cash!

239
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,280
The rest was supposed
to be traveler's checks.

240
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,714
Nobody really does that!

241
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,698
You sound like
one of the teachers!

242
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,172
Are you a goody-goody?

243
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,895
Too bad.
l heard you were different.

244
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,556
Your Tokyo dialect
sounds so harsh!

245
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,429
Why? I'm not angry!

246
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,963
And I'm not a samurai!

247
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,054
You're mean, Taku.

248
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,702
Nobody ever called me harsh.

249
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,984
Is that how I sound?

250
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,007
Yeah, Everyone thinks so.

251
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:38,386
But they're afraid you'll say
they sound like samurai.

252
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,333
OK, I'm sorry.

253
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,596
[ didn't mean
to make fun of you.

254
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,122
You hear dialects in dramas, right?

255
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,924
l thought dialects were all gone.

256
00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:00,973
But Kochi people really talk that way.
l was shocked.

257
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,741
Still. [never told anyone
l felt that way, till today.

258
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,020
You'd better not!

259
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,688
At first 1 couldn't
understand a word.

260
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:15,108
l kept asking people
to say things twice.

261
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,191
Maybe that's why nobody likes me.

262
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,482
Who doesn't like you?

263
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:25,204
Everybody. boys especially.
Nobody talks to me.

264
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,191
Well, except Yutaka, the class
representative. He's nice.

265
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,548
Yeah, Yutaka's a good guy.

266
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,721
Did he tell you about ma?

267
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,009
Yes. l saw you working
at the restaurant...

268
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,266
...during the winter vacation.

269
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,425
Yutaka was with me.
He said you work really hard.

270
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,943
Then he told me
a lot about you.

271
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,948
Like your protest
over the cancelled school trip.

272
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,100
He told you about that?

273
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:57,509
You must have a lot of
money from your job, right?

274
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,104
OK, how much?

275
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,629
What can you spare?

276
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,338
I brought about ¥60,000 and $400.

277
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,335
I haven't spent much.
How about $300?

278
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,516
Really? Then could you
lend me the ¥60, 000?

279
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,455
Wait here.

280
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,784
Sixty thousand yen!

281
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,774
Much obliged, Mr Morisaki!

282
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,913
Should I give it
to you right here?

283
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,060
You're pretty cautious.
OK. sit down right there.

284
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,916
Put it in this handkerchief
and hand it to me.

285
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,309
Feels like we're doing
something illegal!

286
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,588
] probably can't pay
you back right away.

287
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,349
I'm expecting some money, though.

288
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,465
Pay me back anytime.

289
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,337
Please don't tell anyone about this.

290
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,812
Sure, but why?

291
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,721
Mama would yell at me.

292
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,797
“Mama...”

293
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,172
What's her story?

294
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,443
Hey!

295
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:59,698
I'm surprised she knew
so much about me!

296
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:03,572
So you guys are friends.
Dating, huh?

297
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,143
That wasn't a date.

298
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,311
l ran into her over vacation.

299
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,420
l asked her to a movie—
and she said yes!

300
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,032
I couldn't think
of a thing to say.

301
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:20,298
We passed your restaurant,
so l started talking about you.

302
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:21,862
It really helped.

303
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,331
Maybe, but I just got hit
for a loan.

304
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,584
Rikako asked you for a loan?

305
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:32,163
Yeah. I walked by.
and she said she lost her money.

306
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,485
Maybe she remembered
l made money over the break.

307
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,831
So she lost all her money?
Poor thing!

308
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,925
- Want to walk around town?
- Sure.

309
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:49,211
Wait a sec.
I'll drop my stuff.

310
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,033
[ said not to tell!
You already told Yutaka!

311
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,571
Huh? What did he say?

312
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,623
He offered to land me money!

313
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,733
See?
Isn't he a good guy?

314
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,899
I borrowed ¥20.000...
but please keep this a secret!!

315
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,227
] hope you can remember this time!

316
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,344
How did her parents raise her?!

317
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:43,042
The next day we returned to Kochi...

318
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,272
...and I bought some candid shots
of Rikako from a friend.

319
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,916
! fait like getting even.

320
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,432
And thought that was it
for my bad feelings.

321
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,889
But next term,
we ended up in the same class.

322
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,668
Yumi, lunch!

323
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:13,706
Rikako finally made a friend—

324
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:20,111
—a quiet girl in the same class.
Her name was Yumi Kohama.

325
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,566
That was nice for her...

326
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,588
...but spring break came, and
I still didn't have my money.

327
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,063
! thought she'd forgotten it.

328
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:36,575
Taku, telephone!
It's Yumi Kohama!

329
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,672
Is that you Yumi?

330
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,024
Where are you calling from?

331
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,790
You're the only person
! could think of to call!

332
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,061
What's wrong?

333
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,395
We were going to Osaka
for two nights...

334
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,889
...for a concert.

335
00:28:56,535 --> 00:29:00,815
Now we're at the airport.
and Rikako says she’s going to Tokyo!

336
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,676
That was her plan all along!

337
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,596
She doesn't know I'm calling you.

338
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:07,805
Unbelievable!

339
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:11,673
She says there's no difference
where we go.

340
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,604
Rikako even bought
two tickets to Tokyo.

341
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,871
! don't want to lie
to my mother!

342
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,554
Look, calm down!
You don't have to go!

343
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:26,085
Just leave and let Rikako
go by herself.

344
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,437
} can't! Her mother let her go
because I'm with her!

345
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,529
She really wants me to go.
What should } do?

346
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,687
What should you do...?

347
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:40,582
Wait a minute!
Why are you asking ME?

348
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,586
She told me you lent her
the money for the tickets.

349
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,471
You're her friend.
Can't you convince her?

350
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:54,381
Please come to the airport.
Our flight is at 11:30.

351
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,323
We've got 90 minutes.

352
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,109
! really need you to coma!

353
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,963
That money again!

354
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,789
So she didn't really
lose her money. It was a lie!

355
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,466
It was just part of her plan
for this trip!

356
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,230
What a jerk!

357
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,243
KOCHI AIR TERMINAL

358
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:56,924
You came!

359
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,239
Where is she?

360
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,271
In the rest room.

361
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,533
Says she's not feeling well.

362
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,799
I wish she'd get worse.
Then we wouldn't have to go!

363
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,623
Anyway, she's way out of line!

364
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,850
You're her friend.
You should tell her of f!

365
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,130
She really wants to see her father.
1 feel sorry for her.

366
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,688
What about her father?

367
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,630
What are you doing here?
Did Yumi call you?

368
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:36,455
Rikako. let's not lie
about this trip!

369
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,485
Let's tell your mother.

370
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:40,817
She'd never let me go!

371
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,142
I've been planning
this for so long.

372
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,783
Wait a minute.
OK, how about this.

373
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:55,774
Yumi, call home.
Say you feel sick and can't go.

374
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,108
But...

375
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,059
And Rikako's going by herself...

376
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,435
... because it would be a shame
to waste both tickets.

377
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,189
Your parents
will only worry about you.

378
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,397
They won't think about Rikako.

379
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:14,629
You're right!
My mom doesn't know Rikako's mom.

380
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,107
She won't say anything.

381
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:18,959
OK. fine.

382
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,640
I'll call her!

383
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,552
Yumi's from a strict family.

384
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,453
She's not going to run
off to Tokyo just like that.

385
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,280
So, you're not feeling well?

386
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:45,736
My period just started.
Sometimes it's really bad.

387
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,388
It must be tough.

388
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:50,416
Boys don't know what it's like.

389
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,290
Do you really have to go?

390
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:58,513
I'll get your money from Papa.
Don't worry, I'll pay you.

391
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:09,006
If you're worried about going alone,
shall 1 go with you?

392
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,093
Really?
Would you really do that?

393
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,581
Hey, listen.

394
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,943
Your father knows
you're coming, right?

395
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,087
Is he meeting you?

396
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,512
No, ! doubt it.

397
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,281
Could he find a place
for me to stay?

398
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,936
Sure. I'll ask him,

399
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,773
When I see Papa.
I'm going to tell him.

400
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,691
l want to move back to Tokyo
and live with him,

401
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,738
“We are now in our final approach
to Haneda Airport.”

402
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:06,845
As I followed Rikako
around Tokyo, ! thought—

403
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,614
“she's done it to me again.”

404
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:14,274
But ! couldn't just let her go
to Tokyo by herself.

405
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,678
The cherry trees around here
are really nice.

406
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,275
My house is this way.

407
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:28,148
My grandparents used to live here.
This was all farm land.

408
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,804
They built apartments,
and we got the nicest one.

409
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:38,572
It was big. even for four of us.
I bet Papa's lonely.

410
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,607
He'll be glad to see you.

411
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,750
It's good to be back.

412
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,755
Who is it?

413
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,629
Isn't this the Mutos?

414
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,608
Yes, that's right.

415
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,973
Umm...is Papa home?

416
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:11,009
ls that Rikako? I'll come down,
wait in the lobby!

417
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,422
What a surprise!
I didn't know you were coming.

418
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,102
Are you alone?

419
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:33,674
My boyfriend, from Kochi.

420
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,472
It's spring break.
We came to visit.

421
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,770
Oh really?
Thanks for looking after Rikako.

422
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,682
Shall we go for coffee?

423
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,020
I want to see my old room!
How's it look?

424
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,681
OK, let's go up.

425
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,906
I'm sorry...could you wait
here for a little while?

426
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,508
Sure,

427
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,560
Morisaki, thanks
for putting up with Rikako.

428
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:37,094
I hear you don't have a place to stay?
l made a reservation.

429
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:42,245
And Rikako owes you money.
Thank you very much.

430
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,065
! really felt sorry for her—
from the bottom of my heart.

431
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:00,251
GUIDE TO WEST SHINJUKU

432
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,049
Hi, Mom?

433
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,694
Taku? It's almost dinner time.
Come home.

434
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,687
Look, I can't make it tonight.

435
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:18,974
OK, we'll go ahead.
Don't be too late.

436
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,931
I'm in Tokyo.

437
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,609
Tokyo?! How did you get there?

438
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,412
I took a plane
straight to Tokyo.

439
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:27,665
What?!

440
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,057
I'm escorting someone.

441
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,548
Escorting?! Who?

442
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,716
I'll be home in two days.

443
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,455
What's going on?!

444
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,007
Hello? Hello?

445
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,395
I'll explain later! Goodbye!

446
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:40,901
Taku! Wait!

447
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,160
Rikako!

448
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,262
What happened?

449
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:57,591
I'm staying here tonight.
Papa's paying, so l can if ] want.

450
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,145
Hey...

451
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:21,127
The whole thing was starting
to feel like a bad soap opera.

452
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,743
Want some beer, Rikako?

453
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,942
No? We drink it sometimes
when no one’s around.

454
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,494
Make me a rum and coke.

455
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,467
Il tried them at a friend's house.

456
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:02,212
Papa's going on a trip with his
lady friend for the holidays.

457
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:05,524
Well, it IS spring vacation.

458
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,294
My room was completely changed!

459
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,741
The wallpaper's dark green!

460
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,294
l hate green!

461
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:17,305
You're right.
Green's no good!

462
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,769
All the pots are fancy enamelware.
It's so stupid.

463
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,513
Nobody uses enamelware anymore!

464
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,027
Listen. Taku.

465
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,599
When my parents were fighting,
] thought Mama was wrong.

466
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,739
She wouldn't give in,
so Papa didn't either.

467
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,954
It ended in a bad divorce.

468
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,413
My brother and I had to move
and leave all our friends.

469
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,052
l was on Papa's side.

470
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,409
But he wasn't on my side.

471
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,425
On your side? Wait...

472
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,567
My life is so sad.

473
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,043
Things must be tough,
but you should help your mother.

474
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,908
You shouldn't be living by yourself.

475
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,418
I didn't want to impose
on Mama's family.

476
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,363
] wasn’t mad at her.

477
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,915
Well, that's different.

478
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,733
It's none of your business.

479
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,990
“Good evening.”

480
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,695
“How are you spending
the spring holidays?”

481
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,575
Ouch!

482
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,600
She's having a tough time?
What about me?

483
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,742
Taku!

484
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,188
Get up!

485
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:30,834
It's about time.
l was waiting to use the bathroom.

486
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,603
l had to go downstairs!

487
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,026
Sorry...

488
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,510
Could you leave for a while?

489
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,069
I'm meeting someone.
I need to dress.

490
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:42,426
Your father?

491
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,687
A high school friend.
I called this morning.

492
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,814
We're meeting downstairs.

493
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,429
That's great.

494
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:53,303
I need to shower and change.
Hurry up and leave.

495
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:03,190
! think this was when I decided
to attend college in Tokyo.

496
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:12,889
Seeing Rikako bounce back somehow
made me feel at ease here.

497
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:22,616
Good timing. My friend just called,
we're meeting in the lobby.

498
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,497
- Oh. really?
- See you, then!

499
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,648
What about the key?
Are you going out?

500
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,962
No, I'll take a nap.

501
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,777
Really? Sorry!

502
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,696
Don't worry.
Enjoy yourself.

503
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,644
Hello?

504
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,935
Taku, could you come
down to the coffee shop?

505
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,808
What happened?
Forget your wallet?

506
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:06,611
Just come down!
You're rescuing me.

507
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,020
So, what is it this time?

508
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,750
Taku, over here!

509
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,669
This is Taku Morisaki.

510
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:37,202
He was worried about me.
so he came along.

511
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,115
Taku, this is Okada,
my former classmate.

512
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:41,932
Hi.

513
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,180
Rikako. a boyfriend already?
What a shock!

514
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,942
Look who's talking.
As soon as I left...

515
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,475
... you got together with Ryoko.

516
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:56,202
! feel kind of betrayed!

517
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,077
But you're prettier.
Ryoko says so too.

518
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,250
She says she can’t compete.

519
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,833
Listen. Taku.

520
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,718
Wouldn't YOU be shocked?
date Okada for a year...

521
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:12,319
...and two months after I leave,
he's dating a friend of mine!

522
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,004
Happens all the time.

523
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,248
Nothing surprises him either!

524
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,740
I called Ryoko. Are you free?

525
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:28,883
Why don't we all see a movie?
Like a double date.

526
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:33,853
I'd like to, but...

527
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,199
...Papa's treating me to
lunch this afternoon.

528
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,430
Too bad. If we'd known you were
coming, we could've made plans.

529
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,868
But your mother’s not very fair.

530
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:52,115
She could've left you in Tokyo.
You're going to college here anyway.

531
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:57,361
She had to drag her children
off to the country.

532
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:02,397
What are you talking about?
She's not a child!

533
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,129
What's wrong, Taku?

534
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:10,741
You're a bore, that's what!
You and this guy both!

535
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:19,033
He must be jealous of me.
Sorry about that.

536
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,005
! was disappointed.

537
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:31,614
In Kochi Rikako seemed so strong, but
she gets to Tokyo and all she does...

538
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:35,352
...is put on a big show and
fawn over a stupid guy.

539
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:41,685
Rikako?

540
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,020
Okada says to tell you
he's not mad.

541
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,155
That guy's really dumb.

542
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:57,398
When we were dating ] thought
he was kind and thoughtful.

543
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,975
I called you because
l wanted to show off.

544
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:06,234
Afterwards I just felt stupid.

545
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:10,252
We're really bores—
him and me both.

546
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,988
Well. 1 can see you'd be shocked
about his new girlfriend.

547
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,736
You don’t get it, Taku.

548
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:22,692
l was shocked because
he wasn't like ] remembered.

549
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,398
All he talked about was himself.

550
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:31,331
He didn't even ask about Kochi.
But that's his real personality.

551
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,346
I just never noticed.

552
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,529
lll stay at my aunt's tonight.

553
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,965
We shouldn't stay
in the same room anyway.

554
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,538
Let's meet at the airport tomorrow.

555
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,578
Our Tokyo trip
wasn’t much fun, was it?

556
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:58,171
In half an hour,
Rikako seemed to have grown up.

557
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,897
Yumi, what's this?

558
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,299
Do you want one?

559
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:09,203
After the holidays,
Rikako ignored me...

560
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,650
...Just as if nothing had happened.

561
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:16,794
As usual, her only friend
was Yumi Kohama.

562
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:37,287
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not worried about you...

563
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,444
...but you're going to end up
without any friends.

564
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,957
Try to be a little more...

565
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:44,344
Leave me alone!

566
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,480
How were your finals?

567
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:12,255
Awful. I'm going to cram school
in Osaka this summer.

568
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,653
Training camp, huh?

569
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,772
It'll be a nice change.

570
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,254
Listen...

571
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,176
Don't be upset, but...

572
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,531
...did you and Rikako
take a trip during vacation?

573
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,677
Yeah, we did.
How did you know?

574
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,050
How do you think?
The rumor’s all over school.

575
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,351
Haven't you heard?

576
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,763
No, I haven't.

577
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,538
That's just like you.

578
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,060
Nobody wants to joke about it
to your face.

579
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:48,951
People are whispering.

580
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:52,126
Listen, I don't know
what people are saying.

581
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,620
Rikako just went
to see her father.

582
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:56,756
Yeah, I heard.

583
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,728
From who?
Did Yumi tell you?

584
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:03,861
Yumi? Why her?
l heard it straight from Rikako.

585
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:10,243
I ran into her on the way
home and asked her.

586
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,696
What, that story again?

587
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,905
Yes, I stayed with Taku
in a Tokyo hotel!

588
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,549
What's that got
to do with you?

589
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,256
‘m..

590
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,824
I'm in love with you.

591
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,089
Look—

592
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,366
Il hate Kochi, and boys
who speak Kochi dialect!

593
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:50,636
Don't say that to me!
It makes me sick!

594
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,745
“Sick,” huh?

595
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:06,154
Yeah. It was kind of tough.

596
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:08,714
Is that what
did your grades in?

597
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,233
I'll get back on track
over summer.

598
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,540
Now she's gone too far!

599
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:19,238
Taku!

600
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,810
Red or white?

601
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,058
Red!

602
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:31,363
I've gotta talk to you.
Let's go!

603
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:33,983
What?!

604
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,009
What's the problem?

605
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,765
Don't talk to me in school!
People will notice.

606
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,965
You told Yutaka
we stayed in a hotel in Tokyo?

607
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:57,524
So what?

608
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:01,595
It was all your idea!
But people are pointing at ME!

609
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,127
Why. you... !

610
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:08,108
I'm suffering thanks to you.
You're the worst, you really are.

611
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,357
You're such a loyal friend!
Satisfied?

612
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,727
That trip to Tokyo...

613
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:34,207
... really was a total disaster
for both of us.

614
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,999
And so autumn came.

615
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,110
Rikako was as isolated as aver.

616
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:04,278
But her grades
just got better and better.

617
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:11,276
Then, during the last event of
senior year — the school fair...

618
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,275
Sanuki udon noodles!

619
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:20,172
She didn't come today either!

620
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,390
Probably won't come
to the dance performance.

621
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,736
She missed all the rehearsals.

622
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,130
Probably thinks it's stupid!

623
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:32,191
She cuts group events to raise
her grades! Can you believe it?

624
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,551
Let's tell her off!

625
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:37,383
How about tomorrow?

626
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,449
Excuse me...

627
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:41,144
Welcome!

628
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,175
“Announcement from
the Organizing Committee.”

629
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:46,845
“Today's final program
is Dance Paradise.”

630
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:50,864
“Classes finished with cleanup
should assemble in the courtyard.”

631
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:56,888
‘lL repeat. Classes finished
with cleanup should assemble...”

632
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,581
Is that all?
I'm in a hurry!

633
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:02,858
What? What did you say?

634
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,643
In a hurry? Don't you care
about class harmony?

635
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:11,271
Class harmony? You sound like some
stupid politician!

636
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,589
You're wrapped up in yourself.
What about the rest of the world?

637
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,680
What kind of world is it where people
can't think of themselves?

638
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:24,307
Does the world care about me?
I'll take care of myself!

639
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,478
You pretend you're not interested in boys.
but I see you flirting!

640
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:31,123
Making eyes at Yanagida!

641
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:32,238
Yanagida?!

642
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:35,507
I don't even know who he is!

643
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,603
Bring him here!
I'll tell him ] hate him!

644
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,154
Stop it!

645
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,699
You'll just hurt your school record.

646
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:51,903
No point crying
because of someone like this.

647
00:53:58,535 --> 00:53:59,734
We won't forget this!

648
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:11,392
[ think 1 expected
too much from you.

649
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,261
Taku! How long
have you been there?

650
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,076
I'm just throwing this out.
l heard voices.

651
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,500
Good for you.
You stood up to all those girls.

652
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,183
Even made one of them cry.

653
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,161
It was really impressive.

654
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,840
You idiot! You're the worst!

655
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:11,394
Hey!

656
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:18,598
Rikako just ran by.
I think she was crying.

657
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:25,303
Oh. she just got bullied
by the girls in our class.

658
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,659
She cut all the activities.

659
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:32,258
But she really stood up to them.
They couldn't touch her.

660
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:36,000
That Rikako, she's tough.
It was really something.

661
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,480
You didn't stop them?

662
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:44,136
They'd have just told me
to butt out. They're fed up.

663
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:47,049
She can be a real pain.

664
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:53,632
You idiot!

665
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:17,143
! figured Yutaka and I would
be back to normal by next day.

666
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:20,218
At least, that's what! thought.

667
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:26,515
But we graduated
without speaking again.

668
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:32,452
Rikako enrolled at Kochi University.
Yutaka went to Kyoto...

669
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,160
...and f went
to college in Tokyo.

670
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:43,355
“We have just landed at Kochi Airport.”

671
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,117
KOCHI AIR TERMINAL

672
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,877
Hey, Taku!

673
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,371
Yutaka!

674
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,589
Thanks for picking me up.

675
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:17,551
Sure. I got my license
last month.

676
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,981
I'm impressed you found the time
to take lassons.

677
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:25,865
Took me two months
just to get used to Tokyo.

678
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:28,406
Another month for my job.

679
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:31,433
Before I knew it, summer came.

680
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,642
Tokyo and Kyoto are really different.

681
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:38,275
Kyoto's almost like Kochi.
Il settled in right away.

682
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,929
But Kochi's nice.
It's not crowded.

683
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:48,959
And everything you need
is right at hand.

684
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:54,383
Tokyo's got everything, but
it takes an hour to get anywhere.

685
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,542
Even Katsura Beach's
only an hour from here.

686
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:02,506
Jingu Stadium's an hour,
with train transfers.

687
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,830
An hour from Kyoto...

688
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:07,642
... you can get to Osaka or Nara.

689
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,638
Gosh, sounds like Kyoto's better.

690
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:20,416
Want to come in?

691
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,474
I'll pass for today.
Your family must be waiting.

692
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,495
See you at the reunion?

693
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:34,451
l always wanted to apologize.
Sorry ] punched you.

694
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:38,895
Ah, so that explains
the free ride from the airport!

695
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,645
I'll call you.

696
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:45,444
Want to take a walk?

697
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:48,651
It's been a while.

698
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,908
l was angry that time...

699
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,107
...because I knew you were
holding back on my account.

700
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,991
l hadn't noticed till then...

701
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,549
...that you really liked Rikako.

702
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:09,494
Yutaka and! spent an hour
there — then we went home.

703
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,124
PRIVATE PARTY

704
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:27,117
You're living in Osaka?
I'm close — Kobe!

705
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:28,454
Have a drink!

706
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:29,587
Thank you...

707
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:34,595
It's ridiculous!
I can't even resign from a club...

708
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,502
...unless the alumni approve.

709
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,065
So, I went
to Disneyland with him.

710
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,501
We missed the last train.

711
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,600
What happened??

712
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:49,174
I thought I was joining a ski club,
not a religious group!

713
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:52,686
They keep telephoning me.
It's driving me nuts!

714
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,172
Better watch the drinking, Yamao.

715
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:02,491
She's late...

716
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,509
Late? Who?

717
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,738
She's late...

718
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,460
Scoot over more!

719
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:12,922
What's happening?

720
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,230
Yamamoto just confessed.

721
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,180
He always liked Nishimura!

722
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:21,774
Good for him.

723
01:01:23,914 --> 01:01:25,374
We've got a new couple!

724
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,299
Time for me to confess too!

725
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,208
I've always had a thing
for Yumi Kohama!

726
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:45,239
Well done, Yamao.
That's the spirit.

727
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:46,868
What did Yumi say?

728
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:48,597
She's not here yet!

729
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:55,363
From the start, she was always
in that flashy Rikako’s shadow.

730
01:01:56,146 --> 01:02:00,016
While you were mooning over Rikako,
l had my eye on Yuni.

731
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,200
What's that supposed to mean?

732
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:09,862
Come on, now.
Shall we go to men's room?

733
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,790
Hey, Yamao! Are you OK?

734
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,845
Maybe Rikako’s not coming after all.

735
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:32,105
Rikako said she regrets
the things she said to you.

736
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:41,795
Well, he's passed out.

737
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:44,729
You're really looking good, Shimizu.

738
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,471
Thanks.

739
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:49,926
Of course, Rikako was always pretty,
but she's even prettier now.

740
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,348
Shimizu told me she saw Rikako.

741
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,182
Rikako's not here!

742
01:02:57,474 --> 01:03:00,694
I ran into her yesterday,
in the department store.

743
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:03,651
l told her about the reunion...

744
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,690
...but she's probably flown home.

745
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,290
Flown?

746
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,961
Rikako went back to Tokyo?

747
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:17,851
Yeah. I'd always thought
she was in Kochi U.

748
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:22,292
She got into Kochi U
to please her mother.

749
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,558
But she secretly
tested for a Tokyo school too.

750
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,786
When you met her,
were you, like...

751
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:32,772
“Wow, it's great to see you.”
and stuff like that?

752
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:34,666
How'd you know?

753
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:37,663
Well. ] knew
you never liked her!

754
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:42,501
You're right, I never did.
l really hated her.

755
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,080
But seeing her again
made me feel nostalgic.

756
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:50,381
It's kind of like changing seats.

757
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,830
When you're little and have to sit
next to someone you hate...

758
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,961
... You don't even
want to go to school.

759
01:03:57,434 --> 01:04:01,334
The problem is.
your world is too small.

760
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:05,872
If you have something other than
school, like piano lessons...

761
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:09,726
...people you dislike
aren't a problem.

762
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,801
Let's sea. That means...

763
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:17,390
... you realize your world
was too small then?

764
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:19,751
And that's why
you went after Rikako?

765
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,340
We both had the same problem.

766
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,853
Rikako said her world
was really small, too.

767
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:35,264
Yumi!

768
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,612
Hey, Yumi!

769
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,450
Yumi?

770
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:43,072
Huh?

771
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:47,335
Yu... Yumi...?

772
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,911
Yumi!

773
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:50,976
Come on, Yamao!

774
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:52,477
Take it easy!

775
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,571
Yumi!

776
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,253
Hey! Come on!

777
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:13,194
Yoo-hoo!

778
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:21,162
What? You saw Rikako too?

779
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:24,545
Yes. ! wish Rikako had come.

780
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,391
It felt like she was there.

781
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:28,494
Me too.

782
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,151
That reminds me...

783
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,800
...She said there's someone
in Tokyo she wants to see.

784
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,104
But she didn't say who.

785
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:39,976
It's someone who likes
to sleep in bathtubs!

786
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:49,069
I'd forgotten
just how pretty it was.

787
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:51,883
The castle!

788
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,121
! always thought
lighting up Kochi Castle...

789
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:04,691
... Was a waste of electricity.

790
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:09,101
But with Rikako next to me,
it would have been beautiful.

791
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:13,649
There were so many things
! wanted to talk to her about.

792
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:17,460
! wanted us to see the castle
together, like this.

793
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:20,347
Taku! Could you
lend me some money?

794
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:23,357
You sound like
one of the teachers!

795
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,893
Are you 2 goody-goody?

796
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,982
! heard you were different.

797
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,538
! said not to tell!
You already told Yutaka!

798
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:37,260
My period just started.
Sometimes it's really bad.

799
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:40,901
When ! see Papa,
I'm going to tell him.

800
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:44,451
I want to move to Tokyo
and live with him.

801
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:49,098
I'm staying here tonight.
Papa's paying, so! can if I want.

802
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:54,721
My room was completely changed!
The wallpaper's dark green!

803
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:59,822
1 was on Papa's side.
But he wasn't on my side.

804
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,676
We're bores — him and me both.

805
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,180
Our trip wasn't
much fun, was it?

806
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:08,896
You're such a loyal friend!
Satisfied?

807
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,404
You idiot! You're the worst!

808
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:15,842
There's someone in Tokyo
l want to see.

809
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:20,252
It's a guy who
likes to sleep in bathtubs!

810
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,688
And that's when I knew—

811
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:17,255
I'd always been crazy about her.
