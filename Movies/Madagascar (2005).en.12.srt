1
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,862
Here come the balloons.

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,876
We chose balloons

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,426
because we were thinking
of an airy and lighthearted movie.

4
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,131
I'm Eric Darnell.

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,569
And I'm Tom McGrath.
We're the co-directors of this movie.

6
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,981
They say talking about film
is like dancing about architecture,

7
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,480
but we'll do our best.

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,388
Comes Marty, the voice of Chris Rock,
doing a Tarzan yell.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,089
We actually found some
original Tarzan yells

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,139
and played them for Chris.

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,126
Even the original Tarzan yells
were manufactured.

12
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:44,174
- Nobody could actually do that.
- Not even Johnny Weissmuller.

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,934
I think he might have,
but it was all edited.

14
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,834
Chris did his best
and it came out pretty funny.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,180
Very funny.

16
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,434
Ben also does it a little later on,

17
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,957
which is quite a challenge to do.

18
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,104
It's always fun doing slow motion
in computer animation

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,810
because it has to be
animated in slow motion.

20
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,264
It's not like we animated at
normal speed and then slow it down.

21
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,268
Here comes the lion.

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,150
Ben Stiller, of course,
is the voice of Alex.

23
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,824
And we wake up right
in the heart of New York City.

24
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,387
Kendal Cronkhite and Shannon
did a great job

25
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,304
of kind of simplifying and idealizing
the Central Park Zoo,

26
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,408
which is a great location for us,

27
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,217
because it's smack dab
in the middle of Manhattan

28
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,443
and surrounded by
these wonderful skyscrapers.

29
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,678
If you look closely
at the environment,

30
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,444
it does look like New York City
.
In many ways.

31
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,657
It is stylized and modified somewhat,

32
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,867
but on a more detailed level

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,190
midpoint of not having any
parallel lines in New York City,

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,661
something we called
the whack factor,

35
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,214
which gave everything
just a bit of a style.

36
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,526
A little askew.

37
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,481
Sort of matched the style
of the design of our characters.

38
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:17,564
Plus we wanted to have
this opening in the fall.

39
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,418
And the art department
used this great muted palette,

40
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,982
kind of showing the city and
romanticizing it at the same time.

41
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,409
So when we went to Madagascar,
it'd just explode with color.

42
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:39,292
So it's sort of... we start the film
with this talky sequence

43
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,173
as we introduce these two characters.

44
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,492
And Ben and Chris
just both did a great job,

45
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:49,506
energizing this dialogue and giving
the animators material to work with

46
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,500
so we could keep it interesting.
Here goes Alex up on the wall.

47
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,520
It is great.
The animators had a great time

48
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,090
just pushing the movement like this

49
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,439
and finding these strong poses,
hitting them and sticking them

50
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,489
and staying on these poses
to kind of really push the attitudes.

51
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,147
Here comes the people.

52
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,322
There's the lion chasing the zebra,
a little joke on the clock.

53
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,675
So we go around the horn here.

54
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,461
We meet everybody,
just trying to set up their routine

55
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:29,135
and how Alex loves the routine
of performing for the crowds

56
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,236
and he's the most energetic

57
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,971
about the whole idea of being a star.

58
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,644
You see something
very normal and simple,

59
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:43,747
at least it looks simple, when you
look at that water that Gloria's in.

60
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,921
Every time we have
some organic thing like that,

61
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:52,655
water, wind, particles of dirt
or sand or whatever,

62
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,110
it's a big task for the effects
department to put that in.

63
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,500
Nothing's for free.

64
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,574
Crowds were very much
a huge challenge

65
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,946
and having all the variations
of people.

66
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,985
Here's our monkeys.

67
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,587
Conrad Vernon...

68
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,458
..actually the voice of
the gingerbread man in the Shrek film

69
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,798
is the voice of our monkey.

70
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,584
Mason, we call him.
Sounds like James Mason...

71
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,512
After James Mason, yeah.

72
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,768
A spit, just that water coming out.

73
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,654
Big task for some effects animators
to pull that off.

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,760
And they have to do spits
a lot in this movie.

75
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,666
We have about 50 spit takes,
I believe.

76
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,674
So here's where Hans comes in.

77
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,950
Hans Zimmer, our composer,
gave us some great music.

78
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,763
He found a theme for our characters
that he, you know, was playing here.

79
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,088
And he found a large number
of variations on that theme

80
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,431
that we could use later,
emotionally,

81
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,637
to really kind of hit the friendship
between Alex and Marty.

82
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,964
Masses of people,

83
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,092
huge challenge
for our crowd guys.

84
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,983
So this is really... we tried
to take a point of view

85
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,777
from the people
looking at the animals,

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,186
to set up the lives our characters
go through every day.

87
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,190
This is their normal routine.
We wanted to show that.

88
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,596
One of our best actors.

89
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,766
The highly trained Tom McGrath
as the voice of the Skipper.

90
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,746
Just kind of fell into it.
I'd voice it in pitches

91
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,340
and we actually wanted
someone like Robert Stack,

92
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,994
this tough guy
in a little penguin body.

93
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,953
Weill often do the voices
just to fill in

94
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,438
until we can get the actor in
and record them.

95
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,718
And Tom did the voice of the Skipper.

96
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,786
When it came time to cast,
we just figured Tom sounds good.

97
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,700
Let's keep him in there.

98
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,253
So Marty tried his best
to get into the routine,

99
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,609
find something different,
but it didn't quite do it for him.

100
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:34,133
Beautiful afternoon lighting,
almost magic-hour lighting here.

101
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,358
Nice warm glow
in the afternoon, fall feeling.

102
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,543
Originally, Marty was inspired
to go to the wild

103
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,947
by just his mural alone,

104
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,766
and then we found out
we could use these little guys,

105
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,048
these penguins escaping,
to plant the seed in his head

106
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,294
that there was something else
out there besides the zoo.

107
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,922
And it's just one
of the cases we found

108
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,458
we could use the penguins
throughout the film

109
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,363
to kind of be a little mirror

110
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,658
of wanting to find your roots,

111
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,133
the same thing
Marty's going through.

112
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,749
They go through
their own version of it.

113
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,681
He's explained it,

114
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,294
very clearly now, laid it out.

115
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,360
Chris Rock, very excited.

116
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,671
l always liked that joke.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,900
Marty's got some new ideas
to think about.

118
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,674
So you know, it's interesting.

119
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:20,122
To think that every time
you see anything on-screen,

120
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:24,227
somebody had to go in
and figure out how to make it,

121
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,171
get it up onto the screen,
what it should look like,

122
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,504
how it should move,
how it should feel.

123
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,653
With animation of, you know,

124
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,513
in any medium, nothing is for free.

125
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,884
in any medium, nothing is for free.

126
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,929
Everything that you see is on-screen.

127
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,711
It's like those fireworks,
those cheering crowds,

128
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,371
are all positioned and designed,

129
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,550
even these little elements
you see on-screen.

130
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,514
Obviously, for just seconds,

131
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:53,486
whether it's Gloria's fruit bowl
or Melman's medications,

132
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,287
are all designed from scratch

133
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,973
by artists and technicians

134
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,120
and put in place by animators
and given surfaces,

135
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,791
so that they reflect
the light properly.

136
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,897
And then lights are applied to them.

137
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,819
It's a huge undertaking
for just, you know,

138
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:17,036
every moment,
every second of film,

139
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:18,734
in a process like this.

140
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,783
It's one of the reasons that we do have
two directors for a movie like this,

141
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,365
or at least why we like
to do it that way,

142
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,620
is because there are just so many
decisions to be made every day,

143
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,458
not just about what
the characters say and do,

144
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,061
but what those bars
look like on that cage

145
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,493
or what the surface
of that tree should be.

146
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:44,304
Originally, with that monkey,
the teacup build,

147
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,564
originally we had a martini glass.

148
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,800
We decided we needed
to take that out.

149
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,006
- Make it more universal.
- More universal.

150
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,620
- Tea is much more universal.
- It works with his character too,

151
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,820
having a tea and
a teacup and saucer.

152
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,574
But, everything on, including
that whipped cream is a big ordeal

153
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,587
because it has to move with Marty's
mouth and feel like it's connected.

154
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,239
Marty just dropped the bomb
on his friends.

155
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,038
So this is a point in the film,
you know,

156
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,014
this scene, rewritten many times,

157
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,540
and how to best show
Marty's love for the wild

158
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,520
and what his dream is,
and we wanted to have it

159
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,148
in an intimate conversation
from all the noise in the zoo.

160
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,398
The art department put this light
right in the center

161
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,961
and made this little table
so that it felt like

162
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,450
they're just sitting around
a dining room table as friends would,

163
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,647
just to try and get that feeling.

164
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:05,404
And Marty's kind of pushed aside
as his friends downplay his ideas.

165
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,017
One of the goals of this
is how we portray the city

166
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,190
and we try to tell the movie
through their point of view,

167
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:19,164
to have them know only the things that
they would see or perhaps hear about.

168
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,446
And so we try to always see
the film unfold from their eyes.

169
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,746
We wanted to keep them very naive

170
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,915
and have, you know,
their knowledge

171
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:57,733
kind of play into
what is believable

172
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,434
- with animals in a zoo.
- Right.

173
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:04,267
And yet, from their perspective,
they consider themselves New Yorkers,

174
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,014
which is what this premise
is all about.

175
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,143
Take four New York City zoo animals,
New Yorkers to the core,

176
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,191
and dump them into the wild.
How would they survive?

177
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,659
For a lot of that New York sensibility,
we worked with Peter Mehlman,

178
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:35,674
who was a producer‘writer
for Seinfeld for many years.

179
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,091
He helped to sort of find

180
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:39,552
He helped to sort of find

181
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,732
that New York
sensibility and rhythm.

182
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,689
And language too.

183
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,879
Came up with some
great dialogue.

184
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,977
- That helicopter joke.
- The helicopter joke was Peter's.

185
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,695
And of course,
Mark Burton and Billy Frolick,

186
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,985
writing partners on this,
did a wonderful job

187
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,257
laying this story out for us
when we first began.

188
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,149
Really focusing on the story
between a zebra and a lion

189
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,869
that you wouldn't expect to be friends

190
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,083
and they really kind of
honed in on that idea

191
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,749
as kind of the centerpiece
for the story,

192
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,882
this kind of fable about these animals,

193
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,735
this predator‘prey
that should never be friends.

194
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,352
So that's the heart,
and this scene here

195
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,367
is purely to show how close

196
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,135
and what kind of history
these guys share.

197
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,505
You know, originally, this was
a big song and dance number

198
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,355
and it went into a huge fantasy
musical kind of Busby Berkeley thing,

199
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,070
you know, to show Alex's viewpoint
against Marty's viewpoint.

200
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,588
But we felt at this point in the story,

201
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,949
we've already said that
in many other ways,

202
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,459
so it seemed kind of
a redundant kind of idea.

203
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,749
So it just came down to a few bars
of New York, New York.

204
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,246
l always liked this scene
where, classic...

205
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:07,173
.. apartments, buildings, New Yorkers
yelling at each other to be quiet.

206
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,363
The process for writing
and developing a film like this

207
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:18,351
is perhaps a little bit different
than a live action film.

208
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,959
We do try to start with a script.
It's flexible.

209
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,093
We can modify and change it
and do by design,

210
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,342
by a process,
continue to develop ideas

211
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,672
as we take them into other parts
of our production process,

212
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,419
which include storyboarding,

213
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,088
where we basically draw out
a comic book version

214
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,178
of every scene of the film.

215
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,060
And the story artists
can put a lot of new ideas

216
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,142
into the process that way,
both on how they stage things.

217
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,836
They may come up with new gags
and lines of dialogue

218
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:54,456
that help inform the scene.
And it's a very iterative process.

219
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,964
We just do it over and over again,

220
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,466
refining and redoing sequences,

221
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,762
looking at them together
and seeing how they play out,

222
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,986
rewriting scenes,

223
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,934
and that goes on
throughout the production process,

224
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,894
which in this case
was about four years.

225
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,910
Not enough credit
can be given to storyboard artists.

226
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,783
Like this light that he claps on and off
came out of a storyboard artist.

227
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,126
They're writers themselves
and actors

228
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,497
and they really come up
with a lot of the great things you see.

229
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:32,275
Plus the animators
really add little nuances

230
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,899
and little things that kind of make
the characters even more believable.

231
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,237
It's a great example here.

232
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,819
As Marty looks at his wall,

233
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,608
I think it was Manu
who animated this,

234
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,121
put this little scratch
on his ankle in there

235
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,580
and it just makes you feel like
he's a living thing, you know.

236
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,363
Originally in the first version
of the script,

237
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,743
all the animals
were darted by activists

238
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,683
and shipped away from the zoo,

239
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,782
unbeknownst to our characters,
they had no idea what was happening.

240
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,533
Then as the story evolved,

241
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,769
we found it stronger that Marty
would be so obsessed

242
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,696
with seeing the wild
that he would actually escape,

243
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,825
and cause the others to be worried
and follow after him.

244
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,600
It's a little bit more active
on Marty's part.

245
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,499
Plus we got to bring
the characters out into the city

246
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:27,074
and see how they interacted
and how much of a fish out of water

247
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,360
they are in their own city.

248
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,765
And they're completely oblivious to it.

249
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,805
We have these three neurotic sort of
New York males in the film

250
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,029
and with our one female lead,
the hippo,

251
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,414
voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith,

252
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:51,079
we wanted a tough,
strong character,

253
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,324
and you wouldn't think of Jada
necessarily off the bat,

254
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,176
because she's so petite

255
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,939
and nowhere near a hippo.

256
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,602
But when you hear her voice,
it's so commanding and strong

257
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,962
and it's just the thing we needed

258
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,451
to sort of help keep these
three neurotic males in line

259
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:14,016
and Jada just did a wonderful job
as the voice of the hippo.

260
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,344
We did something different
with the camera here,

261
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,411
give it a handheld feel,

262
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,725
which adds to the frenetic nature
of the sequence.

263
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,170
Something you and Johnson
threw in there

264
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,351
just to add that hectic
kind of nature to it.

265
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,185
Great expressions.

266
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,562
Another gag here added
by a story artist,

267
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,562
just break it off and throw it.

268
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:47,249
I think that's the only food joke
from Gloria in the whole film.

269
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,512
Which we kind of tried to avoid.

270
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,284
We wanted Gloria
to be big and robust,

271
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:55,907
but to be a beautiful hippo
and not have to worry about...

272
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,428
but to be a beautiful hippo
and not have to worry about...

273
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,444
make her a character where she's worried
about eating or has a weight problem

274
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,595
because hippos are 800 pounds
and they're proud of it.

275
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,096
A great pose when Gloria
busts out that brick wall.

276
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,543
So we wanted to get the monkeys
to be transferred as well,

277
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,986
so they became part
of this little escape,

278
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,024
with their own agenda,
to go see Tom Wolfe.

279
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,536
Rockefeller Center.

280
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,668
Getting some of these icons in here.

281
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,517
We thought,
what better way to put...

282
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,849
push these characters through
New York better than on a subway?

283
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,664
That's one of the things,
being in the city,

284
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,703
that every New Yorker
is well familiar with

285
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,076
is the subway.

286
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,815
So we just tried to capture that
as best we could, that experience.

287
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,995
When Marty is traveling through the city
he's in wide open space

288
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,772
and these guys are cramped
and claustrophobic

289
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,231
and in smaller spaces,

290
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,191
just to kind of contrast

291
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,942
Marty and his friends.

292
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,234
Melman has these
Kleenex boxes on his feet,

293
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,103
the little tip of the hat
to Howard Hughes.

294
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:53,331
Classic shot of New York City
landmark, Times Square.

295
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,505
There's a lot of animation
in those signs.

296
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,733
That "What are you going to do,"
is another Peter Mehlman thing.

297
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,956
It always makes me smile.

298
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,538
It's such a little thing
but such a nice touch.

299
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:34,452
Now, that is actually a model
of Grand Central Station,

300
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,684
a beautiful set that they built
inside the computer,

301
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,854
so you can shoot it from any angle.

302
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,717
And it's one of
those things as before,

303
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,564
a little bit whacked out,
a little whack factor.

304
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,370
It's identical but things have been
simplified and kind of caricatured.

305
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,112
But all to make you feel
like you're actually there.

306
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,703
A little bit over the top with the...

307
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,696
And had some fun with the audio,
sound effects, of some of this stuff.

308
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,837
It was a fine line, you know.
Where do you go, way over the top

309
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,624
and have those kind
of cartoon-y sound effects.

310
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,572
We tried to find
the best balance we could.

311
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,848
But that old lady is great,
and that's, for even little kids,

312
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,384
they just love seeing
a lion get hit with a purse.

313
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,420
And that was fun to be able
to do slapstick.

314
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,573
That was part of our conceit,

315
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,292
to have a lot of
the action and motion

316
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,033
be entertaining as well.

317
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,710
And just like, you know, years
of traditional animation has done.

318
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,667
So we've sort of reached a place now
with computer animation technology

319
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,871
where if you've got
the talented people,

320
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,601
and the time and resources

321
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,716
you can really do just about
anything you can dream up.

322
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,693
There was a reason why
the first computer animated films

323
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,243
were toys and insects,

324
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,123
things with exoskeletons,

325
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:10,312
because it's really hard to get
that sort of furry fleshy feeling

326
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,510
with computer animation.

327
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,638
Well, it's still hard,
but it's certainly possible today.

328
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,061
So we could really push that
and make these characters organic

329
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,348
and squash them
and stretch them in ways

330
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,424
that we've seen in traditional
hand-drawn animation,

331
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,591
but perhaps not as much
in computer animation.

332
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,683
That's a great joke.

333
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,286
At least I think so.

334
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,753
This is so tremendously difficult to...
A huge number of crowds.

335
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,124
Even they have to keep breathing
and moving even subtly

336
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,358
so they don't just freeze up and...

337
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,013
Here she comes again.

338
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,075
That was Elisa, her name was.

339
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,508
She was one of the loop group
voice people

340
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,250
who just threw a great voice
on that side character.

341
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,896
One of the rare times here where
we go for the human's point of view.

342
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,783
One of the things we discovered
when they transfer animals,

343
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,389
they use very heavy drugs.

344
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,120
It kind of inspired a way

345
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,736
to do our version
of Pink Elephants On Parade,

346
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,916
to have this little
fantasy thing

347
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,073
that only animation can do,

348
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,232
that brings out just
a little something special

349
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,069
and we thought it was very funny
that he would have

350
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,778
this kind of a hallucination.

351
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,481
And twice, by the way.

352
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,508
So this is our
"guilty of exposition" scene,

353
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,024
where we really needed
to find a way

354
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,638
to explain what
the people's motives were

355
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,517
and why they were
transferring these animals,

356
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,093
because they didn't think they were
happy and 'cause they escaped.

357
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,673
We thought it'd be funny to
show it through Alex's point of view.

358
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,014
And then get darted again.

359
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,923
One thing people ask
about the characters,

360
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:43,566
are they designed
after the actors?

361
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,833
‘Cause they look like them
in some cases, but they're not.

362
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,856
They're designed well in advance
of casting in some cases...

363
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,473
in most cases, in our case here.

364
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,606
But the thing is, when they're
performing behind the mike,

365
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,611
we do videotape them.

366
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,476
And it's something we don't copy,

367
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,956
but we give it to the animators
to inspire them.

368
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,555
They're also inspired
by other performances.

369
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:08,188
And they add these
little nuances in the faces,

370
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:11,154
these little facial expressions
the actors give.

371
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:15,497
So it really makes these characters
look sometimes like the actors.

372
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:19,275
But that's how that
kind of gets in there.

373
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,185
They find an essence somehow.

374
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,509
So this was one of the first shots
that we animated on the film,

375
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,647
because they're just
essentially on stage.

376
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:34,403
It gave the animators a chance
to really find a style and a tone

377
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,683
for the way we want to move
these characters around.

378
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:41,357
Six animators
had worked on this shot,

379
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,334
and the time on the shot is incredible.

380
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:48,143
It's close to 30 seconds, I believe,
and so it's a very long shot.

381
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,520
Different animators would work
on different characters.

382
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,644
This is one of the...
just a flat graphic moment

383
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,017
we could take, cinematically.

384
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:00,456
And we thought it'd be interesting
to shoot it all as a single shot

385
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,069
with all these characters
.
coming on-screen,

386
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,539
and a few times in the movie
where we have

387
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,598
this kind of proscenium staging,

388
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,010
to take a break
from the cinematics of it.

389
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:14,178
Always enjoy watching this and watching
the characters that aren't speaking,

390
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,053
see how the animators have chosen
to keep them alive and thinking.

391
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,447
You always feel like there's
something going on in their heads,

392
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,434
even when they're not speaking.

393
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,584
Pretty amazing for a first shot
and it really set the tone

394
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:31,151
for some of the nuances in how
these characters move and react.

395
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,123
Here's Tommy.

396
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,077
Originally we didn't have
a lot of the sets built too,

397
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,460
so this was a great choice to flex
the muscles of the characters

398
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,274
and they can build
these crates relatively easy,

399
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,770
so that's why it was one of
the first scenes to be animated.

400
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,717
I've always enjoyed this reveal.

401
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,090
We kept trying to think
of a name for the boat.

402
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,804
We had Lollipop
for "It's A Good Ship Lollipop."

403
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,493
We had SS Act Two.

404
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,711
We put names on the boat

405
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:05,564
and it just drew your eye
tight to the name instead of the scene.

406
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,447
Those are cans of root beer,
just in case,

407
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,763
if anybody was wondering.

408
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,682
Root beer, not beer.

409
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,601
This was one of the first scenes
that was boarded in the film,

410
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:26,745
and originally it was a storm at sea
that washed the crates overboard.

411
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,012
But so many films
had been done,

412
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,364
castaways, at the time, you know,

413
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:34,527
and there was so many storms,
that we decided...

414
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,617
and Gilligan's Island
had been out for quite some time.

415
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:41,216
So we decided it'd be fun to use
some of these characters,

416
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,837
when the entire zoo
was being transferred,

417
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,005
and have them do
a little jailbreak.

418
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,261
So this was really the scene
for these penguins

419
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,834
and for a while this was
their only moment in the film.

420
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,437
And we kept it in our screenings
and people just liked them,

421
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,372
so we just decided to put them
elsewhere in the film,

422
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:03,238
and found really good
storytelling places for them.

423
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,211
It's a great addition, the sound
of that breaking coffee cup,

424
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,731
which was designed
by the sound effects folks.

425
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,452
Yeah, those guys, you know,

426
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,178
even with the little foley they did,

427
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,038
moving hay and everything,

428
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:38,123
add so much to the storytelling,
and a lot to the comedy.

429
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,227
A lot of the sound effects really made
some of these jokes play really well.

430
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,206
It's just like the picture,
the sound,

431
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,872
everything you hear
has to be invented.

432
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,721
‘Cause there is no real place

433
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,986
where you can record penguins
slapping each other like this,

434
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,985
so every sound,
every step on a keyboard,

435
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,912
every handshake or wave
or slide across a deck.

436
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:05,043
That was a little something Rex Grignon
added there, that penguin sliding.

437
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,879
Also on that map on the wall
behind the penguin when he shrugs,

438
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,658
it said "Madagascar,"

439
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,547
and that was one of the only times

440
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,647
we ever wanted to see
Madagascar originally in the film.

441
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,790
We never even wanted to mention it.

442
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,492
We didn't want anyone to say it,
but we caved in.

443
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,892
- We caved in.
- We did, we caved in,

444
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,951
and, I think, Julien the lemur
introduces it later.

445
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,581
You want to talk about
the genesis of this?

446
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:39,031
This sequence, my brother's wife,

447
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,671
her father was in the Navy

448
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,701
and they were doing war games,

449
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,793
and he was repainting a deck
and got washed overboard.

450
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,473
And he always described the story
about being caught in these swells

451
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,270
as when he dipped down
50 feet and came up

452
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,650
the boat was just a little further away.

453
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,413
It was so graphic and visual,

454
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,311
we thought maybe
from Alex's point of view

455
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,783
he would go through
the same experience.

456
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,316
And we had Marty in his box

457
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,902
and water was spraying out
of different holes

458
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,564
and he was using all his hooves
to cover it, but it was very funny.

459
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:26,718
But then it looks like Marty
was dead after it

460
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,452
for a long time, so we decided
to keep it with just Alex.

461
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,706
Well, even this here
is a dramatic moment.

462
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,097
Alex arrives on the beach all alone

463
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:40,836
and he's scared and worried
about himself and the others.

464
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,033
And yet we still try to find ways
to keep it fun and visual,

465
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:47,136
as he holds onto his tongue
or as he rolls up onto the beach

466
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,329
and the sand is coming out
of his mouth.

467
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:52,517
Or this joke here, that he's
heading down towards the horizon.

468
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,323
- Cats hate water.
- Dan Wagner, he animated this,

469
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,545
and was finding ways
to push Alex even farther.

470
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,401
During the making of the film
it was always a challenge.

471
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,668
How far can we push these characters,

472
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,882
and see how far we can
take our animation?

473
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:14,085
It's easy to be reserved and...

474
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,603
it was great that Jeffrey Katzenberg

475
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:19,522
was So supportive
of the animation style

476
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,495
we all wanted to do

477
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,410
that he was even a big advocate

478
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,040
of pushing it as far as we can,
see what we could get away with.

479
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,301
Another place here
where the story artist

480
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,951
was given this idea of Alex
coming across Melman

481
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,043
and was asked
to figure out a way

482
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,197
to make it fun
and physical and visual.

483
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,842
And so all of this action here,

484
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,773
pulling on Melman's neck
and grabbing this log,

485
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,876
was all invented
by the story artist

486
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,928
who drew it up
and presented it to us

487
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,407
ona big bulletin board,
like a comic book.

488
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:03,096
And you figure
if you're laughing at that

489
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,388
when it's a black and white drawing
on a bulletin board,

490
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,697
then chances are
you've got something.

491
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,790
And a car screech sound there
when Alex comes to a stop.

492
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,541
Coconut.

493
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,790
There are great little added sounds
that, you know...

494
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,840
There's only certain moments in these
where we really went over the top.

495
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,687
Like that clown horn.

496
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,129
That's always cracked me up.

497
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,905
We wanted to just keep
the action going

498
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,525
and get all our characters
reunited quickly,

499
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,486
and try to hide the fact

500
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,130
that it's so convenient they're all
showing up at the same time.

501
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,927
But, you know, each little beat,

502
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,307
each little character gets his moment.

503
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,603
We have our pair, back to back
musical jokes here,

504
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,718
with Hawaii Five-O
and now Chariots Of Fire,

505
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,982
and we thought about,
can we really get away with those

506
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,242
just running up against each other?
We decided yes.

507
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:24,962
We can.

508
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,953
This is our little twist
on the little love affair,

509
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,761
which goes sour.

510
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,723
Again with the slow motion,

511
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,381
even all of those little lips
flapping around,

512
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:41,031
all hand-animated
to appear like slow motion.

513
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,965
So that line "sugar honey, ice tea"

514
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,991
that Marty says when he turns
and runs the other way,

515
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,420
is something that Chris Rock
came up with.

516
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,444
We have a lot of opportunity
to play around and be inventive

517
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:01,424
when we get into the studio
to record these actors.

518
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,360
There's a great shot
of our jungle for the first time.

519
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,966
A lot of times we just had exclamations.
"Wow, this is great"

520
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,290
or, you know,
something really ordinary,

521
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,650
and Chris and all the cast
were really great

522
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,259
at finding the language
for their character.

523
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:21,132
And Chris would come up
with funny exclamations.

524
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:24,965
Dagnabbit.

525
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,065
He'd say sugar honey ice tea.
And right here.

526
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,585
That's Chris Rock all the way.

527
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,828
But that's part of the process
that's so great,

528
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,991
is we... these actors just aren't
names on the marquee for us.

529
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,723
l mean, there's a reason
why they're famous,

530
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,255
it's because they're so good
at what they do.

531
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,961
And so when we get
into the studio with them,

532
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:53,407
we let them fly.

533
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,375
If they've got ideas,
you know, we go.

534
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,438
We get it. And often
it just is... it's just gold.

535
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,764
Like Ben running after Marty.
Ben standing behind a microphone.

536
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,344
He's jumping up and down,
acting out of breath.

537
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:09,164
We say, you're chasing Marty telling him
how many ways you can kill him,

538
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,458
Ben would just put his heart into it,
and it looked...

539
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:16,831
The performance is great.
It really is convincing...

540
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,929
. that they're running
or moving or getting hit.

541
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,736
This is the first shot
of the jungle interior,

542
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,942
absolutely beautiful images.

543
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,196
The art department created
these environments for us.

544
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:43,181
The lighters who gave it
this wonderful glow,

545
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,912
not too bright, 'cause
the sun is going down,

546
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,237
but it's just absolutely beautiful.

547
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,600
And again, it's always fun
to have Alex get beat up.

548
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,363
But we needed to detain him
for later.

549
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,333
He had to be out of the loop later on.

550
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,251
Most of the plants
are derived from real plants

551
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:03,261
you would find in Madagascar,
although they are stylized.

552
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,698
But, at least as important to that
is how they're placed in the jungle.

553
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,288
The art department
looked at a lot of reference,

554
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,110
especially like Balinese gardens.

555
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,995
These are gardens
in very tropical climates,

556
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:20,839
and they use the plants that
they have in that sort of climate,

557
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:25,129
and yet create these very
manicured, groomed spaces.

558
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:29,587
And we use that idea
to give this jungle...

559
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,299
...a sort of structure.

560
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,214
It wasn't supposed to be
a literal version of Madagascar

561
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,759
but kind of stylized,
using plant designs.

562
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,268
But to make it kind of an innocent,
naive version of a jungle,

563
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,465
a kind of childlike view.

564
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,550
To place 900 dancing lemurs
in a jungle

565
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,967
is quite an undertaking for a computer.

566
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,469
This is one of the scenes where we
really wanted to show the wildlife

567
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,348
and one of our editors,
Clare De Chenu,

568
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,379
found this piece of music
called Move It, that would...

569
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,779
And to kind of give these
characters a personality

570
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,975
we thought, like, ravers at a party.
That's how they like to live.

571
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,549
And this Move It song
is from the ‘80s.

572
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,055
And Sacha, who is playing Julien,
heard this music

573
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,636
that was just in the background
and decided he'd like to sing it.

574
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,826
So he went home and practiced it.

575
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:24,052
Came back in and
he just blew the doors off it.

576
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:27,499
Plus he danced on videotape,
which the animators referenced.

577
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,133
And really gave the introduction
to the locals a great flavor.

578
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,230
And we introduced the foosa.

579
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,629
Yeah, it was a stroke of genius

580
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:41,207
to cast Sacha Baron Cohen
as our lemur king.

581
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,550
Leslee Feldman and her crew
suggested him to us.

582
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,106
And we'd actually never
heard of him before,

583
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,535
but then saw the work
he'd done on HBO with Ali G.

584
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,220
- And he could create characters.
- Yeah.

585
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,762
He came in and played around
with some voices,

586
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,892
kind of this Indian,

587
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,110
came up with a French,
kind of Indian accent.

588
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,890
And then after a few sessions
really gave it it's own kind of flavor.

589
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:10,072
We don't know what it is,
what that accent is.

590
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,768
So this was hard to set up,
a challenge for us to set up.

591
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,572
You know, the locals
and what they're like,

592
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,591
and their enemy,
the foosa,

593
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,686
and kind of their situation.

594
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:27,187
And to introduce the New Yorkers
to the locals as well.

595
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,828
Mort, he's one of my
favorite characters.

596
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,299
We've been told
he's very popular in Japan.

597
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,999
- Andy Richter.
- Andy Richter as the voice of Mort.

598
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,266
He's so funny.

599
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,685
Cedric The Entertainer
is the voice of Maurice,

600
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,769
sort of the second in command.

601
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,787
He's a kind of lemur called an aye-aye,

602
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,022
this very bizarre exotic creature

603
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,201
that lives in Madagascar
and nowhere else.

604
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,884
Cedric just has this wonderful
warmth to his voice.

605
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,332
You know, when we began,

606
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,591
we thought we might
try to get Malagasy accents

607
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,609
for our characters
that live in Madagascar.

608
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,130
But we soon realized
that the best thing

609
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,566
is to use these beautiful voices

610
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,968
that our actors can bring to the table.

611
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:20,361
Cedric just has all of this warmth
and this mellow tone to his voice.

612
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:23,772
It's a great contrast to King Julien,

613
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:27,538
which is what we wanted,
these two to kind of be a contrast.

614
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,495
And, yeah, we needed that,

615
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,892
someone who had brains
in the organization

616
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,048
who could play against this child king.

617
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,043
The locals,
because of these guys,

618
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:40,002
were very small characters
in the original version,

619
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:44,045
and their parts just grew tremendously
because of Cedric and Sacha

620
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,576
adding so much to them.

621
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,432
In some of these scenes
we had a lot of dialogue

622
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,716
between Maurice and Julien
in the bushes that was really funny.

623
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,361
A lot of it was improv.

624
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,932
Some of those things, for time,
you have to lose.

625
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,569
The animators having fun with how...

626
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,030
The animators having fun with how...

627
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,330
Sacha used to hold his hands
in all these crimped shapes

628
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,211
when he'd perform,

629
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,256
and the animators tried to
add that to his character.

630
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,074
There was a waterfall
actually behind them

631
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:22,644
that we didn't have the water
quite ready for yet.

632
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,434
And so we didn't turn on
the water for the shot.

633
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,148
So all the things
weren't quite built yet,

634
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,547
but enough to have
the scene come across.

635
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,431
So we had to plan out
what scenes

636
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,583
were best to animate first
with what sets are finished.

637
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:48,031
So cute. This is great.

638
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:51,123
Jada turns on her
motherly charms here.

639
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,868
Originally the joke for Mort was...

640
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,450
..that he was the most
annoyingly cute of all the lemurs.

641
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,977
Remember, you always
thought it was great

642
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,080
that he was 37 years old in reality,

643
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,783
and that's why it was so annoying.
Act your age.

644
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,479
We had a joke,

645
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,667
where they called him
on his age,

646
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,756
and he just giggled.

647
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,819
And we lost that.
Had to cut it for time, I think.

648
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,491
You know, when we started this film,

649
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,338
putting five furry lemurs
on-screen

650
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,804
was the most they could do.

651
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,433
And there you see,
there's a few more than five.

652
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,584
And so that was the challenge
to, you know,

653
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:43,841
how to get all these characters
on screen at once with all their fur.

654
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,305
Every one of these characters
has millions of hairs on him.

655
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,232
And every one of those hairs,

656
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,341
and its associated data,

657
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,953
has to be pumped
through the computers

658
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,771
to create these images.

659
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,796
So it just becomes monumental,

660
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:03,428
the amount of information
that has to get calculated,

661
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,475
to create these furry guys.

662
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,540
- This is a...
- Ad-lib.

663
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:17,198
- It's always challenging in these...
- Yeah "ripping our limbs off."

664
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:25,556
This is a little bit
that Sacha had done

665
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:27,404
where to punish Maurice

666
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,195
he calls everyone to prepare
the spanking machine.

667
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,671
They all cheer and...

668
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,768
But before the spanking machine,

669
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:39,077
they ask them their names
and it's a little funny bit

670
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,426
that we ended up losing,
again, to keep it moving.

671
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,000
So it's always a challenge
with these,

672
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,472
like a nine-foot-tall lion
or a 15-foot giraffe...

673
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:06,517
...to be in the same scene
with an 18-inch lemur, you know.

674
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:09,638
Cinematically it's very
challenging sometimes.

675
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:13,364
It was hard enough just keeping
Melman in the shots with his friends,

676
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,411
much less adding
these little guys to the mix.

677
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,728
That's why it was fun
to have Melman's head

678
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,173
kind of drop into the frame
from time to time.

679
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,232
It sometimes came off
pretty funny.

680
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,977
That's another adlib,
“fuzz bucket," very funny.

681
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,048
Beautiful sunset lighting here.

682
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:01,178
When we started the film, a lot of it
was going to take place on a beach.

683
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,702
We didn't think about things
like kicking sand and footprints

684
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,866
and the history of footprints
and all these little things

685
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,422
that add so much to the realism of it.

686
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,471
l mean, these guys,
a lot of the artists

687
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:16,318
just really invented ways to do this

688
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,301
that it really adds so much.

689
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,759
And make you feel
like you're on a beach.

690
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,009
That was an ad-lib from Chris Rock.

691
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,444
He just started singing that song

692
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:33,837
and he really didn't know the words,
so he starts going...

693
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,328
and he really didn't know the words,
so he starts going...

694
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:40,841
..and inspired that little acrobatic
gymnastics that Marty does.

695
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,904
This scene actually came
after the crates went overboard,

696
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,513
and, in the film,
with the penguins celebrating.

697
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,100
The characters are overboard,
it's dramatic,

698
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:01,012
and you cut back and the penguins
are having champagne.

699
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,122
We found a better place

700
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,939
for that little penguin celebration.

701
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:13,217
It was a great image, I think, with
Melman in his grave, sort of giving up.

702
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,694
His giraffe crate is a headstone.

703
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,958
A little thing about the will
in the sand is that

704
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,972
the art department had researched
a New York State will

705
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,381
and all the legalize
and how it's written

706
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,247
and actually wrote it,
modeled it in the sand.

707
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,353
Yeah, that's a legal,
binding document there.

708
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,790
It's legit.

709
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,888
This little Melman ad-lib here.

710
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,723
David Schwimmer just came up
with that. It's very funny.

711
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:54,235
It just gives the animators
so much material to work with,

712
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,149
these great performances.

713
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:04,118
David made Melman
just such a wonderful character.

714
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:06,848
He's so appealing, you know,

715
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,631
even with his phobias
and weaknesses.

716
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,554
We didn't want him
to be a downer,

717
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:14,995
- we wanted him to be a lot of fun.
- A loveable hypochondriac,

718
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,736
which he did so well.

719
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,434
When we tested it, they asked kids
who their favorite character was,

720
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,998
and this little boy raised his hand
and said,

721
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,427
"l like Melman, because he's too tall."

722
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,013
He's too tall!

723
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,793
Which is great,
‘cause he is too tall, poor guy.

724
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,529
So the kid was really
empathizing with him.

725
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,167
And this is where we start to go

726
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,143
into the survival montage.

727
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,699
We tried so many
different types of music,

728
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:52,666
songs that would underlie it.

729
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:57,554
We were really stuck on it, and then
Hans decided he wanted to take a shot

730
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,929
at just composing something

731
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:03,621
and it really hits
every beat of this

732
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,085
and the attitudes of the characters.
He really did a great job,

733
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:10,188
building it to this climactic,
monumental moment

734
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:12,088
with the Statue Of Liberty.

735
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,587
It was a great idea Tom
came up with,

736
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:28,095
that they construct their own version
of the Statue of Liberty,

737
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:32,042
that they could use
the Liberty's torch as a beacon.

738
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,452
Which led into
another storyboard artist's

739
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,565
Planet Of The Apes reference,

740
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,542
which kind of just seemed
to work right into this.

741
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:55,154
We do have a lot of shameless
film references in Madagascar

742
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,526
and we just think they're funny.

743
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:01,696
And usually, though, what
we'll try to do is give it a test

744
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:04,636
that, if it works even if you
don't get the reference,

745
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,829
if it makes sense
to some degree,

746
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,410
within the context, then it's OK.

747
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,430
Yeah, we had him doing
the Tom Hanks bit here,

748
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:17,963
but we just thought
it was too much Cast Away.

749
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:21,759
So we kind of took out
the "I make fire" bit.

750
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,725
- Fire is very difficult.
- In computer animation.

751
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:32,562
This was a monumental task to do
the effects here of this right here.

752
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,078
And breaking apart like this.

753
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,108
We had a lot of extra material
in this sequence.

754
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,387
Some of it was animated, I believe,
between Marty and Alex.

755
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:48,688
Mireille was great.

756
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,976
We had... this sequence was probably,

757
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:51,428
you know, felt like 15 minutes.

758
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,679
you know, felt like 15 minutes.

759
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:57,163
And Mireille was really good
about saying,

760
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,658
this bit's good, this bit's good,
you could really tighten it up.

761
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:04,857
It was like pulling teeth, but we're
so glad we did tighten that sequence.

762
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,073
- Thank you, Mireille.
- Mireille Soria, our producer.

763
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:16,233
We always wanted to have this scene
in the plane, which is good,

764
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:19,921
and the comments like maybe
the skeleton hand would be too dark.

765
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:23,764
But we just thought it was funny,
and hopefully it ended up funny.

766
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:27,775
So we put smiles on the skeleton's
faces so it wouldn't be...

767
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,942
There's one right there.
So it wouldn't be too gruesome.

768
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,268
We wanted it to be like
a little tree house kind of scene.

769
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:40,007
It's great that the skeleton hand
sort of does the right poses.

770
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,465
There's Teemo
that goes into the ball.

771
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,315
l wish we had used Teemo more.

772
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,441
- It's a tenrec.
- I's an actual animal,

773
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:56,501
all these animals are,
but Teemo was funny.

774
00:49:56,927 --> 00:50:00,087
He used to have this French accent
and had a bigger role early on,

775
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:03,058
but it was reduced to
popping into a little ball now.

776
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,281
We had a bigger role for Masacoro,

777
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:08,033
which is that chameleon
that you see occasionally.

778
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,923
She was a psychic and
she would stick her tongue out

779
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:15,942
onto people's forehead
and change colors like a mood ring.

780
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,474
And she read their fortunes to them.

781
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,615
Again, Sacha, just going off.

782
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,710
He would go off for minutes.

783
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,869
There'd be one line of dialogue
and he'd go off for ten minutes,

784
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,882
having imaginary conversations
with other lemurs,

785
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,232
and we'd just be in tears,
just laughing.

786
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,904
Sacha, there's certain words he would
say that Julien wouldn't know,

787
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,498
he's not smart enough to know,

788
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:58,993
so he came up with a language

789
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,376
tailored to someone
who wasn't so bright,

790
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,245
and it added a lot to his character.

791
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:07,549
That was the second place
we say Madagascar.

792
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,482
And that's about all we wanted
to mention originally.

793
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:36,346
So wouldn't you know,
this is one of those moments,

794
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:40,577
Alex and Marty connect,
you know, kind of intimately.

795
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:43,595
It felt like it was
a good point in the film.

796
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:49,516
Hans Zimmer brings this
friendship theme back in here.

797
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, which really helps out
moments like this.

798
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:06,209
This is a long shot.
The animator took a lot of time.

799
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,430
Some subtle performances.

800
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:27,564
Another story artist idea
that just kind of adds to the shot,

801
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,335
that help sign falling.

802
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,899
So even though they're in the wild
and Marty, you know...

803
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,862
We wanted to have them
live like, you know,

804
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:42,684
like New Yorkers
even though they're in the wild.

805
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:46,603
So we thought it was funny
to have this apartment door scene,

806
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,888
with the chains and everything.

807
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:54,214
This kind of reuniting moment,

808
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,448
and then just have a free-standing door
it was funny.

809
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,852
Again the sound effects guys
adding extra locks

810
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:04,115
and so Marty has like
20 locks he undoes,

811
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,331
and that adds a bit to it.

812
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,699
He's using sort of a Tiki lounge
concept as a reference here.

813
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,482
Marty has this sort of
‘60s bachelor pad, I guess.

814
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:20,454
And then Hans goes,
“] must do that music."

815
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:24,688
And he really nailed
that genre of bachelor pad.

816
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,413
Here come our spit takes.

817
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:34,732
So this is one where we had a few
and thought they were funny.

818
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:38,467
The problem was
we didn't have enough,

819
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:40,926
so we added more.

820
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,272
In the issue of food,
they're so pampered in a zoo,

821
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:04,252
we're like, well how can we...?

822
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,749
They wouldn't know what to look for
to find food, you know.

823
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,496
They didn't even know
food grows on trees.

824
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:14,052
So they're kind of helpless
in this environment

825
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,728
being naive about the wild.

826
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:19,386
And this is a good way to show
the herbivores

827
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,352
are OK with this stuff,

828
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,660
but Alex needs his steak.

829
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,860
So it was a moment we could put in

830
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:31,005
where Alex really starts
to get hungry here.

831
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:54,497
And Alex is hungry for steak.
It was always thought...

832
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:57,642
It was always a moment
for him to have this dream.

833
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,721
We tried different versions
of these different dreams.

834
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:04,705
One was based off Jurassic Park
where there are steaks running around

835
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:08,578
in flocks and herds
on a big savannah. And then...

836
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:12,036
We had a big dance number,

837
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,349
with all the steaks sort of...

838
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,018
Another Busby Berkeley musical,

839
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,224
and again,
the story artists had come up

840
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:24,314
with this idea,
based off the movie.

841
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:28,078
But it was just a real simple
quick way we could convey

842
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:32,752
and have a little joke about it,
that Alex loves steak.

843
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:36,417
Rob Koo, one of our board artists,
added him doing a steak angel,

844
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,450
which he then added to that.

845
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:45,085
We actually added these cutbacks
so that we could extend this moment,

846
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:47,069
make it very uncomfortable.

847
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,006
It sort of cracks me up
that Marty kind of buys it.

848
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,537
Yeah.

849
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:01,155
Hey, what do you know?

850
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,361
Just the cadence of Sacha's voice
make me laugh.

851
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,705
Yeah, it's the Greek chorus up there

852
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,390
commenting on Alex.

853
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,634
The locals are desperate.

854
00:56:32,923 --> 00:56:34,792
They need some kind of help.

855
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,866
Just blabbing on.

856
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,296
This was quite challenging
to do this.

857
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,772
It's really funny on paper
when it's a drawing,

858
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:48,114
all these lemurs pulling into this tree,
but to actually do it is very difficult.

859
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,808
In traditional animation all you
need to do is draw it and paint it.

860
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,394
In the computer world though
you have to build it.

861
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:05,479
And on that gag and this one
coming up here,

862
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,393
we adjusted the timings on those
over and over again

863
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,752
trying to find the perfect rhythm.

864
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,823
The one time we could say suck.

865
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:23,328
The gag really is credited,
that little bit, to Bob Saget,

866
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:27,604
who was actually
in the studio at the time.

867
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,660
We showed him the penguin stuff
and he goes, "At the end

868
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,306
you have them on an icy shelf
just looking at each other

869
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,160
and says, 'Well this sucks."

870
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:40,382
That was going to be
after the credit roll.

871
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:43,384
And we found a better place.

872
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,787
Well, yeah. As the penguins
became more a part of the story,

873
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:50,724
we couldn't end with them in Antarctica
so we could just move that gag up.

874
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,966
One of the underlying themes here
is that these guys are all...

875
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,696
Everybody's looking for a place
that will tell them who they are.

876
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,879
Ultimately they all have to look
inside themselves

877
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:10,915
to find who they are, and
it doesn't matter where they are.

878
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:14,105
They don't have to be where
Mother Nature tells them to be

879
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:15,928
or New York or anything else.

880
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:18,973
So the penguins again
are a parallel to that idea.

881
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,909
Here Marty finds
the real version of his mural

882
00:58:23,467 --> 00:58:25,717
and thinks that that's all
he needs to be happy.

883
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,898
But Alex is a good enough sport
to go along

884
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:33,328
after their reconciliation
on the beach.

885
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,460
This was a challenge too.
Alex is hungry now.

886
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:44,009
How do we get... We wanted Marty
to bring this kind of wild side out.

887
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:51,311
We thought if we could get him
into that chase kind of situation,

888
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,857
a game of tag, that Alex's instincts
would somehow kick in,

889
00:58:55,332 --> 00:58:58,372
between the hunger and
just the act of chasing his friend.

890
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:02,823
We didn't necessarily have
that dream sequence

891
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,576
at the beginning of the film

892
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,941
until we were sort of working
on ideas for this sequence.

893
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:12,045
We found that there's this opportunity
to set up that idea at the beginning,

894
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:15,926
and then allow this
to sort of resonate

895
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,942
with what we saw
when the film started.

896
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:29,334
There's a similar shot
to Marty's fantasy.

897
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,743
So now Alex's pupils
have changed.

898
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:41,310
He's transitioned into something
closer to a wild cat,

899
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:45,662
something's flowing inside of him
that he's never felt before.

900
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,459
We wanted to have something
for Alex that would show

901
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:54,135
like when he's a little bit crazed
and more wild,

902
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:57,624
so his pupils shrank
as his irises grow.

903
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:00,348
And then there's three wigs also
to kind of show

904
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,360
how he would progress
and get a little wilder.

905
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,550
Here's the next version of his hair,

906
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:09,089
which isn't quite as
blow-dried as normal.

907
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:14,314
And his whiskers start to get
little kinks in them as well.

908
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,245
Look how he just throws this lemur.

909
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,990
Animators having fun.

910
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:30,624
This is a great example of Sacha
coming up with alternate wording.

911
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,099
"In a very good working..."

912
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,947
It was something like,
"My plan is working excellently,"

913
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:44,000
in the script, and he turned it
into words that Julien would say.

914
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:01,167
We used to have this long scene
where Alex was sniffing Marty,

915
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:05,038
with that wild look on his face
and didn't know what smelled so good.

916
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:09,042
Thought he smelled steak and he...
His nose kept leading him to Marty.

917
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:20,385
Sort of a variation on the song
that we heard

918
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:22,964
when Alex was at the zoo,

919
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,976
with kind of a crazy,
marching band feel to it.

920
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:33,167
And once Julien's character
was, you know,

921
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:36,460
challenged by another king,

922
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:39,147
he became kind of bitter about Alex.

923
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,309
And there was a lot more of that,

924
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,321
but then we kind of pulled back
on that, because...

925
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,998
A beautiful waterfall back there
through these scenes

926
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,278
that we had turned off earlier.

927
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:59,205
So it was how to show Alex
going nuts, and his point of view.

928
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:02,919
And, you know,
gotta give credit to older cartoons

929
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,350
that would turn someone
into a sucker,

930
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,283
you know,
and cross-dissolve.

931
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:12,593
Although it would've been great
to see little steaks dissolve.

932
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,343
Kind of visually could show it.

933
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,802
Originally the steaks were realistic,
and looked kind of creepy,

934
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,082
so we had to stylize those a little bit.

935
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:26,198
So a moment of lucidity there
as his eyes go back to normal briefly.

936
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:30,478
Yeah, as Tom was saying,

937
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,720
these steaks allow us to do this,

938
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:37,464
to present this idea comedically.
It could be very dark,

939
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:41,618
this idea that Alex
wants to eat his friends.

940
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:45,412
Which isn't something that we all can
necessarily relate to in a way,

941
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:49,299
so we had to play it kind of light,
that part of it,

942
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:53,233
but hopefully play that it's a real
emotional heartbreak for these guys,

943
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,880
‘cause they don't think
they can be friends.

944
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,796
Everything's coming out in the open.

945
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,395
There was a scene
that we actually took out.

946
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,678
It was Maurice like a car salesman,

947
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:06,928
showing all the attributes of a lion.

948
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,590
The teeth, the claws,
built for speed, four-wheel drive.

949
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,865
It was a very funny scene,
but at this point in the film,

950
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,402
you kind of knew what a lion was about,

951
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:21,421
and so it just kind of
slowed down the sequence.

952
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:28,162
It was great working
with this layout team

953
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:30,995
to find really inventive ways
to do the storytelling

954
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:34,337
and to emphasize certain emotions,
where you put the camera.

955
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,121
And you try and think of it
like a live action film.

956
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:40,854
You have these miniature sets built
and these performers within that,

957
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:45,574
and it's all a virtual world, but you do
have cameras and lenses and lights

958
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,322
and there are creative people
working those elements

959
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,576
like you would in a live action film.

960
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:56,235
So it's a really neat
and challenging process

961
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:01,240
and there's a lot more to it creatively
than most people imagine, in animation.

962
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:22,298
There's an entire department that
just constructs all the models for us.

963
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,799
What makes these films interesting
is every film can have its own style,

964
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,614
and we wanted to definitely have
our own style.

965
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:33,038
Kendall pushed a lot of the design,
you know, so it's very unique.

966
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:37,286
So in a way we couldn't borrow
a coffee table from the Shrek universe

967
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,794
because it's a different style
of how it's made and graphically.

968
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:45,631
So, every little thing you see,
every prop, every blade of grass,

969
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:49,308
everything has been made
from scratch for this movie alone.

970
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:15,117
We have this Wonderful World song
you've seen in many films,

971
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,174
to contrast what the characters
are going through.

972
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,271
We'd used it for such a long time
we couldn't find anything better

973
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,662
to play with this montage,

974
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:28,388
which is virtually created
from Rob Koo, I think.

975
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:32,675
He storyboarded all these characters
kind of walking through

976
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:37,013
and each one getting picked off
by a different predator later on.

977
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,120
So it was pretty funny.
It just kind of grew from there

978
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:44,047
and then we added Alex
building his cage,

979
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,417
because he was so afraid
about hurting his friends.

980
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:51,442
With the foosas
it's very difficult, you know,

981
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,221
‘cause we went back and forth.

982
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,047
Do they talk?
What do they say when they talk?

983
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,474
And for a while they did.

984
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:04,924
We found that we didn't need them
to communicate so much,

985
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:06,865
but just to be savage,

986
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,670
and to reflect where Alex
would actually go to,

987
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:13,984
this non-speaking,

988
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:17,247
guttural, savage creature.

989
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,167
Little ducky.

990
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,022
We were going to have him say,
"Are you my mommy?" to Marty

991
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,925
before he gets eaten,
but that just went a little too far.

992
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,765
We reveal what Alex was constructing.

993
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:34,472
The Tsingy,
it's actually in Madagascar.

994
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:37,928
It's a really unique place
of limestone spires

995
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:41,417
we thought it would be great
to play out the scene there.

996
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:17,676
Jada again being the strong female

997
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:20,551
and she's just great.

998
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:23,307
l mean, she has this kind of...

999
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,806
When she walks into a room,
her presence is there.

1000
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:29,854
Jada is very petite in reality

1001
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:34,336
but she has this great
presence about her.

1002
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:47,028
Animator had fun again here.

1003
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:50,549
We always try to give them a lot
of freedom to go crazy with this stuff.

1004
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,509
It's one of those things
that worked out

1005
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,151
with our friends
coming back from Antarctica.

1006
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:04,004
We wanted to have the boat
come back,

1007
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,194
so they see their opportunity to leave,

1008
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:09,976
but it was nice to be able to bring
the penguins back at this time.

1009
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,519
Every shot just has ocean
in the background.

1010
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,729
One of these shots
coming up right here

1011
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:37,277
has 15,000 trees, right here,

1012
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:40,649
with four million blowing leaves

1013
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,107
that they created
just for that one shot.

1014
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:47,203
And the effects team was just like,
"We want to do this shot,"

1015
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,010
and we're so grateful to them
for pulling it off.

1016
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,850
That was a line that Tom
just invented on the fly as a joke.

1017
01:08:57,332 --> 01:08:59,522
We never thought
we'd use it at the time,

1018
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:02,832
and then we were listening to takes
and we said, wait a minute,

1019
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,616
- we should try and blend this in.
- Can we say that?

1020
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:07,649
Kill them and eat their liver?

1021
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:10,904
We decided we could say it as long
as we were sure he was joking.

1022
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,590
The skipper is barking off these orders,
and the scene was animated.

1023
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,739
They get the locals to help them.

1024
01:09:32,035 --> 01:09:34,345
That's why that skipper line
was still in there.

1025
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:37,047
The hearts and minds of the natives.

1026
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,370
But we changed the sequence
and they're no longer part of it.

1027
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:47,819
These signs really helped us.
You know, it's maybe cheap to do that,

1028
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:51,911
but we knew which side of the island
was which, in a way.

1029
01:09:52,455 --> 01:09:54,265
It's in our tone still.

1030
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:08,143
Here it kind of borders on creepy
with all these smiling steaks.

1031
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:12,078
l remember the sound guys put in
the sound of goats and little children,

1032
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:16,008
and we were going, wait a second,
this isn't Silence Of The Lambs.

1033
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:22,916
They were really fun to work with,
these guys. Really creative.

1034
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:26,229
Chris and Ben did a great job
with the performances here.

1035
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:29,709
This is a scene though
where we went,

1036
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:32,473
we changed the dialogue
in subtle ways,

1037
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:35,382
and Chris at the time
was doing the Oscars,

1038
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,788
and he was really cramped for time.

1039
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:40,914
And I remember we actually...
He let us come to his hotel

1040
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,120
and we set up a suite
and recorded this stuff.

1041
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:48,034
And he did a really
brilliant performance.

1042
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:51,708
But there was a technical problem
with the audio,

1043
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:55,315
and we had to animate this scene,

1044
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,538
we had to go back in with him
after the Oscars.

1045
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,238
The day after, I think.

1046
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,174
He said everybody else
was calling to congratulate him.

1047
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,464
DreamWorks called to say, hey,
can we get you back in the studio?

1048
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,390
How he was great, you know,
and it's hard for the...

1049
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,490
They have to recreate
their performances, you know,

1050
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:18,276
and, luckily, our actors were
really patient to the process,

1051
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,371
which can be very difficult

1052
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:23,513
and sometimes that happens
where you have to redo stuff.

1053
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,230
We see all these
beautiful images on screen

1054
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,836
that the art department
helps us realize.

1055
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,407
But the other side of that equation

1056
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:34,687
is the work that Philippe Gluckman
and his team do,

1057
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:39,078
to bring these artistic ideas
to the screen in three-dimension.

1058
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,155
Managing how all the effects look,

1059
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:46,815
how the surfaces look,
how the light reacts with these objects.

1060
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:51,280
It's a huge task. Philippe and his team
have just done an incredible job,

1061
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:55,124
sometimes recreating
almost exactly

1062
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,275
what was conceived

1063
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,174
in the artistic development process.

1064
01:12:01,584 --> 01:12:04,334
And then taking things
to new levels too,

1065
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,367
often in ways
that surprised us sometimes.

1066
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,660
We didn't think that maybe
some things were possible.

1067
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:14,757
We'd ask Philippe and he'd scratch his
head and say, "Let me think about it,"

1068
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,881
and come back the next day
and say, "Yeah, we can do that."

1069
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:21,679
Beautiful backgrounds here,

1070
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,224
dark moody lighting
and the plants blowing gently,

1071
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,901
all help contribute to the tone.

1072
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:32,342
And the animation here,
it isn't as broad and whacky

1073
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:36,184
as it is in some other scenes
and has a little more subtleties.

1074
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:38,469
I think the animators did a great job

1075
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:43,419
of just pulling off
these subtle moments.

1076
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:45,833
And we launch into action.

1077
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,329
This is another little bit
we had to shorten for time,

1078
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:56,796
but Marty was pleading
to the foosas not to eat him

1079
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,610
because he had mad cow disease

1080
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,655
and other Chris Rock
kind of standup routine

1081
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,861
as these foosa
were encircling him.

1082
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,012
But it ended up slowing down
the action a little bit.

1083
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:27,152
Again one of the things we discovered
which was very difficult, whipped cream.

1084
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,437
Let that be a lesson to everyone.

1085
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:35,389
Massive undertaking again here.

1086
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:38,338
All these individual foosa
have to be animated by hand.

1087
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:42,351
You can't tell the computer to move
them around. It doesn't look natural.

1088
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:44,289
The Whac-a-Mole gag.

1089
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:01,173
An amazing roar designed
by the sound effects folks.

1090
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:04,693
It was very hard to get a real lion's
roar, we've discovered,

1091
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:07,664
because they don't really roar
for very long.

1092
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,187
They do really short little blasts.

1093
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:12,386
So the sound guys
had to create one for us.

1094
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,398
You know, one of the things
that made Alex savage visually,

1095
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:23,112
his teeth used to turn sharp.

1096
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:25,332
We had this second set of teeth
for him.

1097
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,501
But it really, really looked like Alien.

1098
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,015
So we decided not to use
those kind of teeth

1099
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:33,097
and keep him with his normal ones.

1100
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:35,132
Usually teeth don't change anyway.

1101
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:03,757
You know, in the end,
just the sound editing,

1102
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,096
what H and those guys did,

1103
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:10,670
it's really amazing technically
how this all works.

1104
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,603
With all these guys
screaming on top of each other,

1105
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,350
and, you know, they're all
recorded separately

1106
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:19,086
and it takes a large amount
of patience in editing

1107
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:22,552
to string all these vocal
performances together

1108
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:26,512
and make it sound like everyone's
working with each other.

1109
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:31,156
A little funny nunchucks bit
that the animator put in.

1110
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:34,314
Really shows off what we can
do with the characters

1111
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:37,190
and how we can move them
.
In a sequence.

1112
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,520
Our character TD's or technical
directors are the ones that set these up

1113
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:45,478
so that they can be sort of
pushed and pulled to such extremes.

1114
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:48,407
Robyn, Alain,
and the others did a great job,

1115
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:50,981
giving the animators
the handles they needed

1116
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:53,777
to do this kind of
over the top animation.

1117
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:01,276
And Rex Grignon was fantastic
as an animation supervisor

1118
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:05,587
who really pushed the animators
and helped set the tone

1119
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,032
of the style of animation
we were after.

1120
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,174
You can't thank those guys enough.

1121
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,429
You never can,
because there's so many.

1122
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:15,758
There's probably 50 animators.
that contributed to this film,

1123
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,758
whose work is seamless.

1124
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,107
Every animator has his own shot,

1125
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:19,778
Every animator has his own shot,

1126
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,552
and they'd run right next
to each other.

1127
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:26,018
So it's amazing how continuous
it all feels afterwards.

1128
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:43,792
We decided Alex could eat fish,
since fish don't talk in our movie.

1129
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,522
- They're not.
- You can eat all the fish you want.

1130
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,512
Because a lion really can't...

1131
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,904
it's impossible for them to really
live off vegetables and fruit.

1132
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:53,868
Have to have protein some way,

1133
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:57,833
so fish was our
serendipitous solution for that.

1134
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:03,425
Marty actually had
teeth marks on his butt

1135
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:05,546
from where he was bitten.

1136
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:10,562
In the computer it never looked right.
It always looked really gruesome,

1137
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,437
with little blood specks
or a little pink thing.

1138
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:14,938
It didn't look right.

1139
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:19,443
The ultimate solution they came up with
was a Band-Aid, which works out great.

1140
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,523
The story artists bring a huge
amount of creativity to the table.

1141
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:30,335
They don't just get the script and draw
what's on the page necessarily.

1142
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,120
They use that as a guide.

1143
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:37,112
Catherine Rader and Rob Koo
are our two lead story artists

1144
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,375
and contributed so much
original material.

1145
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,633
Much of what you see on-screen

1146
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,567
was actually never
in the original script sometimes.

1147
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:49,915
And Rob and Catherine are very much
filmmakers in their own right

1148
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:53,813
as they take these script pages,
just the written word,

1149
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:58,376
and turn it into cinema,
along with their team of story artists.

1150
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:03,168
And the first performance
is in the drawings as well.

1151
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,021
So that's how you visualize this,

1152
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:11,186
and from there everyone else
is inspired by the storyboard drawings.

1153
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:17,692
The crown is so small in Alex's hand.

1154
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:18,103
The crown is so small in Alex's hand.

1155
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:19,937
"Go, Stevie, go!"

1156
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:24,262
He went to town on that so we
put that in, the gecko on his crown.

1157
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,120
Yeah, to fit that crown
on Alex's head was...

1158
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:31,677
..and do some funky things
with it, little tricks,

1159
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,634
to make him be able to wear it.

1160
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:36,018
You can barely see it,
it's so tiny.

1161
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,657
But you know how big Julien is
compared to Alex's head.

1162
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:43,462
We got to this point and realized
we needed to let everybody know

1163
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:46,826
the monkeys were still out there.
They're still OK.

1164
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:51,784
They're back there toasting
with tea and root beer,

1165
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:56,518
until Phil smells his armpit
and is down for the count.

1166
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,630
We've heard that we may be
telegraphing a sequel here,

1167
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:05,244
by saying it's out of gas.
We thought it was a really funny joke.

1168
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:09,077
We had the boat sail off into the sunset
at one time, but it seemed very typical.

1169
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:09,838
We had the boat sail off into the sunset
at one time, but it seemed very typical.

1170
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:19,856
So this is something
at the end of production,

1171
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:24,201
they're sundries animation,
but a lot of it was just...

1172
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:28,047
A lot of animators
had some time and said,

1173
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:31,584
"What's your favorite character?
You want to make him dance?"

1174
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:35,817
You have seven seconds of dance time,
so these guys really worked extra hard

1175
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:39,335
and did these little great
dance numbers with the characters,

1176
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:42,588
which kind of helps you
through the titles.

1177
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:46,175
The titles on an animated film
can be exhausting

1178
01:19:46,682 --> 01:19:49,462
because there's so many people
deserving of credit

1179
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:53,548
and so many people working on it
that's it's an amazing process.

1180
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:56,343
As Eric said, that's why
we have two directors.

1181
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:59,715
We could each work
on separate teams.

1182
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:04,005
But Eric and I could always
get together, and with Mireille

1183
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,410
and kind of know
the film we wanted to make.

1184
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:10,910
So it was easy for us to split up
and divide and conquer in that way.

1185
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:14,807
And it sort of worked that way
with producers as well.

1186
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:17,594
Mireille would often be in one location

1187
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,759
and the co-producer
Teresa Cheng

1188
01:20:20,082 --> 01:20:23,772
would be up at the production facility
in Northern California,

1189
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:29,233
managing the production
and all the folks

1190
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:32,657
and the schedules
that were necessary.

1191
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,027
We did it in two locations.

1192
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:38,174
We have a DreamWorks campus
in Glendale, California,

1193
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:41,324
and then one
in Redwood City, California,

1194
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,170
about an hour plane ride apart,

1195
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,831
and a lot of high end technology
and video conferencing systems

1196
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:52,710
that allowed us to bridge
that gap a little bit.

1197
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:56,949
Often Tom and ! would find ourselves
in different locations,

1198
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,499
or Mireille and Teresa would be.

1199
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:02,075
Which was probably
in a total of, like,

1200
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:05,498
a four-year process,
four-and-a-half-year process

1201
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,044
of working on this film,
the last third of it

1202
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:10,977
is actually in production
with all the animators.

1203
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,210
All these people come aboard

1204
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,420
and help create this thing.

1205
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:19,839
So it takes a long time
to do one of these things.

1206
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,723
But when you see it all done,

1207
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:28,058
and the work everyone else has done,
it's really fantastic to see.

1208
01:21:28,684 --> 01:21:31,904
Every one of these names that
you're seeing is actually someone

1209
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:35,701
who contributed a great deal of time
and creative energy on the film,

1210
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:39,215
so that's a lot of them, yeah.

1211
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:42,974
And any one of them is
a tremendous artist in their own right

1212
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:45,339
who could go out
and do beautiful work

1213
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:48,797
without Tom and myself
telling them what to do.

1214
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:52,174
Our job really is
what the name says,

1215
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:56,271
direct people
all in the same direction,

1216
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:59,365
so that everybody's
telling the same story.

1217
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:03,412
We're caretakers
of the story in that sense,

1218
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:09,487
to make sure all this great creative
work is servicing that main idea.

1219
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,815
Ultimately it doesn't matter
how many polygons you have

1220
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,602
or how many people are in the crowd
or how beautiful the images are,

1221
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:20,232
if you don't have a story behind it all
that people care about

1222
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:22,906
and the characters that people love

1223
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,852
and care about what's
going to happen to them next.

1224
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:29,205
We get to feature some
of the great score work

1225
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:32,488
that Hans Zimmer and his team
did here in these credits too.

1226
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,168
It was great to bring
some of that music back in.

1227
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:39,361
This is a great piece.
A lot of it underscores the film,

1228
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,825
but it's nice to hear it
just clean like this.

1229
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,812
This is when they were
escaping from the zoo.

1230
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:51,172
Hans was trying to do
New York-sounding material.

1231
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:54,017
Looking at Gershwin,
trying to do his own version,

1232
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:56,303
and then finally he said,
"What am I doing?

1233
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,327
Anything I do will just be
a cheap imitation of Gershwin.

1234
01:22:59,775 --> 01:23:02,405
I'm going to come up with my
own sound for New York City."

1235
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:05,155
When he played this for us,
it just gave us chills.

1236
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,156
We thought it was a great piece,

1237
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:10,438
a great way to underscore,
quite literally, what they're doing

1238
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:13,439
when they're escaping
in the streets of Manhattan.

1239
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:31,489
I think there's a montage
of penguins music

1240
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,660
.
coming up soon.

1241
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:37,862
That was fun to work with too,
to find that tone that sort of...

1242
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,000
These guys have this
black and white mentality,

1243
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:44,346
this sort of '50s sensibility.

1244
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,719
And to find music that
kind of helped sell that...

1245
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:52,725
Originally we had crime jazz,
which had a lot of bongos in it,

1246
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:57,618
and so they latched onto that
kind of retro, detective music

1247
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,760
and added their own bit to it.

1248
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:02,309
A lot of people.

1249
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,617
A lot of people,
doing a lot of things.

1250
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,015
Here's some more.

1251
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,504
You do these things on computers,
but there's so much support for that,

1252
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,888
and these guys don't get,
you know...

1253
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:19,607
They invent ways to do new things
and make it

1254
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:24,129
so the art of computer animation
can just keep expanding.

1255
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,596
Much of the software we use
is all written in-house

1256
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,253
and maintained by computer artists

1257
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:33,937
and programmers in-house,

1258
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:38,613
which makes it possible
for us to do things

1259
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:40,974
that frankly would be impossible

1260
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,616
if we had to depend upon
off-the-shelf software.

1261
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,532
So a lot of those names
you see here

1262
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:47,984
are helping us achieve
those sorts of things.

1263
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,980
Helping the departments
communicate with one another.

1264
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:55,748
It's all about the pipeline
in something like this.

1265
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:58,438
The last thing you want
is to have teams of people

1266
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:01,817
sitting, waiting
for inventory to work on.

1267
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:05,286
So it's a monumental task
to keep that flowing

1268
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,987
and a lot of these people
help with that as well.

1269
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:46,731
Here we come with our final
little goodbye from Gloria.

1270
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:51,086
Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Hope you guys enjoyed it.
