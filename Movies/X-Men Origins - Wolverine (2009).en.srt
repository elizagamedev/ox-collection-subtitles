1
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:54,607
-You're always sick.
-You were sick when you were my age.

2
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,118
-Evening, sir.
-Evening, Victor.

3
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,545
I didn't realize you were still here.

4
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,912
I was just keeping James company, sir,
if that's all right.

5
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,668
Very kind of you.

6
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,477
-Any better, Son?
-Still cold, Father.

7
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,551
Just a mild fever.

8
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,622
-You'll be all right in the morning.
-You always say that.

9
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,104
And you always pull through, don't you?

10
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,473
-Yeah.
-Now, you taking your medicine?

11
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,090
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

12
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,086
-Your father's drunk again.
-Elizabeth!

13
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:39,272
-You should help him home, Victor.
-It's not my name he's calling, sir.

14
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,857
-Father!
-Stay where you are, James.

15
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,810
-Get off me!
-Father!

16
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,939
Now! You never loved him!

17
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,079
I told you never to come back here.

18
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,418
Get out!

19
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,468
James?

20
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,960
-No.
-James?

21
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,047
-There are things you don't understand.
-Don't.

22
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,777
-l need him to know!
-Please don't.

23
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,778
-No more lies.
-James...

24
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,578
-No!
-James!

25
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,219
He... He wasn't your father,

26
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,124
Son.

27
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,397
What are you?

28
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,581
-I didn't mean it! 1 didn't mean it!
-Yes, you did!

29
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,644
He deserved it, and you gave it to him.

30
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,524
We're brothers, Jimmy. You realize that?

31
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,571
And brothers protect each other.

32
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:50,474
You have to be hard now,
hard so nothing can ever touch us.

33
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,268
-l want to go home.
-We can't.

34
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,961
We stick together, no matter what,

35
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,087
and take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

36
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,744
Can you do that, little brother?

37
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,508
-I'm going down to the river.
-They're coming.

38
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,408
-Head over the hill. Hurry!
-Can you run?

39
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,130
-Keep on running and don't look back.
-Okay.

40
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,548
Back to back!

41
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,290
That's enough!

42
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,164
Enough!

43
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,908
No! No!

44
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,948
Stand down, soldier!

45
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,205
Victor!

46
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,772
Stand down! Stand down!

47
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,038
Stand down!

48
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:01,873
No!

49
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,700
Ready, aim...

50
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,235
Wake me when it's over.

51
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:43,863
.. fire!

52
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,006
Freaks! You're animals! Freaks!

53
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,525
My name is Major William Stryker.

54
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,659
You've been charged
with killing a senior officer.

55
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,815
Is that correct?

56
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,017
Apparently, we have some issues
with authority...

57
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,722
-Just keep a lid on it.
-
-...SIP.

58
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,647
The warden tells me that your sentence
was carried out by a firing squad

59
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,700
at 1000 hours.

60
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,924
-How'd that go?
-It tickled.

61
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,069
You boys tired of running?
Tired of denying your true nature?

62
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,747
-What do you care?
-Oh, I care.

63
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,094
I care because I know how special you are.

64
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,969
How valuable.

65
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,891
Look, you can stay here
locked up like freaks of nature,

66
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,137
so
or you can join me.

67
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,590
I'm putting together a special team
with special privileges.

68
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:52,942
Now, tell me, how would you like
to really serve your country?

69
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,497
You know, I love this weapon

70
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,025
more than any other thing
in the whole wide world.

71
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,046
-Do you wanna know why?
-No.

72
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,516
It's memorable.

73
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,661
Sure, it's a little bulky,
tough to get on a plane.

74
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,093
You whip out a couple of swords
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding,

75
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,617
they will never, ever forget it.

76
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,576
That's funny, Wade.

77
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,828
I think you confuse me
with someone who gives a shit.

78
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,733
Right, it's probably not
as intimidating as having a gun

79
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,571
or bone claws
or the fingernails of a bag lady.

80
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,610
-Manicure?
-Victor. Easy.

81
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,021
Fred got a new tattoo. I'm concerned.

82
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,903
Oh, Jesus, Fred,
you just met her last night.

83
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,779
-l love her.
-You love her after one night?

84
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,598
She's a gymnast.

85
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,842
Bradley, take her down.

86
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,517
Oh, God.

87
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,546
-Are you gonna puke?
-lf we were meant to fly,

88
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,429
-we'd grow wings.
-Don't worry, Nancy.

89
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,707
-More people die driving than flying.
-How about from impaling?

90
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,938
Hey, be nice,
or be your approximation of nice.

91
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,586
-Would you like a bucket?
-No.

92
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,794
Gentlemen, wheels down in Lagos in five.

93
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,626
-Why are we here?
-All in good time. Zero?

94
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,379
-Intruder! Perimeter breach!
-Man the weapon!

95
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,958
Intruder, stop!
Put your hands behind your head!

96
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,351
Having fun yet?

97
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,401
-Fred?
-The tank?

98
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,520
-The tank.
-Yeah, I got that.

99
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,765
Great. Stuck in an elevator
with five guys on a high-protein diet.

100
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,976
-Wade.
-Dreams really do come true.

101
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,231
Just shut it!

102
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,076
-You're up next.
-Thank you, sir. You look really nice today.

103
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,725
It's the green.
It brings out the seriousness in your eyes.

104
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,598
-Oh, my God. Do you ever shut up, pal?
-No. Not when I'm awake.

105
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,786
Bradley? Top floor, please.

106
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,710
Cover the elevator! The elevator!

107
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,479
Time to go to work.

108
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,001
Okay. People are dead.

109
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,867
If you didn't have that mouth on you,
Wade, you'd be the perfect soldier.

110
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,882
I wouldn't do that if 1 was you, brother.

111
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,239
-Take the diamonds. They're yours.
-l don't want your diamonds.

112
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,429
I want this.

113
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,950
But that is nothing. A souvenir.

114
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,531
Where did you find it? l want the source.

115
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:40,068
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

116
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,312
Tell him this rock is
more valuable to me than his life.

117
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,632
Ask him where he found it.

118
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:00,925
Okay.

119
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,845
He says it came from the sky.

120
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,874
He's telling the truth.

121
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,557
You don't know the language, Logan.

122
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,719
-It's a meteor fragment.
-l know what it is.

123
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,161
I'm asking him where he found it.

124
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,740
Sir, base wants to know our location.

125
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,113
-Shut them down.
-Yes.

126
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,571
Tell him everyone here will die

127
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,506
unless he tells me
where he found the rock.

128
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,348
-He says that it's sacred.
-Okay, fine.

129
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,679
Victor.

130
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,127
Victor!

131
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,806
Don't even think about it.

132
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,346
We didn't sign up for this.

133
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,582
Put him down!

134
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,842
What are you doing?

135
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,564
We finally got a good thing going here.
Don't you screw this up.

136
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,515
Enough. That's enough.
We've done enough.

137
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,642
Who do you think you are?

138
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,759
This is what we do.

139
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,700
Maybe you'd rather be
rotting in a hole somewhere

140
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,353
till they figure out a way to do it to us.
Is that it? Huh?

141
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,575
I'm done.

142
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,475
You coming?

143
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,433
Jimmy!

144
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,143
We can't just let you walk away.

145
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,028
Jimmy!

146
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,222
Jimmy!

147
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,579
Why are you up so early?

148
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,667
Come here.

149
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,776
See you, baby.

150
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,285
Hey.

151
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,721
Oh, that's nice. Yes. Take your time.

152
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,083
You're wrapped, man.

153
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,665
Okay, I'm totally gonna get this.

154
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,963
Nope. Come on.

155
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,929
Oh, wow! Let's go on the Ferris wheel.

156
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,549
-How does he do it?
-Come on.

157
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,221
..-amazing lady in a box!

158
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,525
Swing the hammer, ring the bell!

159
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,511
Hey, what do you do?

160
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,035
If you turn off the light, you win a prize.

161
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,627
-Three tries for a buck.
-Come on, I wanna do it.

162
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,195
There you go. Okay?

163
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,371
No, that's obvious.

164
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,586
That's two.

165
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,333
Well, that's a stupid trick.

166
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,776
It's not a trick, man.

167
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,245
Come on. Freak.

168
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,526
Bye.

169
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,502
Show's over!

170
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,932
I said show's over!

171
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,409
The show's never over for us, Bradley.

172
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,598
-Victor.
-Aren't you gonna invite me in?

173
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,303
Yeah. Come on in.

174
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:56,568
You know, I've never said anything
to anyone about what happened.

175
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,107
I'm living a totally
different life now, Victor.

176
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,479
No need to bring up the past.

177
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,200
You know,

178
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,289
l always thought it would
be Wade to come knocking at my door.

179
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,010
Well... Well,

180
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,778
Wade's gone.

181
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,326
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

182
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,088
I'm not afraid of dying.

183
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,025
How do you know?

184
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,427
You've never tried it before.

185
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,557
Was it the wars?

186
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,517
Which one?

187
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,486
All of them.

188
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,058
-Tell me.
-Hey.

189
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,849
It's just a scratch.

190
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,053
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

191
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,744
Yeah.

192
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,377
Who the hell is this?

193
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,409
Smells like government.

194
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,992
My God. Haven't aged a day!

195
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,694
Clean living.

196
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,403
-You remember Agent Zero?
-Still shooting first, asking questions later?

197
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,189
-You still chewing on cheap cigars?
-Boys, please.

198
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,188
-l have a job for you.
-l already have a job.

199
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,407
Lumberjack? 18 grand a year?

200
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,759
18.5. Plus I haven't had to kill anyone
in a while.

201
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,003
-Starting to miss it?
-Right about now I am.

202
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,332
-Yeah?
-Zero, back to the car.

203
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,474
Attaboy.

204
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,155
You know, I'm not proud about
the way things ended between us.

205
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,299
Conversation's over.

206
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,688
Playing Little House on the Prairie
with a schoolteacher,

207
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,119
I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.

208
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,284
And you would know, huh?

209
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,187
-l would.
-What do you want, Stryker?

210
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,784
Bradley was killed three days ago.

211
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,575
Wade before that.

212
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,447
I believe that someone is hunting down
our old team.

213
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,328
-Anyone else?
-As far as I know, Victor is safe.

214
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,057
But whoever it is has names, addresses.

215
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,274
I can take care of myself.

216
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,458
This is not about you, Logan.

217
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,907
Your country needs you.

218
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,495
I'm Canadian.

219
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,139
I know you, Logan! I know who you are!

220
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,519
-Miss Kayla, Miss Kayla, look what I did.
-What did you do?

221
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,244
Bye, Miss Silverfox! Bye!

222
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,740
What's wrong?

223
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,990
Stryker came by today.

224
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,616
Don't worry. I said no.

225
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,521
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

226
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,014
Because I'm the best there is at what I do,

227
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,827
but what I do best isn't very nice.

228
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:43,352
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

229
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,392
A gift. You can return a gift.

230
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,421
Come on, fellas.

231
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,085
All right.

232
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,190
Stay in the car.

233
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,831
I'm just gonna ask nicely.

234
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,882
You mind letting us go by?

235
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,268
-You in some kind of a hurry there, pal?
-Hey, hey, hey.

236
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,678
Are you?

237
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,016
Just move your truck so we can go by.

238
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,141
We're trying to have
a conversation there, all right?

239
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,408
You start something,
you'd better be ready to finish it.

240
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,946
Listen...

241
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,791
Hey, guys, take it easy! Calm down.

242
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:36,329
-Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.
-l know.

243
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,218
Big temper, too. So please let us pass.

244
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,434
-Thank you.
-Come on, man, let's go.

245
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,247
How'd you do that?

246
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,216
Female powers of persuasion. It's a gift.

247
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,600
Oh, I see.
Do you have those powers over me?

248
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,600
Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you?

249
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,883
Why is the moon so lonely?

250
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:22,527
Why?

251
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,192
Because she used to have a lover.

252
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,650
-You tell this to the kids?
-No.

253
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,594
His name was Kuekuatsheu
and they lived in the Spirit World together.

254
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,654
Oh, this is a true story? All right.

255
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,483
And every night they would
wander the skies together,

256
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,614
but one of the other spirits was jealous.

257
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,758
Trickster wanted the moon for himself,

258
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,909
so he told Kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers.

259
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:55,303
He told him to come to our world
and pick her some wild roses,

260
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,578
but Kuekuatsheu didn't know
that once you leave the Spirit World,

261
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,509
you can never go back.

262
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:08,905
And every night he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name.

263
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:13,967
But

264
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,485
he can never touch her again.

265
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,521
Wow.

266
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,456
Koo-koo-ka-choo got screwed.

267
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,001
“Kuekuatsheu.”

268
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,585
It means “the Wolverine”.

269
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:37,965
What you doing, Logan?

270
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,401
Kayla.

271
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,863
Oh, God.

272
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,206
Kayla!

273
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,924
You're not from around here, are you?

274
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,738
What gave me away?

275
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,166
Victor!

276
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:57,115
-You got insurance on this place?
-Insurance? No.

277
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:01,384
-Too bad.
-Victor!

278
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,673
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

279
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:22,091
Guys, whatever this is, take it outside.

280
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:34,831
Why?

281
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,317
Why?

282
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,633
You don't call. You don't write.

283
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,702
How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

284
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,833
Il hate to say it, Jimmy, but, frankly,
I'm a little disappointed.

285
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,029
Stay down.

286
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,372
Tell me something, Jimmy.
Was she worth it?

287
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,408
When are you gonna figure it out?

288
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,185
We're not like them.

289
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,239
lam nothing like you.

290
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,723
Sure, you are.

291
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:52,996
You just don't know it yet.

292
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,234
-What do we got?
-Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

293
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,614
What is this, a joke? Guy's fine.

294
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,023
-Where is he?
-Hey, hey, don't...

295
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,973
-l said, where is he?
-I don't know who he is.

296
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,859
I can help you.

297
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,350
Six years I've been here.

298
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,967
No one knew me, and then you show up,
and the next day she's dead!

299
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,663
I tried to warn you.

300
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,655
Why didn't you tell me it was Victor?

301
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,924
-I didn't know!
-Bullshit!

302
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:43,589
-Why?
-l swear on my son's life, I didn't!

303
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,606
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

304
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,588
I had to lock him up.
He felt 1 betrayed him.

305
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,618
Went AWOL.
He said he was coming after all of us.

306
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,473
You didn't come to warn me,

307
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,778
you came to save your own ass.

308
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,113
So what's your plan, Captain?

309
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,266
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't!

310
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,708
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

311
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,499
I can give you the tools to defeat him.

312
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,312
And we can still save the others.

313
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,629
You mean save yourself, right?

314
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,544
I promise you two things.

315
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,690
You will suffer more pain
than any other man can endure,

316
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,233
but you will have your revenge.

317
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,828
I come with you, I'm coming for blood.

318
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,300
No law. No code of conduct.

319
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,792
You point me in the right direction,
you get the hell out of my way.

320
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:32,674
When it starts, whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

321
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,571
focus on that. Maybe it will help.

322
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,267
Trust me, I've been through worse.

323
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,204
No, you haven't.

324
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,710
We're ready.

325
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,950
We're gonna make you indestructible,
but first we're gonna have to destroy you.

326
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,355
You remember
what we were looking for in Africa?

327
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,005
-l remember.
-Well, I found it.

328
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,953
It helped us create
a metal compound so strong

329
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,820
that you will be able to withstand
virtually anything.

330
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,026
It's called Adamantium.

331
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,460
I can't put Victor down myself, Logan.

332
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:19,464
To kill him, you're gonna have to embrace
the other side.

333
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,183
Become the animal.

334
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:27,968
Let's do this.

335
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,062
l almost forgot.

336
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,201
I want new ones.

337
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,867
What do you want them to say?

338
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:40,513
Wolverine.

339
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,069
Generals, welcome.

340
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,259
General Munson.

341
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,029
Today we're gonna witness
medical history.

342
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,195
-Today we're gonna create Weapon X.
-X?

343
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,036
Roman numeral 10.

344
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,363
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton.

345
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,345
Let's begin.

346
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,033
-We're brothers, Jimmy.
-Logan!

347
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,559
Body temperature, 108 and rising.

348
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,981
Why is he thrashing like that?
Why isn't he sedated?

349
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:22,397
He feels pain just like the rest of us,
but anesthesia won't work on him.

350
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:26,194
-That's why he had to volunteer.
-Heart rate, 190. 195.

351
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,941
-Will he survive this?
-I don't know.

352
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,614
200.

353
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,217
Son.

354
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,056
Heart rate well beyond maximum.

355
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,942
-Blood pressure?
-260 over 180 and rising.

356
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,418
He can make it. He can make it.

357
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,155
Victor!

358
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,028
I love you.

359
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,679
You're not an animal.

360
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,944
It means “the Wolverine”.

361
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,826
Well, l guess he can die.

362
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,286
Come on, old friend. Come back.

363
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,582
Heart rate rising.

364
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,395
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

365
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,223
No rejection. Procedure completed.

366
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,924
-We did it.
-We did it.

367
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,281
Yeah! Yes.

368
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,277
Are we taking him to the island?

369
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:33,226
The island? No.

370
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,819
The bonding works.

371
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:39,108
We'll use his DNA for the XI.

372
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,740
Erase his memory.

373
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:48,982
Erase his memory.

374
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,408
I think he heard you.

375
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,297
Lock down!

376
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,092
Hunt him down. Take his head off.

377
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,370
Travis.

378
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:53,206
-I think there's a naked man in the barn.
-Yep.

379
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,666
Son?

380
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,785
What in hell you doing?

381
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,765
-It's cold.
-Cold.

382
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,348
-You got no clothes on.
-Yeah.

383
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,399
-You're not on the drugs, are you?
-No.

384
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,330
-No, just had a rough night.
-Yeah, you could say that.

385
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,774
Come on up to the house.

386
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:58,152
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

387
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,823
Here. Cover it up with that, huh?

388
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:04,686
I don't want you giving
the old lady a heart attack.

389
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:53,620
-You all right in there?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm fine!

390
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,846
Supper's on the table.

391
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:59,105
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

392
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,781
I swear, I'm gonna pay for it.

393
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:17,682
-Set it down over there.
-Right.

394
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:23,466
Come and sit down, son.

395
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,963
I can't thank you both enough
for everything.

396
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:35,193
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

397
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,319
-"Decent."
-What?

398
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,270
Nothing. I'm just not
really used to that word.

399
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,033
That's a nice chopper you've got out there.

400
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,408
-You know motorcycles?
-Oh! Lord, here we go.

401
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:52,984
My favorite's a '48 Panhead.
Bought one new off the line.

402
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,341
I think you're a little young for that, son.

403
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,359
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

404
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,096
In the barn.

405
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,555
Nothing you can break out there.

406
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,360
Why is the moon se lonely?

407
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:22,922
Why?

408
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,734
Because she used to have a lover.

409
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,028
He can never touch her again.

410
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,191
You sleep okay?

411
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,738
Yeah.

412
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,144
You look like a man
fixing to do a bad thing.

413
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:06,087
You know what happens
to men who go looking for blood?

414
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,444
-What?
-They find it.

415
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,317
We all got a choice, son.

416
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,639
-Yeah, well, mine got taken.
-Bullshit.

417
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,837
This was my son's jacket.

418
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,624
Try it on.

419
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,702
-Thank you.
-Yep.

420
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:53,056
You want to take my bike for a spin?
Test the suspension?

421
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:56,182
"64, huh?

422
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,623
Man, you're heavy.

423
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,885
Yeah, I put on a little weight recently.

424
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,130
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

425
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,024
Oh. It fits you beautifully.

426
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:14,013
I brought you some...

427
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:26,301
Weapon X is in the barn.
He's just murdered two civilians.

428
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,710
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

429
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:55,041
Come get me.

430
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,194
Blow his brains all over the road!

431
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,665
Damn it!

432
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,067
Alpha one, do not lose him!

433
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,413
Alpha two! Target coming to you!

434
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:51,764
Pull up!

435
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,800
Pull back! Pull back!

436
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:44,977
Zero?

437
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,418
Zero, come in.

438
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,120
Zero?

439
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,487
-Zero, is Logan dead?
-I don't know.

440
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,463
I'm down.

441
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,857
Zera, is he dead? Is Logan dead?

442
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,040
Zero, come in.

443
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,415
You tried to kill me.

444
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,789
-Logan?
-Where's Victor?

445
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,611
Come back to base.

446
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:27,936
I'll explain everything.
We'll take Victor down together.

447
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:31,538
Wrong answer.
After I kill Victor, I'm coming for you.

448
00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:36,662
Logan, listen to me.

449
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,427
If you go down this road,
you're not gonna like what you find.

450
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:44,448
You wanted the animal, Colonel.
You got it.

451
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,473
Those were good people back there.
Innocent people.

452
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,534
It's funny how good, innocent people tend
to die around you.

453
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,666
Zero never stood a chance.

454
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:34,661
The only thing that'll take him down
is an Adamantium bullet.

455
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:45,212
This facility's compromised.
Prep transport.

456
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,384
Colonel, this is turning into a disaster.

457
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,997
-Don't worry. We'll stop him.
-Really?

458
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,896
You just spent half a billion dollars
making him indestructible.

459
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:06,582
-Sir?
-Yes?

460
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:10,133
The young mutant you've been looking for.
We've found him.

461
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:12,774
General, Logan isn't
the only piece of this puzzle.

462
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,063
I need to evacuate this facility.

463
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,471
Please go back to Washington.
We've got work to do.

464
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:24,301
Yo hablo, talk. Tu hablas, you talk.

465
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,851
-
El habla... Somebody translate.

466
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,428
Summers!

467
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,190
Sit up and take off those glasses.

468
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,346
I have a headache.

469
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,340
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

470
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:41,412
while you write out this conjugation
100 times.

471
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,562
-Somebody else?
-He talks.

472
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,644
-
Thank you. He talks. £f habla.

473
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,467
-You sure it was Victor?
-Yeah.

474
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,521
Damn. I'm sorry, man.

475
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,461
What the hell happened to him after I left?

476
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,660
He got worse.
He felt like you abandoned him.

477
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,616
Hell, we all did.

478
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,314
But Victor, he had to prove
he was better than you.

479
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,579
Hunting and killing
everything he was pointed at.

480
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,025
Quit a few months later myself.

481
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:26,421
Couldn't take rounding them up.

482
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:29,214
-Rounding who up?
-Leave it alone.

483
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,710
Rounding who up, John?

484
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:34,156
Hey! Damn it, John!

485
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:36,438
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

486
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,457
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

487
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,460
Mutants? Why?

488
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,280
Stryker said we'd be making a difference,

489
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,973
protecting people from the bad ones.

490
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:59,854
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

491
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:04,203
-Remember that stuff in Africa?
-Yeah, l remember Africa. What about it?

492
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,200
Damn.

493
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,721
What'd they do to you, man?

494
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,546
Don't ask.

495
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,447
Listen, Zero said something
about an island.

496
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,095
Does that mean anything to you?

497
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,350
Nope. But maybe Dukes knows.

498
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,376
-Him and Zero were real tight.
-Fred Dukes? Where is he?

499
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,056
-He's here.
-Well, let's go talk to him.

500
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,990
Hold on. He don't get in till around 4:00.

501
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:33,367
But I got to warn you, he developed
a bit of an eating disorder.

502
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:37,620
We all got our coping mechanisms.
I'm trying to whup him back into shape.

503
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,321
Whatever you do,
don't mention his weight.

504
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,078
Come on, Fred, if you wanna get
in shape, you got to move, man.

505
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:47,094
I told him he got to move.
He's got to move! What?

506
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,900
Fred Dukes? That looks like
the creature that ate Fred Dukes.

507
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,933
Hey, be nice, man.

508
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,627
Hey, fat... Fred.

509
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:03,096
I seem to remember that girl
when she was about 85 pounds, huh?

510
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:07,201
Oh, that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

511
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:08,657
You know where Victor is?

512
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,797
-No idea.
-What's the island, slim?

513
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,419
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

514
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:19,767
Listen, I ain't leaving here
till you tell me where Victor is.

515
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,670
So come on, bub, for old times’ sake, huh?

516
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:27,520
Did you just call me Blob?

517
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,056
No, but...

518
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,547
I told you not to mention his weight.
Why'd you call him Blob?

519
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,080
I didn't call him Blob. I said “bub”.

520
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,402
-God damn it.
-Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Logan.

521
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:45,854
I got an idea.

522
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,814
-This is your idea of an idea?
-I'm trying to help you out, Logan.

523
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,583
Dukes don't like you that much
and you know it.

524
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:53,842
-Yeah, the feeling's mutual.
-Well, use them gloves, man.

525
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:57,937
Dance with him a little bit.
Allow him to let his anger out on you.

526
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:01,185
Figure if you do that, he'll probably
tell you everything you want to know.

527
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,208
Come on, man, look at him.

528
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:05,897
Got a big old ass coming out
the front of his shirt.

529
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,409
Jesus. He's gonna have a coronary,
for Christ's sake.

530
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,287
Is there even a stretcher big enough
to take this guy out of here?

531
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,459
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out of here ona stretcher.

532
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,009
-You're an asshole.
-Come on, Logan.

533
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:22,274
-Whup his ass!
-You want it?

534
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,282
Dance with him, Fred!
Just like I taught you.

535
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,085
You want to dance with me?

536
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,745
-Come on, Fred!
-Oh! Oh, that feels good.

537
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,785
Hey! Guess what?

538
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,635
See, he gonna talk now.

539
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,973
-You got him right where you want him.
-Whose side are you on, anyway?

540
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,622
Come on!

541
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,163
Come on, now, lamb chop!

542
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,035
Damn!

543
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:16,141
Now, where's Victor?

544
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:50,441
Little dark for sunglasses, don't you think?

545
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:10,196
-Please, don't! Please, don't!
-Victor!

546
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,407
Hey, hey! Where's Victor?

547
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:22,951
Yeah. Victor's with Stryker on the island.

548
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,839
They run it together.

549
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,950
What? They what?
Victor will be with Stryker?

550
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:32,231
Yeah.

551
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,873
You didn't know that?

552
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:59,000
All that's left now is Logan.
I trust you can handle that.

553
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,180
-I did before, didn't 1?
-Oh, yes. You did that.

554
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,881
Our deal. It still applies, right?

555
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:16,370
Of course.
Now bag him and tag him, Captain.

556
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:27,282
What's the island?

557
01:04:28,732 --> 01:04:31,952
It's where Stryker takes
them after Victor's caught them.

558
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,459
Wait, hang on a minute. Takes who?

559
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:38,614
Mutants.

560
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:43,209
Rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

561
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,705
I mean, you never wondered
what happened to them?

562
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,605
I tried not to.

563
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:10,192
They killed her so I'd let them
put Adamantium in me.

564
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,403
They killed her for a goddamn experiment.

565
01:05:20,884 --> 01:05:24,604
-Where is it? Where is it?
-Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

566
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:33,202
But a prisoner escaped there once.

567
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:35,937
-Who?
-His name was Remy LeBeau.

568
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,292
He was a street hustler from New Orleans.

569
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:41,158
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

570
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,774
because he kept taking
all their money at poker.

571
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,739
-That's all I know.
-What's Stryker up to, Fred?

572
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:46,594
What's the endgame?

573
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:52,765
He's taking their powers.
Trying to combine them somehow.

574
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,906
That's all l know, Logan. That's all Il know.

575
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,110
If I have to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

576
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,230
I'm coming with you, Logan.

577
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,364
-There's no redemption where I'm going.
-l ain't asking.

578
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:49,928
There's our dude.

579
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:57,935
That's cool.

580
01:06:58,248 --> 01:07:00,028
I'm gonna go cover the back
in case he rabbits.

581
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:02,223
-I'm not gonna fight with him.
-Yeah, right.

582
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:04,365
What? I get in fights with everybody?

583
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,561
Don't dogs kill cats?

584
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:09,062
Just go cover the back, will you?

585
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,566
-Give me 500.
-I'm in.

586
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:23,324
Are you Remy LeBeau?

587
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:27,672
-Do l owe you money?
-No.

588
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,252
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

589
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,593
Large blind's 100. Small blind's 50.

590
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,413
-May I deal you in?
-What can I get for 17 bucks?

591
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:00,118
$17?

592
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,661
A cab ride home, perhaps?

593
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,824
You my brother's new babysitter, John?

594
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,191
l ain't Bradley, Victor.

595
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:15,266
And your creepy black coat
don't scare me.

596
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:16,675
Really?

597
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,300
Worked on Dukes.

598
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,559
You shouldn't have done that,
‘cause now I'm gonna kill you

599
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,770
before Logan even gets a chance.

600
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,587
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

601
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,343
Victor Creed.

602
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,500
And who's that?

603
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:34,403
The man I'm gonna kill.

604
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:39,245
He works with a man named Stryker
on an island.

605
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:44,224
-Just need to know where it is.
-And why would you think I know that?

606
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:47,243
Well, ‘cause I know who you are, Gambit.

607
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:52,825
You're the guy who escaped and you're
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

608
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:57,687
You know, John, there's something
l always wanted to tell you.

609
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,870
You're predictable.

610
01:09:10,078 --> 01:09:12,249
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

611
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,919
That's funny. Never knew you had one.

612
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,788
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

613
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:27,283
The men who took me wore
tags just like them.

614
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,417
Hey, now, bub, you listen to me.

615
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,994
Damn it. That little...

616
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:10,320
Two years I rotted in that hellhole
and I ain't never going back.

617
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:16,218
Shiny.

618
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:20,922
Tell me something, Jimmy.

619
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,964
Do you even know how to kill me?

620
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:26,723
I'm gonna cut your goddamned head off.

621
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,366
See if that works.

622
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,255
You're getting slow, old man.

623
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:51,979
You son of a bitch.

624
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:58,375
You're gonna die for what you did to her.

625
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:24,059
Victor!

626
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,000
Well, that's a nice stick.

627
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,940
Okay, shithead, here's the deal.

628
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,283
See, you're gonna take me to this island,
where I can kill Creed, Stryker

629
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:44,450
and pretty much everyone you hate
in this world. Do you understand?

630
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,091
You're really gonna kill them?

631
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,826
As long as you stay out of my way, yeah.

632
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:05,507
Colonel?

633
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:08,212
-General?
-Is this Weapon XI?

634
01:13:11,087 --> 01:13:13,607
All their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

635
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,726
You really hate them, don't you?

636
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,698
No, I don't hate them.

637
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:22,081
After 20 years of working with mutants,
I just know what they can do.

638
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:30,075
We can win this war before it starts
and save countless lives in the process.

639
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:33,773
Pre-emptive action is
the only action here, General.

640
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:37,560
The days of our country
sitting on the sidelines are over.

641
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:42,555
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

642
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:45,612
-l admire your passion, I do.
-Thank you.

643
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,746
But this is as far as it goes.

644
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:53,159
-Weapon X was a hiccup.
-We know about your son, Bill.

645
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,363
We know he's a mutant,
and we know he killed your wife.

646
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,559
-You shouldn't have kept that from us.
-That...

647
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:03,995
That has nothing
to do with my work, General.

648
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:05,447
Bullshit.

649
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,812
You're too close to this.
I'm shutting you down.

650
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:13,849
Okay. You're right. I won't lie to you.

651
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:21,076
My son did bring
the problem home for me,

652
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:24,579
but I took an oath

653
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:28,289
to protect the American people

654
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:32,279
from every threat, both foreign

655
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,206
and domestic.

656
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:51,966
-You don't like flying, huh?
-I'm fine.

657
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:53,517
-Just concentrate on what you're doing.
-You sure?

658
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,188
You got a bit of sweat
on your brow there.

659
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,921
Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...

660
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:58,746
On the what? The clouds?
Keep my eyes on the clouds?

661
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:00,431
You're up and down
like a freaking yo-yo here!

662
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,809
-Where'd you get this thing, anyway?
-Oh, this is my baby.

663
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,568
I won her in a game. Jacks over fives.

664
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,316
Great.

665
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:10,941
Relax. We're almost there.

666
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,599
There it is. The island. Three Mile Island.

667
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,281
Hiding in plain sight.

668
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,695
No one's gonna snoop
around a nuclear reactor.

669
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:27,884
They think it's gonna turn them
into freaks.

670
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:30,004
-Like you?
-Right.

671
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,399
All right. You ready?
Because it's now or never. Let's go.

672
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:37,061
About time.

673
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:49,575
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
this is really gonna hurt.

674
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,542
Well, yeah, it kind of does, actually.

675
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,636
-Good luck.
-Likewise.

676
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,308
Oh, shit.

677
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:10,120
How you doing? Everything all right?

678
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,191
-Is he ready yet?
-A few more hours.

679
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,413
-And he will respond to my commands?
-Absolutely.

680
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:22,587
Logan.

681
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,849
Welcome back to the war.

682
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,633
Before I gut you, I want to know why.

683
01:17:31,714 --> 01:17:33,734
I needed your powers for the Pool.

684
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:36,256
-For the what?
-The mutant killer.

685
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,890
Deadpool.

686
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:42,056
Years of searching and refining,

687
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:45,851
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body

688
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:48,298
without ripping it apart.

689
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:52,165
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

690
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,240
Logan, you were the last.

691
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,535
You made Weapon XI possible.

692
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:04,445
l asked you to help,
but you said you wanted the quiet life.

693
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:08,236
Well,

694
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:13,368
I've learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge.

695
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:32,803
Who are you?

696
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,746
Oh, she's real, old friend.

697
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:50,767
Did you really think
we'd just let you walk away?

698
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,270
You're a dangerous man.

699
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:56,029
We like to keep an eye on dangerous men.

700
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,212
Tell him about the day you died.

701
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:08,097
They gave me a shot
of hydrochlorothiazide.

702
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,768
It reduces the heart rate so low
it appears you flatlined.

703
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,911
Don't be angry with her.

704
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:31,568
She's a real credit to your species.

705
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:38,257
Did you know that her sister has
diamond-hard skin?

706
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,851
Kayla's mutation is tactohypnosis.

707
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:45,505
She can influence people
as long as she touches them.

708
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:48,260
Quite a useful tool in a seduction.

709
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:50,704
It was never real, my friend.

710
01:19:56,425 --> 01:19:58,065
It was real for me.

711
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:04,228
I told you if you came down this road,
you wouldn't like what you found.

712
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:15,230
That story you told me about a man
who gets flowers for the moon,

713
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:19,492
l had it backwards.

714
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,971
I thought you were the moon
and I was your wolverine.

715
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:31,064
But you're the trickster, aren't you?

716
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:34,170
I'm just the fool who got played.

717
01:20:36,532 --> 01:20:39,142
The worst part of it is,
I should have known.

718
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:44,568
But l ignored my instincts.

719
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,440
lignored what I really am.

720
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,521
But that won't ever happen again.

721
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,221
-Colonel?
-Not now, Kayla.

722
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,742
I've done everything you've asked.

723
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:36,786
My sister.

724
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,590
You said if 1 helped you, you'd let her go.

725
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:45,103
Kayla, it's not as simple as that.
Her mutation is unique. Quite beautiful.

726
01:21:45,768 --> 01:21:47,698
We just need a little more time
to analyze it, that's all.

727
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,469
You let him go?

728
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:55,225
-Victor, please.
-You can't let him go.

729
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:57,340
-You can't beat him, Victor.
-Then give me the Adamantium!

730
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:58,879
-Your tests came back.
-We had a deal!

731
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:01,458
You would never survive the operation.

732
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:06,736
-l can take anything he can.
-No, you can't.

733
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:11,416
You're my favorite soldier, Victor.
Be patient. Your time will come.

734
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:13,393
He's using us.

735
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:25,224
How about this time you die for real?

736
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:28,505
Let me go.

737
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,533
Your little mind games don't work on me.

738
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,089
Victor!

739
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:11,428
Feels good, doesn't it?

740
01:23:12,955 --> 01:23:14,415
All that rage.

741
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,821
-Do it.
-Logan!

742
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:23,719
-You're not an animal.
-Oh, yes, you are.

743
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,500
Do it.

744
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:34,802
Finish it.

745
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:00,675
Logan?

746
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:07,546
My sister. They have my sister.

747
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,094
Please. I didn't trick you into loving me.

748
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:14,121
It was real for me, too.

749
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:20,005
Please, I'm so sorry. They have my sister.

750
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:23,284
Where is she?

751
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:31,154
-Activate Weapon XI!
-The bonding process isn't complete.

752
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:32,967
Just do it! Now!

753
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:37,920
Come on. Come on!

754
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:30,478
Okay.

755
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:32,797
Perfect.

756
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:34,605
-Kayla, get these kids out of here.
-Logan...

757
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:36,532
Find another way out.

758
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,132
Okay. Let's go.

759
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,608
Wade, is that you?

760
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:48,594
Guess Stryker finally figured out
how to shut you up.

761
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,219
Now...

762
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:00,698
Wade?

763
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,730
You don't have to do this.

764
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,616
All right, maybe you do.

765
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:15,499
You're shitting me.

766
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,552
Shoot on sight!

767
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:33,429
-I can help! Point me at them!
-Go.

768
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:43,130
Go! Now!

769
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:51,834
-Did I get them?
-Yeah.

770
01:28:02,344 --> 01:28:03,654
-Let's go.
-I can't go.

771
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:06,224
-Kayla, come on!
-l have to stay here.

772
01:28:07,082 --> 01:28:08,482
You take them.

773
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:11,584
Go! Go!

774
01:28:39,748 --> 01:28:40,977
Go left.

775
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:42,269
Left.

776
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:44,775
-What?
-We go left.

777
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:46,896
-You can't see.
-Trust me.

778
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:03,883
Let's see you dance up here.

779
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:42,492
Nobody kills you but me.

780
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,923
Back to back!

781
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,030
-I got him!
-Oh, no, you don't.

782
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:32,578
Stop! This can't be the way.

783
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:34,244
-This is the way.
-How do you know?

784
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,102
I just know. Come on.

785
01:31:47,769 --> 01:31:49,319
Adamantium bullets.

786
01:31:50,205 --> 01:31:52,955
Let's see him heal with
a few of these through his thick skull.

787
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:55,661
You can't stop him, even with that.

788
01:31:56,378 --> 01:31:58,487
-He'll heal.
-His brain may heal,

789
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:02,991
but his memories won't grow back.

790
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:22,741
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

791
01:32:24,439 --> 01:32:27,129
-We're done.
-We can never be done, Jimmy.

792
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:32,003
We're brothers,
and brothers look out for each other.

793
01:33:06,481 --> 01:33:08,231
-You miss me?
-Ah, Jesus.

794
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:12,064
You know, when you said
you were gonna kill everyone,

795
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:14,624
I thought you may
just have been exaggerating.

796
01:33:15,023 --> 01:33:16,253
Yeah.

797
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:19,365
Do I look like a man who exaggerates?

798
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:21,456
-You're welcome.
-Logan?

799
01:33:24,199 --> 01:33:25,308
Logan.

800
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,577
There's kids trying to get off the island.
Split up. Go!

801
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:33,202
I'm on it.

802
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:43,159
Kayla! Kayla!

803
01:33:47,522 --> 01:33:48,512
Hey.

804
01:33:53,695 --> 01:33:54,955
I love you.

805
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:09,002
-Hey...
-I'm so cold.

806
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,940
Listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

807
01:34:12,413 --> 01:34:13,702
Understand?

808
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:16,822
Just go easy. Nice and easy. That's it.
That's it.

809
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,844
Okay. I'm gonna get you help.

810
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:46,809
Logan!

811
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:45,591
I should make you pull the trigger.

812
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:49,254
But that would make us
no better than you.

813
01:35:50,712 --> 01:35:52,292
Throw the gun away.

814
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:57,013
Turn around.

815
01:35:57,819 --> 01:36:01,859
Walk until your feet bleed.
And then keep walking.

816
01:36:40,495 --> 01:36:42,075
ft will be all right, Scott.

817
01:36:42,397 --> 01:36:44,797
My name is Charles Xavier.

818
01:36:45,233 --> 01:36:46,983
I'm a mutant like you.

819
01:36:47,335 --> 01:36:50,995
-l can hear your thoughts.
-Yes, and can hear yours.

820
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:55,772
You're safe now. Come. We have to go.

821
01:36:57,278 --> 01:36:58,918
Come on, let's go.

822
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,920
The kids are safe.

823
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:53,580
Damn.

824
01:37:57,171 --> 01:37:59,801
-Who are you?
-What do you mean, who am I?

825
01:38:00,274 --> 01:38:03,174
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now, we got to go.

826
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:05,925
Where the hell am I?

827
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:08,147
Listen to me. I'm a friend.

828
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,223
-I'm a friend.
-Yeah? What's my name?

829
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:14,282
-What's my name?
-Your name is Logan.

830
01:38:19,026 --> 01:38:21,306
You need to trust me. We have to go.

831
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:28,330
Follow me.

832
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:35,091
Now!

833
01:39:08,976 --> 01:39:10,375
Do you know her?

834
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:15,655
No.

835
01:39:20,521 --> 01:39:22,361
Hey, these boys aren't gonna like
what you've done to this place.

836
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:24,393
We really need to go.

837
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:26,936
I'll find my own way.

838
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:33,362
Good luck.

839
01:41:04,759 --> 01:41:06,159
Colonel Stryker?

840
01:41:10,698 --> 01:41:13,858
-Colonel William Stryker?
-Yes.

841
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:17,236
You're wanted for questioning
in connection with the death

842
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:19,742
of General Munson, sir.

843
01:46:56,543 --> 01:46:57,413
Another.

844
01:47:00,614 --> 01:47:01,603
You're American?

845
01:47:03,317 --> 01:47:04,777
Canadian, I think.

846
01:47:06,186 --> 01:47:07,795
Are you drinking to forget?

847
01:47:10,357 --> 01:47:13,927
No, I'm drinking to remember.
