00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,615
December 25th, 1945

2
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,982
Tomoko, the sun has set

3
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:24,361
I can't see Taiwan now

4
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,873
Are you still waiting for me there?

5
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,085
Fuck you!

6
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,867
Fuck you, Taipei!

7
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,265
We can’t pass through

8
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,497
Yes, we can

9
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,939
Yes, we can

10
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,530
No, we can’t. Too low

11
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,411
Yes, we can. Really

12
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,640
Let's give it a try

13
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,443
Try what?

14
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,461
We'll get stuck. Try your ass!

15
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,179
Are you getting in or what?

16
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,268
Tomoko, come on!

17
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,489
Wait a minute...

18
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,217
Come on! We don’t have all day here

19
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,320
Tomoko, out!

20
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,721
OK, sorry

21
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,438
Back off please

22
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,322
Got good light. Keep it close together

23
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,820
Tight together. Come on. Excellent!

24
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,165
Good. Keep it close. Thank you

25
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,120
That way!

26
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,096
Now, come on! Keep it close now...

27
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,027
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

28
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,726
Come on! Jeez!

29
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,272
Tomoko, we're trying to shoot here
What do you think you're doing?

30
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,779
All right, ladies. Never mind

31
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,434
Let’s do it professionally, all right?
l want everybody in and smiling

32
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,739
Good!

33
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,916
Old Mao...

34
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,315
Old Mao...

35
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,316
Registered mail!

36
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,494
Come on!

37
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,045
A healthy young man has to work

38
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,434
Don’t force me, please

39
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,303
There’s no vacancy

40
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,368
How could it be?

41
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,953
Old Mao is 80 and he refuses to retire

42
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,025
He doesn’t see you waving hands
nor hear you calling him

43
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,001
He can’t be a mailman anymore

44
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,082
Hey...

45
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,292
You can’t go swimming

46
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,520
You have work tomorrow and later on

47
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,497
What if you got sunburn?

48
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:37,813
What we want is a dip in the water

49
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,397
What are you hollering at?

50
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,516
Don't be a bitch!

51
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,479
Stop looking at the girls! Watch the road!

52
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,073
Hey! I'm also a model!

53
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,155
How can you do it to me?

54
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:52,775
Watch out!

55
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,758
What the hell are you doing?

56
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,443
Damn it!

57
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,828
I told them they'd get sunburn

58
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,030
They wouldn't listen. What can I do?

59
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,202
You don’t care about anything

60
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,950
But you want me to be responsible

61
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,195
What do you want me to do?

62
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,770
Hey, you!

63
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,395
You smoked in my bathroom?

64
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,330
Don’t you think I'll tell the manager?

65
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,027
Just paint it. Don’t waste your time

66
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,847
Come on. It's done

67
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,780
Grandpa, he’s here!

68
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,784
First day at work and you're late

69
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,372
You too

70
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,837
You're late for school

71
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,827
From Hengchun Professional School...

72
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,213
...to Junior High through Hengnan R. and
to Elementary School through Beiman R....

73
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,396
...to Zhongzheng R. and then Hsinhsing R.

74
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,875
This is the returned mail
Give it back tomorrow

75
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,899
Any question?

76
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,044
That's it. Go!

77
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,268
You're late already

78
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,425
Hey! You forget this!

79
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,297
Fuck! You're dead!

80
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,579
Jerk! So late on the first day!

81
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,152
Damn! Got me out and left me here

82
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,227
Where are you from?

83
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,789
Post office’s motorcycle broke down

84
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,425
Fuck! I thought you were mute

85
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,378
Why aren’t you wearing the helmet?

86
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,690
Driver's license, please

87
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,741
What about him?

88
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,416
And them?

89
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,403
And her?

90
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,257
And she ran through a red light too!

91
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,579
There are plenty of them. Why me?

92
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,778
Because you're in a bad luck

93
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,661
Driver's license!

94
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,035
Don’t have it?

95
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,254
And driving without license too

96
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,173
What's your name?

97
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,238
What's your name?

98
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,994
What the fuck is your name?

99
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,411
Shameless!

100
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,158
Fuck!

101
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,397
What are you doing?

102
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,652
I'll kill you!

103
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:37,893
What the hell are you doing?

104
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,462
What are you doing?

105
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,287
Rauma, stop it!

106
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,675
ll kill this motherfucker!

107
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,206
You're not in SWAT team anymore!

108
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,234
Come here!

109
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:51,767
Sorry...

110
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,162
You! Maintain the traffic!

111
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,508
Goddamn it!

112
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,906
What the fuck?

113
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,018
I'm sorry

114
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,762
He’s in a bad mood

115
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,093
Are you all right?

116
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,150
Why don’t you listen to me?

117
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,507
Come on!

118
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,098
Come on! Don’t be a fool!

119
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,015
What's wrong?

120
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,978
Can't start it!

121
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,298
It's tricky

122
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,940
Why is it wrapped like this?

123
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,658
Wow! It’s convertible!

124
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,268
Do you have our mails?

125
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,702
No!

126
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,477
Can you fix it or not?

127
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,996
All my tools are in there

128
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,862
Then go get it!

129
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,883
My owner has the keys

130
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,550
You arrived just now?

131
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,248
When'll your owner be here?

132
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,754
He lives in there!

133
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,968
Then why don’t you ring the bell?

134
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,339
Amitabha, please...

135
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,311
Amitabha. I’m not Police

136
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,611
I'm Frog, and I have no money

137
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,439
l replace you?

138
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,725
I've been in politics longer than you

139
00:13:58,871 --> 00:13:59,721
I don’t replace you

140
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,805
I let you be the mayor first

141
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,644
Mayor, excuse me. This needs your stamp now

142
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,614
Put it on my desk

143
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,952
All right. Put it there

144
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,488
Stamps? Everything needs my stamp

145
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,839
Japanese singer's concert at the beach

146
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,841
It's Mayor's most important job
You have to learn how to do it

147
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,107
Mayor, if you approve this...

148
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,857
..all the representatives will kill you

149
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,164
Tomoko...

150
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,289
Please forgive my cowardice

151
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,144
I dared not admit we were in love

152
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,776
l even forgot how I became obsessed...

153
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,287
..with that rebellious girl...

154
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,154
...who upset me all the time

155
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,817
Tomoko...

156
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,372
You were stubborn and vain

157
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,145
But I couldn't help being crazy for you

158
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,978
You graduated from the school...

159
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,518
...when we lost the war

160
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,908
We're losers

161
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:41,054
Our aristocratism is no more

162
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,935
I'm nothing but a poor teacher

163
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,181
Why should I be the scapegoat?

164
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,636
l have nothing to do with the war

165
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,981
I'm but a poor teacher

166
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,511
I love you, but I have to leave you

167
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,781
O, Lord, let us praise together...

168
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:27,821
...and call thy name

169
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:50,353
A...

170
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,729
...men!

171
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:06,212
Everybody, let's pray together

172
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,650
Malasun!

173
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,839
Miss, how are you?

174
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,147
l have an appointment with Mr. Huang

175
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,158
Can you tell him I’m here?

176
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,206
Wait a second, please

177
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,902
Hello? Is Mr. Huang available now?

178
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,399
Miss, it's a new brand

179
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,391
We repackage the aborigine’s millet wine

180
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,890
The goal is to go international

181
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,261
Thousands years of history with new sensation

182
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,339
We named it Malasun

183
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,607
I'll pour one for you

184
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:46,525
No, thanks...

185
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,532
Yes? I have a Mr...

186
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,699
Malasun! Ma-la-sun...

187
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,138
...Mr. Malasun, who says
he has an appointment with you

188
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,187
OK. The B1 office

189
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,500
B1 office. No problem

190
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,573
The elevator is there

191
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:09,934
Where's the general manager?

192
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,586
You...

193
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,412
Mr. Representative, can I help you?

194
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,108
Have a seat, Mr. Representative!

195
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:26,418
What is love?

196
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,943
It's nothing but a game

197
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,486
Honey, darling, baby or pumpkin

198
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,603
Whatever you call me

199
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:37,773
Which floor?

200
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:38,763
The basement

201
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,504
Can't you walk?

202
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:41,917
Don’t you have legs?

203
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,231
Sth floor!

204
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:59,347
Oh, I’m scared of nothing because I love you

205
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:06,312
But if you love someone else
lI kill you for sure

206
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:13,676
Oh, I’m scared of nothing
because I love you, baby

207
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:19,883
Please indulge me to show your love

208
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,710
Amen!

209
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,509
Who says Hengchun has no talent?

210
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,528
Dada, why are you here?

211
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,990
The church is done?

212
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:39,905
Not yet

213
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,379
Then why are you here?

214
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,900
Lord kicked me out of there

215
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,664
Mr. Representative, why so mad?

216
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,147
The hotel is yours, but the sea is ours

217
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,976
You think rich people
can make everything BOT?

218
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,655
What are you talking about?

219
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,980
We have to go global now

220
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,556
It's a global village

221
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:02,904
What global village?

222
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,696
You outsiders build up hotels here

223
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,139
The lands BOT. The mountains BOT

224
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,777
Now the sea BOT too

225
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,379
What about us natives? Be employed?

226
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,623
-Are we living on the same Earth? -Hey!

227
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,196
Where are you going?

228
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,047
Here it is!

229
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,983
Open the door then!

230
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,160
The sea is so beautiful

231
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,914
Why can’t people see it?

232
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,297
Why?

233
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,002
Because rich people bought it too

234
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,415
They left us nothing

235
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,990
The annual Spring Scream is in Hengchun

236
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,670
What about us natives?

237
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,112
What do we get?

238
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,496
We can only cheer with the crowds

239
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,955
And all we get is garbage everywhere

240
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,094
Come on! We have nothing
to do with Spring Scream

241
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,298
This year we invite...

242
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,737
...a famous singer from Japan

243
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,643
What's his name again?

244
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,345
His voice is like the sea...

245
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,665
I don’t care if your Japanese singer...

246
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,663
..iS going to be a doctor or a sailor

247
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:10,862
What I’m asking you...

248
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,556
...iS to have a local warm-up band

249
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,106
Do you understand me?

250
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,204
But there’s no local band here

251
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,045
I want gaiety this time

252
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,338
That's why we need killing bands

253
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,202
You have no such talents here

254
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:32,766
What are you talking about?

255
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,092
You? We?

256
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,876
What happened to your global village?

257
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,145
What do you mean?

258
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,093
I mean...

259
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,931
All right, whatever

260
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,870
l assure you that I can get...

261
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,742
...a great local band for you

262
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,620
No. it’s impossible

263
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:47,856
Yes, it’s possible

264
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,737
No, it’s impossible!

265
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,885
Yes, it’s possible!

266
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,620
Believe me when I say it’s possible

267
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,465
Or let's run for the Mayor next year

268
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,700
Wait and see who will be elected

269
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,312
Come on! Please!

270
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,380
I promised those people in Taipei

271
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,180
Why don’t you cancel it?

272
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,339
We've paid them. How could it be cancelled?

273
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,242
-Yeah! — -Listen, it’s all right

274
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,744
If you don’t want a local band...

275
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,833
...[ won't let you party at beach...

276
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,556
..even if l have to kidnap the Mayor

277
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,515
Let’s go!

278
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,337
Wait a minute...

279
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,275
Listen to me, please

280
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,769
Do you know how much money I’ve spent?

281
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,165
l even get lots of foreign models...

282
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,748
.. for people to take photos with

283
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,200
It's Integrated Marketing, you know?

284
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,362
I'm running for the Mayor next year

285
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,958
Think about it. I'll give you 1 minute

286
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:42,120
Have you heard of Kousuke Atari?

287
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,989
Don’t you understand what I’m saying?

288
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,887
Wait...Wait a minute!

289
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:49,591
All right!

290
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,606
I'll have your band

291
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:53,815
I'll have your band

292
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,463
No...our band

293
00:23:55,734 --> 00:24:00,093
No...our band

294
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,190
Ma-la-sun

295
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,847
Try it...

296
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,347
What do you think? Is your mouth...

297
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,514
.filled with the beautiful flavor?

298
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,436
Wow! You really can drink

299
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,265
Let me get you one more

300
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,313
Why?

301
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,956
OK. I'll be right there...

302
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,719
Yes?

303
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,729
What? They’ re leaving!

304
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,175
OK. I'll be right there!

305
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,198
What the hell?

306
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,389
I'm a model too

307
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,925
Why can’t I go on the runway?

308
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,514
Why do you always ask me
to be a caretaker and an interpreter?

309
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:21,906
You're good looking

310
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:25,081
But the current fashion doesn’t suit you

311
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,491
You look good actually

312
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,543
You're still young, you know?

313
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,515
I'm old!

314
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,246
I'm so upset that I age early

315
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,056
I stay here in Taiwan after graduation

316
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,638
because you said that 1 was special

317
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,873
Now you say I’m not in trend...

318
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,666
..and that l can only be an interpreter?

319
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,901
Please, don’t start with me

320
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,264
It's an emergency. We had no choice

321
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,002
But it’s a lifetime chance

322
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,949
The Japanese label doesn’t believe...

323
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,877
.. they can get proper musicians...

324
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,292
..in such a place like Hengchun

325
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,343
Do me a favor, please

326
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,744
Supervise everything there

327
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,413
Be a caretaker

328
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,678
Anyway, you can’t ask me to stay
without asking for my consent

329
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,894
You can’t do that

330
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:06,851
The key to Miss Tomoko’s room

331
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,056
You know the Japanese are so picky

332
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,601
We don’t know how to deal with them

333
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,596
When you speak ill of the Japanese...

334
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,331
... don’t forget I'm Japanese too

335
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,972
Why should we cancel our plans?

336
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,967
You're late every day. Lazybones!

337
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,377
What do you think you're doing?

338
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,989
I don’t work here

339
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,491
Schedule your route today

340
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,509
I'll see if it's appropriate

341
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:44,482
The 3rd day

342
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,355
How could I stop myself
from thinking about you?

343
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,179
You're a student from the sunny South

344
00:27:55,941 --> 00:28:00,541
while I’m a teacher from the snowy North

345
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:04,448
We're so different

346
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,117
But why do we love each other so much?

347
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,750
I miss the sunshine and the warm winds

348
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:21,568
l remember you were upset by the ants

349
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,682
I know I shouldn't laugh at you

350
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:30,002
But the way you stamped on the ants...
It fascinated me

351
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,413
It's as if you were dancing...

352
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:40,779
.. with anger and airing joyfulness

353
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:47,947
That was when I fell in love with you

354
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,343
Attention, everyone

355
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:46,268
We have an audition at 7:30 this evening

356
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,215
All those who can play any instrument
are welcome to attend

357
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,019
Your ID card, please

358
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:53,664
My ID card is needed?

359
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,675
Don’t you have it?
Then how do I know if you're native

360
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,625
Move! Don’t you see I’m limping?

361
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,040
Get out of my way!

362
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,987
This kid is impossible. Move!

363
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,364
Hsiang, eat it by yourself

364
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,015
Number 107? All right...

365
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,155
All right...

366
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,550
You're the best. Eat it by yourself

367
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,808
Ma’am, my friend registered for me...

368
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,865
...to play the drums in an audition

369
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,887
Okay, you're free to go

370
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,339
Do you want to see me performing?

371
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,161
Who would take care of these kids?

372
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,504
Take them with you then

373
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,266
-Do you want to go? = -Yes!

374
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,951
Hey, you! Stop!

375
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,841
Stop...

376
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,805
Ask your people to be quiet, please

377
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,421
Stop the racket!

378
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,564
Quiet!

379
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,960
Quiet! Do you hear me?

380
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,436
Where are those 3 kids from?

381
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,118
Get them out of here!

382
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,348
Let me tell you something...

383
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:52,893
Be quiet when someone's performing

384
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:53,781
Otherwise it'd seem so rude

385
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:54,645
Old Mao!

386
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,416
Finished already?

387
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:03,481
Finished?

388
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,445
Applaud!

389
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,656
Number 10, it’s your turn

390
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,641
Number 10? Shit! It’s me!

391
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,873
Number 10...

392
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:27,369
Take care of these kids for me please

393
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,017
Number 10...

394
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,658
Number 10!

395
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,702
What are you doing?

396
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,640
Number 10! It's me!

397
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:42,342
Who’s spraying water?

398
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,577
Sorry...

399
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,255
That's not water. It's saliva

400
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,730
You're disgusting!

401
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,473
I didn’t think you would come

402
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:50,965
Take it

403
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,498
Or I will crash it

404
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,682
How dare you?

405
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,517
Well, go ahead and do it

406
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:11,302
See that?

407
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,663
There goes Hengchun’s drum player

408
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,767
Go with me

409
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,455
Are you going on stage?

410
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,322
It won't hit you...

411
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,553
See? I told you. What are you afraid of?

412
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,524
Hey, Mr. Postman

413
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,826
Playing guitars is supposed to make you happy

414
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,561
Old Mao, please!

415
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,908
Put it away!

416
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,400
My wife and your father died early

417
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:17,105
My kids are working elsewhere

418
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:20,971
Your brothers are away either

419
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,629
Only your mother and I are left here

420
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,033
We're so lonely

421
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,669
The house is big...

422
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,203
..and the bed is large...

423
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,945
Come on!

424
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,390
Speaking about the house makes angry
Why should you mention the bed too?

425
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,318
The priest says...

426
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,613
.. that it's not good to be alone

427
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,209
That was why their God created women

428
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:55,044
People are meant to be social

429
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,787
That's alll can say

430
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,736
l hope you understand

431
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,994
He’s the only one who can play drums

432
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,142
You can’t ask him to because of that

433
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,970
You don’t think he’s good enough?

434
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,118
That's not the point

435
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,154
What matters is
how he charms the audience on stage

436
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,716
But...

437
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,651
He looks like an insect

438
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:46,363
What insect?

439
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,398
You look down upon him already

440
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:50,671
Frog!

441
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,549
The rehearsal is 7:30 at the Hotel basement

442
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,302
I picked you among others

443
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,883
Don’t let me down

444
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,088
Remember, put your feelings into it

445
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:04,365
Come on!

446
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,631
This aborigine is good at mouth organ

447
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,741
Mouth organs are not for a rock band

448
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,050
Says who? He played drums yesterday...

449
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,633
..and guitar and mouth organ. It was great

450
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,239
Everyone loved it

451
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,263
Ask him to play the bass guitar then

452
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,659
What does a mouth organ player
know about the bass guitar?

453
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:33,953
Goddamn it!

454
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,176
Those DoReMis are the same anyway

455
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,862
I bet he knows how to play them both

456
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,224
You think I know nothing about music?

457
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,032
What the hell are you doing?

458
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,310
You play the bass guitar
Your son plays the guitar

459
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,350
I don’t know how to play bass guitar

460
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,688
It's OK. Everything will be fine

461
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,147
All right, that’s it then

462
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,080
And the lead vocal...

463
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:54,118
Go get Mr. Representative’s...that kid!

464
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,946
Wait a minute...Who’s that?

465
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:58,505
Was he there yesterday?

466
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,743
The one who got mad playing the guitar

467
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:04,978
Can he sing?

468
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,666
Don’t look down upon him

469
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,861
He was a lead vocal in a Taipei band

470
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,490
He can write, play and sing

471
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:11,995
How often do you meet a talent like him?

472
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,383
What are you complaining about?

473
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,115
Did I say anything?

474
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:20,807
This is men’s talk

475
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,069
What are you moaning about?

476
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,390
Your tooth aches?
Why don’t you see a doctor?

477
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,247
Ignore her. Come on...

478
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,654
The one who plays keyboard is too old

479
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,451
Old? How about this one? She’s 40

480
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,499
Look how beautiful our sea is

481
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,681
Why can’t young people stay here?

482
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:50,987
Tomoko, take a look at our sea...

483
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,542
I don’t understand your dialect!

484
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,720
Excuse me...

485
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:44,382
7 o'clock tonight at Chateau Hotel

486
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,329
You'll join the band on our behalf

487
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,049
What about my grandpa? Is he in?

488
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,241
Come on! It’s a rock band

489
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,014
Old Mao can only play yukin

490
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:56,413
Son of a bitch!

491
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:57,997
Malasun!

492
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,959
What did you say?

493
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,261
It's Malasun

494
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,840
Damn! It's 7:30 now

495
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,982
Till 9 o'clock? What's wrong with you?

496
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,237
Enough! I want to talk to your manager

497
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:12,382
Frog!

498
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,713
-Have your feelings with you? -Yeah...

499
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,724
Put your feelings into it, all right?

500
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,520
You're in it too?

501
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,105
I'm Frog

502
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,383
The drummer

503
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,011
Frog!

504
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:26,606
-How are you? = -Frog!

505
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,939
When were you back?

506
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:30,788
My daughter

507
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,522
She's so cute

508
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,021
Leave her alone

509
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,326
I'm the drummer, your mom’s friend

510
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,756
How do you do? I’m Frog the drummer

511
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:51,346
Insect! Go back where you came from

512
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,596
I'm sorry

513
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,226
Where's Aga?

514
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:04,761
God knows!

515
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,406
Forget it. Let’s start the rehearsal

516
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,866
Rehearse what? It’s our first day

517
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:31,236
Yeah, we don’t have the score
and we don’t know each other

518
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,259
Hi, I'm Hong Kuo-rong

519
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,440
The town council chairman

520
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,082
Hi, I'm Frog the drummer

521
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,194
I know! I picked you personally!

522
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,487
I'm the town council chairman
I'm 170 centimeters tall

523
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,444
l weigh 75 kilograms and I’m 60 years old

524
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:54,601
What I love most to do is...

525
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,955
... quarrel, fight, kill people and set a fire

526
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,404
And my ambition...

527
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,187
..is to burn down Hengchun...

528
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:03,837
..and to ask all the young people...

529
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,788
...to come back here to rebuild it

530
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,288
We'll be the employers, not the employees

531
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:11,825
Do we know each other now?

532
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,033
Yes! It hurts!

533
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:14,994
All right already! Calm down!

534
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:16,843
Yeah, calm down...

535
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,742
You said something too!

536
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:03,032
What are they doing downstairs? Band?

537
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:04,471
Mr. Malasun?

538
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,532
Can you lower your voice?

539
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:07,814
You scared me!

540
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,033
Here!

541
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:13,672
Do you clean the cup before
it's passed on to someone else?

542
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,316
Yeah

543
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,355
They're rehearsing now

544
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,502
Il see

545
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,091
I'll report to you in a couple of days

546
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,149
I've informed our Taipei Office

547
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:31,578
Yeah

548
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,730
Yeah, I see

549
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:56,496
What the hell are you doing?

550
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,121
Mind your tempo

551
00:46:58,783 --> 00:46:59,953
Stop fooling around!

552
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,217
Take your call outside!

553
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,312
You're getting nearer and nearer

554
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:04,981
It's next to me today

555
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,509
I've had enough!

556
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,078

I'm Hakka in Baoli. Here’s my calling card

560
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,098
This is our new product

561
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,803
Revolutionary millet wine

562
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,095
It's called Malasun

563
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,006
Age-old tradition with new sensation

564
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,668
This is for you. Try it please

565
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:38,764
He’s waiting for you upstairs

566
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:41,024
Thank you

567
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,012
Mr. Representative...

568
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,829
I'm the only salesman in Hengchun

569
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,185
I'm wondering if you can help me...

570
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:48,665
..and introduce me to other hotels

571
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,706
My boss wants this new product...

572
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:53,395
...to be high-class

573
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:56,048
Please. Do me the favor

574
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:57,964
Baoli belongs to Checheng

575
00:48:58,202 --> 00:48:59,022
This is Hengchun here

576
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,779
Why should I help you?

577
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,175
Have some pride, young man

578
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,926
Stop kissing someone's ass for money

579
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:18,513
Yeah, not bad

580
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,220
I've been watching them rehearsing

581
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,156
Yeah, the first song will be ready this week

582
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:34,963
The second one by this weekend

583
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,145
The weather's gone mad and the sea is boiling

584
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,401
That's why I want to seize the day

585
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:42,663
Stop wasting time

586
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,692
Be a skywalker...

587
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,426
Stop...

588
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,567
What?

589
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,933
I'm adding something here

590
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:58,194
Be a skywalker...

591
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:18,514
Amen!

592
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,952
All right, whatever. As you wish

593
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:25,712
One more time!

594
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,324
-When the sky is empty... -Wait...

595
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,680
After that...

596
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:32,388
...l'll try something cool. Come on!

597
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:34,941
Hey!

598
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,093
Can you try it after we do it once?

599
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:39,719
It's been 3 days

600
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:41,874
We haven't finish anything yet

601
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,663
You, with the keyboard!

602
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:44,868
Mind your tempo

603
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,812
The bass guitar is lagging

604
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,415
Drummer can’t stop criticizing

605
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:49,842
What the hell do you want?

606
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,841
What? Stop moaning!

607
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,727
You look down upon us, don’t you?

608
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:56,839
You're the best, all right?

609
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,424
Only you can say anything

610
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,489
What do you want?

611
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,357
What? Wanna fight?

612
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,614
I'd like to point out 3 things

613
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,013
First, the keyboardist is too young

614
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,973
. while the bass guitarist is too old

615
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,615
We have to find someone else

616
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:27,711
Second, you're a mess

617
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,712
We should rehearse more often

618
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,587
Third!

619
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:37,712
They want you to write 2 songs

620
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,565
But there’s only one now...

621
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:45,116
.. written by you a long time ago

622
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,767
But what matters is the other song

623
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,678
Can you do it?

624
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:56,596
Can you do it if l can’t?

625
00:51:57,548 --> 00:51:58,687
I'm not in charge here

626
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:08,281
Ride to hell!

627
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,025
Aga...

628
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,114
When are you normally off duty?

629
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:22,802
Around 5 o'clock

630
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,354
5 o'clock?

631
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:27,883
You're fast, aren't you?

632
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,663
Put the mails inside the mailbox
to avoid them being stolen

633
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,243
I've got complaints about losing mails

634
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,373
Hey, girl!

635
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:55,848
Who do you want?

636
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,706
Excuse me...Is Aga here?

637
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,914
He’s off to work. What do you want?

638
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,300
He won't be back until late afternoon

639
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,527
I'm the coordinator of the band

640
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:11,106
This CD is for his reference

641
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,328
Please give it to him

642
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:17,294
So, you're that Japanese girl?

643
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:19,668
Come on. Come in, please

644
00:53:19,997 --> 00:53:23,096
No, thanks. I'll write him a note

645
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,347
Won't you come in and have a seat?

646
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:32,308
No, thanks

647
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,811
You're Japanese...

648
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,569
...but you write well in Chinese

649
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:18,224
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

650
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,654
I didn’t mean to hurt you

651
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,253
My betel nut...

652
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:23,453
What is it?

653
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,207
I'm fine

654
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,460
Are you all right?

655
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:28,974
I can't see

656
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,571
Wipe them clean! I can’t see...

657
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,268
Help him up

658
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,800
My legs are fine

659
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,922
Get on!

660
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:41,167
Wipe them clean!

661
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,561
Excuse me...well...

662
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,940
Thank you

663
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,909
What happened? Are his hands hurt?

664
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:01,551
Damn!

665
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:03,796
What happened to your nose?

666
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,934
He’s hurt already
and you put an X on his nose?

667
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,502
His wound is right here

668
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:09,578
l have to avoid his eyes and nose tip

669
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:10,727
What else can do?

670
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:15,737
What are you laughing at? He’s in pain

671
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,615
The staircase is too steep

672
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,387
You really know how to play this?

673
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,063
Can you do it?

674
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:37,195
It's not what you're thinking!

675
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,037
Aga!

676
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,496
Aga...

677
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,904
Please! Don’t tell anyone!

678
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,386
He’s young and ignorant
Why don’t you help him?

679
00:56:58,749 --> 00:56:59,738
Don’t I have anything better to do?

680
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,580
I'm old and limping
and you want me to help him?

681
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,015
How many times have I told you?

682
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,205
What if it’s notifying someone's...

683
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,653
.. wedding, giving birth or death?

684
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,495
We have phones. Who writes letters anymore?

685
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:11,554
Damn you!

686
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,572
Are you working for the post office
or the phone company?

687
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,411
Old Mao, don’t tell anyone please

688
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,370
Come on. I don’t need money

689
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:18,384
Buy whatever you like with it

690
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,498
I like playing music

691
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:21,253
Buy a new instrument then

692
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:22,588
Who am I playing for?

693
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:23,979
Who wants to listen to...

694
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:25,517
...us old people playing?

695
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:26,986
The newspaper says I’m a gem

696
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,297
Who gives a damn?

697
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,400
If 'm a gem, I should go out and show them...

698
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:33,325
.. instead of staying at home

699
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:45,825
All right...

700
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:48,456
Only hundreds of them
They won't give you so hard a time

701
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,582
l heard someone got in jail
for opening private letters

702
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,413
I told you it’s not that!

703
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:55,575
What is it then?

704
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:57,563
Porno?

705
00:57:58,442 --> 00:57:59,702
Yeah, yeah...

706
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,814
How I wish a storm would come now...

707
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:11,227
...and drown me in the ocean
between Taiwan and Japan

708
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:18,360
Then I won't have to be
responsible for my cowardice

709
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:22,308
Tomoko...

710
00:58:23,467 --> 00:58:25,247
I've been sailing for several days

711
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,903
The weeps brought by the sea wind

712
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,426
age me already

713
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,575
I don’t want to leave the deck

714
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,084
or go to bed

715
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:43,034
I've made up my mind

716
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:45,804
Once ! land...

717
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:48,176
..I'll no longer see the ocean

718
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:54,837
Sea wind, why do you always bring the weeps?

719
00:58:56,666 --> 00:59:00,356
They weep for being in love,
for marrying someone

720
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,371
or giving birth

721
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:09,754
l weep when I think of you
marrying someone else

722
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:14,107
But the sea wind dries my tears...

723
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,565
...before they drop

724
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:23,205
I can’t cry any tear, which ages me even more

725
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:26,942
Curse the wind!

726
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,484
Curse the moonlight!

727
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,234
Curse the seal

728
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:05,597
I told you already!

729
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:07,663
The bass guitarist was too old

730
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,941
Now you have someone even older

731
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:12,384
It was not me who asked him here

732
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:14,049
I'm not in charge here

733
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:15,484
You're not in charge?

734
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:22,234
All right, I'll see
how you're going to sing on stage

735
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,700
I love my girl

736
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:32,069
I love you so much

737
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:35,763
When we were in the park...

738
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:39,113
...do you know what happened?

739
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,966
l saw the moonlight...

740
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,265
You...

741
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,829
You really want him
to use that as a bass guitar?

742
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,620
I bet that old man...

743
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,285
...never touched a bass guitar

744
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,877
Our Japanese singer will be here soon

745
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:08,941
What can we do now?

746
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:11,303
What about your other song?

747
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,565
l haven’t seen anything!

748
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,310
Have you listened to the CD I gave you?

749
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,679
Look at him!

750
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:27,892
Don’t tell me writing songs
is not your job

751
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:31,957
What are you doing?

752
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:36,125
Look!

753
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:37,903
It's salt!

754
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:41,881
He spent his time at the beach

755
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,550
You've been late everyday

756
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,354
I thought you were busy writing songs

757
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,181
Now I know that you were at the beach

758
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,716
How can you be so mean?

759
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,223
I quit!

760
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:00,895
Get out of my way!

761
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,525
Why didn’t you say anything?

762
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:11,045
Do you understand anything she said?

763
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,493
Wow! The Japanese eats everything!

764
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:21,962
l see the moonlight sprinkling

765
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,875
l have something to tell you

766
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:29,502
Please think about it, girl...

767
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:30,750
What are you doing?

768
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,644
Play this

769
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,259
How do you play this thing?

770
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:47,305
Hey! Are you leaving?

771
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:52,582
Hey! Japanese girl!

772
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:55,618
Your job is not done. Why are you leaving?

773
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:15,645
Miss Tomoko, what's wrong with you?

774
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,202
Miss Tomoko!

775
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,788
Miss Tomoko...

776
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:24,013
The grandson of my younger brother
is getting married today

777
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,924
We have the reception this evening

778
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,759
Please come and enjoy with us

779
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,872
We'll be waiting for you

780
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,805
Congratulations

781
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,240
I'm the bass guitarist of the band

782
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,067
I want to practice a little

783
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,154
Look, Mr. Representative!

784
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,038
This Hakka is so diligent

785
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,513
He works day in and day out

786
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:22,487
Diligence is the only strategy he knows

787
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:24,263
The bottles of wine he’s sold today...

788
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,187
...are more than the mails at Aga’s

789
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:27,846
Shit!

790
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,901
Nothing...

791
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:56,004
Hey! Malasun!

792
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,928
Chateau Hotel. May I help you?

793
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:23,525
60 bottles?

794
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:29,152
OK...Thank you. Bye

795
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:48,327
Let me show you one more time

796
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:49,645
Why can’t I do it right?

797
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:50,743
What can I do?

798
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:53,444
Malasun!

799
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:55,707
What the hell?

800
01:06:55,912 --> 01:06:57,022
Let me show you. It’s...

801
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,257
Malasun! You hit the jackpot!

802
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:00,721
Mr. Representative called...

803
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,120
...and asked for 60 bottles of wine

804
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:03,315
For the wedding reception

805
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:04,752
60...

806
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:08,343
I'm sorry...

807
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,292
60! 60 bottles...

808
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,428
Malasun, you know Mr. Representative well?

809
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,620
Please give this old man a chance

810
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:35,059
Don’t tell him you can play, please

811
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:38,066
Malasun! Hi, everyone!

812
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:39,181
It's on Mr. Representative

813
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,995
Our company’s new product Malasun millet wine

814
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:42,841
Aga!

815
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,048
Come on...Bon appetit!

816
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:53,065
Miss Tomoko...

817
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:54,502
This is Aga’s mother

818
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,321
I've seen her. She visited us once

819
01:07:58,374 --> 01:07:59,394
Sit there!

820
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:16,908
Harder!

821
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:20,177
Next! Mr. Chen Kuang-hui

822
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,150
Here ] am! I’m Chen Kuang-hui

823
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,856
Dad, my head aches! Stop!

824
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:27,612
All right!

825
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,040
I don’t need help!

826
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:34,018
Idiot!

827
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,222
Wow! You really can drink!

828
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:20,581
Why are you dressed like this?

829
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,830
I don’t know. Well...

830
01:09:23,158 --> 01:09:24,268
Sit there...

831
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:28,853
There’s no seat here

832
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,794
I'll... sit there instead

833
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:33,724
Hi, Ma’am

834
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,020
Why are you dressed like this?

835
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:39,676
Uncle Frog, you’re handsome!

836
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,618
Thank you, Mr. Lin

837
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,640
You're so cute!

838
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:47,267
Stop, you chicken! I'll get you!

839
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,055
Go on...Cheer for Daddy

840
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,277
Go on, cheer for Daddy

841
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:58,711
Now...“Whirling Neon Light”

842
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,393
You have suits like this one?

843
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,706
The boss is drunk again

844
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:10,614
This is for you

845
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:39,098
The December sea is filled with anger

846
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:46,330
I tolerate the shame and regrets...

847
01:10:50,113 --> 01:10:51,923
... accompanied by uneasiness

848
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:54,726
Not sure I’m going home...

849
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:02,704
...or leaving home

850
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,772
Hey, friend...

851
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,114
This is my princess

852
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,843
Isn't she pretty?

853
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:24,929
If you see her, please tell her...

854
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:28,708
...that I no longer take risks

855
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:32,092
I'm back here for a peaceful life

856
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:33,168
Please?

857
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,692
Mr. Representative...

858
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:36,741
It's the last bottle. Cheers!

859
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:39,202
No, I have more

860
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:41,976
Il do it

861
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,164
I'll leave it here

862
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:48,559
Enjoy yourself. Thank you

863
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:51,489
This Hakka is really...

864
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:59,399
It's all right. Pll go. You eat

865
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,119
He always gets drunk and falls

866
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:07,632
Come on. Drink...

867
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:08,757
Mr. Representative!

868
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:12,329
How are you? Long time no see

869
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:13,922
Fine. I’m great

870
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,423
This is my wife

871
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:16,625
Is she pretty?

872
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,032
Yeah...

873
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,604
Here. Propose a toast over there

874
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:21,840
They're waiting for you. Go ahead...

875
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:23,498
I'm sorry...

876
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:28,853
He was at the SWAT team in Taipei

877
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,138
You know them, always taking risks

878
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:34,195
Sometimes they were gone all day long

879
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:37,557
His wife left him because of it

880
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:38,874
He’s always in a bad mood

881
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,018
Once he fell from the 3rd floor
while he was chasing the perpetrator

882
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:42,068
I want to sing

883
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:45,438
He was hurt badly
Stayed at the hospital for six months

884
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:48,525
Then he was reassign here, back home

885
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:15,463
Tomoko?

886
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:19,864
-Tomoko? = -Get off me!

887
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,566
-Tomoko!  -l said get off me!

888
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:38,546
First love is filled with emotions

889
01:13:39,382 --> 01:13:44,361
I flush when she says she loves me

890
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:47,751
The girl is happy

891
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,559
But she pretends to be angry

892
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:55,883
Oh...yeah...she’s pretending

893
01:13:56,632 --> 01:14:01,701
First love is filled with emotions

894
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:06,015
I flush when she says she loves me

895
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,885
Fuck! I’m looking at the characters!

896
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,828
Your owner's wife is older than you

897
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,181
And she has 3 kids too

898
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,624
What matters is her husband is still alive

899
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:20,054
What the hell are you thinking?

900
01:14:21,324 --> 01:14:23,284
Have you seen breeding frogs?

901
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,482
A couple of male frogs
get on one female's back

902
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,286
Those male frogs...

903
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,397
Do they fight one another?

904
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:33,104
No!

905
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,402
Then why should we human beings...

906
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:37,468
... insist on monogamy?

907
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:42,276
Right on!

908
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,013
Aga! Come out!

909
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:04,228
Come out!

910
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,354
Why don’t you come out?

911
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:10,621
You're too proud!

912
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,437
Why did you treat me like that?

913
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:19,394
Aga!

914
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:23,134
You're so cocky!

915
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:36,442
Why did you do this to me?

916
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,330
I'm simply doing my job

917
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,361
What are you laughing at?

918
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:07,074
Damn you!

919
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:29,670
I got you!

920
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:38,419
Look at this

921
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:40,995
This is my princess

922
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:44,591
She’s pretty, isn’t she?

923
01:16:46,402 --> 01:16:48,592
Isn't she pretty?

924
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:52,804
If you see her, please tell her...

925
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:58,852
Why did you do this to me?

926
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,600
Why did you do this to me?

927
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,210
rmagirl...

928
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:18,192
.. away from home

929
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,063
I'm working here

930
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,277
And I work very hard

931
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,927
Why did you do this to me?

932
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,790
Why did you do this to me?

933
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:59,386
Evening. We're on the Sea of Japan

934
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,858
My head ached badly earlier today

935
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:06,623
I hate this thick fog

936
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:09,806
It blocked my sight during the day

937
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:14,023
But the stars are beautiful

938
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:19,853
Remember when you were in 7th grade...

939
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:24,217
you challenged my lunar eclipse theory

940
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:27,593
...with the myth of Moon being eaten?

941
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,021
I'll tell you another scientific truth

942
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:36,144
Do you know the stars we see now...

943
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:38,622
...are lights reflected...

944
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:40,468
...from billions of light-years away?

945
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:46,901
Wow! Billions of light-years away!

946
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:50,220
And we haven't seen them until now

947
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,599
In billions of light-years...

948
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,900
...what will Taiwan and Japan become of?

949
01:19:58,761 --> 01:20:01,481
Mountains and seas will still be there

950
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:04,794
But the people will be gone

951
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:10,480
l want to take another glimpse at the sky

952
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:14,094
In this changeable world...

953
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:16,987
...l want to see what eternity is

954
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,540
I met a school of grey mullet
heading to Taiwan for the winter

955
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,344
I trust my love to you to one of them

956
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:34,893
May your fisherman father catch it

957
01:20:36,465 --> 01:20:40,185
Tomoko, though it tastes bad...

958
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:43,514
... you have to try it anyway

959
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:46,607
You'll understand...

960
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,576
...that I didn’t mean to leave you

961
01:20:51,814 --> 01:20:55,684
I'm moaning on the deck at night...

962
01:20:57,786 --> 01:21:02,036
...that I didn’t mean to leave you

963
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:55,679
You really expect anything from us?

964
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,210
But after 15 years...

965
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,736
...[ fail after all

966
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,658
Though I’m not really that bad

967
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:50,075
A new day dawns, but who cares?

968
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:55,464
Sunlight only brings thick mist anyway

969
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,299
I saw before dawn...

970
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:02,855
...the aged you from the future...

971
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:07,059
...and the aged me from the future

972
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:12,120
The morning mist covers
my wrinkles on the forehead

973
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:16,010
The sun scorches your black hair

974
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:21,756
I've lost you completely

975
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:24,401
Tomoko...

976
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:26,866
Please forgive the cowardly me

977
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,084
You...

978
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,160
Those letters are very important

979
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:19,634
You have to give them to that girl...

980
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,892
... whatever it takes

981
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,102
Oh, Jeez!

982
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,711
Who did this?

983
01:25:14,076 --> 01:25:16,266
You idiot! You'll be put into jail!

984
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:19,365
I told you to return the mail
but you opened it instead?

985
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,625
Cape No.7, Hengchun

986
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,543
Kojima Tomoko?

987
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:36,256
I don’t remember this person

988
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,802
We're about the same age if she’s still alive

989
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,561
It's 16 degrees Celsius here...

990
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,540
... with a 12-knot wind
above the 97-meter-deep sea

991
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:56,815
I've seen a couple of sea birds

992
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:00,330
We're landing tomorrow night

993
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:02,556
Tomoko...

994
01:26:03,425 --> 01:26:05,735
I left you all my photos taken in Taiwan

995
01:26:07,062 --> 01:26:09,022
I gave them to your mother

996
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,748
But I took one of them with me

997
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:16,686
It's you playing at the beach

998
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,670
The sea in the photo is so calm...

999
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:26,344
...and your smiles fascinate me

1000
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,246
Whoever your new lover will be...

1001
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:33,398
...he can’t be good enough for you

1002
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:39,100
I thought I packed all my beautiful memories

1003
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,485
Now I realize that alll can take away
is emptiness

1004
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:46,251
l really miss you!

1005
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:49,959
Wow! Rainbow!

1006
01:27:00,449 --> 01:27:02,259
May the rainbow bridge the two ends of ocean

1007
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:06,194
...and bridge you and me

1008
01:27:26,675 --> 01:27:31,505
When sunshine returns

1009
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:36,514
To the rainy southern country

1010
01:27:37,486 --> 01:27:40,036
lll try to finish

1011
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:47,623
The love story in the past

1012
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:51,440
When sunshine...

1013
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:58,651
So many strings. I can’t do it right

1014
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:00,634
It's a love song!

1015
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:03,443
It's easy. Only a few chords

1016
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:04,945
Come on!

1017
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:10,142
Let me tell you something
Come earlier to practice tomorrow

1018
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:11,315
All right...

1019
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:13,006
I never use these two strings

1020
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,745
Can I cut them off?

1021
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,450
No, you can’t!

1022
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,657
Say it nicely. Why did you shout?

1023
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,976
Have you found that girl?

1024
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:49,382
I tried, but didn’t find her

1025
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,115
I'll try harder

1026
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:55,652
The lyrics...

1027
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:59,473
I know. I'll revise them

1028
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:03,109
So...l have to go

1029
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:13,847
I need to turn off the lights

1030
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:17,256
Il do it

1031
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:26,306
All right, it’s up to you guys

1032
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:30,159
Yeah, I think he can do it well

1033
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:32,266
I think so too

1034
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:33,704
Damn!

1035
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:37,146
You were so quick to answer

1036
01:29:37,906 --> 01:29:38,926
I'm senile!

1037
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:41,804
You hurt my feelings

1038
01:29:43,445 --> 01:29:45,144
It's you who brought him here, not us

1039
01:29:45,447 --> 01:29:47,437
Yeah! We don’t even know him

1040
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:50,847
Never mind me, Old Mao

1041
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:53,552
Come on! I know what you want

1042
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,196
You're cocky only because
you can play the bass guitar?

1043
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:02,138
Why can’t we have two bass guitarists?

1044
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,464
Any instrument is all right for me

1045
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:09,760
l have to be on stage

1046
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,076
Damn! They say I’m a gem!

1047
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:49,657
Tomoko, I’ve landed safely

1048
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:53,019
After the seven-day voyage...

1049
01:30:53,982 --> 01:30:57,522
...[ finally step on my homeland

1050
01:30:58,987 --> 01:31:01,127
But I miss the sea already

1051
01:31:03,158 --> 01:31:04,388
Why is the sea standing for...

1052
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:07,086
...the two extremes of hope and death?

1053
01:31:08,697 --> 01:31:12,037
This is my last letter to you

1054
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,237
I'll mail them later

1055
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:18,297
This sea can’t tolerate love

1056
01:31:18,707 --> 01:31:21,517
At least it can tolerate lovesickness

1057
01:31:23,078 --> 01:31:26,918
Tomoko, you must receive my lovesickness

1058
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:31,913
So that you'll forgive me a little bit

1059
01:31:33,355 --> 01:31:36,075
I'll bury you in my heart forever

1060
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:39,008
Even when I'm getting married...

1061
01:31:39,527 --> 01:31:41,927
...or at some turning points of life...

1062
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:44,519
...’m bound to think of you

1063
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:48,093
The girl who ran away from home...

1064
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:52,313
... Standing alone in the crowd...

1065
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:55,868
... wearing the white hat...

1066
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:57,881
... which you'd worked so hard to buy

1067
01:31:58,913 --> 01:32:02,723
You wanted me to recognize you
in the crowd, didn’t you?

1068
01:32:05,754 --> 01:32:10,264
Il saw you...1 saw you...

1069
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:15,577
You were standing there silently

1070
01:32:16,131 --> 01:32:18,301
It's an old address. Anyone knows?

1071
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:23,793
You're like the July sun

1072
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:27,203
I dare not glimpse at you any longer

1073
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:34,888
l saw you standing there silently

1074
01:32:36,818 --> 01:32:40,478
You lit up my chilled heart

1075
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:43,740
l was sad, but had to hide my feelings

1076
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:50,129
I didn’t speak anything

1077
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:54,098
I know that my lovesickness...

1078
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:57,112
...1S like the shadow under the sun...

1079
01:32:57,539 --> 01:33:01,169
... chased by me and chasing me...

1080
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:04,023
...for the eternity

1081
01:33:24,199 --> 01:33:26,039
Why are you so sad?

1082
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,628
Because of love? Of work?

1083
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:34,050
Or is it because of us?

1084
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:42,639
I'm afraid it'll still be raining tomorrow

1085
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,881
Miss Tomoko...

1086
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:51,784
Aren’t you expecting the rainbow?

1087
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:01,638
Tomoko...

1088
01:34:02,537 --> 01:34:06,197
l wrote my guiltiness in my last letter...

1089
01:34:07,742 --> 01:34:10,762
...to show my apology to you

1090
01:34:12,447 --> 01:34:16,257
That's how I can forgive myself

1091
01:34:25,293 --> 01:34:27,253
Hey, you two!

1092
01:34:27,629 --> 01:34:29,119
No singing for you tomorrow on stage
Can you live with that?

1093
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,673
l was sleepless last night, thinking

1094
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:35,709
I've played yukin for more than 50 years

1095
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:37,614
I'll be on stage for the first time
tomorrow and I'll be shaking this?

1096
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:40,297
Hey, you!

1097
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:42,302
You can sing very well

1098
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:43,901
Don’t you want to sing on stage?

1099
01:34:44,112 --> 01:34:44,782
I think...

1100
01:34:44,946 --> 01:34:46,616
Shut up! No one asks you anything

1101
01:35:04,566 --> 01:35:06,266
Hey, slam-dunker...

1102
01:35:07,569 --> 01:35:09,089
Red hair is not trendy now

1103
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:17,006
Aga is home revising the lyrics

1104
01:35:17,612 --> 01:35:18,902
He asked us to rehearse without him

1105
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:26,488
Today, 1 bought something
for each of you at the airport

1106
01:35:27,455 --> 01:35:30,115
Dada, this is Ancestors’ Eyes...

1107
01:35:30,825 --> 01:35:32,724
...to protect your health

1108
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:33,731
Thank you

1109
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,440
Malasun!

1110
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,290
This is Bead of Butterfly Pupa...

1111
01:35:40,702 --> 01:35:42,402
...to bring you fortune...

1112
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,500
...for your diligence

1113
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:47,029
Thanks. Fortune is all 1 need

1114
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:50,486
Frog!

1115
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:53,683
This is Bead of Hands and Legs...

1116
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:56,062
...to improve your craftsmanship

1117
01:35:58,953 --> 01:36:00,003
Rauma...

1118
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:03,450
This is Bead of Peacock...

1119
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:06,235
...to guard your love for your wife

1120
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:09,926
This is Bead of Tears

1121
01:36:12,133 --> 01:36:16,003
It's my lifelong aching for my wife

1122
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,628
But ! bought it. Wear it anyway

1123
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:26,505
You're aching because of love

1124
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:31,044
Thank you...

1125
01:36:32,654 --> 01:36:34,024
Thank you...

1126
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:38,571
Old Mao!

1127
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:43,288
Duck’s grandpa is playing the timbrel now

1128
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:45,811
Playing the timbrel is good as well

1129
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:49,051
Old Mao! This is Bead of Sunshine

1130
01:36:49,704 --> 01:36:51,404
It represents your nobility

1131
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:59,131
l have Mazu too. Won't they fight?

1132
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:01,338
No, they won't!

1133
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:03,949
We're all family. Why should we fight?

1134
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:05,899
Speaking of family...

1135
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:09,037
Actually l have something for you

1136
01:37:09,524 --> 01:37:11,254
We need unification...

1137
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:13,612
.. because we're all part of the band

1138
01:37:13,961 --> 01:37:15,921
l had these custom-made earlier

1139
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,261
And I'll give them to you right now

1140
01:37:18,533 --> 01:37:20,233
This is my own design

1141
01:37:20,535 --> 01:37:21,845
It's our uniform actually...

1142
01:37:22,103 --> 01:37:23,153
...for us to wear on stage

1143
01:37:26,374 --> 01:37:27,864
Uniform?

1144
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:29,026
Malasun

1145
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,960
Thousands years of history with new sensation

1146
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:32,889
The uniform for family

1147
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:44,227
Sorry to bother you

1148
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:48,980
Make yourselves at home. I'll be in my room

1149
01:37:53,501 --> 01:37:58,661
The breeze informs of Spring’s coming

1150
01:38:00,274 --> 01:38:04,784
The fragrance of blooming flowers...

1151
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:12,160
...reminds me of you far away

1152
01:38:13,988 --> 01:38:25,068
You're like a blooming flower
in the sunshine of Spring

1153
01:38:27,635 --> 01:38:39,095
The light of hope will lead us
well into the future

1154
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:52,008
We're stepping on the roads we chose

1155
01:38:55,296 --> 01:38:56,606
Now I know...

1156
01:38:56,864 --> 01:38:58,174
...why people said 1 sang too hard

1157
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:08,688
Aga, l...

1158
01:39:11,212 --> 01:39:13,462
Are you all here? It’s your turn

1159
01:39:17,485 --> 01:39:18,565
All right?

1160
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,076
Atari, all right?

1161
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,521
-OK! -Yeah, l see

1162
01:39:22,857 --> 01:39:24,377
Please

1163
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:26,489
Do me a favor

1164
01:39:26,761 --> 01:39:28,721
I'll make a DVD

1165
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:31,463
Project our logo on that big screen

1166
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,003
It's the best way of promotion

1167
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:35,295
Don’t ask too much!

1168
01:39:35,503 --> 01:39:36,553
You've got the T-shirts

1169
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:40,080
Thanks a lot!

1170
01:39:40,341 --> 01:39:41,071
Thanks a lot!

1171
01:39:41,242 --> 01:39:43,262
Let's have a rest in the hotel

1172
01:39:54,589 --> 01:39:56,369
Tomoko, can you ask them
to prepare the meal?

1173
01:39:58,459 --> 01:40:00,919
That policeman is the band’s guitarist

1174
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:02,148
Policeman?

1175
01:40:08,636 --> 01:40:10,716
You're very popular in Taiwan

1176
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,110
Miss Tomoko...

1177
01:40:16,611 --> 01:40:17,840
Rainbow!

1178
01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:48,814
Can I have a cigarette?

1179
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:51,077
Don’t tell me you don’t speak Japanese

1180
01:41:03,324 --> 01:41:04,584
After today...

1181
01:41:06,494 --> 01:41:11,794
...you don’t have to see us anymore

1182
01:41:18,506 --> 01:41:22,316
I'm in love with Aga

1183
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,802
I've been in love before

1184
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,669
But this is different

1185
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,999
I don’t know if it’s love or not

1186
01:41:45,032 --> 01:41:48,692
You Japanese don’t know what love is

1187
01:41:51,839 --> 01:41:56,409
Have you been hurt by any Japanese?

1188
01:41:58,312 --> 01:41:59,892
Why are you so prejudiced?

1189
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:09,432
Is it Dada’s father?

1190
01:42:17,665 --> 01:42:19,975
He must've hurt you really bad

1191
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:30,975
My heart died long ago

1192
01:42:36,584 --> 01:42:40,094
I'm looking for a girl in Hengchun
whose heart died too

1193
01:42:41,956 --> 01:42:46,786
She’s probably 80 years old now

1194
01:42:48,696 --> 01:42:51,006
Her name is also Tomoko

1195
01:42:52,733 --> 01:42:58,853
Il saw a package at Aga’s place

1196
01:42:59,774 --> 01:43:01,884
A Japanese package with an unknown address

1197
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:05,678
Or more aptly put...

1198
01:43:06,781 --> 01:43:08,741
...there are seven love letters in it

1199
01:43:11,085 --> 01:43:12,955
When the Japanese old man died...

1200
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:15,367
...his daughter found them in his closet

1201
01:43:15,756 --> 01:43:17,426
She mailed them on his behalf

1202
01:43:20,394 --> 01:43:26,634
Unfortunately, no one remembers
an old address 60 years ago

1203
01:43:28,302 --> 01:43:33,192
l read those love letters

1204
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:45,539
Never seen anything more beautiful

1205
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:52,258
It'd comfort the lovesick old lady

1206
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:12,749
What's the matter with you?

1207
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:24,449
Send the package to this address

1208
01:44:26,026 --> 01:44:29,156
That Tomoko lives here

1209
01:44:34,468 --> 01:44:35,958
How do you know that?

1210
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:46,297
She’s my grandmother

1211
01:44:50,651 --> 01:44:54,751
Then...I'll give the package to you

1212
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:08,400
I did something bad to her

1213
01:45:13,107 --> 01:45:17,267
She doesn’t want to see me anymore

1214
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:22,955
Go ahead!

1215
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,160
Gol

1216
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,390
Aga!

1217
01:45:54,648 --> 01:45:55,498
Aga!

1218
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,330
I found the owner of the package

1219
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:15,337
Can you go now?

1220
01:46:16,737 --> 01:46:18,197
That urgent?

1221
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:20,830
Aga...

1222
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:23,752
When the concert is over...

1223
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:26,131
...P Il. go back to Japan...

1224
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,330
...with the Japanese staff

1225
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:33,730
They offered me a job in Japan

1226
01:46:38,692 --> 01:46:39,922
And you accepted?

1227
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:47,603
Don’t forget to tell me...

1228
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:50,788
... what that Tomoko looks like

1229
01:46:55,442 --> 01:46:58,072
This is Bead of Warrior...

1230
01:47:01,782 --> 01:47:04,622
...to guard your honor and bravery

1231
01:47:36,717 --> 01:47:38,937
I'll pretend that you forget me...

1232
01:47:41,322 --> 01:47:43,512
...that you send your love to me away...

1233
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:47,634
... like a migrating bird

1234
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:55,550
...and that you throw the past away

1235
01:47:57,004 --> 01:47:59,374
I'll pretend...

1236
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,210
...until believe everything I imagine

1237
01:48:04,378 --> 01:48:05,688
And then...

1238
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:12,123
...l' ll wish you all the happiness

1239
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:14,297
Anybody home?

1240
01:48:20,194 --> 01:48:21,654
Anybody home?

1241
01:49:30,531 --> 01:49:32,581
Hey! What did you say to Aga?

1242
01:50:41,335 --> 01:50:42,265
Those near the sea water...

1243
01:50:42,503 --> 01:50:43,963
Please come closer!

1244
01:50:44,238 --> 01:50:45,408
The tide is ebbing

1245
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:47,281
Please come closer!

1246
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:50,305
Please come closer!

1247
01:50:50,644 --> 01:50:51,344
Thank you!

1248
01:50:52,713 --> 01:50:54,233
Be careful! Come closer!

1249
01:50:55,048 --> 01:50:56,248
What were you thinking?

1250
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:59,090
You asked him to send a mail?

1251
01:50:59,453 --> 01:51:01,943
What's wrong with you?

1252
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:04,240
Mr. Manager...

1253
01:51:04,458 --> 01:51:06,067
...wanna contact Mr. Representative?

1254
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:08,320
He may be in the crowd

1255
01:51:09,363 --> 01:51:10,593
What good will it do?

1256
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:14,626
Do something! Do you hear me?

1257
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:17,420
Miss Tomoko...

1258
01:51:17,704 --> 01:51:19,044
Is there anyone who can sing?

1259
01:51:19,773 --> 01:51:21,293
I can sing very well!

1260
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:24,092
Ask him if you don’t believe me

1261
01:51:24,411 --> 01:51:25,401
Ask him

1262
01:51:25,779 --> 01:51:27,449
Aga’s here!

1263
01:51:33,787 --> 01:51:35,777
Come on! Get on stage...

1264
01:51:41,228 --> 01:51:42,898
What took you so long?

1265
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:50,975
Didn't they hate each other?

1266
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:53,379
Stay...

1267
01:51:54,408 --> 01:51:55,668
...or Ill go with you

1268
01:52:27,774 --> 01:52:29,994
Don’t be nervous! Relax!

1269
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:34,179
Who’s nervous? Idiot!

1270
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:12,320
l wanna collect the warmth of Summer

1271
01:53:12,853 --> 01:53:14,963
Wanna cross the river named Happiness

1272
01:53:15,489 --> 01:53:17,678
Wanna be a snake swallowing elephant

1273
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:23,838
It sounds stupid, but why not?

1274
01:53:26,199 --> 01:53:29,739
l wanna write a song

1275
01:53:30,437 --> 01:53:33,157
When the sky is empty and the earth is dry

1276
01:53:33,607 --> 01:53:35,687
I'm pouring passion for you

1277
01:53:36,243 --> 01:53:38,173
Make you crazy and make you thirsty

1278
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:41,175
l want the whole world to know you're mine

1279
01:53:41,615 --> 01:53:43,665
The weather's gone mad and the sea is boiling

1280
01:53:44,051 --> 01:53:46,391
That's why I want to seize the day

1281
01:53:46,787 --> 01:53:49,977
Stop wasting time

1282
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:54,120
Be a skywalker...

1283
01:54:03,437 --> 01:54:05,687
An angel like you

1284
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:08,379
Should have wings and name

1285
01:54:08,909 --> 01:54:10,989
Should have fatal beauty

1286
01:54:11,545 --> 01:54:15,355
Should belong to me for once

1287
01:54:15,949 --> 01:54:18,409
When the sky is empty and the earth is dry

1288
01:54:18,819 --> 01:54:21,009
I'm pouring passion for you

1289
01:54:21,588 --> 01:54:23,487
Make you crazy and make you thirsty

1290
01:54:23,824 --> 01:54:26,374
l want the whole world to know you're mine

1291
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,130
The weather's gone mad and the sea is boiling

1292
01:54:29,563 --> 01:54:31,843
That's why I want to seize the day -Grandpa!

1293
01:54:32,232 --> 01:54:35,252
Stop wasting time

1294
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:39,619
Be a skywalker...

1295
01:54:48,048 --> 01:54:50,508
When the sky is empty and the earth is dry

1296
01:54:50,917 --> 01:54:53,107
I'm pouring passion for you

1297
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,480
Make you crazy and make you thirsty

1298
01:54:55,822 --> 01:54:58,542
l want the whole world to know
that you're mine

1299
01:54:58,992 --> 01:55:01,182
The end of the world scares me not

1300
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:03,871
I'll keep on enjoying myself

1301
01:55:04,297 --> 01:55:07,517
‘Cause loving you makes me happy

1302
01:55:08,034 --> 01:55:13,044
Be a skywalker...

1303
01:55:14,374 --> 01:55:19,353
Be happy, oh...

1304
01:56:03,323 --> 01:56:05,433
Relax! What are you afraid of?

1305
01:56:07,828 --> 01:56:09,258
Here. Take this

1306
01:56:38,992 --> 01:56:45,322
If Sea can talk
and if Wind falls in love with Sands

1307
01:56:46,299 --> 01:56:52,449
If my longing’s lost in vacancy

1308
01:56:53,373 --> 01:56:59,442
I'll listen to the waves
Let the wind blow my hair

1309
01:57:01,081 --> 01:57:07,001
My love for you grows with time

1310
01:57:10,824 --> 01:57:16,334
Summer's here when Spring’s away

1311
01:57:17,464 --> 01:57:22,504
I finally realize on retrospect

1312
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:31,429
When sunshine returns

1313
01:57:32,379 --> 01:57:35,719
To the rainy southern country

1314
01:57:37,484 --> 01:57:39,794
lll try to finish

1315
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:44,201
The love story

1316
01:57:45,125 --> 01:57:47,585
In the past

1317
01:57:48,128 --> 01:57:52,928
When sunshine leaves

1318
01:57:53,867 --> 01:57:57,497
The too sunny southern country

1319
01:57:58,772 --> 01:58:01,322
Will you give me back

1320
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:05,706
All the love you took away

1321
01:58:06,646 --> 01:58:11,066
Before you said goodbye

1322
01:58:18,425 --> 01:58:23,345
Sea is blue. Stars shine bright

1323
01:58:25,699 --> 01:58:29,888
My arms are empty without you

1324
01:58:32,872 --> 01:58:38,002
Sky is endless at my lonely nights

1325
01:58:38,878 --> 01:58:41,538
Please forgive my hesitancy

1326
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:46,049
To confess that I love you

1327
01:59:22,689 --> 01:59:24,389
This is Bead of Peacock...

1328
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:27,648
...to guard your everlasting love

1329
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:12,320
When sunshine returns

1330
02:00:13,273 --> 02:00:16,963
To the rainy southern country

1331
02:00:18,378 --> 02:00:20,928
lll try to finish

1332
02:00:22,482 --> 02:00:24,852
The love story

1333
02:00:26,119 --> 02:00:28,429
In the past

1334
02:00:34,127 --> 02:00:37,377
The rainbow... Thank you very much

1335
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:39,371
Don’t mention it

1336
02:00:39,866 --> 02:00:43,026
Will you give me back

1337
02:00:44,204 --> 02:00:46,724
All the love you took away

1338
02:00:47,707 --> 02:00:51,957
Before you said goodbye

1339
02:01:32,318 --> 02:01:34,458
It's all right. Let them sing one more

1340
02:01:34,821 --> 02:01:36,961
No, they only have two songs

1341
02:01:46,866 --> 02:01:47,566
Come here!

1342
02:01:47,734 --> 02:01:48,754
Old Mao!

1343
02:01:58,111 --> 02:01:59,481
Rauma!

1344
02:02:00,613 --> 02:02:01,873
Rauma...

1345
02:02:46,125 --> 02:02:50,875
A boy sees a wild rose

1346
02:02:52,131 --> 02:02:54,711
Ah! I know that song too

1347
02:02:57,770 --> 02:03:02,130
It blooms so early in the morning

1348
02:03:03,343 --> 02:03:07,793
He rushes to see it clearly

1349
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:13,827
The rose makes him happy

1350
02:03:15,154 --> 02:03:19,954
Rose, rose, the red rose

1351
02:03:21,294 --> 02:03:26,044
The rose in the wilderness

1352
02:04:48,982 --> 02:04:50,122
Miss Tomoko...

1353
02:04:51,818 --> 02:04:55,298
These are the letters my father wrote

1354
02:04:56,589 --> 02:05:00,899
l accidentally found them
in my father's bedroom closet

1355
02:05:02,695 --> 02:05:06,945
My father died in January this year

1356
02:05:08,901 --> 02:05:11,891
l read every one of the letters

1357
02:05:12,605 --> 02:05:16,205
How the beautiful secrets...

1358
02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:20,400
...hidden in them broke my heart

1359
02:05:21,414 --> 02:05:23,313
I mailed these letters he wrote...

1360
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:25,220
... which he was supposed to send...

1361
02:05:26,586 --> 02:05:29,136
...60 years ago

1362
02:05:29,756 --> 02:05:32,006
Sorry for keeping you waiting for so long
