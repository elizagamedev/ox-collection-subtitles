1
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,250
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,209
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,696
As I[ recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:48,968
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,940
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,519
Il only meant...

7
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,450
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,087
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,646
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,590
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,576
-l will not disappoint you, my Lord.
-Good.

12
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,880
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,387
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,444
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,294
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:39,575
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,997
Avada Kedavra!l

18
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,570
Harry.

19
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,956
Harry!

20
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,046
Are you all right?

21
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,808
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,197
-When did you get here?
-Just now. You?

23
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,854
Last night.

24
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,135
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,688
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,352
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,801
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,113
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast’s ready!

29
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,683
-Ron, where are we actually going?
-Don’t know.

30
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,367
-Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
-Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,272
Keep up!

32
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,647
Arthur!

33
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,789
It’s about time, son.

34
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:39,048
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:44,726
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,809
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,308
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,082
This way.

39
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,986
Merlin’s beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,962
-Yes, sir.
-Great, great pleasure.

41
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,046
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,244
Yes, it’s just over there.

43
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,421
-Shall we?
-Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,861
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,808
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,367
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,010
-That isn't just any manky old boot.
-It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,688
Time to go!

49
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,424
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,332
-Ready! After three. One, two...
-Harry!

51
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,955
...three!

52
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,132
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,722
-What?!
-Let go!

54
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,341
V'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,898
-Total shambles, as per usual.
-Thanks.

56
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,873
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,352
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,223
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,194
Look!

60
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,243
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,658
Blimey!

62
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,637
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,262
-See you at the match.
-See you.

64
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,740
-Cedric.
-Ced, come on.

65
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,558
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,215
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,619
What?

68
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,891
-Excellent, excellent.
-Ginny, look!

69
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,430
-All to the bath.
-Look.

70
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,948
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,001
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,633
-Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
-Feet off the table!

73
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,089
-Feet off the table!
-Feet off the table!

74
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,533
Il love magic.

75
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,123
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,570
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,387
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,316
If it rains...

79
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,777
..-you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,911
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,240
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,737
Don’t boast, Draco.

83
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,015
There’s no need with these people.

84
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,967
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,260
While you can.

86
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,998
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,377
Come on!

88
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,571
It’s the Irish! There’s Troy!

89
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,586
-And Mullet!
-And Moran!

90
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,034
freland! Ireland! freland!

91
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,434
-Here come the Bulgarians!
-Yes!

92
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,100
Who's that?

93
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,692
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,207
Krum! Krum! Krum!

95
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,462
Krum!

96
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,304
Yes!

97
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,930
Good evening!

98
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,325
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,592
... it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,878
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:38,665
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,213
Let the match...

103
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,148
.. begin!

104
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,389
Krum! Krum! Krum!

105
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,959
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,733
-Krum?
-Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,793
He’s like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,889
-He’s more than an athlete.
-Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,639
He’s an artist.

110
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,967
-l think you're in love, Ron.
-Shut up.

111
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,643
Viktor, f love you

112
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,381
Viktor, 1 do

113
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,589
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

114
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,493
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,509
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,658
It’s not the Irish.

117
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,894
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,345
Get out, it’s the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,761
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,678
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,091
Go!

122
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,086
Harry!

123
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,026
-Keep up, you lot!
-Harry!

124
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,433
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,656
Morsmordre!

126
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,917
Harry!

127
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,417
-Where are you?
-Harry!

128
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,358
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,395
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,171
What is that?

131
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,335
Stupefy!

132
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,931
Stop!

133
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,224
That's my son!

134
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,873
-Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
-We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,510
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,738
-Crouch, you can't possi--
-Do not lie!

137
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,923
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,122
-Crime?
-Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,853
What crime?

140
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,403
It’s the Dark Mark, Harry. It’s his mark.

141
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:03,901
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,617
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,215
-His followers?
-Yeah.

144
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,331
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,834
-Follow me.
-There was a man, before.

146
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,998
There!

147
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,353
All of you, this way!

148
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,629
A man, Harry?

149
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,394
Who?

150
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,555
I don’t know.

151
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,339
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,611
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,715
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,559
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,871
Packet of Drooble’s...

156
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,890
..and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,390
On second thought, just the Drooble’s.

158
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:13,326
-It’s all right, I'll get it. Don’t worry.
-Just the Drooble’s. Thanks.

159
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,198
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,291
Thank you.

161
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,060
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,217
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,184
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,386
This is horrible.

165
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,408
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,465
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,307
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,296
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,410
It’s hurting again, isn’t it? Your scar.

170
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,453
I'm fine.

171
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,247
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:04,247
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,988
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,574
Clear the runway!

175
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,691
Well, there’s something
you don't see every day.

176
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:34,332
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

177
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,918
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,279
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,344
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen....

180
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,915
Yes, what is it?

181
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,507
What is it?

182
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,940
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:55,548 --> 00:17:00,768
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,464
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,067
-For those of you who do not know...
-Brilliant.

186
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,271
.. the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,698
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,231
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,325
Now let me be clear.

190
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,282
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,506
And trust me when I say...

192
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,519
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,988
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:34,223
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,397
..and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,806
Bloody hell.

197
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,896
Blimey. That’s one big woman.

198
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,014
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,930
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,933
..and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,705
Oh, it’s Krum!

202
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,360
Blimey, it’s him!

203
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,345
Viktor Krum!

204
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,743
Albus.

205
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,604
Igor.

206
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,653
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,490
-They will need attending to.
-Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

208
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,072
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,667
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,525
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,508
You idiot!

212
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,478
Your attention, please!

213
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,966
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,779
Eternal glory.

215
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:10,012
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:14,366
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,527
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,322
-Wicked.
-Wicked.

219
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,339
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,224
To explain all this...

221
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,749
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

222
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,262
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,346
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,259
-Alastor Moody? The Auror?
-Auror?

225
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,859
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,710
He’s supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

227
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:16,182
-My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
-Stupid ceiling.

228
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,769
Thank you.

229
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,056
What's that he’s drinking,
do you suppose?

230
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,349
I don’t know, but I don’t think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,395
After due consideration...

232
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,348
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

233
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,476
...no student under the age of 17...

234
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,283
...-shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,277
-This decision is final.
-That’s rubbish!

236
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,057
That's rubbish!
You don’t know what you're doing!

237
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:57,827
-Silence!
-They’re not too happy about that, then.

238
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,810
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,223
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,292
..-need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,532
..and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,976
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,749
If chosen, there’s no turning back.

244
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,716
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,297
Alastor Moody.

246
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,921
Ex-Auror...

247
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,968
...Ministry malcontent...

248
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,573
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,953
lam here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

250
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,221
Any questions?

251
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,129
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,052
...[ believe in a practical approach.

253
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:41,558
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,838
-Three, sir.
-And they are so named?

255
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,130
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will--

256
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:52,324
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

257
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,398
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,941
l say different! You need to know
what you’re up against!

259
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,438
You need to be prepared.

260
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,044
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,530
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,609
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,233
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,857
So which curse shall we see first?

265
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,537
-Weasley!
-Yes?

266
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,028
Stand.

267
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,913
Give us a curse.

268
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,698
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:31,846
The Imperius Curse.

270
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,071
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

271
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,214
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:41,201
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,291
Hello.

274
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,581
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,679
Engorgio.

276
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,758
Imperio!

277
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,511
Don't worry. It’s completely harmless.

278
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,439
If she bites...

279
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,491
...-she’s lethal.

280
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,799
What are you laughing at?

281
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,615
Get off!

282
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,776
Talented, isn’t she?

283
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:32,151
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,763
Drown herself?

285
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,582
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,660
...that they only did
You-Know-Who’s bidding...

287
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,280
...under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.

288
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,423
But here’s the rub:

289
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,622
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,820
Another, another.

291
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,372
Up, up. Come on.

292
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,104
Longbottom, is it?

293
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,280
Up.

294
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,907
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,710
There's the....

296
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,848
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,770
Correct, correct. Come, come.

298
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,750
Particularly nasty.

299
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,601
The torture curse.

300
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,728
Crucio!

301
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,049
Stop it! Can’t you see
it’s bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,641
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

303
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,740
No?

304
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,976
Avada Kedavra!l

305
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,351
The Killing Curse.

306
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,431
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,465
..and he’s sitting in this room.

308
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,902
Brilliant, isn’t he?

309
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,828
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,272
...but he’s really been there, you know?
He’s looked evil in the eye.

311
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,108
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:23,197
To perform them in a classroom....
I mean, did you see Neville’s face?

313
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,928
Neville?

314
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,533
Son?

315
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,505
You all right?

316
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,638
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,346
We're gonna be late!

318
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,228
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,319
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

320
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,108
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,031
Yeah, rather you than me.

322
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,103
Yes!

323
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,210
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,299
-Well, lads, we've done it.
-Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,746
It’s not going to work.

326
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,406
-Oh, yeah?
-And why is that, Granger?

327
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,495
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,601
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,250
So?

330
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:58,187
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,427
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,717
-But that’s why it’s so brilliant.
-Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,723
-Ready, Fred?
-Ready, George.

334
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,752
-Bottoms up.
-Bottoms up.

335
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,084
-Yes!
-Yes!

336
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,473
Yeah!

337
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,249
Yes!

338
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,197
Ready?

339
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,562
-Yes!
-Yes!

340
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,100
-You said!
-You said!

341
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,326
-Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
-l'll tear your ears off!

342
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,100
-Now you're making me laugh.
-Take this! Come on!

343
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,839
Fight! Fight! Fight!

344
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,639
We're “old school,” right?

345
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,130
Yeah, but you look older!

346
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,128
Sit down. Please.

347
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,381
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,766
The champion selection.

349
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:15,803
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,327
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,566
...is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,995
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

353
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:04,282
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,673
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

355
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,284
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,651
...this vessel of victory...

357
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,124
...the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,620
Harry Potter.

359
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,361
Harry Potter?

360
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,867
No. No.

361
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,780
Harry Potter!

362
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,685
Go on, Harry.

363
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,592
Harry, for goodness sake.

364
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,360
He's a cheat!

365
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,295
He’s not even 17 yet!

366
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,545
-It's wrong, I tell you!
-You French tart.

367
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,755
-Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
-Quiet! 1 can’t think!

368
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,032
-Everything is a conspiracy theory!
-I protest.

369
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,501
-Harry.
-I protest!

370
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,459
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,754
-No, sir.
-Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,360
-...to do it for you?
-No, sir.

373
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,241
-You're absolutely sure?
-Yes. Yes, sir.

374
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,988
-But of course he is lying.
-The hell he is!

375
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,544
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,750
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

377
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,053
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,102
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

379
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,422
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

380
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,698
-...perhaps you remember.
-This doesn’t help, Alastor.

381
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,870
Leave this to you, Barty.

382
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,450
The rules are absolute.

383
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:02,203
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,125
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,248
He is, as of tonight...

386
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,116
...a Triwizard champion.

387
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,169
This can't go on, Albus.

388
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,258
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,521
What do you suggest, Minerva?

390
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,750
Put an end to it.

391
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,227
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,816
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,772
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:02,424
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,397
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,518
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,321
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

398
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,656
..let them unfold.

399
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,003
What--? Do nothing?

400
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,868
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,564
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

402
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,211
l agree. With Severus.

403
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:32,604
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

404
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,388
-l can do that.
-Don't let him know, though.

405
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,674
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,931
...knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,877
Then again, we all are.

408
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,658
How did you do it?

409
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:07,418
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might’ve let your best friend know, though.

410
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,053
-Let you know what?
-You know bloody well what.

411
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,733
I didn’t ask for this to happen, Ron.

412
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,892
Okay?

413
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,451
-You're being stupid.
-Yeah, that’s me.

414
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,029
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

415
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,901
I didn’t put my name in that cup.

416
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:31,942
I don’t want eternal glory.
I just wanna be....

417
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:38,099
Look, I don’t know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

418
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:39,897
It just did.

419
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,288
Okay?

420
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,846
Piss off.

421
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,249
What a charismatic quartet.

422
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,283
Hello.

423
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,602
I'm Rita Skeeter.

424
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,678
l write for the Daily Prophet.

425
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:24,722
But of course you know that, don’t you?
It's you we don't know.

426
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,440
You're the juicy news.

427
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:31,522
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

428
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:35,277
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

429
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,714
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

430
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,937
In short, what makes a champion tick?

431
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,594
"Me, Myself & I" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

432
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,475
So who's feeling up to sharing?

433
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,371
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

434
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,552
This is cozy.

435
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,830
It's a broom cupboard.

436
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,430
You should feel right at home, then.

437
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,343
Don’t mind if l use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

438
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,219
No.

439
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,534
So tell me, Harry.

440
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,503
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12--

441
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,333
I'm 14. Sorry.

442
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,301
--about to compete
against three students...

443
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,697
..-not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

444
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,544
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

445
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,084
...in your dizziest daydreams.

446
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,650
Concerned?

447
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,562
I don’t know.
I haven't really thought about it.

448
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,716
Just ignore the quill.

449
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:49,631
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

450
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,394
-Fourteen.
-Your story's legend.

451
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,384
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

452
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,660
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

453
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,773
No, I didn’t enter.

454
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,559
Of course you didn’t.

455
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,459
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

456
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,307
Scratch that last.

457
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:14,928
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

458
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,186
Proud? Or concerned...

459
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,944
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

460
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,859
..at worst, a psychotic death wish?

461
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:29,633
Hey, my eyes aren't
“glistening with the ghosts of my past.”

462
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,603
Harry, 1 couldn't risk sending Hedwig.

463
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,926
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

464
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,453
..and she's too easily recognized.

465
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,415
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

466
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,591
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

467
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,819
And make sure you're alone.

468
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,514
Sirius.

469
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,183
P.S.2

470
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,121
The bird bites.

471
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,946
Sirius?

472
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,675
Harry Potter, age 72...

473
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,684
.. Suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

474
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,490
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

475
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,348
..and choking back tears....

476
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,310
Sirius. How--?

477
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,989
I don’t have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

478
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:27,049
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

479
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:28,862
No!

480
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,750
l had to ask.

481
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:35,294
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

482
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:38,187
But who was the third man in the room?

483
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,839
-I don’t know.
-You didn’t hear a name?

484
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,326
No.

485
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:47,702
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

486
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:49,466
And what was that?

487
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,225
He wanted...

488
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,058
...me.

489
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:59,643
I don’t know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

490
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,339
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

491
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,404
Yes.

492
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,145
It’s just a dream.

493
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,339
Look, Harry.

494
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,720
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

495
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,827
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn’t safe anymore.

496
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,448
What are you saying?

497
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:22,506
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

498
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:27,064
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

499
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:32,542
Then there’s Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

500
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,815
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

501
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,264
l haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

502
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:46,193
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

503
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,921
-I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
-You don’t have a choice.

504
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,001
-Someone’s coming.
-Keep your friends close, Harry.

505
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:00,767
Who were you talking to?

506
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,788
-What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
-l heard voices.

507
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,945
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

508
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,903
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

509
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,665
Amazing.

510
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,089
-Amazing!
-Neville. You're doing it again.

511
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,340
Right, sorry.

512
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:51,009
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

513
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:54,329
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

514
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,740
It’s already been through enough people.

515
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,962
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

516
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,742
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

517
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:06,035
What do you want me to say again?

518
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:07,634
Go.

519
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:14,395
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

520
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,633
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid’s looking for you.

521
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,383
Is that right? Well, you--

522
00:46:21,846 --> 00:46:22,776
What?

523
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,598
-Are you sure you won't do this?
-Do it.

524
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:36,368
Dean was told by Parvati that....

525
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,922
Please don't ask me to say it again.

526
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:41,854
Hagrid’s looking for you.

527
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,223
-Well, you can tell Ronald--
-I’m not an owl!

528
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,136
Did you bring your father’s cloak,
like l asked you?

529
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,862
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

530
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:02,582
You'll see soon enough.

531
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,850
Now pay attention, this is important.

532
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,147
What's with the flower?

533
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,470
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

534
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,683
As a matter of fact, I have.

535
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,912
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

536
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,066
Hagrid?

537
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,818
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

538
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,580
-Bonsoir, Olympe.
-Oh, Hagrid.

539
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,440
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

540
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,404
...you had forgotten me.

541
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,630
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

542
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:54,113
What is it you wanted to show me?

543
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,846
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

544
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:00,887
..-exhilarated.

545
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,134
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

546
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,609
Can we get closer?

547
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:25,925
Dragons?

548
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,580
That's the first task?

549
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,952
-You're joking.
-Come on, Harry.

550
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,134
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

551
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:36,903
Oh, crikey!

552
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,971
Although, I have to admit,
that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.

553
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:45,377
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

554
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,004
-Ron was here?
-Oh, sure.

555
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,527
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

556
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,390
Didn't Ron tell you that?

557
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,730
No, he didn't.

558
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,276
He didn’t tell me a thing.

559
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:13,167
-You cheat, Potter.
-You stink, Potter.

560
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,392
-Good luck, Potter.
-Potter stinks!

561
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,228
-Cedric rules.
-Thanks.

562
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,085
Like the badge?

563
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,381
Excuse me.

564
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,057
Harry.

565
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,532
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

566
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:35,248
Can I have a word?

567
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:38,047
-All right.
-You stink, Potter!

568
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,072
-Potter, you stink!
-Harry Potter smells!

569
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:46,198
Dragons. That's the first task.

570
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:49,434
-They’ve got one for each of us.
-Come on, Ced!

571
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,767
Are you serious?

572
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,450
And Fleur and Krum, do they--?

573
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,982
-Yes.
-Come on, Ced, leave him.

574
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,719
-Right.
-He’s not worth it.

575
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:02,254
-Read the badges, Potter!
-Hey, listen. About the badges.

576
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,393
-I’ve asked them not to wear them, but--
-Don't worry about it.

577
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,076
It’s not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

578
00:50:09,073 --> 00:50:10,363
It just happens a fair bit.

579
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,398
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

580
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,554
You're a right foul git, you know that?

581
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,935
-You think so?
-I know so.

582
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,552
Anything else?

583
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:22,954
-Yeah. Stay away from me.
-Fine.

584
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,915
-There’s Potter. Cheat.
-Why so tense, Potter?

585
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,237
My father and I have a bet, you see.

586
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,506
I don’t think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

587
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:41,049
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

588
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:44,322
I don’t give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

589
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:49,186
He’s vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

590
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,861
-Pathetic?
-Oh, no, you don’t, sonny!

591
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,902
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

592
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,792
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

593
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:03,946
-Professor Moody!
-...back-shooting--

594
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:06,878
-What are you doing?
-Teaching.

595
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:11,895
-Is that a--? Is that a student?
-Technically, it’s a ferret.

596
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:19,741
Stand still! Stand still!

597
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,884
-My father will hear about this!
-ls that a threat?

598
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:35,024
-Professor Moody!
-ls that a threat?

599
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,066
Professor!

600
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,591
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

601
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:43,567
-Alastor! Alastor.
-It doesn’t end here!

602
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:47,408
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

603
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,968
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

604
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,694
-He might’ve mentioned it.
-Well, you will do well to remember it.

605
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:57,637
Away!

606
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:02,848
You. Come with me.

607
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,165
That's a Foe-Glass.

608
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,058
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

609
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,596
If 1 can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

610
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,472
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what’s in there.

611
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:56,718
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

612
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,731
Now...

613
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,100
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

614
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,371
Well, you know, I just thought I'd....

615
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,431
Sit.

616
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,556
Listen to me, Potter.

617
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:19,749
Your pal Diggory?

618
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:23,984
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

619
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:26,779
Miss Delacour?

620
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:29,737
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

621
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:33,704
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

622
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,211
...but Karkaroff’s is not.

623
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,257
They'll have a strategy.

624
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:41,749
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum’s strengths.

625
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,327
Come on, Potter.

626
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,532
What are your strengths?

627
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,562
I don’t know.

628
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,357
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I....

629
00:53:56,867 --> 00:54:00,407
-Better than fair, the way I heard it.
-But I’m not allowed a broom.

630
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,261
You're allowed a wand.

631
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:12,438
Bets! Place your bets!

632
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,683
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

633
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,699
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today’s bloodbath?

634
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,742
Smart money’s on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

635
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,567
Yes, sir?

636
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,493
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

637
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,029
Your attention, please.

638
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:30,779
This is a great day for all of us.

639
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:38,258
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

640
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,312
Please keep your seats at ail times.

641
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:44,212
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

642
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:47,735
-Harry? Is that you?
-Yeah.

643
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,808
i'm sure we all wish our champions...

644
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:52,877
-How are you feeling? Okay?
-...the greatest of luck.

645
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,549
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to--

646
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,739
Battle a dragon.

647
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:07,459
Young love.

648
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,582
How...

649
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:13,348
.. Stirring.

650
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,960
If everything goes unfortunately today...

651
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,946
.-you two may even
make the front page.

652
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,412
You have no business here.

653
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,635
This tent is for champions...

654
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,714
.and friends.

655
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:35,388
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

656
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,496
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

657
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,695
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

658
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:49,216
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

659
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,650
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

660
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:54,677
Sorry, I'll just go.

661
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,452
Barty, the bag.

662
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,980
Champions, in a circle around me.

663
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:02,142
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

664
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:06,153
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

665
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,937
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

666
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,763
The Welsh Green.

667
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,780
Mr. Krum.

668
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,584
The Chinese Fireball.

669
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:34,399
The Swedish Short-Snout.

670
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,908
-Which leaves....
-The Horntail.

671
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,317
-What's that, boy?
-Nothing.

672
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,110
The Hungarian Horntail.

673
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,321
These represent four
very real dragons...

674
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,564
..each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

675
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:56,281
Your objective is simple:

676
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,057
Collect the egg.

677
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,045
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

678
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:04,655
..-without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

679
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,425
Any questions?

680
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,964
Very well. Good luck, champions.

681
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,950
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may--

682
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:25,275
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

683
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:40,281
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

684
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,927
.and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

685
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:47,647
And now our fourth and final contestant.

686
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,130
Harry! Harry! Harry!

687
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,250
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

688
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:05,887
Accio Firebolt!

689
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,038
-Yeah!
-Yes!

690
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:47,476
Oh, my God.

691
00:59:57,294 --> 01:00:00,194
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Well done, dragon!

692
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,482
Yes! Yes!

693
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,344
-Yes, Harry!
-Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

694
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:02,544
-Or an arm.
-Pack it in altogether?

695
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,496
-Never!
-Never!

696
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:07,986
Shush!

697
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,958
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

698
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:14,812
-Who wants me to open it?
-Yes!

699
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,178
-Do you want me to open it?
-Yes!

700
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:31,783
What the bloody hell was that?

701
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,612
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

702
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:42,654
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

703
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,833
l reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

704
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,060
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

705
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:56,371
l wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

706
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,790
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

707
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:04,111
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

708
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:08,432
-Least ! warned you about the dragons.
-Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

709
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,302
No, no, no, I did.

710
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:13,307
No, don’t you remember?
l told Hermione to tell you...

711
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,420
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

712
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:21,548
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

713
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,656
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

714
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,012
.. after you'd figured that out.

715
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,971
Who--? Who could possibly
figure that out?

716
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,228
That's completely mental.

717
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,230
Yeah. Isn't it?

718
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:38,553
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

719
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:42,901
Boys.

720
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,830
-Hi, Harry.
-Hi, Harry.

721
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,922
Cho, Harry’s looking at you.

722
01:05:19,182 --> 01:05:20,671
Shush.

723
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,783
Look at this!

724
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:27,144
I can’t believe it! She’s done it again.

725
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,451
“Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

726
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:33,323
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

727
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,819
Her latest prey, sources report...

728
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:39,456
... is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

729
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:43,663
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow.”

730
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,207
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

731
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,920
Thank you, Nigel.

732
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:56,406
Not now, Nigel. Later.

733
01:05:58,588 --> 01:05:59,928
Go on.

734
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,892
I told him I'd get him Harry’s autograph.

735
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,983
Oh, look, Mum’s sent me something.

736
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,953
Mum sent me a dress.

737
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:25,685
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

738
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:28,226
Nose down, Harry.

739
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,465
-Ginny, these must be for you.
-l'm not wearing that, it’s ghastly.

740
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:36,301
What are you on about?

741
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,393
They're not for Ginny.

742
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:40,025
They're for you.

743
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,474
-Dress robes.
-Dress robes? For what?

744
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,069
The Yule Ball...

745
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:53,195
..has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

746
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,387
...since its inception.

747
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,713
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

748
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,811
...gather in the Great Hall...

749
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:06,756
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

750
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,781
As representatives of the host school...

751
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:15,707
...l expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

752
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,942
And I mean this literally, because...

753
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:23,335
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

754
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,051
...a dance.

755
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,060
Silence!

756
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:35,112
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

757
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,962
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

758
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:42,024
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

759
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:46,382
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

760
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,360
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

761
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:51,076
Now, to dance...

762
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:54,684
...is to let the body breathe.

763
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:58,234
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

764
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,888
...longing to burst forth and take flight.

765
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:04,854
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don’t think it’s a swan.

766
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:08,265
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

767
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,778
-Mr. Weasley.
-Yes?

768
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,359
Will you join me, please?

769
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,361
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

770
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:24,215
-Where?
-My waist.

771
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,951
And extend your arm.

772
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,433
Mr. Filch, if you please.

773
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,492
One, two, three.

774
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:37,981
One, two, three. One, two, three.

775
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,988
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

776
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,440
-Never.
-Never.

777
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:49,154
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

778
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,415
Why do they have to travel in packs?

779
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,157
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

780
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,398
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can’t get a date, who can?

781
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:30,987
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

782
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:38,843
l take after my mum.

783
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:42,667
Though I didn’t know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

784
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,011
No, not the maternal sort, her.

785
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:48,545
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

786
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:53,131
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

787
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,906
He laughed so hard at that.

788
01:09:58,261 --> 01:09:59,901
Very funny.

789
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:09,349
And then he died
just when I started school, so....

790
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:12,632
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

791
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:15,403
But enough of me. What about you?

792
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:37,342
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

793
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,635
Well, us and Neville.

794
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:45,479
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

795
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,472
It might interest you to know
that Neville’s already got someone.

796
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:53,898
Now I'm really depressed.

797
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:02,996
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone.”

798
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,191
Who you going with, then?

799
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:11,656
-Oi, Angelina?
-What?

800
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:16,693
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

801
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,193
To the ball?

802
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:20,865
Yeah, all right.

803
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:26,117
Oi, Hermione.

804
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:27,912
You're a girl.

805
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,454
Very well spotted.

806
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,486
Come with one of us?

807
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:38,909
Come on. It’s one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

808
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:40,738
For a girl, it’s just sad.

809
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:44,407
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

810
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,558
And I said yes!

811
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,045
Bloody hell.

812
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,873
She's lying, right?

813
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,327
If you say so.

814
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:04,084
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

815
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:08,084
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

816
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,094
Agreed.

817
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:35,820
-Cho!
-Harry!

818
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,955
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It’s a bit icy at the top.

819
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,857
Okay, thanks.

820
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:49,427
Cho?

821
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:51,869
Yes?

822
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:55,396
Well, I just wondered if you--

823
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:58,178
l wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

824
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:02,299
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

825
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:07,789
l was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

826
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,793
Harry...

827
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:18,648
...[’m sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

828
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:21,256
And....

829
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:24,938
Well, I’ve said I'll go with him.

830
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:29,253
Okay. Yeah. Great.

831
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:33,272
Fine. No problem.

832
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,309
Okay. Good.

833
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,299
Harry?

834
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,728
l really am...

835
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:42,547
..SOrry.

836
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:53,838
It’s all right, Ron.

837
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:57,006
It’s okay, Ron. It’s all right.
It doesn’t matter.

838
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,206
What happened to you?

839
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:01,602
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

840
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:04,227
-What?
-What did she say?

841
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:05,907
No, of course.

842
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:10,573
-She said yes?
-Don't be silly.

843
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,280
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

844
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:19,741
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

845
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:23,396
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

846
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:28,154
-And what did you do then?
-What else? I ran for it.

847
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:32,044
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don’t know what got into me.

848
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,748
-Hi, Harry.
-Hi, Harry.

849
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:36,759
l always liked looking at them
from behind.

850
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,724
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

851
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:42,547
Hey!

852
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,251
Bloody hell.

853
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,249
Bloody hell.

854
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,111
Bloody....

855
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,519
Oh, bloody....

856
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:17,748
What are those? What are those?

857
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,907
-My dress robes.
-Well, they're all right!

858
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,030
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

859
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,253
Well, 1 expect yours are more traditional.

860
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:31,075
Traditional?! They're ancient!
l look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

861
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:36,753
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

862
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,481
Murder me, Harry.

863
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,477
Leave it alone!

864
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:50,663
Poor kid. I bet she’s alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

865
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:53,417
-Who?
-Hermione, of course.

866
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:57,043
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she’s coming with?

867
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,583
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

868
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:04,501
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

869
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:07,325
-Hello, boys.
-Hello, boys.

870
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,272
Don't you look...

871
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,116
...dashing.

872
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:14,614
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

873
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:16,781
-Ready, professor?
-To dance.

874
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:19,833
It’s traditional that the three champions--
Well, in this case, four.

875
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:21,306
--are the first to dance.

876
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:24,087
-Surely I told you that.
-No.

877
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,500
Well, now you know.

878
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:31,996
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

879
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,798
-Oh, there you are.
-Come on, then.

880
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,567
Come along this way.

881
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,240
Oh, come on.

882
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,050
-Hi.
-Now, I need you all to line up...

883
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:49,429
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

884
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:54,151
This way. This way. Come along.

885
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:58,105
She looks beautiful!

886
01:16:58,547 --> 01:16:59,946
Yeah, she does.

887
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:50,660
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

888
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:53,984
No. Absolutely not.

889
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,378
Hi!

890
01:18:09,318 --> 01:18:11,068
Harry, take my waist.

891
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,448
-What?
-Now!

892
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:21,829
Are you ready?

893
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,615
Move your body like a hairy troll

894
01:19:25,661 --> 01:19:27,831
Learning to rock and roll

895
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,809
Spin around like a crazy elf

896
01:19:31,634 --> 01:19:33,594
Dancing by himself

897
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:37,099
Boogie down like a unicorn

898
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:39,813
No stopping till the break of dawn

899
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,766
Put your hands up in the air

900
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:45,742
Like an ogre who just don't care

901
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,122
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?

902
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,717
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

903
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,148
I don’t think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

904
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:02,837
May I have your arm?

905
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,598
Arm. Leg. I’m yours.

906
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,227
Hot, isn’t it?

907
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:37,026
Viktor’s gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

908
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,849
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

909
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:45,021
What’s got your wand in a knot?

910
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:48,857
He’s a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

911
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:52,608
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

912
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:55,889
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

913
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,452
. is international
magical cooperation...

914
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:01,826
...to make friends.

915
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,471
I think he’s got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

916
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:17,888
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

917
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,600
No.

918
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:30,156
-He’s using you.
-How dare you?!

919
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:34,308
-Besides, I can take care of myself.
-l doubt it. He’s way too old.

920
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:38,210
-What?! What? That's what you think?
-Yeah, that’s what I think.

921
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,697
You know the solution then, don’t you?

922
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,880
-Go on.
-Next time there’s a ball...

923
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:46,048
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

924
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,382
And not as a last resort.

925
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:52,494
Well, that’s-- 1 mean,
that's just completely off the point.

926
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:54,345
Harry.

927
01:21:54,977 --> 01:21:56,117
Where have you been?

928
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:58,634
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

929
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,290
-They get scary when they get older.
-Ron, you spoiled everything!

930
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,594
What's this about?

931
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:14,724
No, don't let

932
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:20,709
This magic die

933
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:25,435
The answer's there

934
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:25,939
Let me see it again.

935
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:30,083
Yes, the time is close now.

936
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,750
Harry, at last!

937
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:42,969
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

938
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:55,459
You all right, Harry?

939
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,615
I just got in.

940
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:00,514
Me.

941
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:14,817
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

942
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:19,074
-The task is two days from now.
-Really? I had no idea.

943
01:24:21,123 --> 01:24:22,702
Il suppose Viktor’s
already figured it out.

944
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,581
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

945
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:31,169
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor’s more of a physical being.

946
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:38,280
I just mean he’s not
particularly loquacious.

947
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:41,101
Mostly, he watches me study.

948
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:44,017
It’s a bit annoying, actually.

949
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:48,017
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

950
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,524
What's that supposed to mean?

951
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,896
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

952
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:57,236
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

953
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,190
And...

954
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:04,401
...[’m scared for you.

955
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,847
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

956
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,960
I'm not sure it’s going
to be enough this time.

957
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,929
Hey, Potter!

958
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,190
-Potter!
-Cedric.

959
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:24,545
How--? How are you?

960
01:25:25,821 --> 01:25:27,050
Spectacular.

961
01:25:28,757 --> 01:25:32,126
l realize l never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

962
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:34,811
Forget it. I'm sure you
would’ve done the same for me.

963
01:25:35,397 --> 01:25:36,767
Exactly.

964
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:40,316
You know the Prefects’ bathroom
on the fifth floor?

965
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,753
It’s not a bad place for a bath.

966
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:51,114
Just take your egg...

967
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,480
..and mull things over
in the hot water.

968
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,918
I must be out of my mind.

969
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:44,297
I'm definitely out of my mind.

970
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:50,105
I'd try putting it in the water
if 1 were you.

971
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:52,342
Myrtle!

972
01:26:52,741 --> 01:26:54,261
Hello, Harry.

973
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:58,080
Long time no see.

974
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:05,971
l was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

975
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:09,608
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

976
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:12,242
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

977
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,244
Polyjuice Potion?

978
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,769
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

979
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,563
That's what he did.

980
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,070
The other boy...

981
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,490
...the handsome one...

982
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,130
...Cedric.

983
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:42,028
Well, go on. Open it.

984
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:54,855
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

985
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:59,737
We cannot sing
Above the ground

986
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:04,315
An hour long you'll have to look

987
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:09,680
To recover what we took

988
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:19,506
Myrtle...

989
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:24,349
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

990
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,127
Very good.

991
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:32,043
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

992
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:36,384
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

993
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,226
Harry, tell me again.

994
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,656
“Come seek us
where our voices sound.”

995
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,419
The Black Lake, that’s obvious.

996
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:06,926
“An hour long you'll have to look.”

997
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:10,449
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

998
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:13,887
"Potentially problematic”?

999
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:17,152
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1000
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:21,896
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1001
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:24,781
Hate to break up the skull session.

1002
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,010
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1003
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:29,605
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1004
01:29:30,065 --> 01:29:32,405
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and--

1005
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:35,181
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1006
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:37,310
..and could do with
a good night’s sleep.

1007
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,896
Go. Now!

1008
01:29:50,185 --> 01:29:51,765
Longbottom!

1009
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:53,933
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1010
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:04,761
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1011
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,480
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1012
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:12,213
Do you know there’s a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1013
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:16,188
Neville, no offense,
but I really don’t care...

1014
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,765
..-about plants.

1015
01:30:19,314 --> 01:30:20,804
Now, if there’s...

1016
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:25,402
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1017
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,344
...then great. But otherwise--

1018
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:32,163
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1019
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:36,345
-Any bets? Any bets?
-Come on, place your bets!

1020
01:30:36,865 --> 01:30:38,155
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1021
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:39,760
-Three lads.
-One lady.

1022
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:42,000
-Four go down.
-But do four come up?

1023
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:43,777
Don’t be so mean.

1024
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:46,182
-Any bets?
-Fleur’s 10-1.

1025
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:50,326
-You're sure about this, Neville?
-Absolutely.

1026
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:52,445
-For an hour?
-Most likely.

1027
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,157
Most likely?

1028
01:30:54,516 --> 01:30:56,446
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1029
01:30:56,885 --> 01:30:59,055
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water--

1030
01:30:59,521 --> 01:31:01,861
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1031
01:31:02,357 --> 01:31:04,087
I just wanted to help.

1032
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:07,212
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1033
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,312
Where are they anyway?

1034
01:31:09,698 --> 01:31:12,358
-You seem a little tense, Harry.
-Do I?

1035
01:31:19,741 --> 01:31:21,701
Welcome to the second task.

1036
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:25,393
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1037
01:31:26,014 --> 01:31:27,214
A treasure of sorts.

1038
01:31:27,549 --> 01:31:29,859
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1039
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:32,722
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1040
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:34,590
In order to win...

1041
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:38,326
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1042
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,270
-Simple enough, except for this:
-Put that in your mouth.

1043
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:44,952
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1044
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:49,027
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1045
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:51,960
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1046
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:21,347
-What's the matter with him?
-I don’t know, I can't see him.

1047
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:25,668
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1048
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,546
Yeah!

1049
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:32,375
What?

1050
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,030
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1051
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:56,682
..has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1052
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,352
...80 She will take no further part
in this task.

1053
01:35:18,513 --> 01:35:20,153
But she’s my friend too!

1054
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:23,470
Only one!

1055
01:36:15,036 --> 01:36:16,676
Let’s get down below.

1056
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:29,401
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1057
01:37:27,275 --> 01:37:28,795
Yes!

1058
01:37:47,128 --> 01:37:48,938
Ascendio!

1059
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:55,925
Harry!

1060
01:37:58,439 --> 01:37:59,729
He’s all right.

1061
01:38:01,109 --> 01:38:02,369
He’s all right. Barty!

1062
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,730
-Go get him another towel.
-l want all the judges over here now!

1063
01:38:06,748 --> 01:38:09,817
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1064
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,375
My little sister.

1065
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:14,357
Thank you.

1066
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:17,755
And you! You helped.

1067
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:21,385
Well, yeah, a bit.

1068
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:29,990
-Harry!
-Hermione!

1069
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:32,644
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1070
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:35,907
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1071
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,090
I finished last, Hermione.

1072
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:42,810
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1073
01:38:43,484 --> 01:38:46,324
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1074
01:38:46,888 --> 01:38:49,438
-Come on! Come on!
-Attention!

1075
01:38:52,126 --> 01:38:54,406
Attention!

1076
01:38:55,196 --> 01:38:58,596
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1077
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,570
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1078
01:39:03,171 --> 01:39:05,511
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1079
01:39:06,007 --> 01:39:10,366
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1080
01:39:11,145 --> 01:39:14,895
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1081
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:17,333
...second place...

1082
01:39:17,752 --> 01:39:19,062
-Second place!
-Well done!

1083
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:21,730
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1084
01:39:23,324 --> 01:39:24,664
Yes!

1085
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:29,942
-Right on.
-All that moral fiber, eh?

1086
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:31,761
-It’s great.
-Moral fiber?

1087
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,213
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1088
01:39:34,669 --> 01:39:37,009
-Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
-Congratulations, Potter.

1089
01:39:37,505 --> 01:39:38,965
-A fine achievement.
-Thank you.

1090
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:40,680
Well done, boy.

1091
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:43,882
-See you at Hagrid’s, Harry.
-I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1092
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:47,955
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1093
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:52,490
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1094
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:54,837
...to lose one’s family.

1095
01:39:57,091 --> 01:39:58,991
Never whole again, are we?

1096
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,336
Still, life goes on...

1097
01:40:04,265 --> 01:40:05,725
..and here we stand.

1098
01:40:08,803 --> 01:40:11,202
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1099
01:40:11,706 --> 01:40:12,996
Bartemius!

1100
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:16,971
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1101
01:40:17,645 --> 01:40:20,455
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1102
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:34,997
And they say I’m mad.

1103
01:40:44,505 --> 01:40:47,785
Now, I remember--
l remember when I first met you all.

1104
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:51,068
Biggest bunch of misfits
l ever set eyes on.

1105
01:40:51,946 --> 01:40:54,196
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1106
01:40:54,682 --> 01:40:58,222
-And here we all are, four years later.
-We’re still a bunch of misfits.

1107
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:01,816
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1108
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:03,760
And Harry, of course.

1109
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:08,845
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1110
01:41:09,697 --> 01:41:11,477
Hooray!

1111
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:15,357
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1112
01:41:15,836 --> 01:41:18,146
Teach us something, please

1113
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:29,759
Mr. Crouch?

1114
01:41:37,024 --> 01:41:40,184
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1115
01:41:40,795 --> 01:41:42,165
I will not.

1116
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:46,099
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1117
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:47,937
Then for once show them some!

1118
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:51,869
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1119
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:55,350
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1120
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:58,370
-What did you say to me?
-Excuse me, gentlemen.

1121
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:02,099
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1122
01:42:06,887 --> 01:42:08,257
Oh, Harry!

1123
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,643
Harry, how good to see you again.

1124
01:42:11,759 --> 01:42:13,099
l can come back later, professor.

1125
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:16,391
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1126
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:19,214
Minister, after you.

1127
01:42:20,067 --> 01:42:21,817
There you are. Your hat.

1128
01:42:22,236 --> 01:42:25,456
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1129
01:42:26,073 --> 01:42:28,913
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1130
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:02,134
Professor?

1131
01:44:02,503 --> 01:44:04,723
-Professor.
-Yeah.

1132
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:19,260
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1133
01:44:19,887 --> 01:44:21,587
...to present evidence to this council.

1134
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:24,358
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1135
01:44:24,859 --> 01:44:28,429
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1136
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:33,135
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1137
01:44:33,868 --> 01:44:35,358
Do you accept these terms?

1138
01:44:36,137 --> 01:44:38,507
-I do, sir.
-And what do you wish to present?

1139
01:44:39,173 --> 01:44:41,343
I have names, sir.

1140
01:44:42,176 --> 01:44:45,336
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1141
01:44:48,449 --> 01:44:50,669
-Rosier is dead.
-He took a piece of me with him...

1142
01:44:51,152 --> 01:44:53,022
-...though, didn’t he?
-l didn’t know.

1143
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:55,764
-If that is all the witness has to offer--
-No, no, no.

1144
01:44:56,257 --> 01:44:59,156
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1145
01:44:59,727 --> 01:45:01,807
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1146
01:45:02,263 --> 01:45:03,313
Yeah, the same.

1147
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:06,851
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1148
01:45:08,536 --> 01:45:11,406
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1149
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,701
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1150
01:45:14,108 --> 01:45:18,268
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1151
01:45:19,013 --> 01:45:21,623
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1152
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:25,629
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort’s downfall...

1153
01:45:26,287 --> 01:45:28,917
-...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
-It’s a lie!

1154
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:32,476
-Today he’s no more a Death Eater than I am.
-Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1155
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:35,080
Silence!

1156
01:45:35,963 --> 01:45:38,983
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1157
01:45:39,567 --> 01:45:41,437
...this session is now concluded.

1158
01:45:41,869 --> 01:45:43,709
Oh, no, no, no.

1159
01:45:44,872 --> 01:45:46,162
I've heard about one more.

1160
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:48,757
-What's that?
-The name.

1161
01:45:49,243 --> 01:45:50,533
-Yes?
-I know for a fact...

1162
01:45:50,878 --> 01:45:52,657
...this person took part
in the capture...

1163
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,980
..and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1164
01:45:55,416 --> 01:45:58,486
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1165
01:45:59,086 --> 01:46:01,136
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1166
01:46:01,589 --> 01:46:03,809
Barty Crouch...

1167
01:46:06,827 --> 01:46:07,727
Junior.

1168
01:46:17,338 --> 01:46:18,827
Hold him down!

1169
01:46:22,676 --> 01:46:25,866
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1170
01:46:28,015 --> 01:46:29,415
Hello, Father.

1171
01:46:31,018 --> 01:46:32,828
You are no son of mine.

1172
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:48,318
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1173
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:51,467
It’s a Pensieve.

1174
01:46:51,805 --> 01:46:55,905
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1175
01:46:56,644 --> 01:46:59,744
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1176
01:47:00,648 --> 01:47:03,258
You see, Harry, l have searched
and searched for something...

1177
01:47:03,784 --> 01:47:05,154
...-some small detail...

1178
01:47:06,754 --> 01:47:08,624
.. something I might have overlooked...

1179
01:47:09,056 --> 01:47:12,745
... something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1180
01:47:14,061 --> 01:47:17,460
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1181
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:20,398
It's maddening.

1182
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:24,487
Sir? Mr. Crouch’s son.

1183
01:47:25,472 --> 01:47:27,282
What exactly happened to him?

1184
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:31,928
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1185
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:36,340
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1186
01:47:38,252 --> 01:47:40,882
-Why do you ask?
-It's just that I....

1187
01:47:41,989 --> 01:47:43,829
l had a dream about him.

1188
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,820
It was in the summer, before school.

1189
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:53,928
In the dream, { was in a house.

1190
01:47:54,501 --> 01:47:58,691
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1191
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:02,629
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch’s son.

1192
01:48:03,444 --> 01:48:05,934
-Have there been others like this dream?
-Yes.

1193
01:48:07,114 --> 01:48:08,544
Always the same one.

1194
01:48:11,785 --> 01:48:13,835
Sir, these dreams...

1195
01:48:14,288 --> 01:48:18,857
... what I see, you don’t think
it’s actually happening, do you?

1196
01:48:21,128 --> 01:48:23,737
I think it’s unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1197
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:26,327
I think it’s best if you simply...

1198
01:48:32,206 --> 01:48:33,756
...cast them away.

1199
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:46,730
It’s a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1200
01:48:55,929 --> 01:48:56,979
Potter!

1201
01:48:57,297 --> 01:48:59,517
What's your hurry?

1202
01:49:04,938 --> 01:49:08,248
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1203
01:49:08,876 --> 01:49:10,866
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1204
01:49:11,912 --> 01:49:13,252
Yes, sir.

1205
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:15,611
Ingenious.

1206
01:49:17,618 --> 01:49:21,098
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1207
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:25,459
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1208
01:49:27,594 --> 01:49:29,294
Nor is this.

1209
01:49:33,734 --> 01:49:35,194
Know what it is?

1210
01:49:36,703 --> 01:49:37,963
Bubble juice, sir?

1211
01:49:38,705 --> 01:49:40,375
Veritaserum.

1212
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:44,591
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1213
01:49:45,212 --> 01:49:49,752
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1214
01:49:51,051 --> 01:49:53,711
..-should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1215
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:58,534
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1216
01:49:59,293 --> 01:50:03,163
-l haven't stolen anything.
-Don't lie to me.

1217
01:50:04,832 --> 01:50:09,842
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1218
01:50:11,238 --> 01:50:14,168
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1219
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,671
...[’m going to find out why!

1220
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:45,170
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1221
01:51:04,558 --> 01:51:05,898
Sonorus!

1222
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:15,019
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1223
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:20,196
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1224
01:51:22,910 --> 01:51:24,490
.and Mr. Potter...

1225
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:28,100
...are tied for first position...

1226
01:51:28,482 --> 01:51:32,112
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1227
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:36,894
-...and Miss Delacour.
-Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1228
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:40,912
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1229
01:51:45,632 --> 01:51:48,031
I’ve instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1230
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:51,115
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1231
01:51:51,638 --> 01:51:55,588
..-he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1232
01:51:56,476 --> 01:51:59,906
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1233
01:52:03,517 --> 01:52:07,327
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1234
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:10,981
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1235
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:14,218
You see, people change in the maze.

1236
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:16,251
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1237
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:20,820
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1238
01:52:22,869 --> 01:52:25,499
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1239
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:36,205
Good luck.

1240
01:52:36,783 --> 01:52:38,483
-My boy.
-See you later, Dad.

1241
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:43,367
On the count of three. One--

1242
01:56:11,465 --> 01:56:12,545
Fleur?

1243
01:56:14,367 --> 01:56:15,627
Fleur.

1244
01:56:19,372 --> 01:56:20,982
Periculum!

1245
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:01,170
Get down!

1246
01:57:01,915 --> 01:57:03,435
Get down!

1247
01:57:04,284 --> 01:57:05,364
Expelliarmus!

1248
01:57:15,128 --> 01:57:17,938
No, don't! Stop!
He’s bewitched, Cedric!

1249
01:57:18,498 --> 01:57:20,308
-Get off me!
-He’s bewitched!

1250
01:57:32,178 --> 01:57:33,668
Yes.

1251
01:57:54,768 --> 01:57:56,318
Harry!

1252
01:57:58,838 --> 01:58:00,298
Harry!

1253
01:58:02,876 --> 01:58:04,136
Harry!

1254
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:08,150
Harry!

1255
01:58:10,317 --> 01:58:11,897
Reducto!

1256
01:58:28,902 --> 01:58:31,092
-Thanks.
-No problem.

1257
01:58:31,805 --> 01:58:35,935
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1258
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:38,196
For a moment, so did I.

1259
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:41,300
Some game, huh?

1260
01:58:42,482 --> 01:58:43,712
Some game.

1261
01:58:49,322 --> 01:58:50,752
Go!

1262
01:59:01,101 --> 01:59:03,760
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1263
01:59:04,304 --> 01:59:06,054
-Together. One, two...
-Two...

1264
01:59:06,473 --> 01:59:07,553
-...three!
-...three!

1265
01:59:20,153 --> 01:59:22,733
-You okay?
-Yeah. You?

1266
01:59:30,163 --> 01:59:31,333
Where are we?

1267
01:59:37,203 --> 01:59:38,633
I've been here before.

1268
01:59:42,475 --> 01:59:43,875
It's a Portkey.

1269
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:49,595
-Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
-I’ve been here before, in a dream.

1270
01:59:52,185 --> 01:59:55,175
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1271
01:59:55,755 --> 01:59:57,485
What are you talking about?

1272
02:00:02,962 --> 02:00:05,512
-Harry! What is it?
-Get back to the cup!

1273
02:00:13,506 --> 02:00:15,556
-Who are you? What do you want?
-Kill the spare.

1274
02:00:16,009 --> 02:00:18,439
-Avada Kedavra!
-No! Cedric!

1275
02:00:30,090 --> 02:00:31,730
Do it! Now!

1276
02:00:43,903 --> 02:00:46,093
Bone of the father...

1277
02:00:46,573 --> 02:00:48,593
..unwillingly given.

1278
02:00:56,349 --> 02:00:59,009
Flesh of the servant...

1279
02:01:01,421 --> 02:01:04,201
...Willingly sacrificed.

1280
02:01:08,695 --> 02:01:11,974
And blood of the enemy...

1281
02:01:18,238 --> 02:01:20,428
.. forcibly taken.

1282
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:29,389
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1283
02:01:30,517 --> 02:01:32,217
.
. again.

1284
02:02:35,849 --> 02:02:38,839
My wand, Wormtail.

1285
02:02:48,795 --> 02:02:50,525
Hold out your arm.

1286
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:52,330
Master.

1287
02:02:52,699 --> 02:02:55,009
Thank you, master.

1288
02:02:55,501 --> 02:02:56,791
The other arm, Wormtail.

1289
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:39,280
Welcome, my friends.

1290
02:03:40,914 --> 02:03:43,344
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1291
02:03:44,317 --> 02:03:49,147
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1292
02:03:50,757 --> 02:03:53,337
I confess myself...

1293
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:55,530
... disappointed.

1294
02:03:56,396 --> 02:03:58,236
Not one of you tried to find me.

1295
02:03:58,665 --> 02:04:01,625
Crabbe! Macnair!

1296
02:04:02,936 --> 02:04:04,106
Goyle!

1297
02:04:06,773 --> 02:04:08,203
Not even you...

1298
02:04:12,278 --> 02:04:13,978
...Lucius.

1299
02:04:16,049 --> 02:04:20,299
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts--

1300
02:04:21,054 --> 02:04:23,684
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1301
02:04:24,223 --> 02:04:28,763
l assure you, my Lord,
l have never renounced the old ways.

1302
02:04:31,097 --> 02:04:36,047
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1303
02:04:38,738 --> 02:04:41,048
...that is my true mask.

1304
02:04:41,741 --> 02:04:43,111
l returned.

1305
02:04:45,778 --> 02:04:49,208
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1306
02:04:50,817 --> 02:04:55,887
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1307
02:05:01,794 --> 02:05:03,844
Thank you, master.

1308
02:05:04,731 --> 02:05:06,251
Thank you.

1309
02:05:09,569 --> 02:05:11,649
-Such a handsome boy.
-Don't touch him!

1310
02:05:13,406 --> 02:05:14,716
Harry.

1311
02:05:15,074 --> 02:05:17,534
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1312
02:05:18,044 --> 02:05:21,914
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1313
02:05:22,615 --> 02:05:23,815
I'd introduce you...

1314
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:27,929
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1315
02:05:31,124 --> 02:05:33,464
The boy who lived.

1316
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:36,510
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1317
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:40,540
Shall l reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1318
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:45,360
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1319
02:05:46,105 --> 02:05:47,504
Yes, shall 1?

1320
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,211
It was love.

1321
02:05:49,542 --> 02:05:53,492
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1322
02:05:54,213 --> 02:05:56,492
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1323
02:05:57,216 --> 02:05:58,796
I could not touch him.

1324
02:06:00,253 --> 02:06:02,123
It was old magic.

1325
02:06:02,555 --> 02:06:04,545
Something I should have foreseen.

1326
02:06:04,991 --> 02:06:06,571
But no matter, no matter.

1327
02:06:06,959 --> 02:06:08,889
Things have changed.

1328
02:06:09,929 --> 02:06:12,999
l can touch you...

1329
02:06:14,033 --> 02:06:15,553
. NOW.

1330
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:25,080
Yeah.

1331
02:06:31,584 --> 02:06:34,834
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1332
02:06:36,422 --> 02:06:37,942
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1333
02:06:39,759 --> 02:06:41,719
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1334
02:06:43,563 --> 02:06:45,613
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1335
02:06:46,065 --> 02:06:48,205
First, we bow to each other.

1336
02:06:48,668 --> 02:06:50,748
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1337
02:06:51,204 --> 02:06:54,044
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1338
02:06:54,607 --> 02:06:55,777
I said, bow.

1339
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:01,620
-That’s better. And now....
-No.

1340
02:07:02,548 --> 02:07:04,188
Crucio!

1341
02:07:06,886 --> 02:07:08,406
Crucio!

1342
02:07:09,689 --> 02:07:11,389
Attaboy, Harry.

1343
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:13,661
Your parents would be proud.

1344
02:07:14,227 --> 02:07:17,217
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1345
02:07:17,797 --> 02:07:19,196
Expelliar--

1346
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:24,510
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1347
02:07:24,971 --> 02:07:26,721
I'm going to destroy you.

1348
02:07:29,175 --> 02:07:34,065
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1349
02:07:35,381 --> 02:07:37,631
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1350
02:07:38,117 --> 02:07:40,457
...they'll speak only of how you...

1351
02:07:41,087 --> 02:07:42,697
...begged for death.

1352
02:07:43,089 --> 02:07:46,399
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1353
02:07:47,393 --> 02:07:48,793
...obliged.

1354
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:50,638
Get up!

1355
02:07:55,835 --> 02:07:57,565
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1356
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:59,960
l want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1357
02:08:00,406 --> 02:08:03,216
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1358
02:08:17,557 --> 02:08:19,077
Have it your way.

1359
02:08:20,326 --> 02:08:22,436
-Expelliarmus!
-Avada Kedavra!

1360
02:08:40,246 --> 02:08:42,586
Do nothing! He’s mine to finish!

1361
02:08:47,486 --> 02:08:48,976
He’s mine!

1362
02:09:22,255 --> 02:09:25,765
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1363
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,235
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1364
02:09:28,661 --> 02:09:30,211
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1365
02:09:31,631 --> 02:09:34,291
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1366
02:09:34,834 --> 02:09:37,054
Take my body back to my father.

1367
02:09:38,404 --> 02:09:39,574
Let go.

1368
02:09:40,206 --> 02:09:41,936
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1369
02:09:43,009 --> 02:09:45,319
Let go! Let go!

1370
02:09:51,384 --> 02:09:52,584
Acciof

1371
02:09:58,457 --> 02:10:00,207
No!

1372
02:10:13,205 --> 02:10:14,605
He did it!

1373
02:10:16,042 --> 02:10:17,502
Harry!

1374
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:21,789
Harry!

1375
02:10:23,182 --> 02:10:26,022
No! No! No, don't!

1376
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:28,359
For God’s sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1377
02:10:28,888 --> 02:10:31,138
He's back. He’s back.

1378
02:10:31,624 --> 02:10:33,404
Voldemort's back.

1379
02:10:33,826 --> 02:10:35,936
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1380
02:10:36,395 --> 02:10:38,445
I couldn’t leave him, not there.

1381
02:10:38,898 --> 02:10:41,358
It’s all right, Harry. It’s all right.

1382
02:10:41,867 --> 02:10:43,887
He’s home. You both are.

1383
02:10:44,337 --> 02:10:47,527
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1384
02:10:51,043 --> 02:10:54,263
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1385
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:56,469
Let me through.

1386
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:58,189
Let me through!

1387
02:11:00,286 --> 02:11:01,396
Let me through!

1388
02:11:01,721 --> 02:11:02,950
That's my son!

1389
02:11:04,423 --> 02:11:05,683
That's my boy!

1390
02:11:08,694 --> 02:11:11,094
It's my boy!

1391
02:11:14,233 --> 02:11:17,363
-Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
-No.

1392
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:20,580
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1393
02:11:21,607 --> 02:11:23,537
No!

1394
02:11:26,879 --> 02:11:28,989
It’s all right, I got you.

1395
02:11:29,448 --> 02:11:32,378
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1396
02:11:36,789 --> 02:11:38,369
No!

1397
02:11:39,692 --> 02:11:41,332
No!

1398
02:12:23,969 --> 02:12:25,459
Are you all right, Potter?

1399
02:12:26,238 --> 02:12:27,938
Does it hurt? That?

1400
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:29,920
Not so much now.

1401
02:12:31,076 --> 02:12:32,916
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1402
02:12:36,315 --> 02:12:38,065
The cup was a Portkey.

1403
02:12:41,020 --> 02:12:42,630
Someone had bewitched it.

1404
02:12:43,122 --> 02:12:44,962
What was it like?

1405
02:12:45,558 --> 02:12:47,018
-What was he like?
-Who?

1406
02:12:47,393 --> 02:12:48,943
The Dark Lord.

1407
02:12:51,464 --> 02:12:54,184
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1408
02:12:55,835 --> 02:12:57,415
I don’t know.

1409
02:13:00,473 --> 02:13:03,053
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1410
02:13:06,378 --> 02:13:08,128
.. into one of my nightmares.

1411
02:13:27,099 --> 02:13:28,469
Were there others?

1412
02:13:28,834 --> 02:13:30,824
In the graveyard, were there others?

1413
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:36,269
he.

1414
02:13:37,142 --> 02:13:40,602
I don’t think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1415
02:13:48,521 --> 02:13:51,391
“Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?”

1416
02:13:56,195 --> 02:13:58,884
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1417
02:13:59,431 --> 02:14:01,101
.. if [hadn't suggested it?

1418
02:14:04,870 --> 02:14:08,120
Do you think Cedric Diggory would’ ve
told you to open the egg underwater...

1419
02:14:08,741 --> 02:14:10,931
.if [hadn't told him first myself?

1420
02:14:12,845 --> 02:14:15,185
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1421
02:14:15,681 --> 02:14:18,491
...could’ve provided you with gillyweed
if ! hadn't given him the book...

1422
02:14:19,051 --> 02:14:20,421
...that led him straight to it?

1423
02:14:29,028 --> 02:14:32,538
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1424
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:36,789
-You bewitched Krum, but you--
-"But-- But--"

1425
02:14:37,403 --> 02:14:39,303
You won because ! made it so, Potter.

1426
02:14:40,205 --> 02:14:43,275
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1427
02:14:43,876 --> 02:14:45,016
And now the deed is done.

1428
02:14:46,845 --> 02:14:50,655
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1429
02:14:59,692 --> 02:15:02,762
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1430
02:15:04,129 --> 02:15:06,318
...that I have once and for all...

1431
02:15:07,232 --> 02:15:11,042
... silenced the great Harry Potter.

1432
02:15:11,737 --> 02:15:12,847
Expelliarmus!

1433
02:15:17,710 --> 02:15:18,820
Severus.

1434
02:15:21,447 --> 02:15:22,757
That’s it, take it.

1435
02:15:24,917 --> 02:15:27,957
-Do you know who I am?
-Albus Dumbledore.

1436
02:15:28,554 --> 02:15:30,924
-Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
-No.

1437
02:15:31,423 --> 02:15:34,143
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1438
02:15:37,563 --> 02:15:38,903
Harry, away from there!

1439
02:16:00,085 --> 02:16:03,015
-You all right, Alastor?
-I'm sorry, Albus.

1440
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:06,200
That’s Moody. But then who's--?

1441
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:09,220
Polyjuice Potion.

1442
02:16:09,528 --> 02:16:12,368
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1443
02:16:12,998 --> 02:16:14,697
We'll get you up in a minute.

1444
02:16:49,368 --> 02:16:50,598
Harry!

1445
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:56,370
Barty Crouch Junior.

1446
02:16:56,875 --> 02:16:59,455
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1447
02:17:02,181 --> 02:17:03,231
Your arm, Harry.

1448
02:17:07,753 --> 02:17:09,713
You know what this means, don’t you?

1449
02:17:10,888 --> 02:17:12,058
He’s back.

1450
02:17:13,424 --> 02:17:15,295
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1451
02:17:16,495 --> 02:17:18,545
I'm sorry, sir. 1 couldn't help it.

1452
02:17:19,031 --> 02:17:23,011
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they’re missing a prisoner.

1453
02:17:24,036 --> 02:17:26,226
-l'll be welcomed back like a hero.
-Perhaps.

1454
02:17:27,106 --> 02:17:29,626
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1455
02:17:49,861 --> 02:17:52,201
Today, we acknowledge...

1456
02:17:53,232 --> 02:17:55,662
...a really terrible loss.

1457
02:17:58,102 --> 02:18:00,532
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1458
02:18:01,039 --> 02:18:03,089
..exceptionally hard-working...

1459
02:18:04,276 --> 02:18:06,356
...infinitely fair-minded...

1460
02:18:07,212 --> 02:18:09,232
..and, most importantly...

1461
02:18:09,815 --> 02:18:13,825
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1462
02:18:15,521 --> 02:18:19,361
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1463
02:18:22,928 --> 02:18:24,268
You see...

1464
02:18:25,297 --> 02:18:27,137
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1465
02:18:28,299 --> 02:18:30,049
...by Lord Voldemort!

1466
02:18:32,204 --> 02:18:35,333
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1467
02:18:36,407 --> 02:18:39,657
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1468
02:18:42,281 --> 02:18:43,741
Now, the pain...

1469
02:18:44,116 --> 02:18:47,335
..-we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1470
02:18:47,952 --> 02:18:49,123
..and reminds us...

1471
02:18:49,454 --> 02:18:52,704
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1472
02:18:53,325 --> 02:18:56,345
..-our hearts beat as one.

1473
02:18:57,262 --> 02:18:59,042
In light of recent events...

1474
02:18:59,630 --> 02:19:03,971
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1475
02:19:05,437 --> 02:19:10,127
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1476
02:19:11,209 --> 02:19:13,080
You remember that...

1477
02:19:13,946 --> 02:19:16,606
...-and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1478
02:19:17,516 --> 02:19:19,686
..-kind and honest...

1479
02:19:20,485 --> 02:19:24,525
.and brave and true,
tight to the very end.

1480
02:19:50,315 --> 02:19:52,095
I never liked these curtains.

1481
02:19:52,951 --> 02:19:55,291
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1482
02:19:55,954 --> 02:19:57,564
By accident, of course.

1483
02:20:03,462 --> 02:20:07,302
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I’m sorry.

1484
02:20:11,236 --> 02:20:12,726
Professor...

1485
02:20:13,138 --> 02:20:15,768
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1486
02:20:16,942 --> 02:20:20,812
..-when Voldemort’s wand and mine
sort of connected.

1487
02:20:22,915 --> 02:20:24,965
Priori Incantatem.

1488
02:20:29,388 --> 02:20:31,788
You saw your parents that night,
didn’t you?

1489
02:20:32,691 --> 02:20:34,301
They reappeared.

1490
02:20:35,994 --> 02:20:39,304
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
Il trust you know that.

1491
02:20:42,334 --> 02:20:44,614
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1492
02:20:45,404 --> 02:20:49,654
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1493
02:20:53,612 --> 02:20:55,071
But remember this:

1494
02:20:55,447 --> 02:20:57,147
You have friends here.

1495
02:20:59,384 --> 02:21:00,934
You're not alone.

1496
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:23,360
Hermione.

1497
02:21:23,976 --> 02:21:25,726
This is for you.

1498
02:21:26,578 --> 02:21:28,508
Write to me. Promise.

1499
02:21:29,881 --> 02:21:31,110
Bye.

1500
02:21:37,522 --> 02:21:39,222
Au revoir, Ron.

1501
02:22:23,402 --> 02:22:25,622
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1502
02:22:26,104 --> 02:22:27,094
-No.
-No.

1503
02:22:27,406 --> 02:22:31,246
No, I didn’t think so. Oh, well.
What’s life without a few dragons?

1504
02:22:36,181 --> 02:22:38,671
Everything's going to change now,
isn’t it?

1505
02:22:46,324 --> 02:22:47,614
Yes.

1506
02:22:52,531 --> 02:22:55,431
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1507
02:22:56,001 --> 02:22:58,251
I won't. You know I won't.

1508
02:22:59,838 --> 02:23:03,148
-Harry will, won't you?
-Yeah. Every week.

1509
02:37:00,344 --> 02:37:02,094
