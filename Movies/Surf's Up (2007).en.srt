1
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,680
Quiet on the set. And we're rolling.

2
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,470
Cody Maverick interview, take one.

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,425
Why are you guys here
to interview me?

4
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,640
It's what we do.
We're a reality film crew.

5
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,373
Should I know some of the questions
before we start?

6
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,978
-No. They're easy.
-Okay.

7
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,694
-Can you stand on that box, please?
-Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,785
Right there? What is that?

9
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,014
-What is that?
-A sound thing. It's a microphone.

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,530
What's up, man? I'm Cody.

11
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,404
And you're what, 14, 15 years old?

12
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,490
Seventeen years of age.

13
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,642
And any other skills
besides surfing?

14
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,794
Like what?
Like singing and dancing?

15
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,066
Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,689
No, not me, man. I just surf.

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,378
-Loser.
-[ just--

18
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,034
Cut it out, Glen. Stop, man.

19
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,682
We're here to make
a movie about Cody.

20
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,561
-Does he have to be here?
-It's gonna be great.

21
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:17,586
Can I get in line now to not see it?

22
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:18,908
We'll re-slate.

23
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,732
Since we're talking about surfing,
give us your thoughts about surfing.

24
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,452
Surfing. Surfing.

25
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,667
-Where do I start?
-How about at the beginning?

26
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,895
Okay, well--

27
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:35,274
So as soon as there was the first wave,
right? There was the first surfer.

28
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,971
All they needed was, like,
a piece of driftwood...

29
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,795
...@ block of ice or something like
that, and then they were off.

30
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,719
And they were hooked, man.
They were hooked,

31
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,032
Up till recent times, you had
your old dudes. Your hang-six cats.

32
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,327
These old guys used to lay down
with these huge, humongous boards.

33
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,797
These guys were the pioneers...

34
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,047
..but nobody saw
what surfing could really be...

35
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,954
until Big Z did it.

36
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,116
-Could you tell us who Big Z was?
-Who was Big 2?

37
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,766
You're asking the right guy.
You got that far. Z is everything.

38
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,027
Big Z is surfing.
1 mean, he's--

39
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,306
There may well as not have been
an ocean before Z.

40
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,612
They invented the ocean for him.

41
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,936
He lived so hard
because he wasn't afraid to live.

42
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,356
He wasn't afraid to die.

43
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,460
He came to Antarctica
when I was just a kid.

44
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,117
Man, it was the biggest thing
that ever happened here.

45
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,135
And suddenly there he was.

46
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:59,374
Just floating over the water.
Hovering, you know, like weightless.

47
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,154
He could've walked up to anyone...

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,780
..and he walks right up to me.

49
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,651
And he gives me this awesome,
one-of-a-kind Big Z necklace.

50
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,309
And then he tells me,
"You know, kid, never give up.

51
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,003
Find a way,
because that's what winners do."

52
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,566
He was the greatest.

53
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,003
Everyone looked up to him,
respected him, loved him.

54
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,584
And one day, one day
I'm gonna be just like him.

55
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:51,930
And I've been surfing
ever since ! can remember.

56
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,482
And I've been surfing
ever since ! can remember.

57
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,233
It's hard to imagine my life
when I wasn't surfing.

58
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,751
! want to get out of here,
and this is my ticket out.

59
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,268
I'm really good, man.
I'm the best on the island.

60
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:10,175
! know it sounds cocky for saying that,
but, ! mean, I am, like the best.

61
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,620
! was born and raised here
in Shiverpool.

62
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,479
Lived here my whole life.

63
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,055
That's where they sort the fish. It's
the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.

64
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,948
But yeah, I worked there
just to pacify my mom a little bit.

65
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,174
Good old Shiverpool.

66
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,038
This place sucks, bro.

67
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,446
l worked my way up from the sardine
pile, then to the mackerel pile...

68
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,727
..and l ended up
on the gefilte fish pile.

69
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,139
-All hard work.
-Not like some I could mention.

70
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,518
Yes, this farkakte kid
with the thing on the water.

71
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,221
My house?

72
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,366
Over there. You see it
right there with the surfboards?

73
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,489
Yeah, I just live here with me
and my brother, Glen, my mom.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,960
He was a little, teeny, small egg.

75
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,962
He wasn't very impressive.

76
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,055
Glen was the big egg,
Cody was the small egg.

77
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,181
He can't help it.
That's just the way he is.

78
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,604
I mean, he's out there...

79
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,119
..in the water all day
shirking his responsibilities.

80
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,957
You know, hatching these eggs
is a big responsibility.

81
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,577
And my brother, Cody,
he just doesn't understand that.

82
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:27,096
-He needs to step up and be a man.
-It takes a real man to sit on an egg.

83
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,438
-You know it.
-Quincy, come to Daddy.

84
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,864
He wants to be different.
All the time with the different.

85
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,500
Who's got the time in the day to--

86
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,145
Only six months in a day.

87
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,082
-Thanks for making it.
-Sorry. It was too good to miss.

88
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,641
-Thanks for making it.
-How was it out there?

89
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,627
He's the big brother.
I'm the little brother.

90
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,643
I'm not touching you.

91
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,321
-Not gonna touch you.
-Do you see this?

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,790
-Don't. Please?
-I'm not.

93
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,313
He makes sure that I know that.

94
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,986
! had to fight for everything.
Even Mom's tuna casserole.

95
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,587
I'm lucky I survived.

96
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,555
It really wasn't that easy
for him growing up.

97
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,962
Like I said before...

98
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,165
..he never really knew his father.

99
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm not really the person to ask about it
because I was too young to remember.

100
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,957
Look, I'm not the only kid
on the island...

101
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,547
.. whose dad was, you know, eaten.

102
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:29,314
-Still, it had to be traumatic.
-No. Not for me, bro. Not for me.

103
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,171
-What's your dream?
-To go away.

104
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,315
-To go away. That's great.
-Do you guys want a drink?

105
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,589
Got to run away
from responsibility and life.

106
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,245
This is unique.

107
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,500
-This is not the norm.
-" have dreams."

108
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,630
-When is this not happening?
-Don't make that noise.

109
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,885
-Cody!
-It's really disrespectful.

110
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,351
I would never do that.

111
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,104
You just wouldn't make it
out of your mouth.

112
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,947
That's the difference
between you and me.

113
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,315
You know what?
I can't do this anymore.

114
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,837
Mom. Look what you did.

115
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,239
This is for me. This isn't for you.
Why is Glen still here?

116
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,915
Oh, yeah, exactly. Mom!

117
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,098
! don't understand why
everybody's so judgmental.

118
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,430
! understand why Mom's judgmental.

119
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,999
! think it's because she cares,
partially. It's also partially because...

120
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,796
.. everyone else is looking at her like,
"Hey, Cody's just a bum.

121
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,385
Cody's this. Cody's that.
Cody's this."

122
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,595
Cody's me, bro. Let me be me.

123
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,038
When is that gonna start?

124
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,252
You know what they call me?
The dream maker. The dream maker.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,730
I find these kids,
I bring them here...

126
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,974
..and l give them a chance
to be somebody.

127
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,993
You know my greatest joy
as a surf promoter? Finding Z.

128
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,799
Watching him rise to the top.

129
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,864
! still can't believe he's gone.
He was like a son to me, you know?

130
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,859
It was a heart thing, you know?
Can we just take five minutes?

131
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,273
How's my hair? Is it messed up?
l ain't got all day. Is it mussed?

132
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,313
We just have a few more questions
about Big Z.

133
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,181
But right now
I think we're more interested...

134
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,640
..in the Reggie Belafonte story,
and who could blame us?

135
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,616
But Big Z is kind of the focus
of our--

136
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,668
Let's get the coconut filler guy
over here.

137
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,496
And how about the guy
sweeping the sand?

138
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:25,207
Can we hear your boring story
about your tedious, ridiculous life?

139
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,329
Get your feathers off it! Stop!

140
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,441
l ain't got all day.
I got a big production here.

141
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,863
Roll, okay? Just roll!

142
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,921
Welcome, fans, to another edition
of SPEN Sports.

143
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,049
This is Sal Masakela...

144
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:41,193
..and we're here at the surfing capital
of the world, Pen Gu Island...

145
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,668
..for a preview of the tenth annual
Big Z Memorial Surf- Off.

146
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,002
Professional surfers
extraordinaire...

147
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,069
...Kelly and Rob tell us...

148
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,574
...what challenges
our surfers are going to face.

149
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,488
First things first, Sal. The wave.
It's the perfect combination...

150
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:01,891
..of beauty and danger. Even
the pros are terrified of this place.

151
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,497
Hi, Mom.

152
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,152
Dig this, Sal. Section behind me.

153
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,701
It's "The Boneyards."
Few surfers have ventured in there...

154
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,050
..and come out alive.

155
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,632
Are you trying to tell me
people have died here?

156
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,430
-That's right, Sal.
-A moment of silence for them.

157
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,494
And we keep it moving because
if the Boneyards was not enough...

158
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,592
..our surfers will be facing off with
Tank "The Shredder" Evans.

159
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,722
Tank, nine-time defending champ.

160
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,009
A role model? No.

161
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,982
But I do consider myself somebody
that everyone should look up to.

162
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,755
Kids should try to pretend
that they're Tank.

163
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,414
I mean, they should try.
Good luck, kids.

164
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,898
You never want to get in there
and help them out...

165
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,664
..and show them how to surf
and spend some time with the kids?

166
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,748
No, I don't want to do that.

167
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,083
-Anyway, this is my wave.
-Always classy Tank Evans.

168
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,925
Coming up after the break,
penguin dodge ball. Stick around.

169
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,626
Okay, to get back to the competition,
I just want to say:

170
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,780
I'm scouring the globe
for the next big thing.

171
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,670
But that's another story.

172
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,805
He doesn't look for them.
I find them.

173
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,718
I find these penguins.
I find the talent.

174
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,648
Reggie has sent me everywhere
on this trip.

175
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,392
Anyplace there's an ocean...

176
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,348
..@ lake, a puddle.
It's ridiculous.

177
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,349
! amon so much migraine medication,
you have no idea.

178
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,639
The stress is killing me. I don't know
how much longer I can last.

179
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,945
I have to tell you that right now.

180
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,000
You gotta try
this blowhole thing, man.

181
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,426
This whale dude
is giving me a brain freeze.

182
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,664
I lost a bet.

183
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,293
Excuse me. Excuse me.

184
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,785
Does anybody
in this entire frozen wasteland surf?

185
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,691
-The Cody Maverick kid does that.
-Wonderful. Thank you.

186
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,948
You know, you're sitting on...
thin ice.

187
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,104
Excuse me, I'm looking for--
I'm looking for Cody Maverick.

188
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,847
-Has anyone seen Cody Maverick?
-I'm Cody Maverick.

189
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,509
Mike Abromowitz from the Big Z
Memorial Surf-Off, Pen Gu Island.

190
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,675
You came here on a wha--
You came to see me. Wow!

191
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,667
-Quite a slip-and-slider, aren't you?
-You're here. What an honor, sir.

192
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,418
Lovely. Wonderful. l hear you surf.

193
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,274
-ls this true?
-You gotta see what I can do.

194
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,133
-You can actually stand on a board?
-I'll be back.

195
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,440
You're gonna see what I can do
everything's gonna be good...

196
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,070
-...and I'm coming with you.
-l can't imagine a better day.

197
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,089
Ma! Ma, he came-- the scout.
Mikey. He came. He's here.

198
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,094
-What? Yeah.
-He's giving me a shot now, Ma.

199
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,960
You want to come watch me surf?

200
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,025
-No, that's okay.
-Just this time.

201
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,647
-I'm busy. I'm chopping here.
-Okay. All right, well, wish me luck.

202
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,299
Cody, just be careful
of those big waves.

203
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,415
Well, anytime now.

204
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,637
You should have been here yesterday.
We had a sweet swell yesterday.

205
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,922
l was doing some layback 360s
and floaters. It was insane.

206
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,617
Wow! Start the whale.

207
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,650
No! Wait! Wait!
Just give me one more chance.

208
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,512
-All l need is one, please.
-You just had it.

209
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,587
-Dude, please don't go.
-Tough break, kid.

210
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,069
-Just wait one second.
-Better luck next year. Move it.

211
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,105
-Let's go. He's coming!
-Just one wave. That's alll need.

212
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,132
I've never won anything
my whole life.

213
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,040
Just once I want to feel like a winner.

214
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:20,403
l used to scout songbirds. Toucans
for this musical revue in Brazil.

215
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,064
Now that's show business.
Toucans--

216
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,439
Hold on!

217
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,007
I don't care what you say,
I'm coming to Pen Gu!

218
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:32,764
No way, no how.
This is a contest for big-wave surfers.

219
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,709
Can't this blubber ball go any faster?
Step on it, fish sticks!

220
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,733
No, no, no, no!

221
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,651
Poor kid. I feel bad a little bit.
Honestly, this is embar--

222
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,491
No, wait! Wait!

223
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,091
Did you guys see that?
He almost had my board!

224
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,774
He almost had it.
Next time we'll get it.

225
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,927
-Yeah, so anyway--
-Wait!

226
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,513
We got you. We got you.
Oh, you are heavier than you look.

227
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:35,991
-Man, we did it.
-Thank you.

228
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,626
Teamwork always pays off.

229
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,504
-I'm Chicken Joe, man.
-Thanks, Joe.

230
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,846
Don't you ever, ever, do anything
like that in the contest, all right?

231
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,533
-I'm in?
-Yeah, you're in.

232
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,286
Because that was entertaining,
in a horrifying sort of way.

233
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,305
Right on, dude.

234
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,159
My name's Cody Maverick,
Shiverpool. You?

235
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,718
No, I'm not from Shiverpool.

236
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,497
-Where are you from?
-Dude, I'm from Lake Michigan.

237
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,858
That's where I surf.
! was the only one...

238
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,218
.. around my town who did it.

239
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,727
A lot of people thought
Il was crazy, but I'm used to that.

240
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,113
-l know how you feel, Joe.
-You do?

241
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,928
-Yeah.
-Radical.

242
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,614
-Butt freeze!
-Somebody help the chicken.

243
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,699
Look out!

244
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,932
Slater, Machado.
How's it going, bros?

245
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,418
-Good. Thanks.
-What's up, buddy?

246
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,259
Okay. Later, dudes.

247
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,749
Radical.

248
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:35,058
Dude, look where I'm standing.
I'm standing where Z stood.

249
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,640
-Aw, man.
-Dude, you gotta try this.

250
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,524
-No, I'm okay.
-Come on. Just one bite.

251
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,060
All right. One bite, that's it.

252
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,233
Yeah, yeah? What do you think?

253
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,605
It's not bad.
It kind of tastes like chicken--

254
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,988
Yep. What's chi-chi?

255
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,244
Coming through! Oh, crap.

256
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,098
Oh, man. I'm in love.

257
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,255
Help me! I'm drowning!

258
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,151
What are you standing here
next to me for? Go talk to her, man.

259
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,555
-I'm not gonna talk to her.
-She's digging on you.

260
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,937
-She called you crap.
-Joe.

261
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,945
-Thanks again.
-All right, well...

262
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,337
. this is the third time
you've been unconscious this week.

263
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,393
I just don't think
it's very good for your brain.

264
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,035
-l know. Bye, Lani.
-Okay.

265
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,645
Yeah, that was awesome
how you saved his life and all.

266
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,381
That was just unbelievable. Really.

267
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,917
You here for the surf contest?

268
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,690
-Well, I'll be watching you.
-Really? You'll be watching me?

269
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,800
Well, yeah,
from the lifeguard station.

270
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,193
-Yeah. Right.
-It's my job.

271
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,512
-That's your job.
-Are you gonna kiss her?

272
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,723
-What's going on?
-Come on, Joe.

273
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,136
-You were saying you were in love--
-No, I didn't say that.

274
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,072
-Look, he really digs you.
-Joe, listen--

275
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,351
He likes you, though. See you.

276
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,626
l love my job.
I have an amazing job.

277
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,254
Just this week, with the contest...

278
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,015
.it's a little crazy. You really
have to be extra, extra attentive.

279
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:12,415
When you have so many guys
in the water you can't miss a thing.

280
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:16,185
But you know what? I have a perfect
record. I've never lost anybody.

281
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,616
Sure, there have been
close calls, but--

282
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,318
-Help!
-Oh, Arnold. I turn my back for one--

283
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,857
-Just lay some feeling on her.
-How do you mean?

284
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,270
-Through words. Through touch.
-Walk me through the approach.

285
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,927
-I'm Lani. You're me.
-You sure about that?

286
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,073
-I get real serious.
-Let's not. Let's not.

287
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,928
-Whoa.
-What is it?

288
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,935
That's it! That's Big Z's shrine.

289
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,414
-Remember?
-No, no. Not really.

290
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,629
Today, the world of surfing
lost one of its legends.

291
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,576
Big Z took his final ride
this morning...

292
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,019
..during a competition with
up-and-coming surfer Tank Evans.

293
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:59,481
Z was last seen paddling into
a massive swell off Pen Gu Bay.

294
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:13,292
Friends of Big Z gathered
to remember and celebrate his life.

295
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,064
Great shot!

296
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,653
What? Hey!

297
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,922
-Every time.
-He's got a pretty good throwing fin.

298
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,335
Stop doing-- Stop it! Cut it out!

299
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,921
-That's like three in a row.
-Here, give it a shot.

300
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,330
What? Wait a minute. Look at this.

301
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:37,154
-Don't. Stop it.
-It's a Big Z necklace.

302
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,307
That's not funny. Stop.
Stop! What are you doing?

303
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,723
Look, everybody, it's Big Z's last fan!

304
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,829
Coming through.
Out of the way. Let's go.

305
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,974
-You don't deserve to talk about him.
-He's a big zero.

306
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,703
-Shut your mouth!
-Zero starts with "Z"!

307
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,551
You'll never be
as good as Big Z, Stank.

308
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:56,162
Hey, hey, people, come on now.
Smile on your brother.

309
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,579
-Keep your girlfriend out of this!
-You can't do that to my friend.

310
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,420
You're getting quite a workout there.
That feels good.

311
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,014
Why don't you work on my glutes
a little bit? That's very nice.

312
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:13,656
-All right. That's enough, guys.
-I'll take you on anytime, anywhere.

313
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,450
Well, then how about
right here, right now, huh?

314
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,107
Hey, Mikey, get this kid a board!

315
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,928
All right, who wants to see
the little guy take on the champ?

316
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,033
Little guys rule!

317
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:32,408
A little one-on-one surfing action
between Tank Evans and Jerry--

318
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,956
-Cody. Cody.
-Cody Maverick.

319
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,608
Cody Mavencourt. And the one
that rides the biggest wave wins.

320
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,808
Are you nervous
about going against Tank Evans?

321
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,501
Ah, Tank. Nervous?
What do I have to be nervous about?

322
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,419
Give it up! Come on, now!

323
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,360
I'm gonna chum the water
with your head.

324
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,622
-Bring it on, pecker face. Let's go.
-Pecker face?

325
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,464
It's mine!

326
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,405
So, Cody, when you take
your first wave...

327
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,977
..and the whole island's there
to watch, what'll it be like?

328
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,933
It's gonna be amazing.
It'll be the best wave of my life.

329
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,555
I hope the cameras are rolling
because you'll want to watch it...

330
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,115
..over and over and over again.
It's gonna be awesome!

331
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,831
I can't look.

332
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,663
-Poor kid. He's-- Poor kid.
-Wow! That was spectacular!

333
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,559
I'm number one! The Tank!

334
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,353
We're trying to get the details.
The lifeguard just pulled him in.

335
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,327
That's what happens
when you take on the Tank, right?

336
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,609
Cody, Cody!

337
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,266
-How is he? Okay? What can I do?
-Yeah, he's okay.

338
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:15,153
I can help. Except if there's blood.
Just the thought of blood makes me....

339
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,349
Somebody help the chicken.

340
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,961
-Tank, you okay?
-Tank needs fuel.

341
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,704
Mikey, get the board, will you?

342
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,346
Come on. Come on. Come on.

343
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,460
-Did I win? I won, huh?
-You should've stayed in Antarctica.

344
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,899
-Oh, wow.
-You're gonna be okay.

345
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:43,015
Look at that.
There's pixies everywhere.

346
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:48,067
What do you think about Cody going
into a contest and possibly winning?

347
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,567
-You know, I'm--
-Ha.

348
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,178
-Why did you just laugh?
-Because he keeps saying "possible."

349
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:57,706
Like it's "possible" that you're gonna
win. And you're gonna do anything.

350
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,370
-Really, what are the chances?
-They're high. Aren't they high?

351
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,650
I mean, they're normal chances.
It's not like I'm, like, the underdog.

352
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,922
Hey, Geek! Geek!
Get up and help me.

353
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,090
Geek.

354
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,406
Geek?

355
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:31,163
Geek. Wake up! I need your help.

356
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,197
Come on. Get off your lazy butt
and come and help me.

357
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,107
--beautiful dream.

358
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:39,382
-Did you ever know Sheila?
-No. I don't know Sheila.

359
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,682
-Wait, wait, wait. What?
-What?

360
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:42,956
Who's this guy?

361
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,655
-He's a surfer. He's hurt.
-Who are all those guys?

362
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,027
They're with him. Ignore them.

363
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,980
-Come on.
-Lani, what are you doing?

364
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,262
If you help him, they'll go away.

365
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,918
-Hey! Get out of here!
-Help him!

366
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,405
-Where do you want him?
-Nowhere. That's the whole point.

367
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,564
-No outsiders. Come on.
-I know, I know, I know.

368
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,917
This is an emergency. He went down
bad over the falls. 1 don't know if he--

369
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,388
-And did he hit the reef?
-I don't know.

370
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,094
I'm not sure. I got him after--

371
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,032
-What, is he your boyfriend?
-No. No.

372
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,551
Wait, wait, wait.
Looks like he stepped on a fire urchin.

373
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,895
Stepped on me? Are you kidding?
This guy was dancing on me.

374
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:28,003
Just look at this. Broken, broken,
gone, gone, broken, broken, broken....

375
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,884
This is pretty bad.
This is really bad.

376
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,120
-What-- Cody!
-I hurt.

377
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,498
-You're gonna be okay. What?
-Maybe I shouldn't have taken that out.

378
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,749
Poison's released. Wow. Amazing.

379
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,287
-What's amazing?
-That you're still alive.

380
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,440
It's all right. I'm gonna fix you up.
I can fix your foot just fine.

381
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:52,438
-Where is it? I've been looking--
-It's a saw. You just threw a saw.

382
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:57,248
Don't let him move like that. He's
pushing the poison all over his body.

383
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,957
-Come on, come on.
-l know he looks--

384
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,156
Here it is.

385
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,152
-What are you doing?
-What is he doing?

386
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,711
This is a sure-fire cure.

387
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,519
I learned it from an old medicine
man. It, well, works wonders.

388
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,020
-What? No! Not that!
-Not what?

389
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,409
What is he gonna-- Gonna what?

390
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,605
-Come on, now.
-Geek, stop.

391
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,970
Let's do this. Lani, can you make
some water sounds?

392
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,573
-Oh, my gosh, this is so gross.
-What is water sounds?

393
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,303
-Come on. Here we go.
-No, no, no. You--

394
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,420
Kid, you better keep your mouth shut.
See, what'd I tell you?

395
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,657
Hold his foot still, Lani. Come on.
Knock him out or something.

396
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,103
-I'm running on empty here.
-I'm trying!

397
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,767
So how you been?

398
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,318
Wow, sea urchin in the foot.
That sounds pretty nasty.

399
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:52,654
Yeah.

400
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,441
How do you cure something like that?

401
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,058
You pee on it.

402
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,193
-That's disgusting.
-l know!

403
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,649
Hey. How long am I stuck
with this guy?

404
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,869
-Because you know--
-Till he's better.

405
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:10,305
Well, come back soon and,
please, bring me some clams.

406
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,376
-No.
-I'm running low here.

407
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,078
I can't keep doing this. You've got
to start taking care of yourself.

408
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,034
-Oh, come on.
-Bye.

409
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,659
-Bring me some more clams!
-Okay.

410
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,460
If it's just as well with you,
I don't want to talk about Cody.

411
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,800
He lost. That's it.
That's his problem. It's not mine.

412
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,869
Aren't you concerned
about anybody's well-being--?

413
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,694
The kid's fine. He was born in water.
He's a penguin, for crying out loud!

414
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,631
-Did you see that wave hit him?
-That's the whole idea of surfing.

415
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,887
-l care. I care!
-Mikey! Wait till you see this.

416
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,018
Look at those little legs.
Stick, stick, stick, sticky.

417
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,613
It's the way I walk. I'm constantly--

418
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,688
-Boom-chicka-chicka--
-What's with the "boom-chicka-boom"?

419
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:01,023
I can't stand blood.
I can't stand the sight of blood.

420
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,023
I can't stand...
sight of blood. Cody!

421
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:10,672
-Dude, have you seen my friend Cody?
-No.

422
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,253
Cody? Cody?

423
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,216
He's not under there.

424
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,331
Cody!

425
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,679
How's it going, man?

426
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,670
So l woke up this morning.

427
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:33,885
I didn't know where I was. It's never
a good place to be when you wake up.

428
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,516
Come on. Get up.

429
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,445
- don't want to.
-Breakfast.

430
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,844
-Wakey, wakey. Come on.
- don't want to.

431
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,725
-How's your foot?
-My foot--

432
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,663
-My foot's fine, but my head.
-Good. Good. Come on, kid. Get up.

433
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,422
What the--?

434
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,908
Yeah, I think I got a concussion.

435
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,550
You should meet my brother, Glen.
You guys would really hit it off.

436
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:06,944
Oh, no. No. Where's my necklace?
Did you see my necklace? It's gotta--

437
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,620
No, no.

438
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,705
Big deal. Get yourself another one
at Reggie's trinket shops.

439
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,101
It's not just some necklace, guy.
He gave it to me himself.

440
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:19,532
-Who?
-Big Z. When he came to Shiverpool.

441
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,238
That guy believed in me
when no one else did.

442
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,431
He told me never to give up
and to find a way...

443
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,006
-...because that's what winners do.
-What winners do. Yeah.

444
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,722
It's funny, you know,
what a loser I became.

445
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,989
Who cares what Big Z said?
You got to...

446
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,746
-... you know, do things your own way.
-l don't have a way.

447
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:47,137
You do now. Just follow this.
It'll take you back to North Beach.

448
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,847
Okay, nice to meet you.
Good luck.

449
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,032
What do I do now?

450
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,409
I can't show my face on the beach.
I can't go home.

451
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,789
You always visualize where you're
gonna be, what you're gonna do.

452
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,567
This ain't it.

453
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:47,964
-What are you doing here?
-Here.

454
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,917
-Oh, man. Thank you, man. This--
-Yeah.

455
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,957
That's cool of you to come back.

456
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,106
-Thank you.
-Better keep that knot tight.

457
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,428
You lose it during a contest,
it's a goner.

458
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:02,024
Yeah, well, I'm not going
in any surf contests.

459
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:07,898
Well, there's more to surfing
than beating Tank Evans, you know.

460
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,115
Yeah.

461
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,026
Look at that.
You know what you're sitting on there?

462
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,629
That's koa wood.

463
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,885
Best surfboards in the world
are made of that stuff.

464
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,978
-Yeah?
-You got a koa board?

465
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:27,591
-No, I don't have a "board" board.
-Well, you wanna...?

466
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,367
You want to make one?

467
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,036
-Nah.
-What?

468
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,418
I come all the way back here
to give you the necklace...

469
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,937
..and I'm offering to make you
a board and you say, "Nah."

470
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,938
Get off your lazy butt.
We're making a board. Come on.

471
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,081
-All right.
-It's gonna be the best board...

472
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,376
..you ever had.

473
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,046
-All right?
-Okay, man.

474
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,342
Cody!

475
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,143
That's cool.

476
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,137
Joe, can you just tell us
why you're out here looking for Cody?

477
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,734
You know, we've known
each other way back...

478
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,470
.. since, like, yesterday, I think it was.
We got a lot in common.

479
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,138
! never really knew my father either.

480
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,333
Why are you making surfboards
in the middle of the jungle anyway?

481
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,063
I'm just trying to understand.
I don't get it.

482
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,641
Forget the 20 questions.
Let's just get the board made.

483
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,700
Okay, it's just--
Are you a surfer, or do you--?

484
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,547
-Very funny.
-Less talk, more pushing. Come on.

485
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,603
Why are we pushing it?
Why don't we just roll it?

486
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,717
I'm sorry. I didn't mean--

487
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,308
I didn't know your foot was there.
Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

488
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,592
It's not like I intentionally did it.
I'm sorry.

489
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,964
-Cody. The log!
-Yeah, I know!

490
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,155
Geek! Stop, stop!

491
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,225
Cody, grab the vine. Grab the vine!

492
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,277
-Now, pull it.
-I'm trying!

493
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,300
Pull!

494
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,360
Cody!

495
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:11,966
Geek!

496
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:13,940
Cody!

497
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,055
Oh, no, no, no.

498
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,277
Help me up so I can kick your butt.

499
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,818
-l thought I killed you. You okay?
-Next time, when I say don't roll the--

500
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,389
Wait. What's that?

501
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,837
Yeah, it's a beach.
Sand, water, sun.

502
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,838
You seen one, you seen them all.
Let's get out of here.

503
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,321
No, come on, man.
Let's go check it out.

504
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,649
You think Cody and the Geek
are doing all right?

505
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,474
Yeah. I hate to see him
living out there all alone.

506
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,617
It'll be good for him
to have something to do.

507
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:16,075
Hey. Somebody's old board shack.

508
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,149
Look at this.

509
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

510
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,937
These are Big Z's boards.

511
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:38,039
Yeah, these are Big Z's boards.
He rode this in the Australian Open.

512
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,561
This is the board he rode
when he came to Shiverpool, man.

513
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,518
This-- I-- Geek!

514
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,303
This is Big Z's place, man!
This is where he lived!

515
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,283
This is where he made his boards!

516
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:51,862
Did you know this was here?

517
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,094
Why didn't you wanna
come down here?

518
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:58,065
And then he went up to this
old shack, you know.

519
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:15,554
And I realized, you know...

520
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:18,658
it was Z.

521
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:45,217
I could tell he needed some space
and some time to himself.

522
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,591
I didn't want to ask him
all these questions.

523
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,415
So I just kind of stood there quietly.

524
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,092
You're Big Z! I can't believe it.

525
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,108
You're alive! You're alive!

526
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,072
That's the respectful way to go,
I think.

527
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,736
Why are you alive?
What happened?

528
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,053
Tell me everything.
Start at the beginning and just go.

529
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,940
Kid! You're gonna
hurt yourself. Relax.

530
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,746
And people said you were dead,
but you're not dead. You're in hiding.

531
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,970
Did something happen?
Something happened.

532
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,362
You saw something
you weren't supposed to see.

533
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:13,891
I knew it!
That's what happened!

534
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,702
Are you nuts?
It's not a conspiracy. It's no big deal.

535
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,405
-What happened?
-l don't want to talk about it.

536
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:24,898
You don't-- Okay, I got it!

537
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:29,326
I'll be over here if you need anything
or you just feel like talking.

538
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,345
Do you feel it now? Like talking now?

539
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,197
-Go away.
-Got it. All right. I'm going away.

540
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,779
Unless you--

541
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,425
-Cody!
-Okay, got it.

542
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,670
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is, like, it's huge, man.

543
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,200
It changes everything.
The contest is a few days away.

544
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:50,257
If l can get him to train me, then--
Boom. I could win this with him.

545
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,389
It's my dream. And I don't want to
give up on that dream.

546
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,566
Winners find a way,
no matter what, right?

547
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,728
A winner is....

548
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,202
They see their goals.
They just go for it.

549
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,471
They're not in it
for the money or glory.

550
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,830
-A winner is...like....
-Hey, hey!

551
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,998
It's the surfer who's out there
having the most fun.

552
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,610
Yep, it's a lot of fun.

553
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,995
Right, I get you. What's winning
without the losers?

554
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,648
They're in it for the joy of it
and the rapture...

555
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,864
..and the slow-motion
instant replay, which is my--

556
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,772
Head over to the snack bar
and get yourself a big bowl of shut up!

557
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,716
Feels better when there's a lot
of losers around.

558
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,532
Was that your question?

559
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,701
A winner is somebody who doesn't
knock me off my surfboard...

560
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,082
..and break it when I'm trying
to get some big waves.

561
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,058
Especially Tank.
He is definitely not a winner.

562
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,058
He's a dirty trashcan full of poop.

563
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,255
Yeah, I can't remember a time
when I wasn't surfing.

564
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,344
My mom put me right on there.
I think she pooped me out...

565
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:53,984
.. Just put me right on there.

566
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,801
What is it about surfing
that you love?

567
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,181
I love being the center of attention...

568
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,016
. . because it's really
where I should be.

569
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,600
And I love the looks
my ladies give me, you know?

570
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,834
The little glint. I love that.
I love holding the ladies.

571
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,205
-You know what I'm talking about?
-I think so.

572
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,808
-Sort of.
-Come with me.

573
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,940
Put this curtain in myself.

574
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,921
These are my ladies.

575
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,651
This is Jill.
This is my lady, Amy.

576
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,164
Little Suzie. Briana.

577
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,196
-You know why we call her Briana?
-No.

578
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,979
It's a long story.

579
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,781
Shaniqua. Helga. Miss Kitty.

580
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,190
Jeannie. I dream of....

581
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,050
Theresa.
This is Theresa right here.

582
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:49,094
-Now, is Theresa, is that your--
-Dirty girl.

583
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:54,411
This spot?
This spot is for my special lady, Lia.

584
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,560
I'm gonna say that one more time.
Lia. Oh, yeah.

585
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,119
That's a sweet, sweet lady.

586
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,854
Tank! Are you polishing
your trophies again?

587
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,461
Mom, I wasn't polishing.
l was talking to my friends.

588
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,140
I'm gonna be polishing later.

589
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,700
When's he coming out?
I'm running out of film.

590
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,173
Mr. Topanga! Could you
tell us why you're not dead?

591
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,566
No! lam dead! I'm dead.

592
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,152
What are you doing?

593
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,555
Hey, who said you--

594
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,287
Turn the board around.
Get back here.

595
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,593
Come out here
and show me some moves.

596
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,222
-No, no.
-Come on!

597
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:45,774
-Grab a board and come out.
-You want to kill yourself, go ahead.

598
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,411
Fine with me.
Just don't mess up my board.

599
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,170
-How do you turn this thing?
-It's not a short board. Sit back on it.

600
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,107
Hey, watch the wave!

601
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,534
You mess up my board,
I'm messing up your other foot.

602
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,823
I'm just trying to ride
this canoe or whatever it is, okay?

603
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,609
Stop trying so hard! Just relax.

604
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,308
What do you mean, rela--?

605
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:15,044
Long, smooth strokes.

606
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,163
-Dig deep. Dig, come on.
-I'm digging!

607
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,790
Keep the nose up! Keep it up!
Watch it! You're pearling!

608
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,375
-What are you doing?
-Come on, please?

609
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,106
Z, l can't learn anything
with you on the beach.

610
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,092
Well, then you're not gonna
learn anything.

611
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,389
-Now, come on in.
-I'm not coming in until you come out.

612
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,285
Oh, you're coming in, all right.
He's not even watching the wave.

613
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,949
-What wave?
-That one.

614
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,165
Five, four, three, two, and....

615
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,397
-Don't touch my stuff, man.
-l couldn't help it.

616
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,565
-I just wanted to learn from the best.
-Yeah, well.

617
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,522
-l don't surf anymore, okay?
-What?

618
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,442
What do you mean, you don't surf?

619
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,863
You want to learn
how to surf the right way?

620
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:19,576
Sure.

621
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,408
Then you gotta make
your own board, all right?

622
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,250
-What do you mean, you don't sur--
-Can't hear you.

623
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,368
-Can I ask one question--
-We're making a board.

624
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,950
Could you tell me
about your board?

625
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,619
I just have a palm tree board.

626
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,990
I would have to say it's not
the nicest board in the world...

627
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:40,203
..but it is a pretty good board.

628
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,065
The ancient Hawaiians believe
that "mana" or heart...

629
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,034
..Was transferred into the surfboard
as you shaped it.

630
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,413
What are your thoughts on that?

631
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:51,746
What's up with the hair?
You could fit a whole fish in there.

632
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,537
My dream surfboard.
It's pretty powerful.

633
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,948
You can add a lot of attachments to it,
like a grenade launcher attachment.

634
00:40:58,523 --> 00:40:59,663
Anybody know whose board this is?

635
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,511
-I'm pretty sure it's the chicken's.
-Has anybody seen the chicken?

636
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,837
Cody!

637
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,676
I know he's out here.
Il can feel it in my nuggets.

638
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,320
Aren't you nervous out here
in the jungle? It's kind of dangerous.

639
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:16,064
Dude, the jungle is the most
peaceful place on the planet.

640
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,190
-Hold it steady.
-This is a dream come true.

641
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,500
This is a dream come true,
to be here with Z, doing this.

642
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,803
-And it's koa wood.
-Where's the--

643
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,952
All the best boards
are made from koa wood.

644
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:37,825
All right, now,
I drew this pattern as a guide.

645
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:42,723
Do you want to have your board
with a lot of rocker or just a little?

646
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,205
I don't know.

647
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,196
What you want is something
in-between. Trust me.

648
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,140
-I'm the expert here.
-Okay.

649
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,052
So...

650
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,447
.. here are your shaping tools.

651
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:59,366
Now, remember, the board's
already inside there, see, somewhere.

652
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:03,048
And what you're doing
is you're trying to find it.

653
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,961
-Reveal it. All right?
-Okay.

654
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,744
Every carve counts.
Why are you smiling? Don't smile.

655
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:13,838
-I'm not smiling. I'm excited.
-This isn't like hacking a piece of ice.

656
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,609
It takes patience and finesse.

657
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,938
All right already. Can you just
give me the tools, please?

658
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:22,755
-Here, take it. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

659
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,638
-Here we go.
-What are you doing?

660
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:30,156
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

661
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,361
All right, look.
First of all, with the grain.

662
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:36,645
With the grain.
You see what I'm doing here?

663
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:40,565
You let the tool do the work.
You see?

664
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,682
Just like you're riding a wave.
You let the wave do the work.

665
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:47,885
You don't fight the wave.
You can't fight these big waves.

666
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,316
Long strokes. Loads of finesse.

667
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:56,555
Find the board within the tree.

668
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,828
-Nice and easy.
-Yeah, I got it.

669
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:02,278
See that? You just...

670
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,797
-You just...
-Maybe I could do it now.

671
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,616
Move with...

672
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:10,069
-With the...
-Can I do it now?

673
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,560
Can I do it now?

674
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:19,898
Yeah. I got carried away.
Sorry about that.

675
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,278
-It's your board.
-My board.

676
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:24,808
Okay, with the grain. I got it.

677
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,129
Don't forget to eyeball it
once in a while.

678
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:30,792
-Long strokes, with the grain.
-Not too long.

679
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,989
Here we go.

680
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:39,291
-You're doing it wrong.
-Will you just let me--

681
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,590
I can't-- No finesse
when you're in my face. Okay?

682
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:44,854
Just let me make the board.

683
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,656
-Do you want my help?
-No, I don't want your help.

684
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,329
I don't want your help.

685
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,390
-You don't want my help?
-[ don't want your help.

686
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,486
-All right. Fine.
-l want to make my board.

687
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:58,162
-Build the board yourself, all right?
-Thank you.

688
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,669
I don't care what the board
looks like. You're the one...

689
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,850
-...who's got to ride the thing.
-Fine. Thank you.

690
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:10,064
-It's in there somewhere.
-Walk over there, please! Please.

691
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,037
Don't cut yourself.

692
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:15,989
So it's day three, yeah?

693
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:20,252
I come across Pen Guans.

694
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,811
I'm Chicken Joe. Joseph.
It's long for Joe.

695
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:25,815
Sweet, man.

696
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,880
And they treat me as their king
and put me in a hot tub.

697
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,278
It is, 1 guess, their royal hot tub.

698
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,013
It got kind of hot and steamy.

699
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,709
But really opened up
my pores, you know?

700
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:57,366
It was kind of cool.

701
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,065
They served me food
while I was in there.

702
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:02,938
It was like dinner and a show.

703
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:16,997
As enjoyable as it was,
I still had a vision of my quest.

704
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:22,953
Thank you. See you guys later.
I gotta get going.

705
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:26,596
Not again.

706
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,770
You know what else it was?
Il had the board.

707
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,685
The board was fine.
The board was great.

708
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,924
-How's it going?
-It's going great, man. It's great.

709
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,080
It did look a little rough.

710
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,428
A little rough? The board looked
a little-- It's a work in progress, bro.

711
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:46,679
You think it's good enough
for the big waves?

712
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:50,067
I think it's good enough
for any wave.

713
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,259
Hang on.

714
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,238
-Okay, let's say I'm a big wave.
-Hold on. No, no, no, no.

715
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,566
-Hey, where you--
-Hold on!

716
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,328
-Where are you going?
-It's my board, man, all right?

717
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,438
Why don't you take your board
and go try it out?

718
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,124
Maybe I will. Piece of junk. Watch!

719
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,644
Nice ride, man.
Nice ride.

720
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,012
This is supposed to be fun.

721
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:23,691
I got three days until the contest.
I don't have time for fun.

722
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,862
No time for fun, huh?

723
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,608
-Hey, Cody!
-What?

724
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,413
Bring me some clams
when you come back!

725
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,292
I'm not coming back!

726
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,962
-He'll be back.
-No, I won't!

727
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:38,828
He'll be back.

728
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,333
-You guys like barbecue?
-Yeah, sure.

729
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:43,136
Got some wood here.

730
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,188
Il wasted my whole day and I have
nothing to show for it, which is--

731
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,046
-l was just going to check on you...
-That's why you were--

732
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:57,854
..and the Geek.

733
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:01,082
-Listen. The Geek is Big Z.
-What?

734
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,732
-l know.
-You know?

735
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:04,754
-How did you find out?
-We went to the beach.

736
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,236
-You got him to the beach?
-Yeah.

737
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,866
I've been trying to get Z
out of that tree for 10 years...

738
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,440
..and you got him all the way
down to the beach in one day?

739
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:13,236
This is fantastic!

740
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:20,213
It's amazing!
Do you want to go somewhere fun?

741
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:25,288
Do you want to go somewhere
really, really fun?

742
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,353
Unless you want--
Did you want to get back to Big Z?

743
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,926
-I'm sorry. l shouldn't have invited you.
-No, no, no.

744
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,962
-What? Okay. No?
-No, look. 1 want to have fun.

745
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,475
-Okay.
-Do I need mints or something?

746
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,531
-You tell me.
-No, you won't need mints.

747
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,964
Z used to carry us up here on his
shoulders. We'd have so much fun.

748
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,904
-It's one of my favorite spots.
-Really?

749
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,981
-Boy, to be 8 years old again.
-What is this?

750
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,251
You don't want to
get all cut up, do you?

751
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,840
Hold on. What are you doing?

752
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,160
No, no, no. I'm out of here.
I'm better off--

753
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:09,702
It's going down! No, no, no!

754
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,828
-This is insane!
-Stop fighting it, Cody! Just let go!

755
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:21,861
All right!

756
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:28,844
Now I'm in front of you.
What's going on now?

757
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,650
It's not a race!

758
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,167
Okay, wait, don't take the left--
Cody!

759
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:50,731
-Give up, slowpoke! It's over with now!
-Not for long!

760
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,491
Give up now, sucker!

761
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,865
-l beat you!
-Congratulations, you sure did.

762
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,808
You should probably
get out of there.

763
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,163
Why is that? This stuff is--
Look at me. It's so beautiful.

764
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,009
Look at it. What is this stuff?

765
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:09,868
See those things up above you?
They're glowworms.

766
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:14,301
So you're right beneath them.
Yeah, that's poop.

767
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:28,172
You know how some stinks stink
and other stinks smell good?

768
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,788
-Yeah.
-This is, like, a good stink.

769
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:32,105
A good stink?

770
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,423
Can I tell you something personal?

771
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,794
We're in the shower together.
You can say whatever you want.

772
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:41,141
I'm serious. I'm really, really
jealous of you.

773
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:42,836
Why?

774
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,547
I couldn't get Z off his butt
for the last 10 years...

775
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,404
..and then you come along and....

776
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:52,317
He must really think a lot of you.

777
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,953
I don't know. I've been a jerk to him.
I don't know what he thinks.

778
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,400
-You haven't.
-I have. I've been a jerk.

779
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,990
-l have.
-Then go not be a jerk.

780
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:05,618
What does it matter to you anyways?

781
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,373
He's my uncle.
He's the only family I've got.

782
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,178
Okay.

783
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,299
Z? No.

784
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:27,931
No, no, no, don't you do it.
Z, don't do it. No.

785
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,259
-No.
-Let's see here.

786
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,294
-l swear...
-It's stronger than I thought.

787
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,620
-...if you break it--
-Should've been broken by now.

788
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,533
Come on! Come on!

789
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,093
Look at that.

790
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:49,093
That's the best place
in the world to be, in the tube.

791
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:50,607
Really?

792
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:54,778
Yeah. Better than winning,
the trophy, all that stuff.

793
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:59,106
Tube riding
is the ultimate thing in surfing...

794
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:01,613
...to ride inside the wave
and make it out of it

795
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,452
It's all we want to do every day.

796
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:06,401
It's almost impossible to describe.

797
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:08,624
There's nothing ! can compare it to.

798
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:12,946
It's a feeling that not too many people
will experience...

799
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:15,458
...80 it's special in that sense.

800
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,033
Then you try to remember it.

801
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:19,948
Like, "I wish I could remember that,"
or "l wish I could get that again.”

802
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:21,931
It's so addicting.

803
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,875
Once you get inside
you never want to get out.

804
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:31,343
-Wow. That's amazing.
-Yeah, man. Nothing like it.

805
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:37,011
So, that aside, how many points
would you get for getting tubed?

806
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,908
Like, what does it depend on
for the contest?

807
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,317
-Points?
-What?

808
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:44,983
You know who you
sound like right now?

809
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,012
I promote happiness!

810
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:50,588
Can you see the happiness emanating
from me? What's wrong with you?

811
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,811
-We're live.
-Good. Good.

812
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:56,983
I have to say, I have no doubt
that this year's Big Z Memorial...

813
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:58,845
.. 18 gonna be the best ever.

814
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,601
With the competition
just one day away...

815
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,029
...the excitement is definitely building
here on Pen Gu Island.

816
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,898
That didn't take too long.
I feel lightheaded.

817
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:32,555
So get this.

818
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,613
On my search for Cody,
l bump into my hot tub buddies again.

819
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,379
I get it. You guys look hungry.

820
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:43,658
You've probably got
the munchies or something.

821
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:48,113
Squidito on el stickito?

822
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:01,602
Check it out! Dude,
have you seen my friend Cody?

823
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,639
He's kind of like a penguin.

824
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:07,861
He's got a lot of black on him,
a lot of white.

825
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:11,482
-How did you learn how to surf?
-l saw Big Z do it, actually.

826
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,752
! don't think you were born yet.

827
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:16,261
-l wasn't?
-No, I don't think so.

828
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,010
Lani? I like her when
she teaches us because--

829
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,279
Smudge! Not another one!

830
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,879
I think he really has to go
to the bathroom right now.

831
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,350
What's next? The board is done.

832
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,402
-The board is done?
-The board is done.

833
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:34,231
-Well, let's do some training.
-Finally!

834
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,758
-Can we get a shot of you--
-You've got to get it in a long shot.

835
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,366
Hey, Z! Come on!

836
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,544
-Where you going?
-l thought we were going to train.

837
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,987
Not in the water. Jeez.
What are you thinking?

838
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:51,569
-You want to surf like Big Z used to?
-Yeah.

839
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,491
I've got some tests here
to figure out your potential.

840
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:57,212
-Let's do it.
-No, put them on your eyes.

841
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,884
-Like this.
-On my eyes.

842
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,560
-Take it, Cody.
-Can we do some training, seriously?

843
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:07,973
What are you talking about?
What do you think we're doing?

844
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,185
Acting like nutjobs.
That's what I think we're doing.

845
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,717
Yeah, good. You're learning!

846
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:14,957
And a big set comes in.

847
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:19,071
Wipeout!

848
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,286
-That's it!
-Take it easy!

849
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,385
This is getting ridiculous.

850
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,014
-You having fun?
-l hate you.

851
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,550
Big, you know, slow:

852
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,346
He does this flip over the top.
All right, now you go.

853
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,382
No joy, man. No joy. Fail.

854
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:42,802
I'm starting to see it, man. I think
I know what you're talking about.

855
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:46,998
That's great. As long as
we're all having fun, right?

856
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:51,334
Z, wake up. Wake up, Z. Z!

857
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,187
Hey, Z, breakfast!

858
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:05,627
Not a chance.

859
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,288
-Four, three, two...
-You gotta get up early in the morning--

860
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,260
.one.

861
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:21,214
That is fun.

862
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,091
-You're having fun?
-lam. Yes. Now lam.

863
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:26,065
Then, Cody...

864
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,843
-... you passed!
-What?

865
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,408
You did it! You're ready! Let's surf!

866
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:34,868
Don't play me, Z. We're surfing?
Yes! Yes!

867
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,393
Hey, check it--

868
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:56,147
I didn't know you could surf!

869
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:03,732
Relax!

870
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:07,304
Long, slow, smooth.

871
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,535
-Like making the board!
-There you go.

872
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,507
-All right. Okay.
-Feels good, yeah?

873
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:28,354
-You're in the water, Z!
-Come on out. Get wet! Come on!

874
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:36,667
Lani, thank you.

875
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,576
Look at that!

876
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:01,127
-Nice! That's it! Nice.
-Great ride!

877
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,517
Big Z is back!

878
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,220
This is what it's all about.

879
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,540
What could be better than this?

880
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,996
1 need some help
on this landing for the high note

881
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:22,283
Nice. Nice.

882
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:24,833
-ls that the only song that you know?
-Pretty much.

883
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,432
You want to hear it again?
It goes like this.

884
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,304
No? Okay. I got you there, didn't I?

885
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:34,020
l must say you were
quite amazing out there today.

886
00:59:34,638 --> 00:59:37,067
-You weren't so bad yourself, kiddo.
-Thanks to this guy.

887
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,251
-I just pointed you in a direction.
-Question, Z.

888
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,760
-Change your mind about the song?
-No, no, no.

889
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:47,473
Here, it goes something like this--

890
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:50,218
l was wondering if you could come
watch me ride tomorrow.

891
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:54,265
Yeah, yeah. We'll both ride, man.

892
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:58,824
-No, not just-- In the contest.
-Contest? What contest?

893
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:01,493
The Big Z Memorial.
Remember that one?

894
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,361
I know I'm asking a lot...

895
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,843
..but it would really, really be...

896
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:09,053
.. the biggest thing in the world
to me if you could come.

897
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:13,997
-You still want to be a part of that?
-Absolutely.

898
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:18,831
-Why do you want me there anyway?
-l thought you'd want to be there.

899
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:22,159
-l don't know why it's a big deal.
-It's no big deal.

900
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,399
Why won't you come?

901
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:25,965
-I'm not coming.
-Why?

902
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,869
-Give it a rest.
-It's getting cold, guys.

903
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:29,627
-Tell me why you're hiding.
-Hiding?

904
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:32,073
-Why are you hiding?
-I'll have to eat all this by myself.

905
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:34,399
Why didn't you come back
after you fell off the wave?

906
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:37,602
That wave.

907
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:44,213
That last day, winning had
become everything to me.

908
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:46,605
1 knew I was gonna beat Tank.

909
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:53,531
But then, you know,
he starts to surf circles around me.

910
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:57,141
! saw what he was doing.
! couldn't do what he was doing.

911
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,341
Times had changed.

912
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:04,214
! didn't want to walk back
on that beach with all my fans there.

913
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:08,648
A loser. Everyone looking
at Big Z, the loser, the has-been.

914
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,226
So...

915
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,226
Big Z's dead,
and that's how it's gonna stay.

916
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:25,113
Let me play you that song.

917
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:29,193
What about "never give up"?
What about "find a way"?

918
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:34,226
-You're giving up. You're giving up!
-Yeah, I'm giving up. That's my way.

919
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:38,162
-Giving up.
-l thought you were the one guy.

920
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:41,338
You don't like it, find your own way.

921
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:44,806
Leave me out of it.

922
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,202
Leave me out of it.

923
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:17,155
I messed up.
I'm just--

924
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,417
I'm...not good.

925
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,470
This is when I needed someone.
I needed him.

926
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,390
It's hard enough
losing one dad, but....

927
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,951
-What do you mean by--?
-Nothing.

928
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:32,467
Nothing, man. Forget it.

929
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,350
Peaceful. Peaceful.
I'm in peace. I come in peace.

930
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:50,853
-Cody!
-Joe!

931
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:54,301
-I've been looking everywhere for you!
-You've been looking for me?

932
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:57,361
I didn't lose you on the whale.
I'm not gonna lose you now.

933
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,894
-Thank you. Seriously, thank you.
-Radical.

934
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,716
They're starting!
Cody, we gotta go! Come on!

935
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:07,506
Wait a minute. Joe?

936
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:08,811
Surfers riding....

937
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,779
I'm sorry. Watch this, dude.
Il can speak their language.

938
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:18,869
I totally need my board. I don't
know where it is. gotta go find it.

939
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:21,359
-I'll see you in the lineup.
-See you, Joe.

940
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,017
-This is gonna be fun, huh?
-See you.

941
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,185
The tenth annual Big Z
is about to get underway...

942
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,266
..and, whoa, it is the day of days.

943
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:35,586
Big mountainous bombs
marching into our coastline.

944
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:39,469
Kelly Slater, on a danger level,
one to ten, give me a number.

945
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:40,953
Twenty.

946
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,031
-Wow. Rob?
-There'll be blood.

947
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,153
I'm scared, and I'm in the booth!

948
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,256
-What are you doing here?
-Mike.

949
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:50,682
You're gonna kill yourself.
Don't do this to yourself.

950
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:52,297
Look what happened last time.

951
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,153
-It's good to see you back.
-Are you serious?

952
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:56,938
You're gonna be
a real crowd pleaser.

953
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,350
I'm telling you,
these people are gonna eat you up.

954
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:02,873
-I'll be expecting big things from you.
-Thank you.

955
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:05,433
People, big announcement.
Cody Maverick, he's back.

956
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,045
The Wipeout King is back...

957
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,217
..and I'm gonna tell you,
start looking for the sharks.

958
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,456
They'll be circling because
there's gonna be blood.

959
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,141
Spectacular carnage today.

960
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:16,943
Thank you! Reggie Belafonte. Little
guy, big hair, big thoughts, big heart.

961
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:29,776
Look at this.
You're going down, snowflake.

962
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:34,274
I'm gonna make you wish
you were never even hatched.

963
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:38,024
You want to see my trophies?

964
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:49,561
Arnold, no.

965
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:58,422
About 24 surfers
battling their way out to the--

966
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,289
Good golly! Make that 18.

967
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,012
Rob, after such a heavy wipeout
earlier in the week...

968
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,251
...what do you think is going
through Maverick's mind?

969
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:14,183
He's gonna have to stay focused and
channel that energy into good places.

970
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:16,438
When are you gonna get a life?

971
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,598
You are a nobody.

972
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,045
You should've stayed
in Antarctica, kid.

973
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:51,398
He made it! Yeah, good.

974
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:55,315
What an amazing first ride
mind-blower from Maverick.

975
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:02,951
Did you guys see that?

976
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:06,046
Man. I thought I was gonna lose it,
and then I just...

977
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,214
I just let go, you know.
I let go, and there it was.

978
01:06:11,835 --> 01:06:14,175
Wow, it's been an amazing day...

979
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,421
...0f shredding in less than
stellar conditions...

980
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,420
..but 1 never would have guessed
our three finalists.

981
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:21,813
Well, Sal, it's no surprise
that Tank Evans...

982
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,964
..has just breezed his way
into the finals.

983
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:29,295
And Cody Maverick, from a horrible
wipeout a few days ago to this.

984
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:35,028
And Chicken Joe from Sheboygan.
Who would have guessed it?

985
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:38,959
! have never seen a finals like this.

986
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,807
-We're in the finals, Joe.
-No way! We get to surf some more?

987
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:46,229
Isn't it exciting?
Look at that. This is great, huh?

988
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:49,832
You know, you should know this.
The Tank loves you.

989
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,279
Looks like this will be
the easiest year ever.

990
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:57,303
No way. Cody, did you hear that?
It's gonna be easy.

991
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,754
Are you loving this?

992
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,185
So who would you like
to see win the trophy?

993
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,868
It's not so important to me.

994
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,698
Friends are better than anything
in the world.

995
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,244
Friends are forever.

996
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,929
Trophies, you never know
what they can have happen to them.

997
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,089
-That was awesome, mate.
-Muy impresivo, my friend.

998
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:21,773
Thank you, bro. Thanks.

999
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,935
-Finals.
-Hey!

1000
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:26,614
Yeah. I know. I can't even--

1001
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,217
I think I can win this thing.
It's too much right now.

1002
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,903
-Well, that's all you came for.
-What?

1003
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,102
-What is that supposed to mean?
-You made it pretty clear last night...

1004
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:38,462
.. that winning's more important
to you than Z or me.

1005
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,998
But, hey, maybe you'll get to take
your stupid trophy home.

1006
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,567
-Lani. Come on.
-Come here, you!

1007
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:45,497
How about this, huh?

1008
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:50,278
Let me tell you something. You win
this thing, we're going places!

1009
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,650
Look at this kid.
He is a champ!

1010
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,240
Tank, nine-time defending champion.
He will roll on you.

1011
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,987
Expect him to win this thing. It's
basically a contest for second place.

1012
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:15,688
First, I'm gonna take you down.
Then I'm gonna fry the chicken.

1013
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,978
That cloud looks just like a kitten.

1014
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,424
Maverick and Evans take off.

1015
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,246
Mine!

1016
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,598
And it's Evans dropping in.

1017
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:46,283
And Tank's playing games,
blocking Maverick's every move.

1018
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,930
Maverick sticks a rail.

1019
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:54,456
Tank Evans down!
! have never, ever seen this before!

1020
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,310
But I'd love to see it again.

1021
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,857
Cody trying to take back the wave
that Tank snaked from him.

1022
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,492
Evans toying with him,
not paying attention.

1023
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:06,901
And there's the outside rail.
Evans goes down.

1024
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:11,322
And it's Maverick with this new-school
move. We'll call it "The Maverick."

1025
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:20,466
And look at this.
Maverick scoring big.

1026
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:25,823
Oh, it's so cute.
It's got little paws and the whiskers.

1027
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,822
Chicken Joe
with a no-paddle drop-in!

1028
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,326
-Here we go!
-Nobody needs to help this chicken.

1029
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:38,787
I'm flying!

1030
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:45,030
Maverick and Joe tied, and no score
for Tank Evans? Unbelievable.

1031
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:50,616
Surfers, this is your final wave!

1032
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:55,064
-Joe, this is it. This wave wins it.
-Yeah, man!

1033
01:09:57,593 --> 01:10:01,403
This wave is stacking up
to be a beautiful tube.

1034
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:05,405
Maverick should score big
on this one!

1035
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:09,687
But wait! Evans drops in.

1036
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:13,299
It looks like Evans
is gonna take out the chicken.

1037
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,318
What's Maverick doing?

1038
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,200
-Go, Joe, go!
-Got it! Let's go!

1039
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,270
! don't believe this.
This contest was Maverick's to win.

1040
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:30,103
Now Evans pushing Maverick out
of bounds and into The Boneyards.

1041
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,762
-Tank, look out!
-You look out!

1042
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:22,347
Code!

1043
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:25,884
Z!

1044
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:31,823
-Cody, come on.
-Z!}

1045
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:35,531
Paddle! Come on! Dig! Faster!
Come on. Dig!

1046
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,335
Don't dig! Don't dig!

1047
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:40,756
What?

1048
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:43,784
Let the wave carry you!

1049
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,194
You're gonna have to time it!

1050
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,686
You're gonna come right here,
right to me!

1051
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,359
Five...four....

1052
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:58,125
Three...two...one.

1053
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:04,809
Z!

1054
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,639
Where's Cody?

1055
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:28,019
Don't touch it! Don't touch that!

1056
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,164
This is a reminder
of the young surfer...

1057
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:36,164
..who gave his life
for the sport he loved.

1058
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,570
There you are.

1059
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:50,463
I can't believe it! 1 can't believe it.

1060
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:53,238
You came back.

1061
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,243
You saved my life, man.
Thank you.

1062
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,699
Hey, hey, come on.
You're gonna tip us!

1063
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,254
Well, I lost.

1064
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:07,739
Me too.

1065
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:12,716
Come on. Let's go, loser.

1066
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:15,123
You want to help me out here?

1067
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:19,968
You know the routine. Come on. Long.
That's it. Smooth, you know. Come on.

1068
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:25,320
Young Joey MacEnroe
was a beacon for a new generation.

1069
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:28,712
May he rest in peace.

1070
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:33,663
So, what am I bid for the board?
Who'll give me 30? 30, come on.

1071
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,110
-Don't touch his stuff, man.
-Pal, if you want to bid--

1072
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,475
-Give me that.
-Hey--!

1073
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:46,007
Hey. Hey, everyone.

1074
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:49,243
-How you been?
-Oh, my gosh!

1075
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:51,625
-Yeah...
-Hey, man, that's Z.

1076
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,464
..that's me.

1077
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,789
Skank, what's happening, man?

1078
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:58,572
Got a little sand
in your egg sac there, fella.

1079
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:01,118
-Where have you been, Z?
-What happened?

1080
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,441
Oh, you know...

1081
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:09,964
..1 got lost for a little while.
But that kid there, Cody...

1082
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:14,271
.. he pointed the way back.

1083
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,391
Could you please shut that off?
Could you give me a minute?

1084
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:35,736
Check it out! How about this?

1085
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,308
You want to talk about talent scout?
People find talent.

1086
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:43,788
I bring them back from the dead.
The now living legend, ladies and--

1087
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:45,817
-Shut up.
-What? Shut up?

1088
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,658
I'm not a legend. I'm a guy looking for
some nice waves, some good friends.

1089
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,843
Hey, guys, the swell is happening
over on the north shore!

1090
01:14:54,457 --> 01:14:55,657
I'm right behind you, Z.

1091
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,162
Ouch, that hurt.

1092
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:03,212
Come back here!
You don't just walk away! Come on!

1093
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:06,300
He's taking this loss pretty hard.

1094
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:09,245
Tank, how does it feel
to lose after nine time--

1095
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,080
l wasn't kissing her.
You can't have her!

1096
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:18,884
Can we get a few words?

1097
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,521
You gave up the trophy to help Joe.
What's that about?

1098
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,568
You know, Rob,
that's what friends do.

1099
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:27,837
-How's it feel to win, Joe?
-l won?

1100
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:31,290
Come on! I'll tell my mom.
Gimme. Gimme!

1101
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,882
Oh, Lia! Oh, Lia.

1102
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:39,559
Don't you walk away from me!
lam Reggie Belafon--

1103
01:15:41,504 --> 01:15:44,604
Turn that thing off.
Mikey! You are so fired!

1104
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,951
I can't imagine a better day.

1105
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:57,960
Dude, this-- This whole
experience has just been--

1106
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:01,204
It's amazing. Z?

1107
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:06,034
I don't think I've ever had
a better friend to me in my life.

1108
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:10,016
It's just really cool
to have everything I need.

1109
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,503
-Don't do it. Help!
-Arnold!

1110
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:16,959
To be honest, man, I'm kind of, like,
bored of talking about myself.

1111
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:20,760
So, is that cool?
You guys got what you need?

1112
01:16:21,377 --> 01:16:23,397
-We got it
-All right. Be good!

1113
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:33,628
Cowabunga!

1114
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,557
Of course we're proud of him!

1115
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,568
What mother wouldn't be
proud of him?

1116
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,951
We're so full of proudness.

1117
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:50,067
You know what?
He followed his dream...

1118
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:53,776
..and he went out there, and now
he's coming home with the trophy.

1119
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,153
l can't wait to see his trophy.

1120
01:17:56,572 --> 01:17:58,322
There's not really a trophy.

1121
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:01,448
Is there, like, a big shell
or something like that?

1122
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:04,311
There's no shell. There's no trophy.
Well, he didn't win.

1123
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:05,713
What?

1124
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:08,845
How bad was it?
Did he get smoked?

1125
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,197
-He was in the finals.
-Second place? That's losing.

1126
01:18:12,755 --> 01:18:14,805
-Winning is not everything, Glen.
-Right.

1127
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:16,567
Look at what Cody did--

1128
01:18:16,926 --> 01:18:18,826
Go back to the
"winning isn't everything" thing.

1129
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,318
That doesn't compute, really.

1130
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:26,594
You know what, Glen? I really hope
someday you can be more like Cody.

1131
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:29,026
This interview is over.

1132
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,971
Remember when were talking
about you leaving? That was great.

1133
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:03,861
Remember when
you were gonna go?

1134
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:06,012
-We were gonna go--
-You should still go.

1135
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:07,431
It's technical equipment.

1136
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:11,246
I know what I'm doing. I can unplug
one of your little Hollywood devices.

1137
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,260
The lighting thing,
