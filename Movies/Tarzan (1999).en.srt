1
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:04,044
Put your faith in what
you most believe in

2
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,201
Two worlds, one family

3
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,249
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

4
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,816
To guide these lives we see

5
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,708
A paradise untouched by man

6
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,472
Within this world blessed with love

7
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,457
A simple life
They live in peace

8
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,801
Softly tread the sand
below your feet now

9
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,585
Two worlds, one family

10
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,669
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

11
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,076
To guide these lives we see

12
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,258
Beneath the shelter of the trees

13
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,036
Only love can enter here

14
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:01,057
A simple life
They live in peace

15
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,872
Raise your head up
Lift high the load

16
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:08,991
Take strength from those
that need you

17
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,343
Build high the walls
Build strong the beams

18
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,834
A new life is waiting

19
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,419
But danger's no stranger here

20
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,128
No words describe a mother's tears

21
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:52,712
No words can heal a broken heart

22
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,080
A dream is gone
but where there's hope

23
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:01,741
Somewhere, something is calling for you

24
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,312
Two worlds, one family

25
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:09,596
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

26
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,910
To guide these lives we see

27
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,037
Every moment now
the bond grows stronger

28
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,633
Two worlds, one family

29
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,713
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

30
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:08,264
To guide these lives we see

31
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,422
Mama, look!
Look over there!

32
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,438
- Kala!
- She's back.

33
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,777
- [told you she was comin’ back.
- We looked everywhere for you.

34
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,138
Are you all right, dear?

35
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,047
I'm fine. No, really, honestly.

36
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,825
It's just that I got a little bit...
sidetracked.

37
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,953
Well, isn't that...

38
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:43,535
- Well, it's so....
- Why, it's, it's just so...

39
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,247
It's freaky-lookin', okay?
That's what it is.

40
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,555
- Terkina!
- Well, it is!

41
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,204
I mean, what the heck is it anyway?

42
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,377
He's a baby.

43
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,211
Ican't ...

44
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,765
So, where's his mama?

45
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,651
Well, I'm going to be his mother now.

46
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,362
You know, he's not so bad,
once you get used to him.

47
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,803
Kala's gonna be its mother now.

48
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,578
Kerchak, I saved him from Sabor.

49
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,437
Kala, it won't replace the one we lost.

50
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,384
I know that.
But he needs me.

51
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,216
But it, it...

52
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,675
Kala, look at it.
It's not our kind.

53
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,626
No, you have to take it back.

54
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,576
Take him back?
But he'll die.

55
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,948
- If the jungle wants him...
- [want him.

56
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,311
I cannot let you
put our family in danger.

57
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,060
Does he look dangerous to you?

58
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,129
Was it alone?

59
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,513
Yes. Sabor killed his family.

60
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,716
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

61
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,745
There are no others.

62
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,109
Then you may keep him.

63
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,819
Kerchak, I know he'll be a good son.

64
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,704
I said he could stay.

65
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,574
That doesn't make him my son.

66
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,425
We will nest here for the night.

67
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,690
So, what you gonna call it?

68
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,263
I'm gonna call him...

69
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,782
.. Tarzan.

70
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,819
Tarzan? Okay, he's your baby.

71
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,089
All right, little lady, come on.
It's way past your nest time.

72
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,750
- Oh, Mom.
- No.

73
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,675
Five more minutes?
Two more minutes?

74
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,851
One more minutes?

75
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,398
Don't cry. I'm here.
Come on. Come on.

76
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,143
Come, stop your crying

77
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,965
It will be all right

78
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,445
Just take my hand
Hold it tight

79
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,439
! will protect you
from all around you

80
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:29,628
! will be here, don't you cry

81
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:34,543
For one so small
You seem so strong

82
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,095
My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm

83
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,118
This bond between us
Can't be broken

84
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,814
! will be here, don't you cry

85
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:53,222
‘Cause you'll be in my heart

86
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,593
Yes, you'll be in my heart

87
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,901
From this day on

88
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,914
Now and forever more

89
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,511
You'll be in my heart

90
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,549
No matter what they say

91
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,248
You'll be here in my heart

92
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,095
Always

93
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,188
Always.

94
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,002
Tarzan.

95
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,414
Tarzan?

96
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,122
I sure scared you, Mom.

97
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,227
You sure did.

98
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,572
Can't you imitate any quieter animal?

99
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,621
Mom, they're no fun.

100
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,703
Wanna see me be a leopard?

101
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,224
Why don't you just come up
with your own sound?

102
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,613
Kala.

103
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,383
Oops.

104
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,414
Tarzan! Thank goodness
you're all right!

105
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,217
Kala and I have been so worried.

106
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,304
Thank you. Thank you so much
for finding him, Kerchak.

107
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,414
You are such a wise and caring leader.

108
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:49,865
Run.

109
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,034
- Hello! Are you thick in the head?
- What?

110
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,077
How many times
do I have to tell you?

111
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,531
If you want Kerchak to like you,
stay away from him.

112
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,412
Come on, Terk, step on it!

113
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,957
- Last one there is a dung beetle!
- Yeah, the first one's gotta eat it.

114
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,561
Terk, can l come?

115
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,472
Well, you could if you could keep up,
but, you know, you can't really keep up.

116
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,393
Wait up, guys!
Wait up! Right behind you!

117
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,552
You're standing on my spleen.

118
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,564
Take that!
Stop hitting yourself.

119
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,859
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

120
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,359
The fun has arrived

121
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,152
- Thank you very much.
- Hey, what took you so long?

122
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,675
I had a little pest control problem,
but it's all taken care of.

123
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,351
Hi, guys.

124
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,759
Terk, what is this,
some kind of joke?

125
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,732
Tell me I'm not looking
at the hairless wonder.

126
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,878
Well, Terk said could come along
if l could keep up.

127
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,198
- No, no.
- Terk. Come on.

128
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,309
I'll handle this, guys, okay?
Listen, buddy. Come here.

129
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,579
We got a tiny, little, itsy-bitsy
problem here, okay?

130
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,788
Personally, I'd love to hang out
with you. You know I would.

131
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,992
But the guys... they need
a little convincing, you know?

132
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,725
- Okay, what do I gotta do?
- Do? What do you gotta do?

133
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,119
It's so stupid.

134
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,321
What?

135
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,709
Well, you gotta...
you gotta go get a hair.

136
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,937
- Ahair?
- Yeah, a hair.

137
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,148
An elephant hair.

138
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,362
An elephant hair?

139
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,977
Like I said, it's stupid, right?

140
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,773
Listen, take it from me.
Go home. Okay?

141
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,046
Who needs this aggravation?

142
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,658
You know, I'm probably
gonna leave soon myself.

143
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,657
You go, I'll catch up, all right?

144
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,892
You see? Leave it to me.
I told you I could...

145
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,522
Tarzan! Tarzan!

146
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,926
That one hurt him.

147
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,521
Look! There he is!

148
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,349
He's alive!

149
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,171
- Hey, guys!
- Hi.

150
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,087
Come back! Come back.

151
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,934
This guy's great.

152
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,689
If he lives, you should
bring him around more often.

153
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,411
Come on, come on.
Let's go get a better seat.

154
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,058
You can never get enough sleep,
let me tell you.

155
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,814
- l get enough sleep.
- Mom?

156
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,539
- It burns up the calories.
- Are you sure this water's sanitary?

157
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,632
It looks questionable to me.

158
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,892
It's fine, honey.

159
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,000
But what about bacteria?

160
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,579
Tantor, can't you see
Mummy's talking?

161
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,797
Watch out!
There's something swimming!

162
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,386
- It's coming right at you!
- Honey, Mummy's losing her patience.

163
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,926
- But this time I really see something.
- Oh, boy.

164
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,916
Piranha! It's a piranha!

165
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,316
Sweetheart, there are no
piranhas in Africa.

166
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,836
Don't tell the kid that.
Of course there are piranhas in Africa.

167
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,810
No, she's right.
They're native to South America.

168
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,592
- Get outta here.
- It's true.

169
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,197
- No way.
- Come on, now.

170
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,009
Think I'd be here if there were?

171
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,075
It's right behind you! Run!

172
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:48,677
For the last time, honey,
there are no piranhas in...

173
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,535
My butt!

174
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,727
- Told you!
- There's something on my butt!

175
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,473
- What is it?
- Are there any more of them?

176
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,074
- What is it?
- It's a piranha.

177
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,179
Piranha!

178
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,730
Tantor, where are you?

179
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,729
He's dead.

180
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,335
We're dead!

181
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:36,036
We didn't do it!
They're the ones!

182
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,010
Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

183
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,599
Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on!

184
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,744
Tarzan, don't die on me!
Don't die on me!

185
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,126
- You weren't supposed to do it!
- Get away!

186
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,139
Don't you know a piranha
can strip your flesh in seconds?

187
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,662
What? He's not a piranha!

188
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,848
He's alive!

189
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,177
He's alive! He's alive!

190
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,253
- He's alive!
- He's...

191
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,758
You idiot!

192
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,572
You nearly gave me a heart attack!
You happy?

193
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,448
I don't believe it.
You got the hair?

194
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,844
Is that what this is all about?
I got a whole tail of them.

195
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,333
- Tarzan?
- Terkina?

196
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,918
Oh, no.

197
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,426
- Who's that?
- My mom.

198
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,212
- Tarzan.
- Hi.

199
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,590
- Hi, Aunt Kala.
- Oh, you scared me!

200
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,879
- What happened?
- Well, I...

201
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,998
It's sort of a long...
It's involved.

202
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,250
Because what happened,
it was a weird...

203
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,319
What happened?

204
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,354
It was my fault, Kerchak.

205
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,649
Tarzan.

206
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,373
We were playing, and...
Well, I'm sorry, Kerchak.

207
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,879
You almost killed someone.

208
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,104
- It was an accident.
- He's only a child.

209
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,610
That's no excuse.
You can't keep defending him.

210
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,314
- But he'll learn.
- You can't learn to be one of us.

211
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,462
- You never give him a chance.
- Give him a chance?

212
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,485
Kala, look at him.
He will never be one of us.

213
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,692
Kerchak!

214
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,098
Tarzan.

215
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,083
Tarzan, what are you doing?

216
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,814
Why am I so different?

217
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,012
You're covered with mud,
that's why.

218
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:25,098
- Kerchak said I didn't belong in...
- Close your mouth.

219
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,541
Kerchak said I don't
belong in the family.

220
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,057
Never mind what Kerchak said.

221
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,972
- Hold still.
- But look at me!

222
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,461
lam, Tarzan.

223
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,287
And do you know what I see?

224
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,585
I see two eyes, like mine,

225
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,498
and a nose, somewhere.

226
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:48,883
Here.

227
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,191
Two ears.

228
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:54,931
- And let's see, what else?
- Two hands?

229
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,874
That's right.

230
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,145
Close your eyes.

231
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,110
Now, forget what you see.

232
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,170
What do you feel?

233
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:22,997
My heart.

234
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,912
Come here.

235
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,442
- Your heart.
- See?

236
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,967
We're exactly the same.

237
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,463
Kerchak just can't see that.

238
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,628
I'll make him see it.

239
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,426
I'll be the best ape ever.

240
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,819
Oh, I bet you will.

241
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,715
Oh, the power to be strong

242
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,314
And the wisdom to be wise

243
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:11,069
Alf these things
will come to you in time

244
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,965
On this journey that you're making

245
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,678
There'll be answers that you'll seek

246
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,949
And it's you who'll climb the mountain

247
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,532
It's you who'll reach the peak

248
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,059
Son of Man, look to the sky

249
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,322
Lift your spirit, set it free

250
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,739
Someday you'll walk tall with pride

251
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,525
Son of Man,
aman in time you'll be

252
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,542
Though there's no one there
to guide you

253
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,132
No one to take your hand

254
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,478
But with faith and understanding

255
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,283
You will journey from boy to man

256
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,393
Son of Man, look to the sky

257
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,062
Lift your spirit, set it free

258
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,360
Someday you'll walk tall with pride

259
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:22,133
Son of Man,
aman in time you'll be

260
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,457
In learning you will teach

261
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,235
And in teaching you will learn

262
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,960
You'll find your place
beside the ones you love

263
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,213
Oh, and all the things
you dreamed of

264
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,843
The visions that you saw

265
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:51,074
Well, the time is drawing near now

266
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,362
It's yours to claim it all

267
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:58,124
Son of Man, look to the sky

268
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,466
Lift your spirit, set it free

269
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:05,154
Someday you'll walk tall with pride

270
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:10,091
Son of Man,
aman in time you'll be

271
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,893
Son of Man

272
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:23,461
Son of Man's a man for all to see

273
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,637
Don't even think about it.

274
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,751
- How'd you know it was me?
- I'm your mother. I know everything.

275
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,793
- Where have you been?
- [thought you knew everything.

276
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,469
Hey, Auntie K, you're looking
remarkably groomed today.

277
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,232
Hello, Terk.

278
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,977
Not the neck!
Not the neck there, T.

279
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,318
Watch it!

280
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,726
Okay, it's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

281
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,516
Please stop.
Somebody's gonna get hurt here.

282
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,126
- And it's always me.
- Cramp. Cramp in the calf.

283
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,728
- Please!
- Okay. Okay, you win.

284
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,913
Okay, okay, you win. Hello!
Down here. Yo, yo! Let go!

285
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,344
Okay, okay, you win. Hello!
Down here. Yo, yo! Let go!

286
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,195
- Oh, sorry, Terk.
- What kind of animal are you?

287
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,987
You know, I been thinking lately
that maybe Tarzan

288
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,197
could be some subspecies of elephant.

289
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,273
What are you, crazy?
An elephant?

290
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,992
Listen to me. Think about it.
He enjoys a peanut, I enjoy a peanut.

291
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,169
He looks nothing like you.

292
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,258
Okay everybody, move aside.
Outta my way.

293
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:32,418
Best friend coming through.
That would be me.

294
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,771
And you,
don't make a habit of that, okay?

295
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,327
There are other ways
of getting attention.

296
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,579
- I'll try to remember that.
- All right.

297
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,541
Il was right behind you if you
needed me. I had you covered.

298
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,859
What was that?

299
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,608
It wasn't me, I swear.

300
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,200
Okay, well, maybe it was.

301
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,118
Everyone, let's move.

302
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,615
l was reminded of a safari
Il led up the Zambezi.

303
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:24,745
Marvelous. Lots of hunting, yes.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

304
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,017
Wildebeest everywhere.

305
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:31,389
Two bearers loading three rifles
for me, blasting away.

306
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,784
That's when I knew
l was born for Africa

307
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,954
and Africa was created for...

308
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,881
Clayton?

309
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,161
Clayton...
Oh, there you are.

310
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,073
What is it? What is it, Clayton?
Are we in danger?

311
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,033
I thought I saw something.

312
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,414
Is it a Hippopotamus amphibious
or a Rhinoceros bihornus?

313
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,108
- Professor, don't move!
- Oh, right.

314
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,827
Daddy?

315
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,037
Daddy, what's all the hullabaloo about?

316
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,837
What is it, Daddy?

317
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,759
Mr. Clayton asked me not to move.
He saw something.

318
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:21,462
l moved.

319
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,193
Uh, Mr. Clayton?
Sorry, excuse me.

320
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,708
But my father and I came on this
expedition to study gorillas,

321
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,873
and I believe your shooting
might be scaring them off.

322
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,426
You hired me to protect you,
Miss Porter,

323
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,565
and protect you I shall.

324
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,817
And you're doing a marvelous job of it.

325
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,436
But we only have a short time
before the ship returns, you see...

326
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,030
Jane! Jane, do you realize
what you're standing in?

327
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,700
- Agorilla's nest!
- Daddy!

328
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,056
At last! Our first sign in days.

329
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,846
Do you think the beasts
could be nearby?

330
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,669
Could be. Why, I mean,
there's the evidence.

331
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,685
They can't be very far, anyway.

332
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,527
Look! Over there and there...

333
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,151
Where?
Yes, more nests!

334
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,114
- l see them!
- Just as you predicted!

335
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,755
Family groups!

336
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,767
Oh, Jane, I love you.

337
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,870
Family groups?

338
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,586
Excuse me,
but these are wild beasts

339
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,512
that would sooner tear your head off
than look at you.

340
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,478
On the contrary, Mr. Clayton.

341
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,723
Daddy's theory is that these are
social creatures, not monsters.

342
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,707
Mr. Clayton, please.
What if it's a gorilla?

343
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,955
It's no gorilla.

344
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,321
- Perhaps we should press on.
- Yes, indeed.

345
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:42,087
Now, we should keep heading west,
following the Ganoderma ablonatum.

346
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,171
Excellent, professor.

347
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,065
I could've used your expertise
on my last safari.

348
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,892
I was in the mountainous region
of Zambia.

349
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,412
Yes, very dangerous.

350
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,443
Are you what all the fuss was about?

351
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,448
Daddy! Daddy, quick!

352
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,652
No, wait. Hold still.

353
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,313
Oh, my good...

354
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:08,735
You may not be a gorilla,
but you are one sweet little...

355
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,545
There you go.
What do you think?

356
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,389
Why, you little...

357
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,151
Well, this is absolutely peachy.

358
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,695
Come to study gorillas and get my
sketchbook pinched by a baboon.

359
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,137
Give me that!

360
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,370
Come on now, enough of this.
l want this paper on the count of three.

361
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,284
One.

362
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,132
Two.

363
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,560
Look, bananas!

364
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,225
I can't believe you fell for that one.

365
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:59,795
No, no, don't give me
those crocodile tears.

366
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,138
What would your parents have to say?

367
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,288
You see, I told you they'd be cross.

368
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,127
Go easy on him.
Children will be children.

369
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,502
I'm flying!

370
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,511
What on earth am I...

371
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,642
Get off! Get off!

372
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,896
Put me down! Put me down!

373
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,892
No, pick me up, pick me up!

374
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,356
Help!

375
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,861
Unhand me, monkey!

376
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,041
Over there!

377
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,962
I'm in a tree with a man
who talks to monkeys.

378
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,183
I can't do this. I can't...

379
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,645
This is good.
This is very good.

380
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,159
Wait.

381
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,410
One, two.

382
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,011
It can't get any worse, can it?

383
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,966
Obviously it can.

384
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,302
Stay back. No, don't...
Don't come any closer.

385
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:07,798
Please, don't.

386
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,769
What are you...
What are you doing?

387
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,608
No, please don't.
That tickles.

388
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,762
No, get off, get off. Get off!

389
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,368
It serves you right.

390
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,850
Stay away from me,
like a very good wild man.

391
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,372
You stay. I'm warning you.

392
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,375
My father won't take kindly to you...

393
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,540
No. That's...
That's close enough.

394
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,907
How dare you?

395
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,872
Oh, dear.

396
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,140
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

397
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,220
Yes, thank you.

398
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,888
That's a lovely heartbeat.
It's very nice.

399
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,277
- It's very nice.
- Oh, thank you.

400
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:34,673
I can't do a thing with it
in this humidity though.

401
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,403
You do speak!

402
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:40,101
All this time I thought you were a big,
wild, quiet, silent person thing.

403
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:44,015
Why didn't you tell me? I must say
I'm rather curious as to who you are.

404
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,588
Tarzan.

405
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,697
Tarzan.

406
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,510
Tarzan?

407
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,565
Oh, I see.

408
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,644
Oh, I see.

409
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,489
Tarzan.

410
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,411
Oh, I see.

411
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,116
I'm Jane.

412
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,495
I'm Jane.

413
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,762
Jane. Tarzan.

414
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,652
Jane.

415
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,784
Jane.

416
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,153
Exactly.

417
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,335
Clayton!

418
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:39,491
- Clayton.
- Extraordinary.

419
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,874
Please, can you take me to my camp?

420
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,813
Yes, Clayton. Wonderful.

421
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,512
Can't we walk?

422
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,217
Can't we walk?!

423
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:03,008
- Let's hope we find him before Kerchak.
- Maybe he's lost.

424
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,011
- Or found something more interesting.
- Are you nuts?

425
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,331
What could be more interesting than us?

426
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,660
Hey, what's everybody looking at?

427
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,820
The horror!

428
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,654
It's gruesome. Hide me!

429
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,636
Pull yourself together.
You're embarrassing me.

430
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,663
These things aren't alive.

431
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,636
I knew that.

432
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,571
Hello?

433
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:40,176
What kind of primitive beasts
are responsible for this mess?

434
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,776
Come here, you guys!
Come here, come here!

435
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:52,812
- Look at this.
- What is that thing?

436
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,781
Funny.

437
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,683
Do it again, do it again.

438
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,483
Like this?

439
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,542
Rip it!

440
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,018
Ding! I love that part.

441
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:19,531
Let me hear it, big fella.

442
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,041
Now, hit it!

443
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,886
Nice.

444
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,889
What the heck? Bye-bye.

445
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,237
Terk.

446
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,209
Yeah, Tant.

447
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,448
Now, hit it.

448
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:40,931
Come on, Tantor.

449
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,960
I love it.

450
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:45,859
Stay with me, fellas.

451
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,027
I feel something happening here.

452
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,917
Gorillas!

453
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,600
He's one of them.

454
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,441
Oh, my...

455
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,580
Jane, where are you?

456
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:39,337
- Thank goodness.
- Good heavens, what happened?

457
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,787
Are you all right?
We've been everywhere.

458
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,189
Oh, my goodness.

459
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,867
Daddy, I was out walking...

460
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:48,707
- Yes, yes.
- Little baby. Little baby monkey.

461
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,312
- [ drew a picture.
- Go on.

462
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:52,417
- The monkey starts crying.
- Poor baby.

463
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,240
But I turned round,
and there's a whole fleet of them!

464
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:57,082
- Of what?
- An army of monkeys!

465
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:59,085
- A huge tree full of them...
- Monkeys?

466
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,790
..screaming at me!

467
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,458
Theropithecus baboonus.
She's very good at this.

468
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,231
- Really?
- Terrified, I was.

469
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,486
Suddenly, I was swinging
in the vines, up in the air!

470
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,426
- With the monkeys?
- Flying.

471
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,571
- In the air.
- And I'm all surrounded.

472
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,513
- What did you do?
- And, Daddy, they took my boot!

473
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,280
- Those are the ones I bought you.
- And l was saved!

474
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:22,186
Il was saved by a flying wild man
in a loincloth.

475
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:25,176
- Loincloth, good Lord.
- What is she talking about?

476
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,513
l haven't the foggiest idea.
Takes after her mother, you know.

477
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,705
She'd come up with stories.
Not about men in loincloths...

478
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,056
- And there were gorillas!
- Gorillas?

479
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,821
- They were doing...
- You saw the gorillas? Where, Jane?

480
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,082
- He left with them.
- Who, dear, who?

481
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,533
Tarzan.

482
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,881
Tarzan?

483
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,002
The ape man.

484
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,281
Everyone. We will avoid the strangers.

485
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,868
Do not let them see you,
and do not seek them out.

486
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:57,736
They mean us no harm, Kerchak.

487
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,705
- [don't know them.
- ldo. I've spent time with them.

488
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,462
You may be willing to risk our safety,
but I'm not.

489
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,223
Why are you threatened
by anyone different from you?

490
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,290
Protect this family,
and stay away from them.

491
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:19,321
Tarzan, for once,
listen to Kerchak.

492
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,484
Why didn't you tell me there were
creatures that look like me?

493
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,417
Well, he didn't stand upright.
He sort of...

494
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,648
- ...crouched.
- Really?

495
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,726
He supported his weight
on his knuckles.

496
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:40,665
- On the knuckles.
- See? Exactly like a gorilla.

497
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:43,612
- Extraordinary.
- It was amazing!

498
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,017
He'd bend his elbows out like this.
And then he walks, like this.

499
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:50,248
Oh, I see! Like Aunt Isabel.

500
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,936
This is capital!

501
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,315
Janey-Jane, what a discovery!

502
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,663
A man with no language,
no human behavior...

503
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,149
And no respect
for personal boundaries.

504
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,562
- How do you mean?
- He was this close, Daddy.

505
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:04,994
Staring at me.

506
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:08,116
He seemed confused at first,

507
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,836
as if he's never seen
another human before.

508
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:15,792
And his eyes were intense
and focused, and...

509
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:20,250
I've never seen such eyes.

510
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,673
Shall l leave you and the blackboard
alone for a moment?

511
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,001
Daddy, stop it.

512
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:33,496
The point is, think of what we could
learn from him. We must find him.

513
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:38,125
Professor, you are here
to find gorillas,

514
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,899
not indulge some girlish fantasy.

515
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,685
Fantasy? I didn’t imagine him.

516
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,198
Tarzan is...

517
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,854
. real.

518
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,905
It's him!

519
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:52,248
It's him, it's him. Tarzan!

520
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,260
- Professor, Jane, stand back!
- Wait!

521
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:57,867
Clayton.

522
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,958
Clayton.

523
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,656
Have we met?

524
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,526
How does he know my name?

525
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:09,982
He thinks it means
the sound of a gunshot.

526
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:14,174
Yes. Hello, Tarzan.

527
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,988
l see what you mean
about those personal boundaries.

528
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:19,288
What's he doing?

529
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,198
Look at him, Jane.

530
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,303
Moves like an ape,
but looks like a man.

531
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,238
He could be the missing link.

532
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:30,945
Or our link to the gorillas.

533
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,609
Yes, yes.

534
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,631
Where are the gorillas?

535
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,948
Go-ri-llas!

536
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,977
Go-ri-llas!

537
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:45,439
Shouting won't help, Mr. Clayton.
He doesn't understand English.

538
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,620
Then I'll make him understand.

539
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,348
If lcan teach a parrot to sing
God Save the Queen,

540
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:54,214
I can certainly teach this savage
a thing or two.

541
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:57,503
Gorilla.

542
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,576
Gorilla.

543
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:03,165
- He's got it!
- Gorilla.

544
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,141
Go-ril-la.

545
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,366
Perhaps not.

546
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,013
Gimme that. Leave it.

547
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:15,249
Mr. Clayton, I think
I'll take it from here.

548
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:28,469
Whatever you do, I'll do it too

549
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:32,653
Show me everything and tell me how

550
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,130
It all means something

551
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:38,506
And yet nothing to me

552
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,471
! can see there's so much to learn

553
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,665
It's all so close
and yet so far

554
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:52,316
l see myself as people see me

555
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:56,656
Oh, I just know there's
something bigger out there

556
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:00,714
! wanna know, can you show me

557
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:04,718
! wanna know about
these strangers like me

558
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:08,692
Tell me more, please show me

559
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,951
Something's familiar about
these strangers like me

560
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,841
Every gesture,
every move that she makes

561
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,812
Makes me feel like never before

562
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:34,393
Why do I have this growing need
to be beside her

563
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:40,223
These emotions I never knew

564
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:44,598
Of some other world
far beyond this place

565
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,392
Beyond the trees,
above the clouds

566
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:52,776
! see before me a new horizon

567
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:56,717
! wanna know, can you show me

568
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:00,846
! wanna know about
these strangers like me

569
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:04,578
Tell me more, please show me

570
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:08,749
Something's familiar about
these strangers like me

571
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:13,871
Come with me now to see my world

572
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,941
Where there's beauty
beyond your dreams

573
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:22,012
Can you feel the things I feel

574
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:26,263
Right now, with you

575
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,439
Take my hand

576
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:34,651
There's a world I need to know

577
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,879
We've wasted all this time
on what he wants.

578
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:58,842
The boat could arrive any day.
Now, ask him straight out.

579
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:05,808
Tarzan, will you take us
to the gorillas?

580
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,220
Do you understand?

581
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,355
l understand.

582
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,438
- Good work, Jane.
- Well?

583
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,910
- lL can't.
- What?

584
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,032
- Why not, Tarzan?
- Kerchak.

585
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:25,105
! wanna know, can you show me

586
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:29,038
! wanna know about
these strangers like me

587
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,853
Tell me more, please show me

588
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:37,887
Something's familiar about
these strangers like me

589
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,011
! wanna know

590
00:53:57,868 --> 00:54:01,708
Oh, Terk, I've never seen him so happy.

591
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:04,086
Yeah? I give it a week.

592
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,879
- Aye, cut her loose!
- Come on, pull it down.

593
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,840
- Aye, cut her loose!
- Come on, pull it down.

594
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:14,087
- All right, move it, ya bilge rats!
- Heave ho, lads.

595
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:15,485
Put your back in it.

596
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,856
- All right, move it.
- Wait. Please, don't...

597
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:21,682
I've waited 30 years for this
and I won't leave until l see a gorilla.

598
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:26,276
Isn't this dreadful, Tarzan?
No! No, no, wait!

599
00:54:26,864 --> 00:54:28,794
Pick your barrel up.
Pick it up.

600
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:30,913
Here we go. Here we go.

601
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:32,635
You're the captain.

602
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:35,863
Tell them you've had engine trouble,
and give us two more days.

603
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,450
And be late at every port
from here to London?

604
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,179
We'll have come for nothing.

605
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,904
I'm sorry, Miss Porter,
but I simply can't do it.

606
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,652
This is your fault.

607
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:49,924
I should've followed my instincts
and set traps for the beasts.

608
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,880
Don't you think I'm disappointed
about the gorillas?

609
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,400
You are absolutely impossible!

610
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,297
Il was so afraid that you
wouldn't come in time.

611
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:00,803
The boat's arrived.

612
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,721
The boat that's come to take us home,
to England.

613
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:08,088
And Daddy and I were...
Well, l was wondering...

614
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:11,395
Well, we really hope
that you'll come with us.

615
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,102
Won't you?

616
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,258
Go see England today.
Come home tomorrow.

617
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,570
Well, see, it would be very difficult
to come back...

618
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,133
- ever,

619
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,723
Not come back?

620
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,499
I know it sounds awful,
but you belong with us, with people.

621
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,790
Jane must stay with Tarzan.

622
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,555
Stay here?

623
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,171
My laundry.

624
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:38,471
No, I can't stay.
Look, I've got...

625
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,079
I'm with my father, and...

626
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:44,368
Jane... stay.

627
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:47,306
- But...
- Please.

628
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,200
But, I can't.

629
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:56,635
Women.

630
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:59,414
How typical. Thank you, Jones.

631
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:03,363
Even if you hadn't grown up
a savage, you'd be lost.

632
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,997
There are no trails
through a woman's heart.

633
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,671
- Jane is going.
- Yes.

634
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:14,734
If only she could've spent
more time with the gorillas.

635
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,325
She's so disappointed.

636
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,894
Crushed, really.

637
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,764
Sorry, old boy.

638
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:26,604
Oh, well, l best get Jane's things
to the ship.

639
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,151
Clayton.

640
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,825
If Jane sees gorillas,
she stays?

641
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:41,575
Say, that's why she came, isn't it?

642
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,481
- I'll do it.
- Good man!

643
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,210
- Snipes?
- Sir?

644
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:52,602
Get the boys together.
There's gonna be a change in plans.

645
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,013
Terk, just get Kerchak out of the way.

646
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,042
- What?
- I'd be happy to get...

647
00:56:57,347 --> 00:57:00,507
Hey! Shut your trunk
and get me out of here.

648
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:03,038
Can you believe that guy?

649
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:06,407
Drops us like a newborn giraffe,
kerplop!

650
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,930
Now waltzes in here
and expects us to just...

651
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,737
Terk, I'm asking you as a friend.

652
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,226
With the face and the eyes
and the...

653
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:22,615
All right! But don't make me
do anything embarrassing.

654
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,644
I'm gonna kill him!!

655
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,980
I thought that dress
was rather slimming on you.

656
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:32,339
Really? I thought it was
a little revealing and kind of...

657
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,415
How does she move in this thing?

658
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,874
Look out!

659
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:10,482
- Look, Daddy!
- Where?

660
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,995
Now, be careful, professor.

661
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:18,821
Mustn't, mustn't frighten.

662
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:21,936
She's beautiful.

663
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:24,679
She's my mother.

664
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,733
This is your...

665
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:30,761
..mother?

666
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,917
- What's happening?
- [don't know, Daddy.

667
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,994
- It's getting away!
- No! You'll only frighten her more.

668
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:58,555
Yes, absolutely, my dear.
Good idea.

669
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,870
What are you doing?
Want to frighten them?

670
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,075
Get up. Get...

671
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:06,397
Don't get up.

672
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:38,884
Hello.

673
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:46,234
It's very nice to meet you, too.

674
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:53,507
Oh, Your Majesty,
you're such a tease.

675
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,450
Whoa! Hello. Hello.

676
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,170
Archimedes Q. Porter at your service.

677
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,180
Quite a grip you've got.

678
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:05,442
Thank you, yes.
Is that one of mine?

679
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:09,111
This is wonderful, Mr. Clayton!

680
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:10,866
Look, look! Social grooming.

681
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:13,951
Congratulations, professor.

682
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:17,251
Our dream has come true.

683
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:22,715
Give me that!

684
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,093
Hey, what are you doing?
Now, stop that! Stop!

685
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,884
Hold on now. Leave that!

686
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:29,057
That is not to be played with!

687
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,334
Can you teach me?

688
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,475
- Speak gorilla?
- Yes.

689
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,373
Good heavens, what did I say?

690
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,650
That Jane stays with Tarzan.

691
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:20,127
Stay? But I, l thought we'd already...

692
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,690
Tarzan, l...

693
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:30,944
- ls that my dress?
- Oh, no.

694
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:36,125
Daddy.

695
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,406
Give it to me!

696
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:45,671
Go!

697
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,247
Go!

698
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,730
Wait, wait! Tarzan!

699
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,045
Go now!

700
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,130
Jane, quickly! Hurry!
Come along!

701
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,968
Kerchak, I didn't...

702
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:39,221
- I'm sorry, lL...
- lasked you to protect our family.

703
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:43,116
And you betrayed us all.

704
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:13,758
I'm so confused.

705
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:17,993
Come with me.

706
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:21,191
There's something I should've
shown you long ago.

707
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:42,951
Is this me?

708
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,194
And this is my father,

709
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:50,859
and...

710
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,701
and my...

711
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:56,241
Now you know.

712
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,399
Tarzan, I just want you to be happy,

713
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,397
whatever you decide.

714
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:55,487
No matter where I go,
you will always be my mother.

715
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:02,926
And you will always be in my heart.

716
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:25,026
Goodbye, Tarzan.

717
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,497
I'm so glad you found us in time.

718
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,660
We're too late!
I can't believe it!

719
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,560
If you had pulled over
and asked for directions...

720
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,779
We didn't get to say goodbye.

721
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:51,795
Well, good riddance, all right?
Who needs you, huh?

722
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:54,022
Go on, get out of here, bald boy!

723
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,864
You, you ingrate!
You bald ingrate!

724
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,030
Go on and rot, for all 1 care!

725
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,839
Go!

726
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,886
What are you looking at?

727
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,858
I'm gonna miss him, too.

728
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:18,081
Tarzan, you can't imagine
what's in store for you.

729
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:19,645
You'll see the world.

730
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,379
Everyone's going to want to meet you.
Kings, scientists, famous writers.

731
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,840
Yes. Darwin and Kipling.
Queen Victoria!

732
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,330
l haven't met her,
but I heard she's nice.

733
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:31,109
And I'll be with Jane?

734
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,920
Yes, with Jane.

735
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,297
Slippery.

736
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,310
Get him!

737
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:35,633
What's going on here?

738
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,962
Clayton! Clayton, help!

739
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,689
Have we met?

740
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:48,627
Yes, the ape man.

741
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,938
Clayton, you...

742
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,258
You...

743
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,284
So sorry about the rude welcome,
old boy,

744
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,447
but I couldn't have you
making a scene

745
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:03,399
when we put your furry friends
in their cages.

746
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,323
Why?

747
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,062
Why?

748
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,706
For three hundred pounds sterling
a head.

749
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:13,153
Actually, l have you to thank, my boy.

750
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,309
Couldn't have done it without you.

751
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,785
Lock him up with the others.

752
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:27,255
That sounded like Tarzan.

753
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:29,580
He sounded like he was in trouble.

754
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:33,062
Well, why doesn't he get his new friends
to help him? I don't care.

755
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:36,596
That's it!

756
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,659
I've had it with you
and your emotional constipation!

757
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,659
Tarzan needs us
and we're gonna help him!

758
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:46,648
You got that?
Now, pipe down and hang on tight!

759
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,146
We've got a boat to catch.

760
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:01,352
I've never felt so alive!

761
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:04,130
Good! 'Cause I'm gonna kill you!

762
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,464
No time for that now, missy.

763
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:28,930
Tarzan, it's no use. Don't!

764
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:40,277
- Clayton.
- Yes, Clayton.

765
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:44,363
Clayton betrayed us all.
I'm so sorry, Tarzan.

766
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:47,281
No, I did this.

767
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:51,626
I betrayed my family.
Kerchak was right.

768
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:56,498
Those magnificent creatures,
shivering in cages.

769
01:10:57,153 --> 01:10:59,703
What is this world coming to?

770
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,232
Oh, by Jove!
Don't know my own strength.

771
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:14,879
What was that?

772
01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:17,388
You are an animal!

773
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,309
That sounded just like an elephant.

774
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:22,691
Tantor!

775
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,510
Thanks, guys.

776
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:28,265
I thought I would never
see you again!

777
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,204
And here you are.

778
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:33,957
Sometimes you embarrass me.

779
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:44,475
l remember you.

780
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,675
I think this one
will be better off stuffed.

781
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,543
You came back.

782
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:14,192
l came home.

783
01:13:29,372 --> 01:13:30,952
Fire!

784
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:39,322
You there! Take what you can
back to the boat.

785
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:40,852
Aye, aye, sir.

786
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,589
I've got some hunting to do.

787
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,262
Don't worry.

788
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,620
I'm going to have you
out of this in a second.

789
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:20,500
This should do the trick.

790
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,396
Hiding, are we?

791
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,790
- Good!
- Clayton, you...

792
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,139
I could use a challenge.
Because after I get rid of you,

793
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:56,130
rounding up your little ape family
will be all too easy!

794
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:25,056
Go ahead, shoot me.

795
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:30,498
Be a man.

796
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,097
Not a man like you!

797
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,159
Clayton, don't!

798
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,041
Kerchak, forgive me.

799
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:18,269
No, forgive me
for not understanding

800
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:22,748
that you have always
been one of us.

801
01:17:24,907 --> 01:17:27,867
Our family will look to you now.

802
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:32,022
No, Kerchak.

803
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:33,864
Take care of them...

804
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,612
..my son.

805
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:48,352
Take care of them.

806
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:13,005
London will seem so small
compared to all this.

807
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,722
I will miss you, Jane.

808
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,655
- Miss Porter!
- know. I'm coming.

809
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:25,280
Well... l suppose we
should say goodbye.

810
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,233
Goodbye.

811
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:51,970
Goodbye, Tarzan!
Goodbye.

812
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,864
I'm going to miss that boy.

813
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:08,140
Jane, dear, I can't help feeling
that you should stay.

814
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,907
Please don't.
We've been through all of this.

815
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:13,053
I couldn't possibly...

816
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:17,295
belong in England with you,
with people...

817
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,202
But you love him.

818
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:31,816
Go on.

819
01:20:57,386 --> 01:21:00,456
Thank you.
Thanks for getting my glove.

820
01:21:01,924 --> 01:21:03,264
Thank you.

821
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,102
What am I doing?

822
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:25,248
Captain, tell them that you
never found us, eh?

823
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,904
After all, people get lost
in the jungle every day.

824
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:30,527
Tootle-pip.

825
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,608
Put your faith in what you
most believe in

826
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:58,397
Two worlds, one family

827
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,284
Trust your heart, let fate decide

828
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:04,598
To guide these lives

829
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,520
To guide these lives we see

830
01:22:11,894 --> 01:22:15,524
Two worlds, one family
