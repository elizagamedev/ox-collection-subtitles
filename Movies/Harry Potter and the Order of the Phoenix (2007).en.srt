1
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,480
! don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,799
And it’s going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,744
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow,
maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,704
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...

5
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,690
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,603
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,547
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,798
-Do we have to?
-Yes, we do.

9
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,395
V'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,579
He squealed like a pig, didn’t he?

11
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,054
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,268
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,824
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,386
-This one deserved it.
-Yeah.

15
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,986
-Five against one, very brave.
-Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,300
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,601
"Don't kill Cedric.”

18
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,841
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,864
-Shut up.
-"He’s going to kill me, Mum.”

20
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,747
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,168
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,511
She dead?

23
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:12,327
Is she dead?

24
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,232
Is she a dead Pott--?

25
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,195
-Dudley.
-Dudley, let’s go.

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,930
-What’'s going on?
-What are you doing?

27
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,932
-I'm not doing anything.
-We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,798
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,042
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,178
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,762
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,695
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,334
They might come back.

34
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,503
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,507
-Whole world’s gone topsy-turvy.
-l don’t understand. How do you know--?

36
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,095
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,524
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,474
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,448
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,284
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,530
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,183
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,244
it is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,570
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,672
Diddykins?

46
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,018
Is that you?

47
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,226
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,520
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,853
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,073
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,965
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,921
Vernon, don’t say that.

53
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:09,272
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,883
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,675
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,895
-Dear Mr. Potter.
-What?

57
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:36,925
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,891
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,482
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,474
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,012
..-you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,751
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,752
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,474
Justice.

65
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,935
He’s not very well.

66
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,303
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,302
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,411
-Tonks, for God's sake.
-Unnatural.

69
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,101
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,392
-What are you doing here?
-Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,042
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,682
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,015
But the letter said--

74
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,972
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,415
-...pending a formal hearing.
-A hearing?

76
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,811
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,408
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,227
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,663
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don’t break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,729
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,314
Come on.

82
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,482
In you go, son.

83
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,545
There've been no sightings.

84
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,424
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,324
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn’t proof enough....

86
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,302
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important....

87
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,188
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:28,521
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it’s time to take action.

89
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,031
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.

90
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,372
-His instinct would be to ignore it--
-Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:39,829
He’s getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,357
-Harry.
-Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,465
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,560
Bit peaky, but I’m afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:03,694
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,951
Yeah.

97
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,964
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:18,045
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,824
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,771
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,927
-Freaks.
-There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,420
Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,310
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,963
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,311
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,435
-You must tell us everything.
-Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,638
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It’s just outrageous.

108
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,218
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,025
-It'’s completely unfair.
-Yeah.

110
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,167
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,096
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,868
-It's headquarters.
-Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,310
It's a secret society.

114
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,920
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,656
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, 1 suppose?

116
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,572
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,605
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

118
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,152
-Only....
-Only what?

119
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,260
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,945
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,358
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,591
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,487
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,930
-Harry.
-Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,939
-Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
-If you're all done shouting....

126
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,796
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,339
if anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
if it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,723
...we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.

129
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,519
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,964
But he’s not an adult either.

131
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,134
-He's not James, Sirius.
-Well, he's not your son.

132
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,557
He's as good as.

133
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,683
-Who else has he got?
-Hey, Ginny.

134
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,201
-He's got me.
-How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,384
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon,
just like his godfather.

136
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,483
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,679
-Snape's part of the Order?
-Git.

138
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,745
--about your supposed reformation.

139
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,540
-1 know better.
-So why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,533
-Get off it.
-Quick.

141
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,340
-Get it up.
-Crookshanks.

142
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,847
-Stop it.
-Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,272
-Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
-Get it up.

144
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,740
-Hermione, I hate your cat.
-Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,765
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,078
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

147
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,190
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,134
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,823
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,515
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,908
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,959
Sirius.

153
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,910
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,576
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:30,213
I don’t understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,554
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,004
He’s been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:54,606
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,151
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,831
Why?

161
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,889
He thinks Dumbledore’s after his job.

162
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,165
No one in their right mind
could believe that--

163
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:07,117
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,853
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,978
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,580
The last time Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,973
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,006
Now he’s returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,230
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,955
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

171
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,000
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,507
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,208
He’s been recruiting heavily,
and we've been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,949
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he’s interested in.

175
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,957
We believe...

176
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,879
... Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,245
Sirius.

178
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,542
Something he didn’t have last time.

179
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,141
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:14,133
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,260
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

182
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,109
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort’s
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,693
Harry.

184
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,078
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,984
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,216
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,625
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,700
Here we are.

189
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:19,648
I’ve never used the visitors’ entrance
before. Should be fun.

190
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,710
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,791
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,214
Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,414
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,202
-Morning, Arthur.
-Morning, Bob.

195
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,551
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,396
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,045
Merlin’s beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,589
-They’ve changed the time of your hearing.
-When is it?

199
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,039
In five minutes.

200
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,782
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,345
And I’m confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,859
Yes, but we must be--

203
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,281
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

204
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,965
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,572
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

206
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,673
Yes?

207
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,028
I'm not allowed in, I’m afraid.

208
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,495
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,871
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

210
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,934
..into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,647
..resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,981
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag--

213
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,140
Witness for the defense.

214
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,312
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,026
...-Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,610
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

217
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,427
-...had been changed, did you?
- must have missed it.

218
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:24,373
But by a happy mistake,
l arrived at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,870
The charges?

220
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,408
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

221
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,321
"That he did knowingly...

222
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,822
.and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

223
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,059
...Pproduce a Patronus Charm...

224
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,438
...in the presence of a Muggle.”

225
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,903
-Do you deny producing said Patronus?
-No, but--

226
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,513
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

227
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,629
-...while under the age of 17?
-Yes, I was, but--

228
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,106
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot--

229
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,643
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

230
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,085
Dementors?

231
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,380
In Little Whinging?

232
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,809
That's quite clever.

233
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,011
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

234
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,534
-Highly convenient.
-I'm not lying.

235
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,217
-There were two of them, and if I hadn’t--
-Enough.

236
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:21,393
I'm sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

237
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:26,024
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event--

238
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:30,784
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

239
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,407
Please describe the attack.

240
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,139
What did they look like?

241
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:47,708
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

242
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,928
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,658
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,349
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

245
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,538
..as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:10,598
Now, look here. Dementors don’t just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

247
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,580
..-and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

248
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,714
I don't think anyone would believe...

249
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,756
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

250
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,187
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

251
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:30,533
Dementors are, after all,
under the control of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:35,067
And it’s so silly of me,
but it sounded for a moment as though...

253
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:39,258
... you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

254
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,379
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,548
...which is why I’m sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

256
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:50,186
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

257
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,723
...-and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

258
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,960
Of course, there is someone...

259
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,849
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:07,245
Cornelius, l implore you to see reason.

261
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,990
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

262
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:15,148
He is not back.

263
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,323
In the matter of Harry Potter...

264
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,303
...the law clearly states...

265
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:30,702
...that magic may be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.

266
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,953
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

267
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,253
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

268
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,330
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

269
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,218
Those in favor of conviction?

270
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:05,807
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

271
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,509
Cleared of all charges.

272
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,344
Professor.

273
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:43,196
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

274
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,822
You'll blow the entire operation.

275
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,830
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you....

276
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,601
I had to see you off, didn’t I?

277
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,917
What's life without a little risk?

278
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,480
I don’t wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

279
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,222
Don't worry about me.

280
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:13,224
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

281
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,871
Original Order of the Phoenix.

282
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,301
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,933
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

284
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,399
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

285
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,803
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,502
Neville’s parents.

287
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,080
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

288
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,636
It's been 14 years.

289
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,459
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

290
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,984
Do you really think
there’s going to be a war, Sirius?

291
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,643
It feels like it did before.

292
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,837
You keep it.

293
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:11,396
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

294
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,743
I'll see you at the train.

295
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,915
Bye-bye, darling.

296
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,360
l love you.

297
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,056
Hold my hand, lovey.

298
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,565
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

299
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,151
Bye.

300
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,101
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

301
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,914
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,159
l expect there’s a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

303
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:23,645
-What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
-Just stay away from me!

304
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:26,947
It’s only Malfoy.

305
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,616
What'd you expect?

306
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,848
Hi, guys.

307
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,623
-Hey, Neville.
-Hey there, Neville.

308
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,216
What is it?

309
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,450
-What's what?
-That. Pulling the carriage.

310
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,705
Nothing’s pulling the carriage, Harry.

311
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:18,582
It’s pulling itself, like always.

312
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,431
You're not going mad.

313
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,236
I can see them too.

314
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,059
You're just as sane as I am.

315
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,995
Everyone, this is Loony Love--

316
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,728
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,947
What an interesting necklace.

318
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,667
It's a charm, actually.

319
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,704
Keeps away the Nargles.

320
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:11,985
Hungry.

321
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,574
I hope there's pudding.

322
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,974
-What’s a Nargle?
-No idea.

323
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,530
Good evening, children.

324
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,433
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

325
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,596
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,389
...who’'ll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

327
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,915
... while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,690
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,131
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:59,101
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

331
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,749
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you--

332
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,841
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

333
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:24,354
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

334
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,638
And how lovely to see all your bright...

335
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,745
.. happy faces smiling up at me.

336
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:38,028
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

337
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,790
-That’s likely.
-That’s likely.

338
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,512
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

339
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,958
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

340
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,001
Although each headmaster...

341
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:59,697
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

342
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:07,243
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

343
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:12,097
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

344
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,801
...perfect what can be perfected...

345
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:22,201
..-and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

346
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,680
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

347
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:38,192
-Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
-What’s it mean?

348
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,358
Magic is forbidden in the corridors....

349
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,923
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

350
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,670
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,054
-Good holiday?
-All right.

352
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,648
Better than Seamus’, anyway.

353
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,274
Me mum didn’t want me
to come back this year.

354
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,627
-Why not?
-Let me see. Because of you.

355
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,424
The Daily Prophet's been saying
a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.

356
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,171
What, your mum believes them?

357
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,173
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

358
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,291
I guess you should read the Prophet, then,
like your stupid mother.

359
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,910
-Don't talk about my mother.
-l'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

360
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,702
-What’'s going on?
-He’s mad, is what's going on.

361
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,901
Do you believe the rubbish he’s come out
with about You-Know-Who?

362
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,881
Yeah. I do.

363
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,820
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

364
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,608
-You all right?
-Fine.

365
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,527
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

366
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,746
-But he'll come through, you'll see.
-l said, I'm fine, Ron.

367
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,748
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

368
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,614
Harry.

369
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,094
Bring it over here. Over here.

370
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,784
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

371
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,012
Good morning, children.

372
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:25,729
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

373
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,804
O-W-Ls.

374
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:33,304
More commonly known as OWLs.

375
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,782
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

376
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:42,132
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

377
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:52,796
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

378
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,455
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

379
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,957
...you will be following
a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...

380
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,926
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

381
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,875
There’s nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

382
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,704
Using spells?

383
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,106
Well, can’t imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

384
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,638
We're not gonna use magic?

385
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,395
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

386
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,607
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

387
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,694
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

388
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,798
It is the view of the Ministry...

389
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:34,687
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

390
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,923
...to get you through your examinations...

391
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,468
.. Which, after all,
is what school is all about.

392
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,391
And how's theory supposed to prepare us
for what's out there?

393
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,681
There is nothing out there, dear.

394
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,763
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

395
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,176
Oh, I don’t know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

396
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:06,203
Now, let me make this quite plain.

397
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,582
You have been told...

398
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:13,647
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

399
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:18,976
-This is a lie.
-It’s not a lie. saw him. I fought him.

400
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,201
Detention, Mr. Potter.

401
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,473
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

402
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,048
Cedric Diggory’s death
was a tragic accident.

403
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,411
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

404
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,137
Enough!

405
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,471
Enough.

406
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:36,631
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

407
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:02,963
Come in.

408
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:10,053
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

409
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,032
Sit.

410
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:23,328
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

411
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,607
No, not with your quill.

412
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,880
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

413
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,642
Now...

414
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:41,941
...[ want you to write,
“I must not tell lies.”

415
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,392
How many times?

416
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:51,158
Well, let’s say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

417
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,191
You haven't given me any ink.

418
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:56,877
Oh, you won't need any ink.

419
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,629
Yes?

420
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,118
-Nothing.
-That’s right.

421
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,912
Because you know, deep down...

422
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,380
..-you deserve to be punished.

423
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,706
Don’t you, Mr. Potter?

424
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,613
Go on.

425
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,846
-Skiving Snackboxes.
-Sweets that make you ill.

426
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:29,723
Get out of class whenever you like.

427
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,404
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

428
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,036
Care for another?

429
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,587
-I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
-Please.

430
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,680
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

431
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:44,087
Pll do the introduction. That's all.

432
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,785
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.

433
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:52,133
-And if I’m ever rude to you again....
-l'll know you've gone back to normal.

434
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,529
What’s wrong with your hand?

435
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:01,615
Nothing.

436
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,731
The other hand.

437
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,075
-You've got to tell Dumbledore.
-No.

438
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,397
Dumbledore’s got enough
on his mind right now.

439
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,705
I don’t want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

440
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,278
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman’s torturing you.

441
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:20,201
-lIf the parents knew about this....
-l haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

442
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,651
Harry, you've got to report this.

443
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:29,217
-It’s perfectly simple. You're being--
-No, it’s not.

444
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,310
Hermione, whatever this is,
it’s not simple.

445
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,471
You don’t understand.

446
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,029
Then help us to.

447
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,618
Dear Padfoot...

448
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:58,902
...f hope you're all right.

449
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:03,323
it's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

450
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,683
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
! feel more alone than ever.

451
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,030
i know you, of all people,
will understand.

452
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,464
Hello, Harry Potter.

453
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:58,442
-Your feet. Aren't they cold?
-Bit.

454
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,451
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

455
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,205
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

456
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,115
-What are they?
-They’re called Thestrals.

457
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:22,678
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit....

458
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:27,667
Different.

459
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,055
But why can't the others see them?

460
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:36,611
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

461
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,460
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

462
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,383
My mum.

463
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:48,432
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

464
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:52,093
..-and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

465
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,773
-l was 9.
-I'm sorry.

466
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,562
Yes, it was rather horrible.

467
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:02,692
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I’ve got Dad.

468
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,886
We both believe you, by the way.

469
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,912
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back,
and you fought him...

470
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:17,172
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

471
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:21,562
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

472
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,430
I don’t think that’s true.

473
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,713
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

474
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:30,817
What do you mean?

475
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,308
Well, if 1 were You-Know-Who...

476
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,135
...['d want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

477
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:40,142
...because if it’s just you alone...

478
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:43,362
..-you’re not as much of a threat.

479
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:05,459
-Do you ever stop eating?
-What? I’m hungry.

480
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:10,337
Harry.

481
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,390
Can I join you?

482
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,196
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

483
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,178
lam merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

484
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:25,436
..-you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

485
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,583
So silly of me, but it sounds...

486
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:31,589
..as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

487
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:33,433
...Minerva.

488
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:37,684
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

489
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,672
lam sorry, dear.

490
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:44,067
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

491
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:47,392
..and by extension, the minister himself.

492
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,345
lam a tolerant woman...

493
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:54,163
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

494
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,104
Disloyalty.

495
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,537
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

496
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:07,235
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

497
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,746
What's happened to Dumbledore?

498
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,395
Having already revolutionized...

499
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,221
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

500
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,259
.--Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...

501
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,850
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

502
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,037
Just one question, dear.

503
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:52,162
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

504
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:03,963
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

505
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,505
Yes.

506
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,468
But you were unsuccessful?

507
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,134
Obviously.

508
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:48,783
Could you please predict something
for me?

509
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:51,985
I'm sorry?

510
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,305
Move those mouths.

511
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,435
One teensy little prophecy?

512
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:15,952
Pity.

513
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:18,804
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

514
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,192
Yes, 1 do. Something dark.

515
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,712
You are in grave danger.

516
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,258
Lovely.

517
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,550
Cho. What's going on?

518
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:44,036
It's Professor Trelawney.

519
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,221
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

520
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:20,402
Hogwarts is my home.

521
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,330
You can't do this.

522
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,986
Actually, I can.

523
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,341
Something you'd like to say?

524
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:41,016
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

525
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,281
There....

526
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:01,493
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

527
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,537
Sybil, dear. This way.

528
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,313
Thank you.

529
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,212
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

530
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:15,747
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister--

531
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:19,093
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

532
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,780
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

533
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,047
That power remains with the headmaster.

534
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,535
For now.

535
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,883
Don't you all have studying to do?

536
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:39,322
Professor.

537
00:50:41,305 --> 00:50:42,265
Professor?

538
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,333
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

539
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:47,712
Professor Dumbledore.

540
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:00,496
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

541
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:05,712
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

542
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,477
She's taking over the entire school.

543
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,999
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

544
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,227
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

545
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,259
...that these disappearances
are the work...

546
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:22,767
...0f notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

547
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,284
Harry.

548
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,205
Sirius.

549
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:30,522
-What are you doing here?
-Answering your letter.

550
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,571
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

551
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,790
Training you to kill half-breeds?

552
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,803
-She’s not letting us use magic at all.
-Well, I’m not surprised.

553
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,100
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn’t want you trained in combat.

554
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,636
Combat?

555
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,819
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

556
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:49,569
That's exactly what he thinks.

557
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:53,367
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

558
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:57,278
He’s becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

559
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:01,087
The others wouldn’t want me
telling you this, Harry...

560
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,542
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

561
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,365
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

562
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:11,368
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

563
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:15,593
Voldemort is on the move.

564
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,630
Well, what can we do?

565
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:19,662
Someone's coming.

566
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:21,933
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

567
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:26,763
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

568
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:40,972
He really is out there, isn’t he?

569
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,433
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

570
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,640
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.

571
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,017
Harry.

572
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,942
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

573
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,478
I'm a nutter, remember?

574
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,750
Look on the bright side:
you can’t be any worse than old toad face.

575
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:30,578
-Thanks, Ron.
-I'm here for you, mate.

576
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,558
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

577
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:35,881
Just a couple of people.

578
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,411
Lovely spot.

579
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:48,160
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

580
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,492
Matey, come back here.

581
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:00,223
Hi.

582
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,321
So you all know why we're here.

583
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:04,921
We need a teacher.

584
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:08,677
A proper teacher.

585
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,026
One who's had experience
defending themselves against the Dark Arts.

586
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,133
-Why?
-Why?

587
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:16,328
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

588
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,124
-So he says.
-So Dumbledore says.

589
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,359
So Dumbledore says because he says.

590
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,901
The point is, where's the proof?

591
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,221
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed....

592
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:34,011
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that’s why you’re here, clear out now.

593
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,658
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

594
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,552
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

595
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:45,441
Yes.

596
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:48,344
I’ve seen it.

597
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,555
Blimey, Harry.
I didn’t know you could do that.

598
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:55,118
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore’s office.

599
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:56,873
It’s true.

600
00:54:57,194 --> 00:54:59,624
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

601
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:03,725
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

602
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,374
Wait.

603
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:10,216
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

604
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:14,071
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

605
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:18,058
I didn’t know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

606
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,752
-He’s just being modest.
-No, Hermione, I’m not.

607
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:28,855
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

608
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,480
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

609
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,374
But out there...

610
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,066
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

611
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:42,886
...or watching a friend die
tight before your eyes....

612
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,689
You don’t know what that’s like.

613
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,358
You're right, Harry, we don't.

614
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,197
That’s why we need your help.

615
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,176
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

616
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:08,751
...Voldemort....

617
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,856
He’s really back.

618
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,853
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

619
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,458
... where Umbridge won't find out.

620
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:41,696
-The Shrieking Shack.
-It’s too small.

621
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:44,742
-Forbidden Forest?
-Not bloody likely.

622
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:47,109
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

623
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,557
Who cares?

624
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:53,586
I mean, it’s sort of exciting, isn’t it,
breaking the rules?

625
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,334
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

626
00:56:57,314 --> 00:57:00,533
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

627
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,290
What's that?

628
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,527
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

629
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,283
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

630
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,319
..-with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

631
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:19,202
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there’s no chance she can find us.

632
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,446
Will do, Harry.

633
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:34,044
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

634
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:37,877
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

635
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:40,692
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

636
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:20,443
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

637
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:22,120
The what?

638
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:24,542
It’s also known as
the Come and Go Room.

639
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:28,022
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

640
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:30,945
And it's always equipped
for the seeker’s needs.

641
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,721
So say you really needed the toilet....

642
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:40,596
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

643
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:45,631
It’s brilliant. It’s like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

644
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,577
Expelliarmus.

645
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,137
I'm hopeless.

646
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,785
You're just flourishing your wand too much.
Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

647
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:16,156
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

648
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,450
...to ensure maximum retention.

649
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:23,440
-There will be no need to talk.
-No need to think’s more like it.

650
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,841
-Expelliarmus.
-Wands away.

651
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,732
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

652
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:44,239
It's a wizard’s bread and butter, really.

653
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,811
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

654
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:55,988
Stupefy!

655
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:04,964
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

656
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:12,714
Don’t worry. I'll go easy on you.

657
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,093
Thanks, Ronald.

658
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,944
-Come on, Ron.
-Come on, Ron.

659
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,903
-You can do it.
-Come on, Ron.

660
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,567
-One Sickle.
-You're on.

661
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:34,062
Stupefy.

662
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:41,633
-Thank you.
-Shut up.

663
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:46,312
Il let her do that.
It's good manners, isn’t it?

664
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,332
It was completely intentional.

665
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:19,854
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

666
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:25,992
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

667
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,780
Expelliarmus.

668
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:32,837
Very good. Keep your concentration.

669
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,567
Great.

670
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,428
A little higher.

671
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,593
I'm okay. I’m okay.

672
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:11,269
-Stupefy.
-Stupefy.

673
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:16,123
Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad
for extra credit...

674
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,220
.
.-May sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.

675
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,165
Diminuendo.

676
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:31,057
Working hard is important, but there’s
something that matters even more:

677
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,678
Believing in yourself.

678
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,987
-Expelliarmus.
-Levicorpus. Got it.

679
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,788
Think of it this way.

680
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:41,664
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

681
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,922
..as nothing more
than what we are now: students.

682
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:49,143
If they can do it, why not us?

683
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:01,223
-Stupefy.
-Expelliarmus.

684
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,812
Expelliarmus.

685
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:08,994
Expelliarmus.

686
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:15,864
Reducto.

687
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,169
-Expelliarmus.
-Expelliarmus.

688
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:34,788
Expelliarmus.

689
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,792
Expelliarmus.

690
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:47,877
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

691
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,796
So that’s it for this lesson.

692
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:55,218
Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

693
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,692
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

694
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:02,195
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

695
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,670
Well done, mate.

696
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,272
Thanks.

697
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:18,199
See you after Christmas.

698
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:29,741
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

699
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:33,770
-Thanks a lot, Harry.
-No worries.

700
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,952
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all. Merry Christmas.

701
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,788
-Thank you, Harry.
-Thank you. Merry Christmas.

702
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,884
-Merry Christmas.
-Have a good Christmas.

703
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,559
-Have a great Christmas, Luna.
-We've been thinking.

704
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,159
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

705
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,958
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils--

706
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,674
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

707
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:09,094
Are you all right? ! heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

708
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,919
Yeah. I’m okay.

709
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,369
Anyway, it’s worth it.

710
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,830
It’s just, learning all this...

711
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:28,041
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it....

712
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:31,025
Cedric did know this stuff.

713
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,038
He was really good.

714
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:37,364
It’s just, Voldemort was better.

715
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,817
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

716
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,858
I’ve never been able
to stun anything before.

717
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:58,813
Mistletoe.

718
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,225
Probably full of Nargles, though.

719
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,017
What are Nargles?

720
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:09,451
No idea.

721
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:33,618
Well, how was it?

722
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,207
Wet.

723
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,376
I mean, she was sort of crying.

724
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:40,692
That bad at it, are you?

725
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:43,497
I'm sure Harry’s kissing
was more than satisfactory.

726
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,569
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

727
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,995
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

728
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,262
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

729
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,056
Well, obviously
she’s feeling sad about Cedric...

730
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:06,343
..and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

731
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:09,730
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

732
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:13,573
..and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she’s worrying about everything.

733
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:19,095
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

734
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,542
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon....

735
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,218
Harry.

736
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,888
Voldemort may be after something.

737
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:55,566
Something he didn't have last time.

738
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:57,883
Harry.

739
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:00,786
Harry.

740
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,031
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

741
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:36,922
...or looking down at the scene?

742
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,189
Neither. It was like I....

743
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,957
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

744
01:08:43,386 --> 01:08:45,436
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

745
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,997
Make sure he’s found
by the right people.

746
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:49,827
-Sir.
-Phineas.

747
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,213
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

748
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,972
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

749
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:59,125
..and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

750
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:02,491
They've got him, Albus.
It was close, but they think he'll make it.

751
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,259
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

752
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:07,412
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to--

753
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,860
Look at me!

754
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,478
What’s happening to me?

755
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:27,268
You wished to see me, headmaster?

756
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:31,974
Oh, Severus. I’m afraid we can’t wait.
Not even till the morning.

757
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:35,519
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

758
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,042
It appears there’s a connection...

759
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:44,462
...between the Dark Lord’s mind
and your own.

760
01:09:44,913 --> 01:09:48,573
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

761
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:52,112
Pray he remains ignorant.

762
01:09:52,654 --> 01:09:55,525
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

763
01:09:56,392 --> 01:10:00,262
-...he'll be able to read my mind?
-Read it, control it...

764
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,603
...unhinge it.

765
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:05,959
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

766
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:08,496
...to invade the minds of his victims...

767
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:12,098
..creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

768
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:17,896
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

769
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:22,398
..-only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

770
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:24,166
..-kill them.

771
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:27,428
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

772
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,960
..-Will help shield you
from access or influence.

773
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:35,750
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

774
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,619
You will attempt to resist.

775
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:41,559
Prepare yourself.

776
01:10:44,474 --> 01:10:45,554
Legilimens.

777
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,976
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

778
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,742
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

779
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:28,489
Here we go.

780
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:30,884
Daddy's back.

781
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:37,513
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

782
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,967
-And a nice big box for Ron.
-Big box for you. And....

783
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,231
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

784
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,690
-l want to see your faces.
-Yes.

785
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,249
-Try it on.
-Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

786
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:56,487
-Just what he wanted, actually.
-Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

787
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,700
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

788
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:01,996
Oh, Harry, Harry.

789
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,088
There you are.

790
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,931
-Happy Christmas.
-Thank you.

791
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,363
-Lovely to have you with us.
-Thank you.

792
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:11,489
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

793
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,414
-Thank you.
-Has everybody got?

794
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:14,996
Fred? George?

795
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,551
-Hermione.
-A Christmas toast.

796
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:19,674
To Mr. Harry Potter...

797
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:23,427
...without whom I would not be here.

798
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,393
-Harry.
-Harry.

799
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:30,925
Harry.

800
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:34,361
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

801
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,931
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

802
01:12:38,154 --> 01:12:40,554
I can’t understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

803
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,968
l look like a bloody idiot, that’s why.

804
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,969
No more than usual, Ron.

805
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,005
I don't know why....

806
01:12:54,237 --> 01:12:58,277
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.

807
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:03,168
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

808
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:06,543
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

809
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,630
-lf my poor mistress only knew....
-Kreacher!

810
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:12,608
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

811
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,872
Of course, master.

812
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:19,421
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

813
01:13:22,298 --> 01:13:23,968
Sorry about that.

814
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,987
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

815
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:30,611
Not to me, anyway.

816
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,407
What, you grew up here?

817
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:35,799
This is my parents’ house.

818
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,782
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

819
01:13:41,384 --> 01:13:44,254
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

820
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:48,135
This is the Black family tree.

821
01:13:49,325 --> 01:13:51,195
My deranged cousin.

822
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,027
I hated the lot of them.

823
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:58,660
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

824
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,778
My mother did that after I ran away.

825
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,217
Charming woman.

826
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:13,144
I was 16.

827
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,443
Where did you go?

828
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:18,797
Round your dad's.

829
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,676
l was always welcome at the Potters’.

830
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:26,293
l see him so much in you, Harry.

831
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:29,193
You are so very much alike.

832
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,129
I'm not so sure.

833
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:34,696
Sirius, when I was....

834
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:41,687
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

835
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:44,719
l was the snake.

836
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:48,327
And afterwards, in Dumbledore’s office...

837
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:52,540
...there was a moment
when I wanted to--

838
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:00,714
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

839
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:04,891
What if the reason for it
is that 1 am becoming more like him?

840
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:10,979
I just feel so angry all the time.

841
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:15,751
And what if, after everything
that I’ve been through...

842
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:19,609
...something’s gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

843
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:25,525
l want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

844
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,732
You're not a bad person.

845
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:34,766
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

846
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:36,888
You understand?

847
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,555
Besides, the world isn’t split
into good people and Death Eaters.

848
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:48,260
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

849
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,415
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

850
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,770
That's who we really are.

851
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,340
Harry, time to go.

852
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:08,076
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

853
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:10,164
You'll see.

854
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,700
Come on.

855
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:51,326
Really?

856
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,950
Harry. Harry.

857
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,143
Hagrid’s back.

858
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:00,924
I'm sorry.

859
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:18,143
I will say this one last time.

860
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:20,914
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

861
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:24,030
Il told you. I've been away for me health.

862
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,400
-Your health?
-Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

863
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:33,328
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

864
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:38,141
If l were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

865
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:41,491
In fact, ! mightn’t bother
unpacking at all.

866
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,563
This is top-secret, right?

867
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:06,927
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

868
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:08,693
Giants?

869
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:10,989
You found them?

870
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:14,717
Well, they're not that hard to find,
to be perfectly honest. They’re so big, see?

871
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:18,718
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

872
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,631
But I wasn’t the only one
that was trying to win them over.

873
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:24,335
-Death Eaters?
-Yes.

874
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,964
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

875
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,951
-Did they?
-l gave them Dumbledore’s message.

876
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:35,007
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.

877
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:40,254
And they did this to you?

878
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,666
Not exactly, no.

879
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:46,815
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

880
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,140
It’s changing out there.

881
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:05,209
Just like last time.

882
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,305
There's a storm coming, Harry.

883
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,934
We'd all best be ready when she does.

884
01:19:49,318 --> 01:19:51,978
We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...

885
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:55,010
...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.

886
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:58,744
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.

887
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:01,201
We strongly suspect...

888
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:04,048
...that the breakout was engineered...

889
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:08,156
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

890
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:12,557
..-notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

891
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:18,350
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

892
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,211
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

893
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,440
He’s gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

894
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:35,987
Harry.

895
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,585
I wanted to apologize.

896
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:46,098
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don’t add up.

897
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:51,964
So, what I’m really trying to say
is that I believe you.

898
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,021
Neville?

899
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,672
Fourteen years ago...

900
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:19,855
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

901
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:23,352
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

902
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:27,793
She tortured them for information...

903
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,349
...but they never gave in.

904
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,477
I'm quite proud to be their son.

905
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:39,157
But I’m not sure
I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.

906
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:49,197
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

907
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:57,192
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

908
01:21:57,813 --> 01:22:00,833
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

909
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,647
George, your turn now.

910
01:22:04,186 --> 01:22:06,206
Expecto Patronum.

911
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:10,443
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

912
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:14,396
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

913
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,110
Wow, that was really good.

914
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,335
Fantastic, Ginny.

915
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,240
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

916
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:24,925
So focus, Luna.

917
01:22:28,911 --> 01:22:30,401
Think of the happiest thing you can.

918
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,509
Expecto Patronum.

919
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:35,435
-I'm trying.
-l know. It’s good.

920
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:39,701
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

921
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,066
Expecto Patronum.

922
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,420
Pll make short work of this.

923
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:30,821
Bombarda Maxima.

924
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:50,558
Get them.

925
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:52,449
Been watching them for weeks.

926
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,494
And see, "Dumbledore’s Army”...

927
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:58,413
...proof of what I've been telling you
tight from the beginning, Cornelius.

928
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:02,045
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

929
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:03,811
...-never fooled us for a minute.

930
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:05,982
We saw your lies for what they were:

931
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:09,778
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

932
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:11,282
Naturally.

933
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,800
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

934
01:24:14,283 --> 01:24:17,503
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

935
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:22,370
...the parchment clearly says
“Dumbledore’s Army," not "Potter's."

936
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:25,435
l instructed Harry
to form this organization.

937
01:24:25,928 --> 01:24:28,968
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

938
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,174
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

939
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,787
If we hurry,
we should still make the morning edition.

940
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:38,489
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

941
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:40,501
...to Azkaban...

942
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:46,450
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

943
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:49,829
I thought we might hit this little snag.

944
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:54,373
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I’m going to--

945
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:56,617
What was the phrase?

946
01:24:56,959 --> 01:24:58,358
--come quietly.

947
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:00,217
Well, I can tell you this:

948
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:02,882
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

949
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:04,442
Enough of this.

950
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,060
Take him.

951
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:22,887
Well, you may not like him, minister...

952
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:25,455
...but you can't deny...

953
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,654
...Dumbledore has got style.

954
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:57,151
Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.

955
01:25:57,886 --> 01:26:00,906
Those wishing to join
the inquisitorial Squad for extra credit....

956
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:05,910
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

957
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:10,474
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

958
01:27:22,204 --> 01:27:23,603
Harry.

959
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:33,736
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

960
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:36,396
Even Dumbledore
didn’t see this coming.

961
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,486
Harry, if it's anyone’s fault, it’s ours.

962
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,761
Yeah, we talked you into it.

963
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,919
Yeah, but I agreed.

964
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:48,356
I tried so hard to help,
and all it’s done is make things worse.

965
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:53,039
Anyway, that doesn’t matter anymore.

966
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:58,092
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

967
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:01,114
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

968
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:04,389
-So maybe it’s just better to....
-To what?

969
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:08,715
To go it alone.

970
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,750
Hagrid.

971
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:22,835
Any idea where he’s taking us?

972
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,987
Hagrid, why can’t you just tell us?

973
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:37,016
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

974
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:39,762
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

975
01:28:41,016 --> 01:28:43,066
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

976
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:45,448
... they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

977
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,347
Hagrid, what's going on?

978
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:49,682
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

979
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:54,485
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

980
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:58,509
.. [Il likely be getting the sack
any day now.

981
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:02,137
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

982
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:08,205
Grawpy.

983
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,652
Down here, you great buffoon.

984
01:29:19,254 --> 01:29:20,744
Grawpy.

985
01:29:21,723 --> 01:29:23,213
Brought you some company.

986
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,760
I couldn't just leave him, because--

987
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,726
Because he’s my brother.

988
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:41,098
Blimey.

989
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:43,188
Well, half brother, really.

990
01:29:43,612 --> 01:29:48,242
He’s completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.

991
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:53,069
-Grawpy, that is not polite.
-Hagrid, do something.

992
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:55,630
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

993
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:58,081
That's your new friend, Hermione.

994
01:29:58,526 --> 01:29:59,666
Grawpy.

995
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,182
Grawp.

996
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:10,058
Put me down.

997
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:15,479
Now.

998
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:28,782
You all right?

999
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:31,685
Fine.

1000
01:30:32,294 --> 01:30:34,314
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1001
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,873
I think you've got an admirer.

1002
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:41,567
You just stay away from her, all right?

1003
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:14,366
He gets his own food and all.

1004
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:18,660
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1005
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:22,335
You will look after him, won't you?

1006
01:31:23,111 --> 01:31:25,481
I'm the only family he’s got.

1007
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:41,034
Feeling sentimental?

1008
01:31:44,532 --> 01:31:47,902
-That’s private.
-Not to me.

1009
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:51,740
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1010
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:57,389
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1011
01:31:57,946 --> 01:32:01,576
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1012
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:05,241
You're just like your father.

1013
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,267
Lazy, arrogant.

1014
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:09,615
-Don’t say a word against my father.
-Weak.

1015
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:11,958
-I’m not weak.
-Then prove it.

1016
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:14,561
Control your emotions.

1017
01:32:14,963 --> 01:32:17,543
Discipline your mind.

1018
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:21,785
Legilimens.

1019
01:32:29,144 --> 01:32:30,104
Harry.

1020
01:32:30,412 --> 01:32:31,932
Sirius.

1021
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:33,984
fi may vomit.

1022
01:32:34,449 --> 01:32:35,348
Stop it.

1023
01:32:36,618 --> 01:32:38,638
Is this what you call control?

1024
01:32:39,421 --> 01:32:42,111
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1025
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:45,647
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1026
01:32:47,695 --> 01:32:49,365
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1027
01:32:49,764 --> 01:32:53,244
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

1028
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:56,862
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn’t fair.

1029
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:00,919
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1030
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:04,236
-My father was a great man.
-Your father was a swine.

1031
01:33:05,647 --> 01:33:06,957
-Legilimens.
-Protego.

1032
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,060
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1033
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,232
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1034
01:33:16,658 --> 01:33:18,268
Nice one, James.

1035
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:20,880
-Dad.
-impedimenta.

1036
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:23,079
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1037
01:33:23,498 --> 01:33:25,838
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly’s trousers?

1038
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:28,324
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1039
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:29,820
Enough.

1040
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,339
Enough.

1041
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:44,330
Your lessons are at an end.

1042
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:45,809
[--

1043
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:48,991
Get out.

1044
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:08,508
-What's your name?
-Michael.

1045
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:10,613
Your hand’s gonna be fine, Michael.

1046
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:13,672
Yeah. It’s not as bad as it seems. See?

1047
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:15,995
It’s fading already.

1048
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:20,577
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1049
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:30,929
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1050
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:34,742
. naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1051
01:34:38,273 --> 01:34:39,443
You know, George...

1052
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:42,994
...[’ve always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1053
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:47,621
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1054
01:36:00,121 --> 01:36:01,581
All right, professor!

1055
01:36:10,565 --> 01:36:12,115
Here you go.

1056
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,902
Ready when you are.

1057
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:07,749
I need that prophecy.

1058
01:38:08,316 --> 01:38:09,896
You'll have to kill me.

1059
01:38:10,985 --> 01:38:14,995
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1060
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,213
Crucio.

1061
01:38:19,961 --> 01:38:21,511
Crucio.

1062
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:34,397
Sirius.

1063
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:35,612
Harry, are you sure?

1064
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,080
Il saw it. It’s just like with Mr. Weasley.

1065
01:38:38,546 --> 01:38:40,186
It’s the door I’ve been dreaming about.

1066
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,391
I couldn’t remember
where I'd seen it before.

1067
01:38:42,817 --> 01:38:44,517
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1068
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:47,818
Something he didn’t have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.

1069
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:50,089
Harry, please, just listen.

1070
01:38:51,826 --> 01:38:53,576
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1071
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:57,879
What if he’s only hurting Sirius
because he’s trying to get to you?

1072
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:01,503
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1073
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:05,173
Hermione,
he’s the only family I’ve got left.

1074
01:39:08,209 --> 01:39:09,079
What do we do?

1075
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:12,041
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1076
01:39:12,413 --> 01:39:14,223
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1077
01:39:14,649 --> 01:39:16,019
Not all of them.

1078
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:20,190
Alohomora.

1079
01:39:31,599 --> 01:39:33,089
Alert the Order if you can.

1080
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:36,598
-Are you mental? We're going with you.
-It’s too dangerous.

1081
01:39:37,205 --> 01:39:40,394
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1082
01:39:41,008 --> 01:39:43,848
That you are.

1083
01:39:44,412 --> 01:39:46,932
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1084
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:54,126
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?

1085
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:56,335
-No.
-Liar.

1086
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:59,246
-You sent for me, headmistress?
-Snape, yes.

1087
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,800
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1088
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,004
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1089
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:07,916
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1090
01:40:08,436 --> 01:40:11,186
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1091
01:40:15,643 --> 01:40:16,933
Unless you wish to poison him--

1092
01:40:17,278 --> 01:40:21,178
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1093
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:24,016
--l cannot help you.

1094
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,177
He’s got Padfoot.

1095
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:32,492
He’s got Padfoot at the place
where it’s hidden.

1096
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:35,264
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1097
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,036
What is he talking about, Snape?

1098
01:40:43,905 --> 01:40:45,655
No idea.

1099
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:51,781
Very well.

1100
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,030
You give me no choice, Potter.

1101
01:40:55,683 --> 01:40:58,293
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1102
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:00,629
...you leave me with...

1103
01:41:01,622 --> 01:41:03,352
..no alternative.

1104
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:06,322
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1105
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:07,631
That's illegal.

1106
01:41:07,929 --> 01:41:10,889
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1107
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:20,146
Tell her, Harry!

1108
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:23,102
Tell me what?

1109
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:26,228
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1110
01:41:27,148 --> 01:41:28,698
- el will,

1111
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:32,131
Where what is?

1112
01:41:33,554 --> 01:41:35,574
Dumbledore’s secret weapon.

1113
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:42,201
How much further?

1114
01:41:42,563 --> 01:41:44,023
Not far.

1115
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:49,483
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1116
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:55,565
What are you doing?

1117
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:57,490
Improvising.

1118
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,620
Well?

1119
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:10,992
Where is this weapon?

1120
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:18,152
There isn't one, is there?

1121
01:42:21,202 --> 01:42:23,102
You were trying to trick me.

1122
01:42:27,575 --> 01:42:28,945
You know...

1123
01:42:30,544 --> 01:42:32,324
...L really hate children.

1124
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:52,062
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1125
01:42:55,269 --> 01:42:56,729
Lower your weapons.

1126
01:42:57,104 --> 01:43:01,964
I warn you, under the law,
as creatures of near-human intelligence....

1127
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:03,890
Protego.

1128
01:43:04,311 --> 01:43:05,300
How dare you?

1129
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,420
Filthy half-breed.

1130
01:43:08,382 --> 01:43:09,251
incarcerous.

1131
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:24,875
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1132
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:29,466
Now, enough. I will have order.

1133
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:41,129
You filthy animal.

1134
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:44,224
Do you know who I am?

1135
01:43:44,752 --> 01:43:47,242
Leave him alone. It’s not his fault.

1136
01:43:47,755 --> 01:43:49,395
No, he doesn’t understand.

1137
01:43:57,298 --> 01:44:00,338
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1138
01:44:00,935 --> 01:44:02,635
I'm sorry, professor.

1139
01:44:03,037 --> 01:44:04,617
But I must not tell lies.

1140
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:05,875
What are you doing?

1141
01:44:06,173 --> 01:44:09,543
lam Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1142
01:44:10,478 --> 01:44:12,408
Let me go!

1143
01:44:15,349 --> 01:44:16,929
Thank you, Grawp.

1144
01:44:17,318 --> 01:44:20,388
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1145
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:32,226
-How’'d you get away?
-Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1146
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:34,702
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1147
01:44:35,136 --> 01:44:37,386
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1148
01:44:38,539 --> 01:44:39,849
That was clever, Ron.

1149
01:44:40,875 --> 01:44:43,065
-Has been known to happen.
-It was brilliant.

1150
01:44:43,544 --> 01:44:45,124
So how are we getting to London?

1151
01:44:46,714 --> 01:44:49,814
Look, it’s not that 1 don’t appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1152
01:44:51,085 --> 01:44:53,455
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1153
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:56,563
Dumbledore’s Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1154
01:44:57,258 --> 01:44:59,128
Or was that all just words to you?

1155
01:45:01,262 --> 01:45:04,072
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1156
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:11,269
So how are we going to get to London?

1157
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:14,900
We fly, of course.

1158
01:46:06,227 --> 01:46:08,126
Department of Mysteries.

1159
01:46:17,238 --> 01:46:18,728
This is it.

1160
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:13,976
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1161
01:47:15,963 --> 01:47:17,163
Ninety-four.

1162
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:19,499
Ninety-five.

1163
01:47:32,179 --> 01:47:34,609
-He should be here.
-Harry.

1164
01:47:37,651 --> 01:47:38,791
It’s got your name on it.

1165
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:07,984
The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1166
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:11,490
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...

1167
01:48:11,952 --> 01:48:14,412
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1168
01:48:20,394 --> 01:48:25,114
For neither can live
while the other survives.

1169
01:48:28,268 --> 01:48:29,228
Harry.

1170
01:48:39,847 --> 01:48:41,157
Where's Sirius?

1171
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:45,995
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1172
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:51,423
...and reality.

1173
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,300
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1174
01:48:58,599 --> 01:48:59,909
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1175
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:02,107
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1176
01:49:05,139 --> 01:49:07,389
He knows how to play.

1177
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:11,215
Itty, bitty baby.

1178
01:49:11,845 --> 01:49:12,925
Potter.

1179
01:49:13,614 --> 01:49:15,284
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1180
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:18,262
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1181
01:49:18,786 --> 01:49:20,426
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

1182
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:27,710
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1183
01:49:28,762 --> 01:49:30,072
... shall we?

1184
01:49:30,431 --> 01:49:32,601
All we want is that prophecy.

1185
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:34,997
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1186
01:49:35,436 --> 01:49:36,866
You dare speak his name?

1187
01:49:38,605 --> 01:49:40,004
You filthy half-blood!

1188
01:49:40,374 --> 01:49:42,654
It’s all right.
He’s just a curious lad, aren't you?

1189
01:49:44,912 --> 01:49:49,712
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1190
01:49:50,551 --> 01:49:52,951
Which is lucky for you, really.

1191
01:49:57,057 --> 01:49:58,757
Haven't you always wondered...

1192
01:49:59,493 --> 01:50:04,063
...what was the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1193
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:07,621
Why he was unable to kill you...

1194
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:10,322
...when you were just an infant?

1195
01:50:12,005 --> 01:50:16,225
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1196
01:50:17,744 --> 01:50:21,614
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1197
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:25,100
All you have to do...

1198
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:27,619
.. is give it to me.

1199
01:50:28,155 --> 01:50:31,054
Then I can show you everything.

1200
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,780
I've waited 14 years.

1201
01:50:42,603 --> 01:50:43,743
I know.

1202
01:50:45,205 --> 01:50:47,785
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.

1203
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:49,568
Stupefy.

1204
01:51:05,893 --> 01:51:06,763
Levicorpus.

1205
01:51:13,433 --> 01:51:15,213
Petrificus Totalus.

1206
01:51:15,636 --> 01:51:17,216
Well done, Neville.

1207
01:51:25,879 --> 01:51:27,249
Stupefy.

1208
01:51:29,183 --> 01:51:30,263
-Stupefy.
-Stupefy.

1209
01:51:41,562 --> 01:51:43,232
Stupefy.

1210
01:51:51,004 --> 01:51:53,024
Reducto.

1211
01:52:09,323 --> 01:52:11,163
Get back to the door.

1212
01:52:46,727 --> 01:52:50,677
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn’t they?

1213
01:52:56,436 --> 01:52:58,106
The voices.

1214
01:52:58,905 --> 01:53:00,684
Can you tell what they’re saying?

1215
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,509
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1216
01:53:05,512 --> 01:53:07,062
Let’s get out of here.

1217
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:08,847
I hear them too.

1218
01:53:12,152 --> 01:53:14,462
Harry, it’s just an empty archway.

1219
01:53:17,557 --> 01:53:18,786
Please, Harry.

1220
01:53:19,726 --> 01:53:21,366
Get behind me.

1221
01:54:08,141 --> 01:54:10,510
Did you actually believe...

1222
01:54:11,011 --> 01:54:15,051
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1223
01:54:16,216 --> 01:54:20,726
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1224
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:28,138
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1225
01:54:32,299 --> 01:54:35,229
Give me the prophecy now...

1226
01:54:35,802 --> 01:54:39,312
..-or watch your friends die.

1227
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:53,949
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1228
01:55:20,414 --> 01:55:22,844
Get away from my godson.

1229
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,559
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1230
01:55:56,216 --> 01:55:57,826
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1231
01:55:58,218 --> 01:56:00,708
You've done beautifully.

1232
01:56:01,688 --> 01:56:03,148
Now, let me take it from here.

1233
01:56:03,523 --> 01:56:04,393
Black.

1234
01:56:31,685 --> 01:56:32,855
Expelliarmus!

1235
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:34,356
Nice one, James.

1236
01:56:41,761 --> 01:56:43,051
Avada Kedavra.

1237
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:05,470
No. No.

1238
01:57:29,709 --> 01:57:32,049
I killed Sirius Black.

1239
01:57:33,346 --> 01:57:35,075
-You coming to get me?
-Crucio.

1240
01:57:47,661 --> 01:57:50,411
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1241
01:57:50,964 --> 01:57:54,274
She killed him. She deserves it.

1242
01:57:58,572 --> 01:58:01,382
You know the spell, Harry.

1243
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:14,750
Do it.

1244
01:58:22,629 --> 01:58:25,239
So weak.

1245
01:58:32,372 --> 01:58:35,182
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1246
01:58:35,742 --> 01:58:37,262
The Aurors are on their way.

1247
01:58:37,644 --> 01:58:41,334
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

1248
01:58:43,383 --> 01:58:45,223
... shall be dead.

1249
02:00:59,786 --> 02:01:01,456
You've lost, old man.

1250
02:01:21,841 --> 02:01:22,711
Harry.

1251
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:28,290
So weak.

1252
02:01:28,982 --> 02:01:30,942
So vulnerable.

1253
02:01:35,522 --> 02:01:36,392
Look at me.

1254
02:01:39,058 --> 02:01:42,778
Harry, it isn’t how you are alike.

1255
02:01:43,463 --> 02:01:45,652
It's how you are not.

1256
02:01:50,904 --> 02:01:52,214
Harry?

1257
02:02:24,804 --> 02:02:26,094
You're the weak one...

1258
02:02:26,873 --> 02:02:30,503
..-and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1259
02:02:34,414 --> 02:02:36,964
And I feel sorry for you.

1260
02:03:00,373 --> 02:03:03,413
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1261
02:03:04,777 --> 02:03:09,287
And you will lose everything.

1262
02:03:24,864 --> 02:03:26,324
He’s back.

1263
02:04:34,267 --> 02:04:35,727
I know how you feel, Harry.

1264
02:04:36,102 --> 02:04:37,501
No, you don't.

1265
02:04:43,343 --> 02:04:44,572
It's my fault.

1266
02:04:44,911 --> 02:04:47,781
No, the fault is mine.

1267
02:04:49,182 --> 02:04:50,732
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1268
02:04:51,117 --> 02:04:53,807
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.

1269
02:04:54,988 --> 02:04:58,738
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...

1270
02:04:59,425 --> 02:05:04,025
...he’d be less tempted,
and therefore you might be more protected.

1271
02:05:07,467 --> 02:05:10,397
The prophecy said:

1272
02:05:11,404 --> 02:05:14,884
“Neither one can live
while the other one survives.”

1273
02:05:16,709 --> 02:05:22,039
It means one of us
is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.

1274
02:05:24,784 --> 02:05:26,154
Yes.

1275
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:28,189
Why didn't you tell me?

1276
02:05:28,554 --> 02:05:31,714
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1277
02:05:32,325 --> 02:05:34,465
The same reason your friends saved you.

1278
02:05:35,595 --> 02:05:38,695
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1279
02:05:39,298 --> 02:05:41,848
...[ didn’t want to cause you
.
any more pain.

1280
02:05:43,669 --> 02:05:45,539
l cared too much about you.

1281
02:06:10,663 --> 02:06:12,683
How come you're not at the feast?

1282
02:06:13,132 --> 02:06:17,142
Lost all my possessions.
Apparently people have been hiding them.

1283
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:18,740
That's awful.

1284
02:06:19,038 --> 02:06:20,708
Oh, it’s all good fun.

1285
02:06:21,107 --> 02:06:24,147
But as it’s the last night,
l really do need them back.

1286
02:06:24,744 --> 02:06:26,824
Do you want any help finding them?

1287
02:06:30,016 --> 02:06:32,826
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1288
02:06:40,259 --> 02:06:42,069
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1289
02:06:42,495 --> 02:06:43,955
That's all right.

1290
02:06:44,330 --> 02:06:46,230
Anyway, my mum always said...

1291
02:06:46,666 --> 02:06:50,066
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1292
02:06:53,773 --> 02:06:56,643
If not always in the way we expect.

1293
02:06:58,544 --> 02:07:00,914
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1294
02:07:36,916 --> 02:07:39,466
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1295
02:07:39,986 --> 02:07:41,476
What's that?

1296
02:07:42,288 --> 02:07:44,718
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1297
02:07:45,224 --> 02:07:47,944
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn’t have.

1298
02:07:48,494 --> 02:07:49,804
Yeah?

1299
02:07:51,898 --> 02:07:53,978
Something worth fighting for.

1300
02:18:09,348 --> 02:18:11,098
