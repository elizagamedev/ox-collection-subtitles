1
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:28,784
Grandpa!

2
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,499
You're not supposed to be up here,
looking at that.

3
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,367
I just wanted to know.

4
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,973
Well, you're old enough, I suppose.

5
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,597
You should know the story.

6
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,561
OK, here we go.

7
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,530
It was 1832.

8
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,819
On a night much like this.

9
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:07,662
Charles Carroll was the last surviving
signer of the Declaration of Independence.

10
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,476
He was also a member
of a secret society known as the Masons.

11
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,113
And he knew he was dying.

12
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,427
He woke up his stable boy
in the middle of the night

13
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,936
and ordered him to take him to
the White House to see Andrew Jackson.
a

14
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:27,328
because it was urgent
that he speak to the president.

15
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,085
Did he talk to him?

16
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,231
No. He never got the chance.

17
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,764
The president wasn't there that night.

18
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,304
But Charles Carroll had a secret.

19
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,481
So he took into his confidence
the one person he could,

20
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,675
my grandfather's grandfather,

21
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,441
Thomas Gates.

22
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,667
What was the secret?

23
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,612
A treasure.

24
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,629
A treasure beyond all imagining.

25
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,866
A treasure that had been
fought over for centuries

26
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:13,192
by tyrants, pharaohs,
emperors, warlords.

27
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,096
And every time it changed hands
it grew larger.

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,750
And then suddenly...

29
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,243
it vanished.

30
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,117
It didn't reappear
for more than a thousand years,

31
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,187
when knights from the First Crusade

32
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,499
discovered secret vaults
beneath the Temple of Solomon.

33
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,202
You see, the knights who found the vaults

34
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,485
believed that the treasure
was too great for any one man -

35
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,840
not even a king.

36
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:50,697
They brought the treasure back to Europe
and took the name "the Knights Templar.”

37
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,657
Over the next century
they smuggled it out of Europe

38
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,684
and they formed a new brotherhood
called the Freemasons.
a

39
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,567
in honor of
the builders of the great temple.

40
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,587
War followed.

41
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:09,326
By the time of the American Revolution
the treasure had been hidden again.

42
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,783
By then the Masons included

43
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,749
George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere.

44
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,870
They knew they had to make sure

45
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:22,179
the treasure would never fall
into the hands of the British.

46
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:26,292
So they devised a series of clues
and maps to its location.

47
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,357
Over time the clues were lost or forgotten,

48
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,700
until only one remained -

49
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,308
and that was the secret that Charles Carroll
entrusted to young Thomas Gates.

50
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,017
Charlotte.

51
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,059
"The secret lies with Charlotte.”

52
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,736
Who's Charlotte?

53
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,275
Oh, not even Mr. Carroll knew that.
a

54
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,406
Now look here, Ben.
a

55
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,597
The Freemasons
among our Founding Fathers left us clues.

56
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,512
Like these.

57
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,640
The unfinished pyramid.
The all-seeing eye.

58
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:11,294
Symbols of the Knights Templar,
guardians of the treasure.

59
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:17,059
- They're speaking to us through these.
- You mean laughing at us.

60
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,241
You know what that dollar represents?

61
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,933
The entire Gates family fortune.

62
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,193
Six generations of fools...
chasing after fool's gold.

63
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,813
It's not about the money, Patrick.
It's never been about the money.

64
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,198
Come on, son. Time to go.

65
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,530
You can... say your goodbyes.

66
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,774
Grandpa?

67
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,639
Are we knights?

68
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,027
Do you want to be?

69
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,429
All right. Um... kneel.

70
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,174
Benjamin Franklin Gates,

71
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:18,393
you take upon yourself the duty
of the Templars, the Freemasons

72
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,724
and the family Gates.

73
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,628
Do you so swear?

74
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,701
Iso swear.

75
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,656
l was thinking about
Henson and Peary,

76
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:56,052
crossing this kind of terrain with nothing
more than dog sleds and on foot.

77
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,993
- Can you imagine?
- It's extraordinary.

78
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,142
We getting closer?

79
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,969
Assuming Ben's theory's correct
and my tracking model's accurate,

80
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,931
we should be getting very close.

81
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,524
But clon't go by me -
l broke a shoelace this morning.

82
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,457
- It's... it's a bad omen.
- Shall we turn around and go home?

83
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,728
Or we could pull over
and just throw him out here.

84
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,063
OK.

85
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,474
Riley, you're not missing that little
windowless cubicle we found you in?

86
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,858
No, no. Absolutely not.

87
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,731
Why are we stopping?
I thought we were looking for a ship.

88
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,684
- [don't see any ship.
- She's out there.

89
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,499
Look... this is a waste of time.

90
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,656
How could a ship wind up way out here?

91
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,849
Well, I'm no expert, but...

92
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,052
it could be that the hydrothermic properties
of this region

93
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,815
produce hurricane-force ice storms

94
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,778
that cause the ocean to freeze
and then melt and then refreeze.
a

95
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,445
resulting in a semisolid
migrating land mass

96
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:40,303
that would land a ship right around here.

97
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,349
Hello, beautiful.
a

98
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,803
Have Viktor
check the fuel in the generators.

99
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:47,992
Two years ago, if you hadn't shown up,
hadn't believed the treasure was real.
a

100
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,675
I don't know
if lever would have found Charlotte.

101
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,484
You would have found it. l have no doubt.
a

102
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,763
That's why I didn't think it was
as crazy an investment as everyone said.

103
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,321
I'm just relieved that I'm not as crazy
as everyone says. Or said my dad was.

104
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,989
Or my granddad. Or my great-granddad.

105
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,621
OK!

106
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,718
Let's go!

107
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,255
- Let's go find some treasure.
- Yeah, bring us back something.

108
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,515
Oh, God!
a

109
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,337
You handled that well.

110
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,740
This is it.

111
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,169
It's the cargo hold.

112
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,142
Do you think it's in the barrels?

113
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,732
Gunpowder.

114
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,573
OK...

115
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,165
Why would the captain
be guarding this barrel?

116
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,458
I found something!

117
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,033
What is it?

118
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,729
Do you guys know what this is?

119
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,492
ls it a billion-dollar pipe?

120
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,582
It's a meerschaum pipe.
Ah. that is beautiful.
a

121
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,069
Look at the intricacy of the scrollwork
on the stem.

122
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,239
- Is it a million-dollar pipe?
- No. it's a clue.
a

123
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,250
Let me see that.

124
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,551
No, don't break it!
a

125
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,203
We are one step closer to the treasure,
gentlemen.

126
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,906
Ben, I thought you said that
the treasure would be on the Charlotte.

127
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,489
No, "The secret lies with Charlotte.”
a

128
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,708
I said it could be here.

129
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,162
It's Templar symbols.

130
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,742
"The legend writ.”

131
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,935
"The stain effected.”

132
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,987
"The key in Silence undetected.”

133
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,567
"Fifty-five in iron pen.”

134
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,118
"Mr. Matlack can't offend.”

135
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,944
It's a riddle.

136
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,872
I need to think.

137
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,371
"The legend writ.”

138
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,443
"The stain effected.”

139
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,313
What legend?

140
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:30,376
There's the legend of the Templar treasure,
and the stain effects the legend.

141
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,780
How?

142
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,246
"The key in Silence undetected.”

143
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,292
Wait.

144
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,985
The legend and the key...
Now there's something.

145
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,839
A map.

146
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,544
Maps have legends, maps have keys.

147
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,883
It's a map, an invisible map.
So now...

148
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,473
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
"invisible" - "an invisible map"?

149
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,773
"The stain effected”
could refer to a dye or a reagent

150
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,614
used to bring about a certain result.

151
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,520
Combined with
"The key in Silence undetected,”

152
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:08,326
the implication is that the effect is to make
what was undetectable detectable.

153
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,365
Unless...
"The key in Silence” could be...

154
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,166
Prison.

155
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,803
Albuquerque.

156
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,365
See, I can do it too.
a
Snorkel.

157
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,184
That's where the map is.
Like he said, "Fifty-five in iron pen.”

158
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,880
"Iron pen” is a prison.

159
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:30,905
Or it could be, since the primary writing
medium of the time was iron gall ink,

160
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,211
the "pen’ is... just a pen.

161
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,534
But then why not say a pen?
Why... why say “iron pen"?

162
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,715
‘Cause it's a prison.

163
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,671
Wait a minute. "Iron pen” - the “iron”
does not describe the ink in the pen,

164
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,536
it describes what was penned.

165
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,819
It was "iron" -
it was firm. it was mineral...
a

166
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,746
No, no, no, that's stupid.

167
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:59,820
It was... It was firm.
a
it was adamant. it was resolved.
a

168
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,011
It was resolved.

169
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,781
"Mr. Matlack can't offend.”

170
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,319
Timothy Matlack was the official scribe
of the Continental Congress.

171
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:14,646
Calligrapher, not writer. And to make sure
he could not offend the map,

172
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,581
it was put on the back of a resolution
that he transcribed.
a

173
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,571
a resolution that 55 men signed.

174
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,305
The Declaration of Independence.

175
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,194
Come on, there's no invisible map on the
back of the Declaration of Independence.

176
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,989
That's clever, really.
A document of that importance

177
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,328
would ensure the map’s survival.

178
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,130
And you said there were several Masons
signed it, yeah?

179
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,410
Yeah. Nine. for sure.
a

180
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,248
We'll have to arrange a way to examine it.

181
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,588
This is one of the most important
documents in history.

182
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,891
They're not just gonna let us waltz in there
and run chemical tests on it.

183
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,739
- Then what do you propose we do?
- [don't know!

184
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,796
We could borrow it.

185
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,781
Steal it?

186
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,014
- don't think so.
- Ben...

187
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,478
the treasure of the Knights Templar
is the treasure of all treasures.

188
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:25,344
Oh, I didn’t know that.
a
Really?

189
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:30,351
Look, Ben... l understand your bitterness.
I really do.

190
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,090
You've spent your entire life
searching for this treasure,

191
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,349
only to have
the respected historical community

192
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:39,058
treat you and your family
with mockery and contempt.

193
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,812
You should be able to rub this treasure
in their arrogant faces,

194
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,563
and I want you to have
the chance to do that.

195
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,237
How?

196
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,263
We all have our areas of expertise.

197
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,807
You don't think mine are limited
to writing checks, do you?

198
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,298
In another life...

199
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:03,421
l arranged a number of operations of...
questionable legality.

200
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,799
I'd take his word for it, if l were you.

201
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,773
So don't worry.
I'll make all the arrangements.

202
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:17,923
No.

203
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,136
I'd really need your help here.

204
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:31,429
lan... I'm not gonna let you steal
the Declaration of Independence.

205
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,108
OK.

206
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,377
From this point on
all you're going to be is a hindrance.

207
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,320
Hey!

208
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,947
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shaw?

209
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,485
Well, you can't shoot me.
There's more to the riddle.

210
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,764
Information you don't have. I do.

211
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,921
I'm the only one who can figure it out,
and you know that.

212
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,418
He's bluffing.

213
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,110
We played poker together, lan.
You know I can't bluff.

214
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,616
Tell me what I need to know. Ben.
oe

215
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,965
or I'll shoot your friend.

216
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,571
Hey!

217
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,861
Quiet, Riley!
Your job's finished here.

218
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:17,543
Look where you're standing.
All that gunpowder.

219
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:21,494
You shoot me.
a
I drop this, we all go up.

220
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,562
Ben...

221
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,748
What happens when the flare burns down?

222
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,043
Tell me what I need to know. Ben.
a

223
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,771
You need to know...

224
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,773
if Shaw can catch.

225
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,344
Nice try, though.

226
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,680
Get out. Shaw!
a

227
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,004
Fool!

228
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,189
Riley, get over here!

229
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,071
- What is this?
- Smuggler's hold. Get in!

230
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,192
Move! Get out of here!

231
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,890
- What?
- Move! Get out!

232
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,016
Follow me.

233
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,514
Let's go, let's go!
She's gonna blow!

234
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,714
Get down.

235
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,077
OK, let's go.
Before someone sees the smoke.

236
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,875
There's an Inuit village
about nine miles east of here.

237
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,858
- It's popular with bush pilots.
- All right.

238
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:11,484
- Then what are we gonna do?
- Start making our way back home.

239
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,837
No, meant about lan. He's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence, Ben.

240
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,093
We stop him.

241
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,526
ls it really so hard to believe

242
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,927
that someone's gonna try to steal
the Declaration of Independence?

243
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,463
The FBI gets 10,000 tips a week.

244
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,938
They're not gonna worry about
something they're sure is safe.

245
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,548
But anyone that can do anything
is gonna think we're crazy.

246
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,684
Anyone crazy enough to believe us
isn't gonna want to help.

247
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:56,357
We don't need someone crazy. But one
step short of crazy, what do you get?

248
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,469
Obsessed.

249
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,234
Passionate.

250
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,274
Excuse me.

251
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,504
- Dr. Chase can see you now, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you.

252
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,006
Mr. Brown?

253
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,191
The family name doesn't get a lot
of respect in the academic community.

254
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,507
Huh. Being kept down by the man.

255
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,872
A very cute man.

256
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,224
Thank you.

257
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,477
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hi.

258
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,213
- Abigail Chase.
- Paul Brown.

259
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,628
- Nice to meet you.
- Bill.

260
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,254
Nice to meet you, Bill.

261
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,456
- How may I help you?
- Your accent. Pennsylvania Dutch?

262
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,793
Saxony German.

263
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,417
- You're not American?
- Oh, lam an American.
a

264
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,549
I just wasn't born here.
Please con't touch that!

265
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,129
Sorry. A neat collection.
George Washington's campaign buttons.

266
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,976
You're missing the 1789 inaugural, though.

267
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,002
- [found one once.
- That's very fortunate for you.

268
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,052
Now, you told my assistant
that this was an urgent matter.

269
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,378
Yes, ma’am.
a

270
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,144
Well, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

271
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,048
Someone's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

272
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,828
It's true.

273
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,531
I think I'd better put you gentlemen
in touch with the FBI.

274
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,533
- We've been to the FBI.
- And?

275
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,852
They assured us that the Declaration
cannot possibly be stolen.

276
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,586
- They're right.
- My friend and I are less certain.

277
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,482
However, if we were given the privilege
of examining the document...

278
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,250
we would be able to tell you for certain
if it were actually in any danger.

279
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,594
What clo you think you're gonna find?

280
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:49,596
We believe that there's an...
encryption on the back.

281
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,473
- An encryption, like a code?
- Yes, ma'am.
a

282
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,642
Of what?

283
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,591
A... cartograph.

284
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,051
-Amap.
- Yes, ma'am.
a

285
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,230
A map of what?

286
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,386
The location of...

287
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:14,289
..of hidden items
of historic and intrinsic value.

288
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,885
- A treasure map?
- That's where we lost the FBI.

289
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,966
You're treasure-hunters, aren't you?

290
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,468
We're more like treasure-protectors.

291
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,368
Mr. Brown, have personally seen the back
of the Declaration of Independence,

292
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,776
and I promise you, the only thing there
is a notation that reads.
a

293
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,097
"Original Declaration of Independence,
dated...

294
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:39,953
"Four of July, 1776." Yes, ma'am.

295
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,952
But no map.

296
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,377
It's invisible.

297
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,303
Oh! Right.

298
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,518
And that's where we lost
the Department of Homeland Security.

299
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,876
What led you to assume
there's this invisible map?

300
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,363
We found an engraving
on the stem of a 200-year-old pipe.

301
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,913
Owned by Freemasons.

302
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:17,081
- May I see the pipe?
- We don't have it.

303
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,665
- Did Big Foot take it?
- It was nice meeting you.

304
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,492
Nice to meet you, too.

305
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,564
And, you know,
that really is a nice collection.

306
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,881
Must have taken you a long time
to hunt down all that history.

307
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,235
If it's any consolation,
you had me convinced.

308
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,868
It's not.

309
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,573
I was thinking, what if we go public,
plaster the story all over the Internet?

310
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,945
It's not like
we have our reputations to worry about.

311
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,911
Although I don’t think
that's exactly gonna scare lan away.

312
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,634
180 years of searching,
and I'm three feet away.

313
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,398
Of all the words
written here about freedom.
a

314
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:05,037
there's a line here
that's at the heart of all the others.

315
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,627
"But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations,

316
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,497
pursuing invariably the same object,

317
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,377
evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism,

318
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,394
it is their right, it is their duty
to throw off such government

319
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:23,008
and provide new guards
for their future security.”

320
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,234
People don't talk that way anymore.

321
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,329
Beautiful, huh?
a

322
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,840
- No idea what you said.
- It means, if there's something wrong,

323
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:38,126
those who have the ability to take action
have the responsibility to take action.

324
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,395
I'm gonna steal it.

325
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,481
What?

326
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,609
I'm gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

327
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,764
Ben?

328
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,020
This is... huge.

329
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,197
It's prison huge.

330
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,696
You are gonna go to prison,
you know that?

331
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,165
Yeah, probably.

332
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,744
So that would bother most people.

333
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,887
lan's gonna try and steal it. And if he
succeeds, he'll destroy the Declaration.

334
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,492
The fact is, the only way to protect
the Declaration is to steal it.

335
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,249
It's upside down.

336
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,046
I don't think there's a choice.

337
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,266
Ben, for God's sakes.
a

338
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,835
it's like stealing a national monument. OK?

339
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,279
It's like stealing him.

340
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:43,778
It can't be done. Not shouldn't be done.
It can't be done.

341
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,867
Let me prove it to you.

342
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,607
OK, Ben, pay attention.

343
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,546
I've brought you to the Library of Congress.

344
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:57,156
Why? Because it's the biggest library
in the world.

345
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,569
Over 20 million books.

346
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,075
And they're all saying
the same exact thing:

347
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,521
listen to Riley.

348
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:09,066
What we have here, my friend,
is an entire layout of the archives.

349
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,905
Short of builders’ blueprints.

350
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:15,824
You've got construction orders,
phone lines,

351
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,709
water and sewage -
it's all here.

352
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,845
Now. when the Declaration
a
is on display, OK,

353
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,455
itis surrounded by guards
and video monitors

354
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,445
and a little family from lowa and little kids
on their eighth-grade field trip.

355
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:35,193
And beneath an inch of bulletproof glass
is an army of sensors and heat monitors

356
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,741
that will go off if someone gets too close
with a high fever.

357
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,322
Now, when it's not on display,

358
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:49,878
it is lowered into a four-foot-thick
concrete, steel-plated vault...

359
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,356
that happens to be equipped
with an electronic combination lock

360
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,771
and biometric access-cenial systems.

361
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,376
You know. Thomas Edison tried and failed
a
nearly 2,000 times

362
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,380
to develop the carbonized cotton-thread
filament for the incandescent light bulb.

363
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,167
Edison?

364
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,245
When asked about it.
a
he said. "I didn't fail.
re

365
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,034
I found out 2,000 ways
how not to make a light bulb.”

366
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:15,434
But he only needled to find one way
to make it work.

367
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,763
The Preservation Room.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

368
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,548
Do you know
what the Preservation Room is for?

369
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,177
Delicious jams and jellies?

370
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,899
No. That's where they clean,
repair and maintain

371
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,906
all the documents
and the storage housings

372
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,188
when they're not on display or in the vault.

373
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:39,284
Now, when the case needs work they take
it out of the vault, directly across the hall

374
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,481
and into the Preservation Room.

375
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,233
The best time for us. or lan, to steal it
ee
would be during the gala this weekend

376
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,527
when the guards are distracted
by the VIPs upstairs.

377
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,340
But we'll make our way to the Preservation
Room, where there's much less security.

378
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,035
Well. if lan...
a

379
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,361
Preservation...

380
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,943
The gala, huh?

381
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,313
This might be possible.

382
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,981
It might.

383
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,019
And we are in.

384
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,647
There you are. Hello.

385
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,810
The hallway.

386
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,795
That's what I want.

387
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,434
Game on.

388
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,217
I'll buy that.

389
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:16,937
Cool.

390
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,014
This just came for you.

391
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,100
l hope it's not from Stan.

392
00:33:56,535 --> 00:34:00,545
"For the woman who has everything else...
Thanks for listening. Paul Brown.”

393
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,279
Abigail Chase.

394
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,498
Hey, Mike.

395
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,243
- Let's do this by the book.
- Hallway is secure.

396
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,723
- Keep the document level.
- No problem.

397
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:15,683
What have you got?

398
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,610
The heat sensor went off
in the Declaration frame.

399
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,076
Run full diagnostics,
then I want them all changed out.

400
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,955
Our evil plan is working.

401
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,742
Ben, are you sure that we should...?

402
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,637
Riley.

403
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,449
- Can you hear me?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

404
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,325
We're all set in here.

405
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:18,537
You want to go around to the front
and present your invitation.

406
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,470
You're gonna have to show ID.
Go ahead. man.
a

407
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,967
Howely.

408
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,810
I need your invitation
and your ID, please.

409
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,502
How do you look?

410
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,538
- Not bad.
- Mazel tov.

411
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,008
This is it.

412
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,212
For you.

413
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,736
- Oh, Mr. Brown.
a
- Dr. Chase.

414
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,058
- What are you doing here?
- Is that that hot girl?

415
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:55,015
- How cloes she look?
- [made a last-minute donation. A big one.

416
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,047
Well, on that subject,
thank you for your wonderful gift.

417
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,053
- Oh, you did get it? Good.
- Yes, thank you.

418
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,138
You know, I really couldn't accept
something like that normally, but...

419
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,467
I really want it.

420
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,656
- Well, you needled it.
- Come on, Romeo, get outta there.

421
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,662
l have been wondering, though,
what the engraving indicated

422
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,746
on the pipe that Big Foot took.

423
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,288
Hi.

424
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:22,677
- Here you go.
- Oh, Dr. Herbert. this is Mr. Brown.
a

425
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,258
- Hi.
- Hi there.

426
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,569
- Who's the stiff?
- Here, why don't you let me take that?

427
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,202
- So you can take that off his hands.
- Thank you.

428
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,644
A toast, yeah?

429
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,879
To high treason.

430
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:40,205
That's what these men were committing
when they signed the Declaration.

431
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:45,285
Had we lost the war, they would have been
hanged, beheaded, drawn and quartered,

432
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,939
and - Oh! Oh, my personal favorite -
and had their entrails cut out and burned!

433
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:57,057
So. here's to the men
a
who did what was considered wrong

434
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,455
in order to do what they knew was right.

435
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,779
What they knew was right.

436
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,156
Well, good night.

437
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,415
- Good night.
- Good night.

438
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,819
Yeah!

439
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,794
OK, go! Go!

440
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,251
This better work.

441
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:02,506
Clear!

442
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,109
- On.
- Door one. 30 seconds.

443
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,168
How does it look?

444
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:27,392
It's working.
It's working...

445
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,119
Unbelievable.

446
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:52,018
Second door. 90 seconds.

447
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,506
Well done, boys. Let's go.

448
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,102
- We're in the elevator.
- OK.

449
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,441
I'm gonna turn off
the surveillance cameras. Ready?

450
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,457
In five. four.
oe

451
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,720
three... Now.

452
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:33,967
Ben Gates.
a

453
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,532
you are now the Invisible Man.

454
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,460
- I'm here.
- Give me the letters for her password.

455
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,769
What clo you got for me?

456
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,263
Hit me with it.

457
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,292
A-E-F-G...

458
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,221
L-O-R-V-Y.

459
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,711
Anagrams being listed.

460
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,961
OK.

461
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,656
Top results: "A glove fry.”

462
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,426
"A very golf.”

463
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,330
"Fargo levy.”

464
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,616
"Gravy floe. Valey frog.”

465
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,512
Also "Ago fly rev.”

466
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,132
"Grove fly a.”

467
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,011
"Are fly gov.”

468
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,262
"Era fly gov.”

469
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,655
- "Elf gov ray.”
- It's "Valley Forge.”

470
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,185
"Valley For...”
I don't have that on my computer.

471
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,387
It's "Valley Forge” -
she pressed the E and L twice.

472
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,233
Valley Forge was a turning point
in the American Revolution.

473
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,899
Can I marry your brain?

474
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,306
We're in.

475
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:45,869
Hello.

476
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,645
Ben, you're doing great.

477
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,460
Ben, pick it up.

478
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,188
You got about one...

479
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,301
We own video.

480
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,546

- What?

481
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,546
I lost my feed, Ben.

Ben, I have no...
a
Ben, I have nothing.

00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,941
Get out of there.
Get out of there now.

485
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,594
I'm taking the whole thing.
I'll get it out in the elevator.

486
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,410
What are you talking about?
Is it heavy?

487
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,508
Shaw. Door three, one minute.
a

488
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,113
Gates.

489
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,716
What was that?

490
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,723
Who's shooting?

491
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,577
- Damn.
- He's got the bloody map!

492
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,630
Are you still there? Ben?

493
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,455
I'm in the elevator.

494
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:28,832
- lan's here. There was, uh, shooting.
- [hate that guy.

495
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:38,122
Hey, Rebecca.
Do you have a Paul Brown on that list?

496
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:40,053
Paul Brown?

497
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:41,711
No. Not here.

498
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:57,203
Have a good night.

499
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:07,149
Are you trying to steal that?

500
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,063
It's $35.

501
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,866
- For this?
- Yeah.

502
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,966
- That's a lot.
- Hey, I don't make the prices.

503
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,248
It's...

504
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,159

505
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,175

This is Mike. Sublevel three.
l have an alert.

508

Where are you, Ben?

509
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,156
- Where are you?
- Stop talking.

510
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,937
Start the van.

511
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:36,025
Ben, the...
a
the mean Declaration lady's behind you.

512
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:42,982
Hey.

513
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,547
Oh, it's you. Hello.

514
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,306
Mr. Brown, what's going on?
What's that?

515
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,590
- It's a souvenir.
- Really?

516
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,722
Stop chatting and get in the van.

517
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,484
Code red. Code red.
We have a break-in.

518
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:05,216
Lock it down. Nobody leaves the building.
Get the FBI on the phone.

519
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,170
- Did you enjoy the party?
- Yeah.

520
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:19,127
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You did not...?

521
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,040
- No...
- Security! Over here!

522
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:24,123
- Give me that!
- It's yours. Take it.

523
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,562
Security!

524
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,304
- Over here! Security!
- Got you.

525
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:32,352
Go.

526
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,390
Viktor! Move!

527
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,559
- We can't just let her go!
- We can. Go!

528
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,525
- Security, over here!
- Wait. No, hold it.
a

529
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:42,355
Hold it!

530
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:45,632
- Wha...?
- Oh. bad.
a

531
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,140
- What do you want?
- Give me the document.

532
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,148
Bad. bad. bad!
a

533
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,750
- Let me go!
- Just bring her!

534
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,299
No! No!

535
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,157
- That's...
- Go! Go!

536
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,066
And just who might you be?

537
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,541
- Once we catch them what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

538
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:27,033
Right turn, right turn.

539
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:32,216
Why don't you just pass me that
document? Then we can all go home.

540
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,215
Oh, no.
a

541
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:02,411
Skidding, skidding, skidding.

542
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,206
- Oh, no!
a
- Holy Lord!

543
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,350
- Help!
- No! If she falls, the document falls.
a

544
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:22,805
Get me next to her.

545
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,714
- Thank you.
- No!

546
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,326
Got it. Go on.

547
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,109
Abigail!

548
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,756
Come on. Jump.

549
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:08,151
- We lost them.
- That's all right. This... is what we need.

550
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,356
Well done. Gates. Well done.
a

551
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,461
- Are you all right?
- No! Those lunatics...

552
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,107
- You're not hurt, are you?
- You are all lunatics!

553
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,833
- Are you hungry?
- What?

554
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:32,325
Are you all right?

555
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:36,043
Still a little on edge from being shot at,
but I'll be OK. Thanks for asking.

556
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,880
Yeah, well, I'm not all right. Those men
have the Declaration of Independence!

557
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,214
- She lost it?
- They don't have it.

558
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,476
See? OK?
Now could you please stop shouting?

559
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,147
- Give me that!
- You're still shouting. It's starting to annoy.

560
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:57,138
You'd do well, Dr. Chase.
re
to be a bit more civilized in this instance.

561
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,228
If this is the real one, what did they get?

562
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,538
A souvenir.

563
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:05,986
I thought it'd be a good idea to have
a duplicate. It turned out I was right.

564
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:12,467
l actually had to pay for the souvenir and
the real one, so you owe me $35, plus tax.

565
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,287
- Genius.
- Who were those men?

566
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,877
Just the guys we warned you
were gonna steal the Declaration.

567
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,853
And you didn't believe us.

568
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:23,455
We did the only thing we could do
to keep it safe.

569
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:26,319
Verdammt! Give me that!

570
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,573
You know something?
You're shouting again.

571
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,669
I'm pretty sure she was swearing, too.

572
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:33,707
Well, we probably deserve that.

573
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,528
Ladies and gentlemen...

574
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:46,706
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is
Peter Sadusky. I'm the agent in charge.

575
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,994
Il wanna reassure you,
you are not in danger in any way.

576
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:54,660
If we all cooperate, we'll get through this
with as little frustration as possible.

577
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,463
Thank you.

578
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:03,109
Get positive IDs. Search everyone,
including the security staff.

579
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:06,243
If they refuse,
detain them and get warrants.

580
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,847
Yes, Agent Hendricks?
You have something?

581
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:10,503
Um...

582
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:14,581
- This isn't a day for "Um..."
- We got a tip several days ago

583
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,889
that someone was going to steal
the Declaration of Independence.

584
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,915
Do we have a name on the tipster?

585
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:24,498
There was no file opened.
We didn't find the information credible.

586
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,030
How about now?

587
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:31,912
There is not a treasure map on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.

588
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,943
And there's no chance
anyone can steal this either.

589
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:40,381
I leveled with you 100 percent.
Everything I told you was the truth.

590
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,758
I want that document. Mr. Brown.
a

591
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,830
OK, my name's not Brown.
It's Gates.

592
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,310
I leveled with you 98 percent.

593
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,036
Wait a minute, clic you just say "Gates"?

594
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:53,863
Gates?

595
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:57,208
You're that family with the conspiracy
theory about the Founding Fathers?

596
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:00,698
- It's not a conspiracy theory.
- Per se.

597
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,548
You know what? I take it back.
You're not liars. You're insane.

598
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:07,042
There's a copy of the Declaration
on display now?

599
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,314
- Yes. we decided to...
a
- Leave it there.

600
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,933
The guests know something happened,
but they don't know what.

601
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:15,132
They got him with a Taser at the service
entrance. He doesn't remember a thing.

602
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,462
Also, we found bullet casings.

603
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,255
Dic we get a description
from the other guards?

604
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,160
- Which guards?
- The guards that were fired upon.

605
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,229
There weren't any other guards
on patrol down here.

606
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,966
So...

607
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,146
who was shooting,
who were they shooting at,

608
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,689
and why weren't they getting along?

609
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,535
You can't seriously intend
to run chemical tests

610
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,758
on the Declaration of Independence
in the back of a moving van.

611
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,678
We have a clean-room environment
all set up.

612
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,793
EDS suits, a particulate air filtration
system, the whole shebang.

613
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,506
- Really?
- We can't go back there.

614
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,442
What? Why not?

615
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:54,098
This is the guy. Dr. Herbert said
Dr. Chase introduced him as Mr. Brown.

616
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,770
Not on the guestlist.

617
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,629
Now, the gift-store clerk - she said
he seemed... Well. she said "flustered."
a

618
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:02,814
He tried to walk out with a copy
of the Declaration of Independence

619
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,990
without paying.

620
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,059
He paid with a Visa.

621
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:10,157
"Charge to Benjamin Gates.”

622
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,014
A credit-card slip?

623
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,877
Dude, we're on the grid.

624
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:17,672
They'll have your records from forever.
They'll have my records from forever.

625
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,188
I know. I Know. It's only a matter of minutes
before the FBI shows up at my front door.

626
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:23,532
What clo we do?

627
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:26,411
- We need those letters.
- What letters?

628
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,782
You know, get off the road,
take a right.

629
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,711
What letters?

630
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:38,224
You have the original Silence Dogood
letters? Did you steal those, too?

631
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:40,749
We have scans of the originals.

632
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:43,598
- Quiet, please.
- How'd you get scans?

633
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:47,144
Oh, I know the person
who has the originals. Now shush.

634
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:54,491
- Why do you need them?
- She really can't shut her mouth, can she?

635
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:58,312
I'll tell you what, look.
I will let you hold onto this

636
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,319
if you'll promise to shut up, please.

637
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:03,982
Thank you.

638
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:07,112
- Ben, you know what you have to do.
- [know what to do.

639
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,871
I'm just trying to think
of anything else we could do.

640
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:12,674
Well, not to be a... nudge,

641
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:16,616
but you do realize how many people
we have after us.

642
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:20,081
We probably have
our own satellite by now.

643
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:26,432
It took you all of two seconds to decide
to steal the Declaration of Independence.

644
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,637
Yeah, but I didn't think l was gonna
personally have to tell my dad about it.

645
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:33,535
Hey, not cool! Not cool!

646
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,801
Let me go!

647
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,122
OK. You're let go. Go, shoo.

648
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,488
I'm not going. Not without the Declaration.

649
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,448
You're not going with the Declaration.

650
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:47,093
Yes, Lam. I'm not letting it
out of my sight, so I'm going.

651
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:50,451
Wait. You're not going with us
with the Declaration.

652
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,814
- Yes. lam.
a
- No, you're not.

653
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:57,182
Look, if you wanted to leave me behind,

654
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,561
you shouldn't have told me
where you were going.

655
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,423
Clear.

656
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,399
What the...

657
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,513
Now we're getting somewhere.

658
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:30,190
They're digital scans of letters
to the editor of The New England Courant.

659
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,121
Written 1722.

660
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:37,363
They're all from the same person.
"Your humble servant, Silence Dogood.”

661
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:55,207
Gentlemen...

662
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:59,202
why is this word capitalized?

663
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:03,271
Because it's important?

664
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,899
Because it's a name.

665
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,888
OK, I got it.
When Ben Franklin was only 15 years old

666
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:13,908
he secretly wrote 14 letters
to his brother's newspaper

667
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:17,581
pretending to be a middle-aged widow
named Silence Dogood.

668
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,471
These letters were written
by Benjamin Franklin.

669
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,854
Looks OK.

670
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,523
- Park a couple of blocks away.
- Well, how long do you think we got?

671
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:36,106
I'm gonna give them a couple of hours
at least. hope.

672
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,130
What clo we do about her?
I've got some duct tape in the back.

673
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,680
No, that won't be necessary.
She won't be any trouble.

674
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,866
- Promise you won't be any trouble.
- [ promise.

675
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,029
See? She's curious.

676
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:56,022
Here's what I got on Gates. A degree
in American History from Georgetown,

677
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,600
a degree in Mechanical Engineering
at MIT.
a

678
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:02,892
Navy ROTC and Naval Diving
and Salvage Training Center.

679
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:06,581
What in the world did this guy
want to be when he grew up?

680
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,734
We keep our focus on Gates.

681
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,102
Run him to ground.

682
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:14,735
Compile a family-and-friends list.
Closest relative first.

683
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,092
I want to find out who this guy is.

684
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,280
Dad.

685
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,591
Where's the party?

686
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:36,717
Well... I'm in a little trouble.

687
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,525
- ls she pregnant?
- Well. if she is.
a

688
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:44,837
are you gonna leave the woman carrying
your grandchild standing out in the cold?

689
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,565
I look pregnant?

690
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,402
This better not be about
that dumb treasure.

691
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,378
Well. have a seat.
a
Make yourselves comfortable.

692
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:07,174
There's some pizza.
It's still warm. I think.
a

693
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,080
Dadi...

694
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:15,621
I need the Silence Dogood letters.
Yeah. it's about the treasure.
a

695
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,066
And he dragged you two
into this nonsense?

696
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,578
- Literally.
- volunteered.

697
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,797
Well. unvolunteer.
a
before you waste your life.

698
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:26,921
- Knock it off. Dad.
a
- Sure, sure, Know, I'm the family kook.

699
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:29,384
l have a job, a house, health insurance.

700
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:33,393
At least l had your mother, for however
brief a time. At least l had you.

701
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,959
What cdo you have? Him?

702
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:41,255
Look, if you just give us the letters,
we're gone.

703
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,410
You disappoint me, Ben.

704
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:48,193
Well, maybe that's the real Gates-family
legacy. Sons who disappoint their fathers.

705
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,630
Get out. Take your troubles with you.

706
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,580
Il found the Charlotte.

707
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,018
The Charlotte?

708
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:10,658
- You mean she was a ship?
- Yeah. she was beautiful.
a

709
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:11,974
It was amazing, Dad.

710
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:14,605
And the treasure?

711
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:17,441
No, no. But we found another clue
a
that led us here.

712
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:20,218
Yeah, and that'll lead you
to another clue.

713
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,897
And that's all you'll ever find,
is another clue. Don't you get it, Ben?

714
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,546
I finally figured it out.

715
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,658
The legend says that the treasure
was buried to keep it from the British.

716
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,525
But what really happened
was the legend was invented,

717
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:34,677
to keep the British occupied
searching for buried treasure.

718
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:38,134
The treasure is a myth.

719
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:40,682
l refuse to believe that.

720
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:49,926
Well, you can believe what you want.
You're a grown person. What am I doing?

721
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:53,354
Do what you want, Ben.
Do what you want.

722
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:59,442
He's probably right. You don't even know
if there is another clue.

723
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:06,005
Well, l can think of a way where we could
find out. And we can find out right now.

724
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,554
Looks like animal skin.

725
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,230
- How old is it?
- At least 200 years.

726
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,967
- Really? You sure?
- Pretty darn.

727
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:36,681
Now if this thing's in invisible ink,
how clo we look at it?

728
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,200
Throw it in the oven.

729
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:39,828
- No.
- Uh-uh.

730
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,436
Ferrous sulfate inks
can only be brought out with heat.

731
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:45,642
- Yes. but this...
a
- It's very old.

732
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:51,112
This is very old, and we can't
tisk compromising the map.

733
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:52,955
You need a reagent.

734
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,546
Dad. it’s really late.
Why don't you get some rest?

735
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:58,136
I'm fine.

736
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:00,125
Lemons.

737
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:09,007
- You can't do that.
- But it has to be done.

738
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:13,139
Then someone who is trained to handle
antique documents is gonna do it.

739
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:16,330
OK.

740
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,861
OK.

741
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,928
Now, if there is a secret message,

742
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:29,033
itll probably be marked by a symbol
in the upper right-hand corner.

743
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,176
That's right.

744
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,261
lam so getting fired for this.

745
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,445
I told you. You need heat.

746
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,299
See?

747
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,050
- We need more juice.
- We need more heat.

748
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,970
That's not a map.

749
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,080
- Is it?
- More clues. What a surprise.

750
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:58,022
Are those latitudes and longitudes?

751
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:00,551
That's why we need
the Silence Dogood letters.

752
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,627
- That's the key?
- Yeah. "The key in Silence undetected.”

753
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:05,504
Dad. can we have the letters now?
a

754
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:09,695
Will somebody please explain to me
what these magic numbers are?

755
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,483
- It's an Ottendorf cipher.
- That's right.

756
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,459
Oh. OK.
a

757
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:17,331
- What's an Ottendorf cipher?
- They're just codes.

758
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:21,564
Each of these three numbers
corresponds to a word in a key.

759
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,647
Usually a random book
or a newspaper article.

760
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,961
In this case,
a
the Silence Dogood letters.

761
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:29,407
So it's like the page number
of the key text,

762
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:32,696
the line on the page,
and the letter in that line.

763
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,449
So. Dad. where are the letters?
ee

764
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,259
You know, it's just by sheer happenstance
that his grandfather...

765
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:41,994
- Dad.
- ..even found them.

766
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:44,232
They were in an antique desk
from the press room...

767
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:46,041
- Dad.
- ..0f The New England Courant.

768
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:49,006
- That's a newspaper.
- Dad. where are the letters?
a

769
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,882
I don't have them. son.
a

770
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,718
- What?
- [don't have them.

771
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,131
Where are they?

772
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,436
I donated them to the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia.

773
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,220
Time to go.

774
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:14,607
I still can't believe it. All this time
no one knew what was on the back.

775
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,535
The back of what?

776
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,650
No!

777
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:21,172
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- know.

778
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:23,861
Oh, my God. What have you done?
This is... this is the...

779
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,683
- l know!
- This is the Declaration of Independence.

780
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,870
Yes. And it's very delicate.

781
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,256
You stole it?

782
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:37,314
Dad, I can explain, but I don't have time.
It was necessary. And you saw the cipher.

783
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:40,434
And that will lead to another clue,
a
and that will lead to another clue!

784
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:43,797
There is no treasure.
l wasted 20 years of my life.

785
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,794
And now you've destroyed yours.

786
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,877
And you pulled me into all this.

787
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,437
Well. we can't have that.
a

788
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,701
Come in!

789
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,840
I'm in here.

790
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,810
FBI, right?

791
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:11,983
You gonna untie me?

792
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,141
And you have no idea where he's going?

793
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:21,107
- Well, wouldn't I have told you if I did?
- Would you?

794
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:23,548
He tied me to a chair.

795
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,450
The garage is empty, but there’s a Cadillac
DeVille registered to Patrick Gates.

796
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,827
And he stole my car.

797
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,740
Don't worry, Mr. Gates, we'll find your car.
And your son.

798
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:38,873
Your dad's got a sweet ride.

799
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:41,749
I think we should change clothes.

800
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,384
We look kind of conspicuous,
don't you think?

801
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,397
I'd love to go shopping, too,
but we have no money.

802
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,647
Here. I took this from his house.
a

803
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:53,192
He usually tucks a few hundred dollars
somewhere between those pages.

804
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:57,430
- Common Sense. How appropriate.
- When are we gonna get there?

805
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,174
I'm hungry. This car smells weird.

806
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,932
Excuse me.

807
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:50,844
Excuse me. Oops, sorry, sir. Excuse me.

808
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,077
That's OK.

809
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,616
$-S-A-N-D.

810
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:03,435
OK.

811
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,451
You're sure this is right?

812
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,417
OK.

813
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,263
S-S-A...

814
01:08:13,523 --> 01:08:15,103
No, N.
a

815
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,231
- That is an N.
- It doesn't look like an N.

816
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:23,493
You know what? Here. Last one. OK?

817
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,124
- One more dollar.
- Thank you.

818
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,836
Go get the last four letters.

819
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:32,313
Go get 'em, chief. Come on.

820
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:54,593
OK. "The vision to see the treasured past

821
01:08:55,198 --> 01:09:00,878
comes as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of pass and...”

822
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,048
"Pass and...” what?

823
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:20,194
"Pass and...”

824
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,769
What's going on?

825
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,886
- I'm not sure.
- What's up?

826
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,678
So you show up at your father’s door
and say you're in trouble

827
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:02,562
and the first thing he assumes
is I'm pregnant.

828
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:05,209
Is there a question in there?

829
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,818
I think there's an interesting story
in there.

830
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,773
Well, my father thinks I've been
a little too cavalier in my personal life.

831
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,711
-lsee.
- Let me ask you something.

832
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:17,691
Have you ever told someone -
not a relative - "I love you?"

833
01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:20,074
Yes.

834
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,756
More than one someone?

835
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,243
Yes.

836
01:10:25,488 --> 01:10:27,158
Oh. Well, then my father would say

837
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:30,447
you've been a little too cavalier
in your personal life, too.

838
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:33,967
So you get your sense of absolute certainty
from him, do you?

839
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:36,164
Well. I'm sure I don't know
a
what you mean.

840
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:40,656
Well, you're certain the treasure is real,
despite what anyone else thinks.

841
01:10:41,304 --> 01:10:42,614
No, but I hope it's real.

842
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:46,852
I mean, I've dreamt it’s real
a
since my grandfather told me about it.

843
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:50,347
But I want to hold it.
I feel like I'm so close. I can taste it.
a

844
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:54,973
But I just... l just want to know it's not just
something in my head or in my heart.

845
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:02,068
People don't really talk that way, you know.

846
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:05,682
I know. But they think that way.

847
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:13,054
Hey.

848
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:14,986
- Did you get it? Riley?
- Oh, I got it.

849
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:18,614
"The vision to see
the treasured past comes

850
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:23,862
as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of Pass and Stow.”

851
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,070
Now, "Pass and Stow.” of course,
re
referring to...

852
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:30,003
- The Liberty Bell.
- Why do you have to do that?

853
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,608
Well. John Pass and John Stow
a
cast the bell.

854
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:35,829
OK. Well. then, what does
ee
the rest of this mean?

855
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:40,452
Wait... "The vision to see the treasured
past" must refer to a way to read the map.

856
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:42,437
Well, [ thought the cipher was the map.

857
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:45,218
No, the cipher was a way
to find the way to read the map.

858
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,095
And the way to read the map can be found

859
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:51,380
where the "timely shadow” crosses
in front of the Liberty Bell.

860
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:54,878
Crosses in front of the "house"
of the Liberty Bell. Independence Hall.

861
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:58,414
Right, so "timely shadow" -
it's a specific time.

862
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:01,188
- Right.
- What time?

863
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,977
What time? What time?

864
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,827
Wait a minute. wait.
a
You're gonna love this.

865
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:11,481
Excuse me, can I see one of those
a
hundred-dollar bills I paid you with?

866
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,393
No.

867
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:17,135
Oh. Well. here.
ee
l have this diver’s watch.

868
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:20,063
It's called a Submariner. I dive with it.
It's actually quite valuable.

869
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,309
- You can use it as collateral.
- Whatever.

870
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:23,978
Thank you.

871
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,639
On the back of a hundred-dollar bill
is an etching of Independence Hall

872
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,473
- based on a painting done in...
- Hello.

873
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,764
Thank you.
..in the 1780s. who...
a

874
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:34,153
The artist was actually a friend
of Benjamin Franklin's. It's wonderful.

875
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,049
- Fascinating.
- Hold this.

876
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:38,099
OK.

877
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,691
I'm not going anywhere.

878
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:44,617
Now, I think that if we look
a
at this clock tower...

879
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:48,532
..we may find the specific time.

880
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,477
- What clo you see?
- 2:22,

881
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,927
- What time is it now?
- Almost three.

882
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,505
- We missed it.
- No. we didn't.
a

883
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:05,469
We didn't miss it because...

884
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:09,661
You don't know this? I-l know something
about history that you don't know.

885
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:12,032
I'd be very excited to learn about it, Riley.

886
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:15,285
Well, hold on one second, let me just...
let me just take in this moment.

887
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,978
This is... this is cool.

888
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:21,701
Is this how you feel all the time? Because,
you know... Except for now, of course.

889
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,071
- Riley!
- All right.

890
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:29,089
What I know is that daylight savings
wasn't established until World War I.

891
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:34,755
If i's 3pm now, OK, that means
in 1776, it would be 2pm.

892
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,261
- Let's go.
- Riley, you're a genius.

893
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,570
Yeah.

894
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:43,106
Do you actually know who the first person
to suggest daylight savings was?

895
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,079
- Benjamin Franklin.
- Benjamin Franklin.

896
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:48,863
Is this real?

897
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,211
Just tell me what you told my friend.

898
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,840
Just a bunch of letters.
I can't remember.

899
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:59,313
Can you remember which ones
you were gonna tell him next?

900
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,366
Yeah. here. S-T-O-W.
a

901
01:14:10,713 --> 01:14:14,553
Top results: Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall.

902
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,584
Imagine its impact
back in the 18th century.

903
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:25,691
It could have been seen for miles around.
a
which was exactly its purpose,

904
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:30,602
because it served as a beacon. as it were.
re
for people to collect and hear...

905
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:46,785
Good stuff.

906
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:51,173
It gained a place in history
on July 8, 1776,

907
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,961
when the Liberty Bell tolled
for the first public reading

908
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,603
of the Declaration of Independence.

909
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,923
Eventually, it was moved from its place

910
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,401
in Independence Hall steeple
and given its own...

911
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:04,074
- Idiot.
- Who?

912
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:05,807
- Me.
- What?

913
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,758
It's not here. It's there.

914
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,756
Come on.

915
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:22,563
- What bell is this?
- It's the Centennial Bell.

916
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:25,987
It replaced the Liberty Bell in 1876.

917
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:35,873
There it is.

918
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,158
All right. I'm gonna go clown there,
and you meet me in the signing room.

919
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,715
- OK? All right.
- OK.

920
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:44,151
All right, let's go.

921
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:47,437
3:22. My idea.

922
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:57,211
Hey. What'd you score?

923
01:16:57,513 --> 01:16:58,823
I found this.

924
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,301
Some kind of ocular device.

925
01:17:01,684 --> 01:17:04,704
"The vision to see the treasured past.”
Let me take this.

926
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:08,467
Aw, they're like early American
X-ray specs.

927
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:12,621
Benjamin Franklin invented
something like these.

928
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:15,215
I think he invented these.

929
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:17,344
So. what do we do with them?
a

930
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,974
We look through it.

931
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,919
Here, help me.

932
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,885
- Careful.
- You think?

933
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:39,204
- What?
- It's just that the last time this was here

934
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,872
it was being signed.

935
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,980
- Ben, there's another tour coming.
- Turn it over.

936
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,837
- Careful.
- Spectacles.

937
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,174
What clo you see?

938
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,560
What is it? Is it a treasure map?

939
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:15,293
It says, "Heere at the wall.”
spelled with two E's.

940
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,708
Take a look.

941
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:23,394
Wow.

942
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:27,736
Why can't they just say, "Go to this place,
and here's the treasure, spend it wisely?”

943
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,510
Oh, no.
a

944
01:18:31,507 --> 01:18:33,616
- Oh, no.
a
- Oh, no.
a

945
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,220
How'd they find us?

946
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:39,608
Well, lan has nearly unlimited resources.
And he's smart.

947
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,455
I don't think we can get out of here
without being spotted.

948
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:45,431
Well. we don't want them to have
a
the Declaration, or the glasses.

949
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:48,164
But we especially don't want them
to have them both together.

950
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:51,166
- So what do we do?
- We separate the lock from the key.

951
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:53,404
- We're splitting up.
- Good idea.

952
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,749
Really?

953
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:56,894
I'll take this.

954
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:00,483
And those. You keep that. Meet me at the
car and call me if you have any problems.

955
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:03,612
Like if we get caught and killed?

956
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:07,169
Yeah. That would be a big problem.
Take care of her.

957
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,726
- L will.
- L will.

958
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,107
We're on him.

959
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,408
There he is.

960
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:30,840
- Let's walk this way.
- Wait up.

961
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:34,857
- Shaw. look. There's the others.
a
- [got it.

962
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:41,184
Viktor, meet me at Fifth and Chestnut. Fifth
a
and Chestnut. They're heading your way.

963
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:08,369
- Look out! Look out!
- Riley!

964
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,217
- There they are! Move!
- Move!

965
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:14,778
- Time to run.
- Keep up. Viktor! Move. Come on.

966
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,124
In here.

967
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:31,288
- Come on.
- Follow me.

968
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,642
That way.

969
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:48,577
If you're not a steak,
you don't belong here.

970
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:52,344
I'm just trying to hice
from my ex-husband.

971
01:20:52,815 --> 01:20:55,275
- Who, baldy?
- Yes.

972
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:58,151
Honey, stay as long as you like.

973
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:00,507
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

974
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,606
You want something?

975
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,233
- Do you want something?
- Shut up.

976
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:16,146
I see why you left him.

977
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:23,724
Go around. Go around.

978
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,138
Gates!

979
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,362
Aw. come on!
a

980
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:11,348
- Where were you?
- Hiding.

981
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:13,687
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

982
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:21,727
lan. lan, I've got em.
They're heading toward City Hall.

983
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:24,861
- OK, I'm on my way.
- Out of the way!

984
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,856
They're headed for the breezeway
on the north side.

985
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:56,928
I'll be right there.

986
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:08,265
Hey, Gates!

987
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:17,346
Enough, man! Give me the document.

988
01:23:18,861 --> 01:23:20,821
All right, Phil.

989
01:23:37,913 --> 01:23:40,543
Watch out! Get out of my way!

990
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:46,226
Watch it!

991
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:30,527
Leave them! Let 'em go.

992
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:35,201
We've got it.

993
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:39,578
- FBI. Have you seen this guy?
- No.

994
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:42,456
Nope, I haven't seen him.

995
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:45,374
Ted. Philadelphia police
found Gates's car.

996
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:47,924
It's close.
We got surveillance there now.

997
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:50,713
Let's go. Tell the boss
we got the car.

998
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,922
- What?
- We lost it.

999
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:58,410
- What?
- We lost the Declaration. lan took it.

1000
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:03,779
Yeah, OK. You all right?
You both all right?

1001
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:06,102
Yeah, yeah, we're all right.

1002
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:09,275
- Ben, I'm sorry.
- We'll be fine.

1003
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:11,928
Meet me at the car.

1004
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,666
Suspect has arrived.

1005
01:25:23,385 --> 01:25:25,115
Hello, Mr. Gates.
a

1006
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:29,462
Mr. Gates, face your father's car and
put your hands behind your back, please.

1007
01:25:29,925 --> 01:25:33,055
- We got one in custody.
- Gates, you're a hard man to find.

1008
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:34,962
Could you please be careful?

1009
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:52,514
Riley, do you know
how to get in touch with lan?

1010
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,623
Excuse me?

1011
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,343
That's some story.

1012
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:05,807
Well, it's the same story I tried to tell you
guys before the Declaration was stolen.

1013
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:09,698
- By you.
- No, by lan. I stole it to stop him.

1014
01:26:10,232 --> 01:26:13,072
I did it alone.
Dr. Chase was not involved.

1015
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:16,999
And lan still ended up with
the Declaration of Independence.

1016
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:19,251
Because of you.

1017
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,755
So here's your options.

1018
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:26,748
Door number one.
a
you go to prison for a very long time.

1019
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:32,199
Door number two, we are going to get back
the Declaration of Independence,

1020
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:37,108
you help us find it, and you still
go to prison for a very long time,

1021
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:39,929
but you feel better inside.

1022
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:43,285
Is there a door that doesn't lead to prison?

1023
01:26:44,466 --> 01:26:47,336
- Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.
- Yeah.

1024
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:52,128
So what are these for?

1025
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:54,224
It's a way to read the map.

1026
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:56,063
Right.

1027
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:57,714
Knights Templar.

1028
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:59,239
Freemasons.

1029
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:01,701
Invisible treasure map.

1030
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:05,924
- So what'd it say?
- "Heere at the wall.”

1031
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:08,675
Nothing else.

1032
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,246
It's just another clue.

1033
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,906
It looks like lan Howe
could be a false identity.

1034
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:16,636
Follow up with ATF and INS.

1035
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:19,672
There's more to it.

1036
01:27:20,035 --> 01:27:22,255
- Standard tap procedure.
- Let's check the signal, folks.

1037
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:24,687
- Lock it in.
- Are we set?

1038
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,820
- Checking source.
- Unknown number.

1039
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:32,423
Yes.

1040
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:34,987
Hello, Ben. How are you?

1041
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:38,423
- Um. chained to a desk.
a
- Sorry to hear that.

1042
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:41,694
I want you to meet me on the flight deck
of the USS Intrepid.

1043
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,403
Meet me there at ten o'clock
tomorrow morning.

1044
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:49,798
And bring those glasses
you found at Independence Hall.

1045
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:52,378
Yeah, Know about the glasses.

1046
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:57,095
We can take a look at the Declaration.
a
and then you can be on your way.

1047
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:59,219
And I'm supposed to believe that.

1048
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:01,907
I told you from the start,
l only wanted to borrow it.

1049
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:04,411
You can have it. And the glasses.

1050
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:08,083
I'll even throw in the pipe
from the Charlotte.

1051
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,137
I'll be there.

1052
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:13,077
And tell the FBI agents
listening in on this call

1053
01:28:13,522 --> 01:28:16,982
if they want the Declaration back,
and not just a box of confetti,

1054
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:19,635
then you'll come alone.

1055
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:35,401
- Take positions.
- Perimeter looks normal.

1056
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:38,771
- Can l get a status report?
- Crow's nest in position. Port side is quiet.

1057
01:28:39,247 --> 01:28:40,557
Copy that.

1058
01:28:50,859 --> 01:28:54,049
- Gates is on the flight deck.
- Eyes on Gates.

1059
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:57,403
- Do not lose sight of primary mark.
- Brian, you're clear with NYPD.

1060
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:00,086
- [have a visual.
- Gates.

1061
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:01,577
Stay with the program.

1062
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:04,702
l hope your agents are all uncer four feet
tall and wearing little scarves.

1063
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,873
Otherwise lan's gonna know they're here.

1064
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:09,665
As soon as he shows you the Declaration,
we'll move in.

1065
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:12,388
Don't try anything.
Just let us handle it.

1066
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:16,411
You know, Agent Sadusky,
something I've noticed about fishing:

1067
01:29:16,985 --> 01:29:19,445
it never works out so well for the bait.

1068
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:30,671
Sir, we've got some traffic incoming.
Looks like a sightseeing helicopter.

1069
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:33,413
Unit two.
a
get an eyeball on that chopper.

1070
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:36,838
Agent Michaels, get FAA flight plans
and authorization records on that craft.

1071
01:29:37,339 --> 01:29:40,269
If that's not Mr. Howe.
a
l want to know who it is.

1072
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:44,462
- L got him. He’s coming from the north.
- Gates. Are you with me?

1073
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:48,416
Well, I'm sure not against you,
if that's what you're asking.

1074
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,213
We've got some interference
on Gates's mike, sir.
a

1075
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:15,626
This I know.

1076
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:19,465
Hello, Ben.
a

1077
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:22,918
Thomas Edison needed only one way
to make a light bulb.

1078
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,527
Sound familiar?

1079
01:30:27,856 --> 01:30:29,786
- Keep sightlines clear.
- What's the devil's going on?

1080
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:31,615
There's a lot of commotion.
We can't see Gates.

1081
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:36,113
Go to the starboard observation point
behind the F-16 and here's what you do.

1082
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:39,459
Gates? Gates?

1083
01:30:39,701 --> 01:30:42,891
Air Tour helicopter,
you are in controlled airspace.

1084
01:30:43,405 --> 01:30:44,775
Vacate immediately.

1085
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,440
Who's got Gates?

1086
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:48,817
- All agents, report in.
- l can't see anything.

1087
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:52,076
- Did Gates speak to anybody?
- Target is moving.

1088
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:56,057
- He's heading towarcls the stern.
- I've got him. He's coming this way.

1089
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,458
Anyone got a view of our friend lan Howe?

1090
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,457
lan Howe is not at the stern. sir.
a

1091
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:03,625
Then why is he heading there?

1092
01:31:04,092 --> 01:31:06,871
He's at the observation deck.

1093
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:08,259
Sadusky.

1094
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,530
I'm still not against you.

1095
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:14,232
But I found door number three.
And I'm taking it.

1096
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,549
- What's he talking about?
- Move in!

1097
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:18,831
Move in! Move in on Gates!

1098
01:31:29,117 --> 01:31:30,047
Divers are a go.

1099
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:32,591
- Snipers, go to action zebra.
- All teams, move in. Pursue at own risk.
a

1100
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:35,418
- lrepeat, pursue at own risk.
- You first.

1101
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:38,134
Holy mackerel. He set us up.

1102
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:04,125
Agent Dawes, do you have a visual?
Can you see Gates in the water?

1103
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:07,022
Sir, it's the Hudson. Nothing is visible.

1104
01:32:08,156 --> 01:32:09,906
Smart fish.

1105
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:31,710
Hello, Ben. Welcome to New Jersey.

1106
01:32:33,181 --> 01:32:35,401
- What'd you do with Abigail and Riley?
- Hope these fit.

1107
01:32:35,784 --> 01:32:37,124
We had to guess your sizes.

1108
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,195
I said, what'd you do
with Abigail and Riley?

1109
01:32:39,521 --> 01:32:41,481
He's the only one who could've
told you that line about Edison.

1110
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:43,573
Did you bring the glasses?

1111
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:45,501
I don't know.
Tell me what's happening here.

1112
01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:48,104
Ask your girlfriend.

1113
01:32:48,496 --> 01:32:50,636
She's the one calling all the shots now.

1114
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:53,429
She won't shut up.

1115
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,227
Yeah. hello.
a

1116
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:01,597
It's for you.

1117
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:05,803
- Hello.
- Hi, sweetie. How's your day going?

1118
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:08,187
Uh, interesting, dear.

1119
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,686
So, what, you working with lan now?

1120
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:15,126
It turns out helping someone escape
from FBI custody is a criminal act.

1121
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:16,980
And he's the only criminal we knew.

1122
01:33:17,225 --> 01:33:19,835
- So we called him and made a deal.
- Well, you're...

1123
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:24,069
You're... you're... you're all right, yeah?
I mean you're safe?

1124
01:33:24,466 --> 01:33:26,486
Yeah. we both are.
a

1125
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:29,875
Riley's right here, doing
something clever with a computer.

1126
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:32,211
I'm tracking him through the... Hey!

1127
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,650
I'm tracking you through the GPS
in Shaw's phone.

1128
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:37,879
They take a turn anywhere we don't want,
we'll know it. So don't worry.

1129
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:43,175
If lan tries to double-cross us. we can call
a
the FBI and tell them right where you are.

1130
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:46,378
- And where to find lan.
- And where is that?

1131
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:48,777
Right across the street
from where we're hiding,

1132
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:50,853
at the intersection
of Wall Street and Broadway.

1133
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:53,768
Well, you figured out the clue.

1134
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:56,969
Simple. "Heere at the wall.”
Wall Street and Broadway.

1135
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,475
Ben, there is a catch.
a

1136
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:05,464
We made lan believe
he could have the treasure.

1137
01:34:05,907 --> 01:34:07,657
It was the only way
we could get this far.

1138
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:09,936
He's here.

1139
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:19,369
Here we go.

1140
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:25,224
Ben.

1141
01:34:25,426 --> 01:34:29,936
You all right? No broken bones?
A jump like that could kill a man.

1142
01:34:30,632 --> 01:34:33,062
Naw, it was cool.
a
You should try it sometime.

1143
01:34:35,937 --> 01:34:39,277
The Declaration of Independence.
And the meerschaum pipe.

1144
01:34:40,275 --> 01:34:42,025
All yours.

1145
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:46,198
- That's it?
- That's it.

1146
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:50,370
I knew you'd keep your promise.
Now, where is it? Where's my treasure?

1147
01:34:50,952 --> 01:34:52,532
It's right here.

1148
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,660
The map said "Heere at the wall.”
spelled with two E's.

1149
01:34:56,124 --> 01:34:58,523
Wall Street follows the path
of an actual wall

1150
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:01,677
that the original Dutch settlers built
as a defense to keep the British out.

1151
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:06,110
The main gate was located at a street
called De Heere. also two E's.
a

1152
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:09,074
Later De Heere Street was renamed
Broadway after the British got in.

1153
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,720
So. "Heere at the wall.”
a

1154
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:15,126
Broadway, Wall Street.

1155
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:17,219
Cheerio.

1156
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,370
Just a moment. Ben.
a

1157
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:24,868
lan, if you break our deal, the FBI
will be only a few minutes behind you.

1158
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,040
You might get away, you might not.

1159
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:33,856
Is that all the map said?

1160
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:38,060
Every word.

1161
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:42,321
Oh, Ben.
a

1162
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:45,540
You know the key
to running a convincing bluff?

1163
01:35:46,007 --> 01:35:49,517
Every once in a while
you've got to be holding all the cards.

1164
01:36:00,822 --> 01:36:02,162
Dad.

1165
01:36:04,892 --> 01:36:07,382
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

1166
01:36:11,799 --> 01:36:14,759
Trinity Church. We have to go
inside Trinity Church.

1167
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:20,596
Good. Excellent.

1168
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:23,602
Well, why don't you ask Dr. Chase
and Riley to join us?

1169
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:26,855
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

1170
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,643
Are you all right?

1171
01:36:35,023 --> 01:36:37,243
What clo you think? I'm a hostage.

1172
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,050
Sit. Sit down.

1173
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:44,175
- Let him go, lan.
- When we find the treasure.

1174
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:48,442
No, now. Or you can figure out
the clues for yourself.

1175
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:50,677
Good luck.

1176
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,232
Ben.

1177
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,873
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

1178
01:37:04,786 --> 01:37:06,956
Let's have a look at that map.

1179
01:37:43,391 --> 01:37:44,701
It's...

1180
01:37:46,928 --> 01:37:49,268
It's... it's really quite something. It's...

1181
01:37:49,664 --> 01:37:51,773
It really is remarkable. Take a look.

1182
01:37:58,606 --> 01:38:02,206
- "Parkington Lane.”
- "Beneath Parkington Lane.”

1183
01:38:02,777 --> 01:38:06,287
But why would the map lead us here,
then take us somewhere else?

1184
01:38:06,848 --> 01:38:09,038
- What's the purpose?
- Just another clue.

1185
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:13,547
Dad. No, you're right. Parkington Lane
has to be here somewhere.

1186
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:17,566
A street inside the church?

1187
01:38:17,959 --> 01:38:20,269
Not inside. Beneath.

1188
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,411
Beneath the church.

1189
01:38:27,135 --> 01:38:29,355
- I'm so sorry, Ben.
- None of this is your fault.

1190
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:30,697
- Ico...
- Come on.

1191
01:38:40,548 --> 01:38:41,838
Look.

1192
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:46,897
Cooperation only lasts as long
as the status quo is unchanged.

1193
01:38:47,455 --> 01:38:51,765
As soon as this guy gets to wherever this
thing ends, he won't need you anymore.

1194
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:53,597
Or... or any of us.

1195
01:38:53,828 --> 01:38:57,198
So we find a way to make sure
the status quo changes in our favor.

1196
01:38:57,732 --> 01:39:01,192
- How?
- I'm still working on it.

1197
01:39:01,736 --> 01:39:04,486
Well. I guess I better
work on it too, then.
a

1198
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:07,309
Hey! Par... Hey, I found it!

1199
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:09,288
- Him!
- Ben!

1200
01:39:10,044 --> 01:39:11,794
It's a name.

1201
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:16,466
Parkington Lane.

1202
01:39:16,751 --> 01:39:20,001
He was a third-degree master mason
of the Blue Lo...

1203
01:39:20,521 --> 01:39:22,541
Hey! Stop!

1204
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:38,478
Easy.

1205
01:39:42,243 --> 01:39:44,053
Careful no one steps in him.

1206
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:46,248
All right, put it down.

1207
01:39:53,421 --> 01:39:57,931
OK. Who wants to go down
the creepy tunnel insicle the tomb first?

1208
01:39:59,527 --> 01:40:03,427
Right. McGregor, Viktor, you stay here.

1209
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:09,159
And if anyone should come out without me,
well... use your imagination.

1210
01:40:12,707 --> 01:40:14,457
Shall we?

1211
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,920
You got a light?

1212
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,959
Careful.

1213
01:40:54,315 --> 01:40:56,335
Watch your step.

1214
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:04,140
Come here.

1215
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,844
Why does that never happen to me?

1216
01:41:22,176 --> 01:41:23,926
What's this?

1217
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:41,410
It's a chandelier.

1218
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:52,008
Here.

1219
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,612
- Wow.
- Look at the elevators.

1220
01:42:11,025 --> 01:42:12,455
A dumbwaiter system.

1221
01:42:12,727 --> 01:42:15,007
How do a bunch of guys with hand tools
build all this?

1222
01:42:15,396 --> 01:42:18,585
Same way they built the pyramids
and the Great Wall of China.

1223
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:21,820
Yeah. The aliens helped them.

1224
01:42:22,269 --> 01:42:24,259
Right, let's go. What are we waiting for?

1225
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:28,569
I'm not going out on that thing.
200 years of termite damage and rot.

1226
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:31,803
Dad, do what he says.

1227
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,429
Watch your step.

1228
01:42:55,569 --> 01:42:57,269
We're right uncer the Trinity graveyard.

1229
01:42:57,571 --> 01:42:59,881
That's probably why
no one ever found this.

1230
01:43:04,912 --> 01:43:06,662
What is that?

1231
01:43:11,318 --> 01:43:13,068
Subway.

1232
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:21,286
Shaw! Oh. God. Shaw!
ee

1233
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,938
Oh, my God.

1234
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:40,992
Hold on! Hold on!

1235
01:43:43,818 --> 01:43:45,838
OK, get on the elevator. Jump!

1236
01:43:49,290 --> 01:43:51,250
Ben! Grab my hand.

1237
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:54,927
- Come on.
- lan!

1238
01:43:55,196 --> 01:43:57,626
Abigail! Get on!

1239
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:03,436
Jump!

1240
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,140
Here.

1241
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:23,950
Ben!

1242
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:27,235
Get down there.
Get down there!

1243
01:44:32,967 --> 01:44:34,427
The Declaration.

1244
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:39,768
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

1245
01:44:54,188 --> 01:44:55,798
Oh, no! Ben!
a

1246
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:03,959
Hang on!

1247
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:14,250
Son!

1248
01:45:21,482 --> 01:45:25,022
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dropped you.
l had to save the Declaration.

1249
01:45:25,586 --> 01:45:29,596
No, don't be. I would have done
a
exactly the same thing to you.

1250
01:45:30,224 --> 01:45:32,124
Really?

1251
01:45:32,459 --> 01:45:35,619
I would have dropped you both.
Freaks.

1252
01:45:43,571 --> 01:45:45,531
Get on.

1253
01:45:45,873 --> 01:45:47,452
lan...

1254
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:49,881
it's not worth it.

1255
01:45:50,244 --> 01:45:54,344
Do you imagine any one of your lives
is more valuable to me than Shaw's?

1256
01:45:54,982 --> 01:45:56,122
We go on.

1257
01:45:58,085 --> 01:46:01,565
The status quo.
Keep the status quo.

1258
01:46:09,763 --> 01:46:12,663
- Now what?
- This is...

1259
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:15,653
This is where it all leads.

1260
01:46:25,446 --> 01:46:27,196
OK, let's go.

1261
01:47:10,357 --> 01:47:12,607
What is this?

1262
01:47:12,993 --> 01:47:15,103
So where's the treasure?

1263
01:47:18,332 --> 01:47:19,532
Well?

1264
01:47:21,335 --> 01:47:23,325
This is it?

1265
01:47:23,671 --> 01:47:25,781
We came all this way
for a dead end?

1266
01:47:27,408 --> 01:47:28,638
Yes.

1267
01:47:32,046 --> 01:47:34,536
- There's gotta be something more.
- Riley, there's nothing more.

1268
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:37,029
- Another clue, or...
a
- No. there are no more clues!
a

1269
01:47:37,384 --> 01:47:38,844
That's it. OK? It's over!
a

1270
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:42,749
End of the road. The treasure’s gone.
Moved. Taken somewhere else.

1271
01:47:44,558 --> 01:47:48,038
You're not playing games with me,
are you, Ben? Hm?

1272
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:51,255
You know where it is.

1273
01:47:51,699 --> 01:47:53,188
No.

1274
01:47:57,104 --> 01:47:59,124
OK, go.

1275
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,903
Hey, wait a minute.

1276
01:48:02,643 --> 01:48:04,633
- Hey! lan, wait!
- Wait. wait. wait!
a

1277
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:06,469
- lan...
- We'll be trapped.

1278
01:48:06,747 --> 01:48:08,937
- Don't do this.
- You can't just leave us here.

1279
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:12,776
Yes. l can.
a
Unless Ben tells me the next clue.

1280
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,280
There isn't another clue.

1281
01:48:15,622 --> 01:48:19,542
lan, why don't you come back down here
and we can talk through this together?

1282
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,380
- Don't speak again.
- OK.

1283
01:48:24,131 --> 01:48:27,731
The clue. Where's the treasure?

1284
01:48:29,336 --> 01:48:30,296
Ben?

1285
01:48:33,507 --> 01:48:35,317
- The lantern.
- Dad...

1286
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:39,061
The status quo has changed, son.

1287
01:48:39,413 --> 01:48:40,782
Don't.

1288
01:48:44,018 --> 01:48:47,388
It's part of freemason teachings.

1289
01:48:47,921 --> 01:48:50,941
In King Solomon's temple
there was a winding staircase.

1290
01:48:51,425 --> 01:48:56,665
It signified the journey that had to be made
to find the light of truth.

1291
01:48:57,464 --> 01:49:00,864
- The lantern is the clue.
- And what does it mean?

1292
01:49:01,402 --> 01:49:03,622
Boston. It's Boston.

1293
01:49:04,004 --> 01:49:05,494
The Old North Church in Boston.
a

1294
01:49:05,773 --> 01:49:08,843
where Thomas Newton
hung a lantern in the steeple,

1295
01:49:09,343 --> 01:49:12,803
to signal Paul Revere that the British
were coming. One if by land, two if by sea.

1296
01:49:13,347 --> 01:49:17,947
One lantern. Under the winding staircase
of the steeple, that’s where we have to look.

1297
01:49:18,652 --> 01:49:21,612
- Thank you.
- Hey, you have to take us with you.

1298
01:49:22,089 --> 01:49:24,899
Why? So you can escape in Boston?

1299
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:28,519
Besides, with you out of the picture
there's less baggage to carry.

1300
01:49:29,029 --> 01:49:31,019
What if we lied?

1301
01:49:31,365 --> 01:49:32,474
Did you?

1302
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:35,129
What if there's another clue?

1303
01:49:35,536 --> 01:49:37,436
Then I'll know right where to find you.

1304
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,135
See you, Ben.

1305
01:49:43,911 --> 01:49:45,431
- No!
- There's no other way out!

1306
01:49:45,712 --> 01:49:47,522
- Come back!
- You're gonna need us, lan!

1307
01:49:48,782 --> 01:49:50,892
We're all gonna die.

1308
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:54,791
It's gonna be OK, Riley.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1309
01:49:55,355 --> 01:49:57,224
It's OK. kiddo.
a

1310
01:49:57,558 --> 01:50:02,508
OK, boys, what's going on? The British
came by sea. It was two lanterns, not one.

1311
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:06,073
lan needed another clue.
a
so we gave it to him.

1312
01:50:06,533 --> 01:50:09,083
It was a fake.
It was a fake clue.

1313
01:50:09,503 --> 01:50:11,782
The all-seeing eye.

1314
01:50:12,172 --> 01:50:14,342
"Through the all-seeing eye.”

1315
01:50:15,409 --> 01:50:18,039
That means... by the time lan
figures it out and comes back here,

1316
01:50:18,479 --> 01:50:21,759
we'll still be trapped,
and he'll shoot us then.

1317
01:50:22,716 --> 01:50:25,056
Either way, we're gonna die.

1318
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:29,120
Nobody's gonna die.
There's another way out.

1319
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:31,020
Where?

1320
01:50:31,225 --> 01:50:33,535
Through the treasure room.

1321
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:42,384
Here.

1322
01:50:52,412 --> 01:50:53,962
Riley.

1323
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:23,794
Looks like someone got here first.

1324
01:51:25,445 --> 01:51:27,695
I'm sorry, Ben.

1325
01:51:28,081 --> 01:51:29,691
It's gone.

1326
01:51:32,419 --> 01:51:34,789
- Listen. Ben...
a
- It may have even been gone

1327
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:38,619
before Charles Carroll
told the story to Thomas Gates.

1328
01:51:40,294 --> 01:51:42,164
It doesn't matter.

1329
01:51:42,496 --> 01:51:45,106
I know. 'Cause you were right.

1330
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:48,052
No, I wasn't right.

1331
01:51:48,468 --> 01:51:50,838
This room is real, Ben.
a

1332
01:51:51,238 --> 01:51:53,288
And that means the treasure is real.

1333
01:51:54,074 --> 01:51:56,563
We're in the company of
some of the most brilliant minds in history,

1334
01:51:56,977 --> 01:52:00,347
because you found
what they left behind for us to find

1335
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:03,161
and understood the meaning of it.

1336
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:06,130
You did it, Ben. For all of us.
a

1337
01:52:07,487 --> 01:52:10,387
Your grandfather, and all of us.

1338
01:52:11,258 --> 01:52:14,798
And I've never been so happy
to be proven wrong.

1339
01:52:25,639 --> 01:52:27,539
I just...

1340
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:30,594
really thought
Il was gonna find the treasure.

1341
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:34,612
OK.

1342
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:37,345
Then we just keep looking for it.

1343
01:52:40,954 --> 01:52:42,704
I'm in.

1344
01:52:47,661 --> 01:52:49,271
OK.

1345
01:52:51,098 --> 01:52:53,878
Not to be Johnny Rain Cloud here,
but that's not gonna happen.

1346
01:52:54,334 --> 01:52:57,264
Because as far as I can see.
a
we're still trapped down here.

1347
01:52:57,738 --> 01:52:59,228
Yeah.

1348
01:53:00,307 --> 01:53:01,977
Now, Ben,
oe
where is this other way out?

1349
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:04,116
Well. that's it.
a
It doesn't make any sense,

1350
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:07,254
because the first thing the builders
would have done after getting down here

1351
01:53:07,714 --> 01:53:10,404
was cut a secondary shaft back out for air...

1352
01:53:10,851 --> 01:53:13,630
- Right.
- ..and in case of cave-ins.

1353
01:53:36,243 --> 01:53:38,963
Could it really be that simple?

1354
01:53:43,784 --> 01:53:45,744
"The secret lies with Charlotte.”

1355
01:55:13,974 --> 01:55:16,604
Scrolls from the library at Alexandria.

1356
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:20,719
Could this be possible?

1357
01:55:40,467 --> 01:55:44,916
It's a big... bluish-green man,

1358
01:55:45,605 --> 01:55:48,125
with a strange-looking goatee.

1359
01:55:48,542 --> 01:55:51,002
I'm guessing that's significant.

1360
01:56:40,727 --> 01:56:41,597
Yes!

1361
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:55,910
Riley, are you crying?

1362
01:56:56,309 --> 01:56:58,149
Look.

1363
01:56:58,478 --> 01:57:00,378
Stairs.

1364
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:18,773
Hi.

1365
01:57:19,099 --> 01:57:20,849
Do you have a cell phone I could borrow?

1366
01:57:34,214 --> 01:57:36,844
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1367
01:57:37,284 --> 01:57:40,214
You do know you just handed me
your biggest bargaining chip?

1368
01:57:40,687 --> 01:57:43,587
The Declaration of Independence
is not a bargaining chip.

1369
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:45,577
Not to me.

1370
01:57:45,859 --> 01:57:47,379
Have a seat.

1371
01:57:48,028 --> 01:57:50,138
So what's your offer?

1372
01:57:50,997 --> 01:57:53,577
How about a bribe? Say...

1373
01:57:54,935 --> 01:57:57,835
ten billion dollars?

1374
01:57:58,305 --> 01:57:59,765
I take it you found the treasure?

1375
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,320
It's about five stories
beneath your shoes.

1376
01:58:06,446 --> 01:58:08,316
You know, the Templars
and the Freemasons believed

1377
01:58:08,648 --> 01:58:12,808
that the treasure was too great
for any one man to have, not even a king.

1378
01:58:13,453 --> 01:58:16,763
That's why they went to such lengths
to keep it hidden.

1379
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:19,400
That's right.

1380
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:22,889
The Founding Fathers believed
the same thing about government.

1381
01:58:23,396 --> 01:58:26,266
I figure their solution
will work for the treasure too.

1382
01:58:27,133 --> 01:58:28,093
Give it to the people.

1383
01:58:28,301 --> 01:58:32,781
Divide it amongst the Smithsonian,
the Louvre. the Cairo museum...
a

1384
01:58:33,473 --> 01:58:36,223
There's thousands of years
of world history down there.

1385
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:40,576
And it belongs to the world,
and everybody in it.

1386
01:58:41,181 --> 01:58:44,460
You really don't understand
the concept of a bargaining chip.

1387
01:58:45,518 --> 01:58:49,618
OK, here's what I want.
a
Dr. Chase gets off completely clean,

1388
01:58:50,256 --> 01:58:52,096
hot even a little Post-it
on her service record.

1389
01:58:52,425 --> 01:58:53,215
OK.

1390
01:58:53,393 --> 01:58:58,873
I want the credit for the find
to go to the entire Gates family,

1391
01:58:59,699 --> 01:59:02,159
with the assistance of Mr. Riley Poole.

1392
01:59:02,569 --> 01:59:04,619
And what about you?

1393
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:06,750
I'd really love not to go to prison.

1394
01:59:07,073 --> 01:59:11,433
I can't even begin to describe
how much I would love not to go to prison.

1395
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:15,999
Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.

1396
01:59:16,449 --> 01:59:20,989
Well, if you've got a helicopter,
I think I can help with that.

1397
01:59:30,063 --> 01:59:32,113
Freeze! FBI!

1398
01:59:34,501 --> 01:59:36,491
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

1399
01:59:38,605 --> 01:59:41,644
- Put your hands up.
- Move, move, move.
a

1400
01:59:45,712 --> 01:59:47,382
You're under arrest. Mr. Howe.
a

1401
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:50,641
We've got you on kidnapping,
attempted murder...

1402
01:59:51,117 --> 01:59:53,747
and trespassing on government property.

1403
02:00:02,462 --> 02:00:04,952
Yeah. You got it, chief.
Thank you. Bye.

1404
02:00:06,433 --> 02:00:09,063
They want us in Cairo next week
for the opening of the exhibit.

1405
02:00:09,502 --> 02:00:11,172
They're sending a private jet.

1406
02:00:11,471 --> 02:00:12,580
That's fun.

1407
02:00:12,806 --> 02:00:16,175
Yeah, big whoop. We could have had
a whole fleet of private jets.

1408
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:19,520
Ten percent, Ben. They offered you
ten percent and you turned it down.

1409
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:23,019
Riley, we've been over this.
It was too much. I couldn't accept it.

1410
02:00:23,516 --> 02:00:27,175
I still have this splinter that's been festering
for three months from an old piece of wood.

1411
02:00:27,754 --> 02:00:28,684
OK, I'll tell you what.

1412
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:32,258
Next time we find a treasure
that redefines history for all mankind,

1413
02:00:32,792 --> 02:00:34,542
you make the call on the finder's fee.

1414
02:00:34,861 --> 02:00:37,050
That's not as funny.

1415
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:39,240
What clo you care?
You got the girl.

1416
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,990
- It's true.
- It's true.

1417
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:47,474
Rub it in.
Enjoy your spoils...

1418
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:49,996
while I sit on one percent.

1419
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:54,461
One stinkin’ percent.
Half of one percent, actually.

1420
02:00:55,315 --> 02:00:57,485
One percent. Unbelievable.

1421
02:00:57,851 --> 02:00:59,601
I'm sorry for your suffering, Riley.

1422
02:00:59,919 --> 02:01:03,759
For the record, Ben,
oe
l like the house.

1423
02:01:04,357 --> 02:01:07,377
You know. I chose this estate
a
because in 1812 Charles Carroll met...

1424
02:01:07,861 --> 02:01:12,111
Yeah, someone that did something
in history and had fun. Great. Wonderful.

1425
02:01:12,766 --> 02:01:14,286
Could have had a bigger house.

1426
02:01:23,276 --> 02:01:26,556
- [made something for you.
- You did? What?

1427
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,830
-Amap.
-A map?

1428
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:32,250
Where cles it lead to?

1429
02:01:32,552 --> 02:01:35,132
You'll figure it out.
