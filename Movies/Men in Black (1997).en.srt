1
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,218
Goddamn bugs.

2
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,960
Oh, shit!

3
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,437
Oh, crap.

4
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,171
Well, Nick the Dick.
What a surprise.

5
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,767
Where you coming from, Nick?

6
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,358
Fishing in Cuernavaca.

7
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,851
Sure you are.
Let’s take a look at your catch.

8
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,451
Come on.

9
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,756
Me? I would’ve thrown them back.

10
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,945
What do you get?
100 bucks a head? 200?

11
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,581
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer.
You are gonna need it.

12
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,751
We'll take it from here.

13
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,454
Who the hell are you?

14
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,066
ILN.S., Division 6.

15
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,521
Division 6?
I never heard of Division 6.

16
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,070
Really?

17
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,928
Who you got your money on, Dee?

18
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,114
Tough call, Kay.

19
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,419
- We've got a winner here.
- Oh, I know.

20
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,604
Sir--

21
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,890
Don’t "sir" me, young man. You have
no idea who you’re dealing with.

22
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,620
We're going to chat with our friend.
You can hit the road.

23
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,604
Keep on protecting us
from the dangerous aliens.

24
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,125
You ever hear of Division 6?

25
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,294
There is no Division 6.

26
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,423
- This is bullshit.
- Hell, yeah.

27
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,046
Looks like you fell off the bus
in the wrong part of town, amigo.

28
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,417
I'll bet dollars to pesos
you’re not from anywhere near here.

29
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,837
Mikey?

30
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,786
When did they let you out of jail?

31
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,232
Political refugee. Right.

32
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,697
You know how many treaties
you just violated?

33
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,521
- One!
- Try seven.

34
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,092
That’s enough, Mikey.
You hand me that head.

35
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,373
Put up your arms
and all your flippers.

36
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,406
Shit.

37
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,152
Shoot him!

38
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:21,994
That.

39
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,703
-.Wa-Wa-Wa--

40
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,207
Was not human. ! know.
You got some entrails on you, pal.

41
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,892
What the hell?

42
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,521
The situation’s under control.
Calm down, please.

43
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,910
Give me your attention for a moment.
I'll tell you what happened.

44
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,209
This is called a neuralizer.

45
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,527
It’s a gift from some friends
from out of town.

46
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,540
This red eye isolates...

47
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,649
the electronic impulses in your brains,
specifically memory.

48
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,673
Fellas, give me a splay burn around
the perimeter with holes...

49
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,186
at 40, 60 and 80 meters
from right here. Thank you.

50
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,816
Good. Thank you.

51
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,611
- What in the hell is going on?
- Excellent question.

52
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,457
The answer you're looking for
lies right here.

53
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,443
Who are you, really?

54
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:22,605
Really?

55
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,523
lam just a figment
of your imagination.

56
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,054
Damn, what a gullible breed.

57
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,567
I’m serious, fellas. You're lucky
to be alive after a blast like that.

58
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,544
- What blast?
- The underground gas vein, genius.

59
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,034
You should exercise a lot more
caution before firing.

60
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,790
I'll tell you that right now.
Especially you.

61
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,104
Have yourselves checked out
with E.M.S. before you leave.

62
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,853
I’m sorry about back there.

63
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,454
That happens.

64
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,173
Didn’t used to.

65
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,266
The spirit’s willing, Kay, but...

66
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,180
the rest of me--

67
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,951
They're beautiful, aren’t they?

68
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,246
What?

69
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,921
The stars.

70
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,847
We never just look anymore.

71
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,935
No.

72
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,214
I'll tell you, Kay...

73
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,175
I will miss the chase.

74
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:36,376
I will miss the chase.

75
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,468
No, Dee...

76
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,685
you won't.

77
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,083
Freeze!

78
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,288
N.Y.P.D., freeze!

79
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,218
All yours, Edwards.

80
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,788
Freeze means stop!

81
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,705
What the hell?

82
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,043
It just be raining black people
in New York.

83
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,034
Do you see this?

84
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,079
N.Y.P.D.!

85
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,918
It means I will knock
your punk-ass down!

86
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,657
He’s coming!

87
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,473
Yeah, and when he gets here,
I'll arrest his ass too.

88
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,705
You trying to catch a beat down?

89
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,412
What’s up?

90
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,399
He’s coming.

91
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,380
He’s coming because ! failed.
Now he'll kill me.

92
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,949
You pissing everybody off today, huh?

93
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,464
You don’t understand.

94
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,805
Your world’s going to end.

95
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,220
What the hell are you?

96
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,102
Watch that ledge.
Watch it.

97
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,924
Come down. We'll get those eyes fixed.
Don’t even worry about it.

98
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,324
Wait a minute.
Let me talk to you!

99
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,040
1 go out. ! work my butt off
to make a living.

100
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,306
All 1 want is to come home
toa nice clean house...

101
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,389
with a nice fat steak
on the table...

102
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,341
but instead get this.
Looks like poison.

103
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:56,662
but instead get this.
Looks like poison.

104
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,175
Don't you take that away!
I'm eating that, damn it!

105
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,748
ft is poison, isn’t it?

106
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,440
! swear to God,
! wouldn't be surprised if it was...

107
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,290
the way you skulk around
like a dog been hit too much,

108
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,906
Or ain't been hit enough!
‘ can't make up my mind.

109
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,989
You're useless, Beatrice.

110
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,661
The only thing that pulls its weight
around here is my goddamn truck!

111
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,714
Figures.

112
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,342
What the heck is it, Edgar?

113
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,711
Get your big butt
back in the house.

114
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,659
Place projectile weapon
on the ground.

115
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,780
You can have my gun...

116
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,152
when you pry it
from my cold, dead fingers.

117
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,556
Your proposal is acceptable.

118
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,762
Edgar, what on earth was that?

119
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,174
Sugar.

120
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,704
I’ve never seen sugar do that.

121
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,926
Give me sugar.

122
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,236
In water.

123
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,860
More.

124
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,598
More.

125
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,161
Your skin is hanging
off your bones.

126
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,345
Oh, yeah.

127
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,001
Is that better?

128
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,972
"The perpetrator then blinked
two sets of eyelids."

129
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,124
You mean blinked with both eyes?

130
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,252
No, sir. He blinked one set,
then a completely different set.

131
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,933
You know, like high beams
and low beams.

132
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,877
Was that before...

133
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,102
or after he drew the weapon that you
claim evaporated into a million pieces?

134
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,333
After, sir.

135
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,696
Why is it that no other officers
saw either of these events?

136
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,860
Some other officers are soggy
around the midsection.

137
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,049
I guess that’s why
they couldn’t keep up.

138
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,858
If you were half the man ! am--

139
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,506
What the hell?
lam Aaff the man that you are.

140
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,976
- What is your problem?
- You being all up in my damn face.

141
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,526
-] think he threw him off the roof.
- Maybe you’re next.

142
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,932
-l want to talk to you. Now.
- Ten minutes, take your best shot.

143
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,780
Take ten minutes on a Stairmaster,
you pudgy bastard.

144
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,192
I believe you.
Laurel Weaver, Deputy Medical Examiner.

145
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,345
Find me at the morgue on 26th.
l’ll show you.

146
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,564
Wait.

147
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,875
Wait a minute!

148
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,777
You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner’s
office working on the John Doe?

149
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,521
- Yes, that’s right.
- Will you look at this, please?

150
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,457
Some night, huh?

151
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,025
Yeah, some night.

152
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,895
They were gills, not eyelids.

153
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,104
Gills.
He was out of breath.

154
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,260
Who are you?

155
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,101
Did he say anything to you?

156
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,234
Yeah, the world was coming to an end.

157
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,024
Did he say when?

158
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,494
Would you recognize his weapon
if you saw it again?

159
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,216
Absolutely.

160
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,520
Come on. Let’s take a ride.

161
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,442
Wait a minute.
Look, ! got tons of paperwork--

162
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,902
- Right. It’s all done.
- Good work, Edwards.

163
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,831
You really ran this dude down on foot?
That’s tough, kid.

164
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,714
That’s double tough.

165
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,198
So who exactly are you with?

166
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,929
So who exactly are you with?

167
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,374
FBL?NSA?

168
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,797
I'm part ofa bureau
that licenses, monitors and polices...

169
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,188
alien activity
on the planet Earth.

170
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,712
Whatever.

171
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,253
Were here.

172
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,790
- This is where we're going?
- Yeah.

173
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,612
This is Jack Jeebs’ spot.
He buys from chain snatchers.

174
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,956
- He doesn’t even sell guns.
- Really?

175
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,458
All right, look.

176
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,349
I'll slide in and put my thing down.
But when I come out ! want answers.

177
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,476
Go put your thing down.

178
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,110
Officer Eduardo.

179
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,090
How did these get here? ! thought
I turned them in to the authorities.

180
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,559
The way I hear it you’re into
something hotter than stolen Rolexes.

181
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,622
I’m a huge crack dealer now,
but I work here as I love the hours.

182
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,476
I’m talking about guns, smart ass.

183
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,812
- Weird ones.
- Come on. What you see is what ! got.

184
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,370
Why don’t you
show him the imports, Jeebs?

185
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,347
- Hiya, Kay. How are you?
- Show him the imports right now.

186
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,727
I got out of that business
along time ago.

187
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,783
- Why do you lie to me? I hate it.
- Just hold on a second.

188
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,133
- I’m gonna count to three.
- He'll do it, Jeebs.

189
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,338
- One...
- That man does not look stable.

190
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,355
- He’s crazy when he’s like this.
- He’s always crazy.

191
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,725
Why don’t you get a massage?
Take a cruise.

192
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,734
- Drop the weapon. Hands on your head!
-l warned him.

193
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,320
- Drop it! Don’t make me kill you.
- You warned him.

194
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,703
You insensitive prick!

195
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,880
Do you have any idea
how much that stings?

196
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,629
Show us the merchandise
or you'll lose another head, Jeebs.

197
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,677
Mr. Edwards?

198
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,827
Right there.
The one in the middle.

199
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,339
You sold a reverberating carbonizer
with mutate capacity...

200
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,136
to an unlicensed cephlapoid!
Jeebs, you piece of--

201
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,985
He looked all right to me.

202
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,070
- Assassination. Who’s the target?
-1 don’t know.

203
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,370
- Goddamn it, Jeebs!
-1 don’t know!

204
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,060
All that’s confiscated.

205
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,085
I want you on the next transport
off this rock...

206
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,454
or I'll shoot you
where it don’t grow back.

207
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,434
And I’m going to be back to talk
about them Rolexes.

208
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,306
Searching for a handle
on the moment?

209
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,600
I can’t help you.

210
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,236
The only comfort I can offer...

211
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,541
is my promise that tomorrow morning
you won't remember a thing.

212
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,915
That’s not exactly
some shit you just forget.

213
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,627
Ever seen one of these?

214
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,546
She looks over to her husband...

215
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,805
then sets it back down
in her lap and says...

216
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:39,142
"Honey, this one’s eating my popcorn."

217
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,805
Get it?

218
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,786
- Yeah.
- "Eating my popcorn."

219
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,797
Gotta go.
Thanks for the egg rolls, kid.

220
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,452
Wait a minute.

221
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,880
Who are you?

222
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,302
See what I mean about tequila?
You're a bright young man, James.

223
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,251
But you need to lay off the sauce.
l’ll see you bright and early, 9:00.

224
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,989
Be there...

225
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,314
or be square.

226
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,137
Well, well, well.

227
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,142
Moving right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

228
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,935
I got an eviction notice
for you boys.

229
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,624
Just what exactly do you think
you're doing here?

230
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,980
Taking care of your pest problem.

231
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:38,663
Pest problem?

232
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,848
Pest?

233
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,083
Yeah, you got
a hell of an infestation.

234
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,919
You know, I’ve noticed
an infestation here.

235
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,792
Everywhere I look in fact.

236
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:51,547
Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved,
barely conscious pond scum...

237
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,504
totally convinced
of their own superiority...

238
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,956
as they scurry about their short...

239
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,979
pointless lives.

240
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,022
Well, yeah.

241
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,823
Don’t you want to get rid of them?

242
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,726
In the worst way.

243
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:42,984
Help you?

244
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,329
This dude gave me this card--

245
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:46,828
Elevator.

246
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,674
You're late. Sit down.

247
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,420
My name is Zed.

248
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,302
You're all here because you’re
the best of the best.

249
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:29,508
Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALs,
Army Rangers, N.Y.P.D.

250
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:31,712
And we’re looking
for one of you.

251
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,374
Just one.

252
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,185
What will follow is a series
of simple tests...

253
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,008
for motor skills,
concentration, stamina.

254
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,339
I see we have a question.

255
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,435
I’m sorry,
maybe you already answered this but...

256
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,634
why exactly are we here?

257
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,113
Son.

258
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,502
Second Lieutenant Jake Jensen.
West Point. Graduate with honors.

259
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,578
We're here because you want
the best of the best of the best, sir!

260
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,767
What’s so funny, Edwards?

261
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,193
Your boy, Captain America, here.

262
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,256
"The best of the best
of the best, sir!"

263
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,281
"with honors."

264
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:15,014
He’s just really excited,
and he has no clue why we’re here.

265
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,734
That’s very funny to me.

266
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,128
Y’all ain’t laughing, though.

267
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,844
Okay, let’s get going.

268
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,817
Want to get down on this?

269
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,418
Edwards, what the hell happened?

270
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,347
Hesitated.

271
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,728
May I ask why you felt
little Tiffany deserved to die?

272
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,392
She was the only one that actually
seemed dangerous at the time, sir.

273
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,063
How’d you decide that?

274
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,871
First, l was going to pop this guy
hanging from the streetlight...

275
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,871
but I realized
he’s just working out.

276
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,671
How'd I feel if somebody bust me
in my ass while I’m on the treadmill?

277
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,661
Then I saw
this snarling beast guy...

278
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,147
and I noticed he had a tissue
in his hand and realized...

279
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,463
he’s not snarling, he’s sneezing.

280
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,145
Ain’t no real threat there.

281
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,716
Then I saw Tiffany.

282
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,495
I’m thinking, eight-year-old white girl,
middle of the ghetto...

283
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,591
bunch of monsters at night
with quantum physics books.

284
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,745
She about to start some shit, Zed.

285
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,510
She’s about eight. Those books are
way too advanced for her.

286
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,030
If you ask me,
she’s up to something.

287
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,998
Honestly, I’d appreciate it
if you eased up off my back about it.

288
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,279
Or do I owe her an apology?

289
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,314
That was a good shot though, right?

290
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,862
He’s got a real problem
with authority.

291
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,381
So dol.

292
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,813
But this kid ran down a cephlapoid
on foot, boss.

293
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,036
That’s got to be tough enough.

294
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,112
Let’s hope you know
what you're doing.

295
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,402
Gentlemen.

296
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,784
Congratulations.
You're all we’ve come to expect...

297
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,954
from years
of government training.

298
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,993
If you'll just follow me,
we have one more test. An eye exam.

299
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,451
Where are you going?

300
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,127
Hey, man, what the hell
is all this?

301
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,059
In the mid-1950s the government
started an underfunded agency...

302
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,779
with the simple and laughable purpose
of establishing contact...

303
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,777
with a race not of this planet.

304
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,500
Look directly at the end
of this device.

305
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,626
Everyone thought the agency was a joke,
except the aliens...

306
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,096
who made contact March 2, 1961,
outside New York.

307
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,330
There were nine of us
the first night.

308
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,488
Seven agents, one astronomer...

309
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,897
and one dumb kid who got lost
on the wrong back road.

310
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,832
Oh, you brought
that tall man some flowers.

311
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,793
This way.

312
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,079
They were a group
of intergalactic refugees.

313
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,891
Wanted Earth for an apolitical zone
for creatures without a planet.

314
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,012
Did you ever see "Casablanca"?

315
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,001
Same thing, except no Nazis.

316
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,143
We agreed and concealed
all the evidence of their landing.

317
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,290
So these are real flying saucers...

318
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,539
and the World’s Fair
was a cover-up for their landing?

319
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,217
Why else hold it in Queens?

320
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,969
More nonhumans arrive every year
and live among us in secret.

321
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:20,206
Look, I’m sorry.
Not to change the subject...

322
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,369
but when was the last time
you had a CAT scan?

323
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,438
Six months ago.
It’s company policy.

324
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,366
Make another appointment.

325
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,408
Tell your boy Zed
I had an absolutely wonderful time...

326
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,611
and thank you for everything
but show me the door.

327
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:36,025
All right. I’m going to get some coffee.
You want some coffee?

328
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,110
No, thank you, I’m fine.

329
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,234
How you doing, fellas?

330
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,559
- Shit!
- Okay.

331
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,626
- That’s not decaf, is it?
- Viennese cinnamon.

332
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,692
Don’t tell me we only got powdered stuff
for cream. I hate that stuff.

333
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,088
Well, that’s good.
Good. Good.

334
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,651
You guys getting along all right?

335
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,887
Don’t work too hard.

336
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,981
So, you guys seen
the cahuengas on--

337
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,050
Sure you don’t want coffee?

338
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,692
Cahuengas, yeah,
but how about the zapoata?

339
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,883
All right, kid,
here’s the deal.

340
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,106
At any given time there are
around 1,500 aliens on the planet.

341
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,540
Most of them
right here in Manhattan.

342
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,492
Most of them are decent enough.
Just trying to make a living.

343
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,257
- Cab drivers.
- Not as many as you’d think.

344
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,835
Humans, for the most part, don’t have
a clue. Don’t want or need one.

345
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:37,331
They're happy. They think
they have a good bead on things.

346
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,783
Why the big secret? People are smart.
They can handle it.

347
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,476
A person is smart.

348
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,303
People are dumb, panicky,
dangerous animals. You know it.

349
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,312
Fifteen hundred years ago,
everybody knew...

350
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,088
the Earth was the center
of the universe.

351
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,451
Five hundred years ago,
everybody knew the Earth was flat.

352
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,756
And fifteen minutes ago, you knew
that people were alone on this planet.

353
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,703
Imagine what you'll know...

354
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,426
tomorrow.

355
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,933
- What’s the catch?
- The catch.

356
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,002
The catch is you will sever
every human contact.

357
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,207
Nobody will ever know
you exist anywhere.

358
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,413
Ever.

359
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,823
l’ll give you to sunrise
to think it over.

360
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:31,842
Is it worth it?

361
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,577
Yeah, it’s worth it...

362
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,481
if you’re strong enough.

363
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,992
What’s up, pops?

364
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,771
All right, I’m in...

365
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,049
because there’s some next-level shit
going on here, and I’m with that.

366
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,463
But before y'all beam me up,
there’s a few things to understand.

367
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,686
First off, you chose me...

368
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,675
so you recognize the skills.

369
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:05,342
I don’t want nobody calling me "son"
or "kid" or "sport." Cool?

370
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,187
Whatever you say, slick.

371
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,965
But I need to tell you something
about all your skills.

372
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:12,783
As of right now...

373
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:13,394
As of right now...

374
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,162
they mean precisely...

375
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,763
dick.

376
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,308
- Purpose of trip?
- Diplomatic mission.

377
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,754
- Duration of stay?
- Lunch.

378
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,420
Any fruits or vegetables?

379
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,043
You want to stay away
from that guy.

380
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,818
He’s grouchy.

381
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,812
Three-hour delay in customs
after a 17 trillion mile trip...

382
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,013
gonna make anybody cranky.
Right?

383
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,082
What branch of the government
do we report to?

384
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,890
- None, they ask too many questions.
- So who pays for all this?

385
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,763
We hold patents on a few gadgets
we confiscated from the visitors.

386
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,917
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

387
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,094
This is a fascinating little gadget.

388
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,022
It'll replace CDs soon.

389
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,154
Guess I'll have to buy
the "White Album” again.

390
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,233
That’s fun.
It’s a universal translator.

391
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,602
We're not even supposed to have it.
I'll tell you why.

392
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,944
Human thought is so primitive
it’s looked upon...

393
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,950
as an infectious disease
in some of the better galaxies.

394
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,143
That kind of makes you proud,
doesn’t it?

395
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,632
What’s this?

396
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,700
Just be calm.

397
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:37,955
Relax!

398
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,320
Watch your head!

399
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,185
Somebody get him some ice.

400
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:46,018
Move! Just move
when it’s coming at you!

401
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,270
Damn!

402
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,475
I’m going to pay for that!

403
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,718
This thing caused
the 1977 New York blackout.

404
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,959
Practical joke by the Great Attractor.

405
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,948
He thought it was funny as hell.

406
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,651
Sorry, yall.

407
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,293
It was a accident.
Sorry.

408
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,002
Observation,
the heart of our little endeavor.

409
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,398
Meet the twins Blblup and Bob.

410
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,197
This map shows the location
of every registered alien on Earth...

411
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,106
at any given time.
Some are under constant surveillance.

412
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,756
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

413
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,722
In public, they're normal as you are,
but in private, well...

414
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:38,502
You'll get the idea.

415
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,074
Oh, man.

416
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,082
Doesn’t make any sense, does it?

417
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,869
Well, no,
it makes perfect sense.

418
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:50,706
When I was in third grade,
everyone said I was crazy...

419
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,576
but I knew our teacher was
from Venus or something like that.

420
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,168
Ms. Edelson. Jupiter, actually.
Well, one of the moons.

421
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,293
Class...

422
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:03,542
be quiet and pay attention!

423
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,857
lf 1 have to telf you
one more time--

424
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,660
Edwards!

425
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,124
Let’s put it on.

426
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,799
Put what on?

427
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,815
The last suit you'll ever wear.

428
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,997
You will dress only in attire
specially sanctioned...

429
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,252
by MIB special services.

430
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,465
You'll conform to the identity
-
We give you.

431
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,500
Eat where we telf you.
Live where we tell you.

432
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,361
From now on...

433
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,933
you'll have no identifying marks
of any kind.

434
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,959
You'll not stand out
-
invany Way.

435
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,888
Your entire image is crafted to leave...

436
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,290
no lasting memory
with anyone you encounter.

437
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,091
You are a rumor...

438
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,070
recognizable only as déjé vu
and dismissed just as quickly.

439
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,730
You don’t exist.
You were never even born.

440
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:07,334
Anonymity is your name.
Silence, your native tongue.

441
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,350
You're no fonger part of the system.

442
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,300
You're above the system.
Over it. Beyond it.

443
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,417
Were "them." We're "they.”

444
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:21,794
We are the Men in Black.

445
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,880
You know what the difference is
between you and me?

446
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,596
I make this look good.

447
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:40,198
We're going to go for a ride.

448
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,706
l’ll put you down here for a minute
then Daddy will be right back.

449
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,784
Okay, now we’re ready
to go for a little ride.

450
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,064
We're going to meet
with Daddy’s friend who you'll like.

451
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,564
Let’s see.

452
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,419
Bee...

453
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,214
we've got the deposed sur-prefect
of Singalee...

454
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:34,827
touching down in the forest
outside Portland tonight.

455
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,696
- Humanoid?
- You wish. Bring a sponge.

456
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,043
And here.
Red letter from last night.

457
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:44,593
We had an unauthorized landing
somewhere in upstate New York.

458
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,949
Kay, keep your ears open
on this one.

459
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:50,384
We're not hosting
an intergalactic kegger down here.

460
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,017
Well, we got a skimmer.

461
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,281
Landed alien out of zone.
Who is it?

462
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:57,648
Redgick.

463
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,472
He’s not cleared
to leave Manhattan...

464
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,984
but he’s way out of town now,
stuck on the New Jersey Turnpike.

465
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,111
Why don’t you take junior with you?

466
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,923
This is a good one
for him to warm up on.

467
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,793
Go get him, tiger.

468
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,667
"We're not hosting
an intergalactic kegger."

469
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,162
Zed.

470
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,447
He just...

471
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,977
Unlimited technology
from the whole universe...

472
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,969
and we cruise around
in a Ford P.O.S.

473
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,408
Fasten your seat belt.

474
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,033
We got to work
on your people skills.

475
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,705
You’d get a much better reaction
if you were more polite.

476
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,145
- Fasten your seat belt, please.
- Good. Did you hurt yourself?

477
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,698
Oh, the red button there.
Don’t ever, ever touch it.

478
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,383
All right, pop,
that'll be $72 there.

479
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:07,993
Okay, sweetie,
let me pay the impolite driver.

480
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,256
Six is up!

481
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,055
- Where is lvan?
- Gave him a break.

482
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,268
You can kill us both,
but you will not find the galaxy.

483
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,545
You're right about one thing.

484
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,528
You're not going anywhere, pal.

485
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,410
What’s going on?

486
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,647
I'd like to see
your license and registration, please.

487
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,706
Like to see your other license
and registration, please.

488
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:39,157
You're restricted to Manhattan.
Where are you going, Redgie?

489
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:43,178
It’s my wife.
She’s-- Well, look.

490
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,708
All right. No big deal.

491
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,967
Okay, you come with me, Redge.

492
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,214
And you handle this.

493
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:56,553
What! Me?

494
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,547
It’s easy.
You just catch.

495
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,509
- He knows what he’s doing?
- He does it all the time.

496
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,115
Let the man work.

497
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,862
Damn, man! So--
Something’s peaking!

498
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,035
Croagg the midwife is
at 54th and Madison.

499
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:18,374
You're headed out of town.
What’s going on?

500
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:20,623
- We're meeting someone.
- Who you meeting?

501
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:21,978
It’s aship.

502
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:23,943
I saw no departure clearance
for today.

503
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,722
- You didn’t?
-No.

504
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,636
-t’s an emergency.
- Kay! Kay!

505
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,982
- You're doing fine, ace.
- Kiss my ass!

506
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,384
What kind of emergency?
What’s the rush to get off the planet?

507
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:34,047
Excuse me, miss.

508
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,205
We just don’t like
the neighborhood anymore.

509
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,441
Some of the new arrivals.

510
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,616
New arrivals? Have anything to do
with the crash last night?

511
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,539
Excuse me, miss!

512
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,661
Oh, man.

513
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,963
Oh, man!

514
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,110
Look.

515
00:44:54,325 --> 00:44:55,964
Oh, man.

516
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,528
Congratulations, Redge.
It’s a.

517
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,008
squid.

518
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,306
He’s...

519
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,081
actually kind of...

520
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,390
cute.

521
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,622
Anything about that
seem unusual to you?

522
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:33,243
What would scare Redgick so badly
he’d risk a warp jump with a newborn?

523
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:35,875
We'll check the hot sheets.

524
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,049
These are the hot sheets?

525
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,057
Best investigative reporting
on the planet.

526
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:48,476
Read the "New York Times" if you want.
They get lucky sometimes.

527
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,910
I cannot believe you’re looking
for tips in the supermarket tabloids.

528
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:55,478
Not looking for.

529
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,171
Found.

530
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,112
Wait, slow down.

531
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:14,534
Why?

532
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,105
Give her time to get the wrong
impression. Makes things smoother.

533
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,253
Can! help you, gentlemen?

534
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,531
Yes, ma’am. I’m Agent Manheim,
this is Agent Black, with the F.B.I.

535
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:25,765
We'd like to talk about your visitor.

536
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,543
You here to make fun of me too?

537
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:31,358
We at the F.B.I. do not have a sense
of humor we’re aware of. May we come in?

538
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34,394
Sure.

539
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,134
- Thank you.
- Lemonade?

540
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:37,703
Oh, yes, please.

541
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,616
The chief of police himself come
up to the house...

542
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,809
and did a full-out
professional investigation.

543
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:49,775
Took a police report
and writ down everything I said...

544
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,481
from A to Z,
not believing one thing I said.

545
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:54,607
Sort of poking fun at me.

546
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,841
Then they asked,
"If he was murdered...

547
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,431
how was he able to walk
back in the house?”

548
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,707
I gotta admit to you
that one got me sorta stumped.

549
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,494
But I know Edgar
and that wasn’t Edgar.

550
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:10,035
It was like
something was wearing Edgar.

551
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,022
Like a suit.

552
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:16,015
An Edgar suit.

553
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,520
Dude was that ugly
before he was an alien.

554
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,449
I’m sorry.

555
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:31,918
Goon.

556
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:34,104
Anyway...

557
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:36,255
I come to and he’s gone.

558
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,411
- Did he say anything?
- Yes.

559
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,400
He asked me for some water.

560
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,936
Some sugar water.

561
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:46,842
- Sugar water?
- Yeah, l remember that right.

562
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,691
Cause I thought that was odd.

563
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,090
That he asked me for sugar water
and not lemonade or ice water or...

564
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:54,870
regular water or...

565
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,416
tap water.

566
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,958
All right, Beatrice.
There was no alien.

567
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,684
The flash of light you saw
in the sky was not a U.F.O.

568
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,360
Swamp gas from a weather balloon
was trapped in a thermal pocket...

569
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,390
and refracted the light from Venus.

570
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:10,315
Wait a minute.
You flash that thing...

571
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:12,655
it erases her memory
and you just make up a new one?

572
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,450
A standard-issue neuralizer.

573
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,125
That weak-ass story is
the best you can come up with?

574
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:18,698
All right.

575
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,859
Ona more personal note,
Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.

576
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,293
You'll go stay with your mom
a couple nights.

577
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,485
You'll get over it
and decide you're better off.

578
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,874
Yeah, because he never
appreciated you anyway.

579
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:31,894
In fact, you know what?

580
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:35,165
You kicked Aim out.
And now that he’s gone...

581
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,606
you'll go into town,
find yourself some nice dresses.

582
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,743
Get yourself some shoes.
Find somewhere you could get a facial.

583
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,490
And...

584
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:47,652
hire a decorator
to come here quick because, damn!

585
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,639
Yo, Kay, check it out.
When do! get my own flashy...

586
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,712
memory messer-upper thing?

587
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:01,614
When you grow up.

588
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,778
Please, not green.

589
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,578
Damn.

590
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,690
I don’t suppose you know
what kind of alien life-form...

591
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,239
leaves a green spectral trail
and craves sugar water?

592
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:17,946
Wait. That was
on "Final Jeopardy” last night.

593
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,285
- Damn, Alex said it was--
- Zed, we have a bug.

594
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,179
So.

595
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:24,854
What?
We don’t like bugs?

596
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,828
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

597
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,308
They consume, infest, destroy, live off
the destruction of other species.

598
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:34,103
- You were stung as a child, right?
- Listen, kid.

599
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:38,252
Imagine a giant cockroach
with unlimited strength...

600
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:42,123
a massive inferiority complex,
and a real short temper...

601
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,606
is tear-assing around Manhattan Island
in a brand-new Edgar suit.

602
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,127
Sound like fun?

603
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,614
What’s the move?

604
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:55,007
With the bug in town,
we'll watch the morgues.

605
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,538
Where co you want
contestant number three?

606
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,334
Just leave it there.

607
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,069
What’s with the cat?

608
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,834
There’s a problem with the cat.
Sign here.

609
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:18,386
- What’s the problem with the cat?
- It’s your problem.

610
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,813
I hate the living.

611
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:26,966
Shall we?

612
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,430
Oh, my God!

613
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,510
Buddy, what are you?

614
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:16,067
Subject was approximately 112 degrees
at time of autopsy...

615
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,650
indicating an increase
in body temperature.

616
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,759
Examiner tried
to verify this rectally...

617
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,038
only to find the subject was
without rectum.

618
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,750
- Which is, needless to say, really--
- Weird.

619
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,750
I’m Dr. Leo Manville,
Department of Public Health.

620
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,785
This is Dr. White.

621
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:33,991
You boys must not have
much of a home life.

622
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,254
We watch the morgues very carefully.
Seen something unusual?

623
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,898
I'd say so.
Triple homicide.

624
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,332
The first body was pretty normal,
except he was broken in half.

625
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,623
The first body was pretty normal,
except he was broken in half.

626
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:47,177
But when I opened up
the other two, well-- Let me show you.

627
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,435
There’s a skeletal structure
unlike any I’ve ever seen before.

628
00:51:57,915 --> 00:51:59,225
I'l look at it.

629
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,673
Dr. White, why don’t you and Dr. Weaver
check out the other body?

630
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,362
This way, Doctor.

631
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:05,698
This one’s even stranger.

632
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,050
I did a full laparotomy.

633
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,285
I began with the stomach. We can start
with the gastroesophageal junction.

634
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:13,512
Whichever you prefer.

635
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,881
Let’s start
wherever you started at.

636
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,971
Okeydokey.

637
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:29,238
- Your cat?
- Guess it is now.

638
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,703
It came in with the body.
Dive right in.

639
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,692
I’m sure he won’t mind.

640
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,204
You have really pretty eyes.

641
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:41,294
Thank you.

642
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:45,965
Feel that?

643
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:49,125
Where the pyloric junction would be?
Push it aside.

644
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,529
Notice anything strange?
Stomach, liver, lungs?

645
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,023
No, all fine.

646
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,699
Doctor, they're all missing.

647
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,101
Well, of course.

648
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,546
That’s obviously the first thing
I noticed.

649
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:05,162
What I was pointing out is the fact
that there are no...

650
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,660
.
pieces...

651
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,378
of them left.

652
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,529
You know, so they're intact.

653
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:16,154
Wherever they are. Whole, somewhere.
That we can be sure of.

654
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:17,903
Have we met before?

655
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:20,796
I’m having the strangest feeling
of déja vu.

656
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,493
- Yeah, me too.
- Really?

657
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,212
Okay, you want to know
what I really think?

658
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,784
But don’t tell him,
he’s under enough stress.

659
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:31,924
I don’t think it’s a real body.

660
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:35,022
I think it’s some kind of transport unit
for something else altogether.

661
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,089
The question is, what?

662
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,932
Is this freaking you out?

663
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:43,496
No, girl.

664
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,305
You know what I like to do sometimes
when it’s late?

665
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:51,913
No.

666
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,000
Dr. White.

667
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:57,273
Excuse me.

668
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,015
What do you think?

669
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,811
Very interesting. She got a real
Queen-of-the-Undead thing going--

670
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,211
- Of the body.
- Great body.

671
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,156
The dead body.

672
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:13,726
Man, you have to look
at that thing.

673
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,744
You recognize him?

674
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:19,707
Yeah, he looks like the big guy 1 saw
down at headquarters, only deader.

675
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,940
What do you think killed him?

676
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:24,543
- A bug?
- Dr. White.

677
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,322
You're up, slugger.

678
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:31,444
Look at this.

679
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,430
What the hell is that?

680
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:54,667
Must...

681
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,870
To prevent...

682
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,307
contest.

683
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,130
It’s okay.
What are you trying to say?

684
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,605
To prevent...

685
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,297
"To prevent...”

686
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:09,725
Struggle?

687
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:11,834
No.

688
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:13,196
To prevent...

689
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,640
War?

690
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,168
War.

691
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,599
The galaxy...

692
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,395
.
lS ON...

693
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:26,248
..Orion’s...

694
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,538
..be- be--

695
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,404
What is word?

696
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,434
The bed?

697
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,596
Belt?
Orion’s belt?

698
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,198
"To prevent war
the galaxy is on Orion’s belt."

699
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,118
What the hell
does that mean?

700
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:08,511
Doctor...

701
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:11,495
- whatever, come here!
- Dr. "Whatever"?

702
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:14,152
You guys aren’t really from
the Department of Health, are you?

703
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:16,672
Rosenberg!
Ah, damn.

704
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:20,734
The Arquillians will not like this.
He was one of the royal family.

705
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:22,738
I knew it.
This is an alien.

706
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:26,113
And you're from some government agency
trying to keep it under wraps.

707
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:29,577
He said, "To prevent war,
the galaxy is on Orion’s belt."

708
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,192
This makes total sense.
How else do you explain New York?

709
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,746
The other day ! was
in this cab and this guy--

710
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:38,834
"Galaxy on Orion’s belt"
doesn’t make sense.

711
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,502
That’s what the little dude
inside the big dude’s head said. Right?

712
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,069
Right after--

713
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,910
Damn, man.
You did the flashy thing already.

714
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:49,187
Whoever you are, you have to show I.D.
if you’re gonna be in the morgue.

715
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,236
Of course, young lady.
Look at this for me, please.

716
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,726
- Would you stop that?
- What?

717
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,298
That thing is gonna give her
brain cancer or something.

718
00:56:57,681 --> 00:56:59,611
Never hurt her before.
We have to close all the doors here.

719
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,700
Special Services will be here
any minute.

720
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,479
"Before"! How many times have you
flashy-thinged that poor woman?

721
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:05,908
Couple.

722
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:08,433
- No worries about no long-term damage?
- Little.

723
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,256
- Have you ever flashy-thinged me?
-No.

724
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,401
-[ain’t playing with you! Have you?
-No.

725
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:26,514
I think 1 should be in charge
of the flashy thing department.

726
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:28,406
Not while I’m around, ace.

727
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,869
You won't be happy till you fricassee
someone’s brain out.

728
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:33,208
We got two dead aliens
and a Deputy Medical Examiner...

729
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,300
- that needs a new memory.
- Yes, sir.

730
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:40,028
Make it a happy memory.

731
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,033
Where is it?

732
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:00,412
Hey, Zed.

733
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:03,538
Doesn’t anyone ever get
any sleep around here?

734
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,547
The twins keep us on Centaurian time.
It’s a 37-hour day.

735
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:11,725
Give it a few months, you'll get used
to it. Or have a psychotic episode.

736
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,552
Here’s Orion.

737
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:16,854
It’s a grouping of the brightest stars
in the northern sky.

738
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:19,814
- And here’s Orion’s belt.
- That’s what the little guy said.

739
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,503
"To prevent war,
the galaxy is on Orion’s belt."

740
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,307
Junior, there are no galaxies
on Orion’s belt.

741
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,946
The belt is just these three stars.

742
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:32,551
Galaxies are huge.
They're made up of billions of stars.

743
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,680
You heard wrong.

744
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:37,511
Look, whatever,
I know what I heard.

745
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,087
Pretty lady.

746
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:26,803
The grumpy guy’s story is starting
to come into focus a little bit here.

747
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,721
You were the guy in the picture
you showed me with the flowers.

748
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,945
And, I take it,
she never got those flowers.

749
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:38,273
So, what, she ever get
married or anything?

750
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:41,697
You know what they say.

751
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:45,042
"It’s better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all."

752
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,812
Try it.

753
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,775
Take a look at this.

754
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,510
My God, they're all leaving.

755
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:59,325
We've had 12 jump in the last hour.
Redgick was just the first.

756
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:02,167
What do they know that we don’t?

757
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:03,919
Why does a rat desert a ship?

758
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:07,413
Give me Lem Sat 4 with a proton
induction thermoscan, please.

759
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,990
Thank you. Okay.
Lem Sat 18.

760
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:15,504
All right, 4,000.

761
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,923
- That’s an Arquillian battle cruiser.
- We've got a dead Arquillian prince.

762
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,609
Speak of the devil.

763
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:29,258
They sound pissed.

764
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,129
Boys, translate that.
Step on it.

765
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:34,725
Go to Rosenberg’s jewelry store
and see what you can turn up.

766
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,157
Give the kid a weapon.

767
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:55,105
- Series 4 de-atomizer.
- That’s what I’m talking about.

768
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:56,889
Noisy cricket.

769
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,419
Kay, no, no,
come on, man.

770
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,971
You get a Series 4 de-atomizer...

771
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,764
I get a midget cricket?

772
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,077
Feel like I’m going
to break this damn thing.

773
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,673
Hey, this is my truck!

774
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:02,342
Make sure you tell them that
down at the impound.

775
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,980
Please.

776
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,271
Who breaks into a jewelry store
and leaves all the jewels?

777
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:26,128
Somebody not looking for jewelry.

778
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,229
He had a serious crush on his cat.

779
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,347
Get down!

780
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,337
Man!

781
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,059
That’s him. That’s the bug!

782
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,678
In the Edgar suit!

783
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:10,908
We do not discharge our weapons
in view of the public!

784
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,488
We ain't got time
for this cover-up bullshit!

785
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,190
Have you forgotten?
There’s an alien battle cruiser--

786
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:19,136
There’s always an alien battle cruiser
or a Korilian death ray...

787
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:22,136
or an intergalactic plague
about to wipe out life on this planet.

788
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,169
The only way people get on
with their happy lives...

789
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,115
is they do not know about it!

790
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,713
Don’t worry about the bug.

791
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,542
He’s not leaving town.
We've got his ship.

792
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,365
Zed, we need a containment crew...

793
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:49,554
on MacDougal Street
south of Houston,

794
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,696
Containment may be a moot point, friend.
The exodus continues.

795
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,509
It’s like the party’s over and the last
one to leave gets stuck with the check.

796
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,657
You sorry little ingrates!

797
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:10,415
What about the Arquilfians?

798
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,926
We've only translated part
of the message so far:

799
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,359
- "Deliver the galaxy."
- They don’t want much, do they?

800
01:05:15,712 --> 01:05:17,172
Oh, it gets better.

801
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:19,147
They hold us responsible.

802
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:30,208
Where do you keep your dead?

803
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,049
I don’t have any dead.

804
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,932
Where?

805
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:35,334
I don’t know.

806
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,726
The city morgue?

807
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,507
That’s three for a dollar, sir!

808
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,637
It was some light that refracted
off of Venus...

809
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,693
into some swamp gas...

810
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,595
and that’s what made the--

811
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,057
All right, kid!

812
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:01,312
Excuse me.
What’s up?

813
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,991
The Arquillians want the galaxy,
whatever the hell that means.

814
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:06,004
We need help, a professional.

815
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:09,366
Somebody with years of experience
in intergalactic politics.

816
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:12,266
I just hope the little prick
hasn’t skipped town.

817
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:14,569
May I have your attention?
Thank you.

818
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,684
ifyou'll gather over here.

819
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:19,346
That's right, move in closer.
That's good.

820
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:23,716
ifyou look right here,
Vd appreciate it. Thank you.

821
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,010
That’s the worse disguise ever.
He’s obviously an alien.

822
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,773
You don’t like it,
you can kiss my furry little butt.

823
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:44,987
You busy, Frank?

824
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,101
Can't talk now.
My flight’s leaving in--

825
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:49,627
- Get your paws off me!
- Call the pound! We got a stray.

826
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,056
The dog owes my friend money.

827
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,748
Arquillians and bugs, Frank,
what do you know?

828
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,210
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

829
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:00,544
Stop it. Stop it.
Okay. Okay.

830
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:03,254
Rosenberg wasn’t some
two-bit Arquillian.

831
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:06,642
He was the guardian of a whole galaxy.
They thought he’d be safe on Earth.

832
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,583
The bug had other plans.

833
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,848
The galaxy is the best source
for subatomic energy in the universe.

834
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,908
If the bugs get their slimy claws on it,
kiss the Arquillians good-bye.

835
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,641
Ask about the belt.

836
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,800
Rosenberg mentioned a galaxy
on Orion’s belt.

837
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,385
- What’s he mean?
- Beats me.

838
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,285
Not around.

839
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:28,226
They're rehearsing
a ventriloquist act.

840
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,245
The galaxy is here!

841
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:32,007
What do you mean "here"?

842
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:34,712
Galaxy’s millions of stars and planets.
How’s it here?

843
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:37,428
You humans!
When will you learn size doesn’t matter?

844
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,840
Just because something’s important,
doesn’t mean it’s not very small.

845
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:44,454
- How small?
- Tiny. Like a marble or a jewel.

846
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,738
If you'll excuse me,
I gotta be walked before my flight.

847
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:49,911
All right.
Get out of here.

848
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:54,598
If the galaxy’s here,
it’s not on Orion’s belt.

849
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,101
Boy, when you want attention--

850
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:19,615
Orion.

851
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:21,408
That’s a pretty name.

852
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,558
What’s this?

853
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,084
Yes, good, thank you.

854
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:23,356
Thank you for making sure
the bell works.

855
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,938
What’s up, Farmer John?

856
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:31,962
A man came in here earlier.

857
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:33,538
A dead man.

858
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,610
And that means what to me?

859
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:40,363
It was a very dear friend of mine.

860
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:43,427
I believe he had
an animal with him.

861
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:46,269
It was a gift 1 gave him.
A pet cat.

862
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:48,292
It means worlds to me.

863
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,193
I'd like to have it back.

864
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:52,126
I’m gonna need
a picture I.D...

865
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:53,881
written proof
of ownership of the cat...

866
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:56,117
notarized proof of kinship with...

867
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:58,343
the deceased.

868
01:09:58,628 --> 01:09:59,938
Don’t do that.

869
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:02,767
Do what?

870
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,426
Don’t do it.

871
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,697
Oh, man.

872
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,294
- Look, Kay, let me handle this one.
- What?

873
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:30,287
All we gotta do is get a cat.
It’s not really that hard.

874
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,067
But if you go in,
you'll lay your Jack Webb on her.

875
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:36,423
Flash your brain ray all in her face.
She'll wind up with leukemia.

876
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,919
She’s a doctor. She don’t need you
flashing away her med school classes.

877
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,153
- Five minutes.
- Two minutes.

878
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,554
- Where’s the animal?
-1 told you I don’t know.

879
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,057
Let’s see if we can find it.

880
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:56,731
Hello!

881
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,098
Hello!

882
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,061
- How you doing?
- Hello.

883
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:16,116
I’m Sergeant Friday,
from the 26th precinct.

884
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,352
A cat came in with a corpse
the other day.

885
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:21,254
-"Orion" on the name tag.
- Yes, that’s right.

886
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,847
This cat is a...

887
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:26,064
a witness in a murder case.

888
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:28,129
I’m gonna need to take him,
ask him a few questions.

889
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:31,081
- 1 don’t know where the cat is.
- You don’t?

890
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:34,361
No, but maybe you could
take me with you instead.

891
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,782
Damn, you do start fast,
don’t you?

892
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,798
I'd really like to go with you...

893
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,614
now.

894
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,089
And exactly why is that?

895
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:56,796
There’s something
I need to show you.

896
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,243
Slow down, girl.
You ain’t got to hit the gas like that.

897
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:02,809
You don’t understand.
You really need to see this.

898
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:07,526
I will, [ will. One thing, I got
to drive. It’s not some macho trip.

899
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,347
I’m saying
that’s the way! get down.

900
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,693
Look, stud,
you're really not getting this.

901
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,170
There’s something
I need you to help me with.

902
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:40,838
- Freeze it, bug!
- Christ, you are thick!

903
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,589
- How was I to know?
- Should I have sung it for you?

904
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:45,513
If you weren’t coming on like--

905
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:49,425
That is so typical. A woman shows
a hint of sexual independence--

906
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:51,699
- Shut up!
- Let her go, shiteater.

907
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:53,731
Listen, monkey-boy.

908
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,996
Compared to you humans, I’m on the top
rung of the evolutionary ladder.

909
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,283
-Socan it.
- You're breaking my heart.

910
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:01,359
Show me your face
and I'll cure all your ills.

911
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:04,777
Ever pull wings off a fly?
Care to see the fly get even?

912
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:06,621
How far can you go with no ship?

913
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:09,133
If that’s what you call that space trash
we got locked in the office.

914
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:12,358
- Put your weapons down!
- Never going to happen, insect.

915
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:15,222
- It’s okay.
- How is it okay?

916
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,645
I’m saying it’s going to be okay.

917
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:19,603
Don’t bet on it, meat sack.

918
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:30,982
Let me go!

919
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:43,321
Go on!

920
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,545
- Take me here.
- No way.

921
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,640
Take me!

922
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:10,905
He’s ina cab!

923
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,959
Don’t move! Don’t move!
Don’t move!

924
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,932
Hey, man, what?

925
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,591
He’s not leaving the planet in a cab.
Let’s go.

926
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,412
Come with me. Put up a bio-net
all the way around Manhattan.

927
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,438
If it’s not human,
I don’t want it to leave this island.

928
01:15:03,299 --> 01:15:05,049
What do we hear from
our friends upstairs?

929
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:06,828
Same thing.
"Deliver the galaxy."

930
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:09,533
The bug has the galaxy but we have
his ship. He’s looking for a way out.

931
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:14,992
Warning. Protonic fusion detection.

932
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:25,029
What the hell
they shooting at us for?

933
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:27,371
Battle rules, kid.
First, we get an ultimatum...

934
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:30,273
then a warning shot, then a galactic
standard week to respond.

935
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:33,617
A galactic standard week?
How long is that?

936
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,200
One hour.

937
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:36,510
One hour?

938
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,036
Then what?

939
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:44,782
That’s bullshit.

940
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:48,701
Kid, to keep the bugs from getting it,
the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy.

941
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:51,058
And whatever planet it’s on.

942
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,342
- You're talking about us.
- Sucks, huh?

943
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:01,143
I’m getting the location of every
interstellar vehicle within 100 miles.

944
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,640
l already did.
Frank took the last ship.

945
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:06,183
- Snedens Landing and Throg’s Neck.
- They're gone.

946
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,022
- Atlantic City.
- Adios.

947
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:09,906
- Bayonne?
- Gone.

948
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,949
- There’s Three Mile Island.
- Gone.

949
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:13,578
-Yall.
- Staten Island?

950
01:16:13,836 --> 01:16:15,296
- Gone, thank God.
- Fellas!

951
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,351
We're running out of time.
If the bug leaves with the galaxy--

952
01:16:18,808 --> 01:16:20,388
Hey, old guys!

953
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,191
Do those still work?

954
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:44,615
- You're coming with me.
- What?

955
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:47,202
It’s along trip.
I’ll need a snack.

956
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:48,023
It’s along trip.
I’ll need a snack.

957
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,403
Wait, the tunnel?

958
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:58,018
- You know a better way to Queens?
- It’s gonna be packed.

959
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,430
- Remember the little red button?
- Yeah.

960
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,192
Push the red button.

961
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,291
You may want to wear a seat belt.

962
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,829
You’re much too tense.
You're a young man.

963
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,398
You need to relax.
Learn to take some joy in your work.

964
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:36,093
You like music?

965
01:17:37,453 --> 01:17:38,763
Man!

966
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:41,766
That’s better.

967
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,438
You do know Elvis is dead?

968
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:16,977
No, Elvis is not dead.
He just went home.

969
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:36,711
You don’t want to eat me.
I’m important on my planet. A queen!

970
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:40,093
A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me.

971
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:44,649
I’m not trying to impress you. Just
letting you know it could start a war!

972
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:49,237
Good, war. That means more food
for my family. All 78 million of them.

973
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:53,398
- That’s alot of mouths to feed.
- Wonderful, but I’m staying here!

974
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:17,284
Now, that’s what I’m talking about.

975
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,504
Roaches check in.

976
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,884
But they don’t check out.

977
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:29,634
Warning.

978
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:32,522
Fight minutes
to the destruction of Earth,

979
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,823
Fight minutes to destruction.

980
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:25,214
We'll use pulsar level 5,
with a sub-sonic implosion factor.

981
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:26,964
What?

982
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:29,742
Just shoot the damn thing
on the count of three. One...

983
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,768
two, three.

984
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,480
You idiots!

985
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,400
You don’t get it!

986
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:37,862
I’ve won.

987
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:38,992
It’s over.

988
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,664
It’s over.

989
01:21:40,963 --> 01:21:42,513
You milk suckers!

990
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:45,059
You don’t matter.

991
01:21:45,768 --> 01:21:47,818
Ina few seconds,
you won't even be matter.

992
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,780
You're under arrest for violating
sections of the Tycho Treaty.

993
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,726
So hand over whatever galaxy
you are carrying and step away...

994
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:56,663
from your busted-ass vehicle
and put your hands on your head.

995
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:03,687
I'll put my hands...

996
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:07,196
on my head.

997
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:12,897
Like this?

998
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,298
That did not go at all
how I’d planned.

999
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,236
Whatever happens,
don’t let him on the second ship.

1000
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:49,308
- What are you talking about?
- Keep him on this planet.

1001
01:22:49,765 --> 01:22:51,515
Kay, where are you going?

1002
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,044
I’m getting my gun back.

1003
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:57,675
Hey, bug!

1004
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:00,456
You know how many of your kind
I’ve swatted with a newspaper?

1005
01:23:00,876 --> 01:23:03,306
You're nothing but a smear
on the sports page to me...

1006
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:06,402
you slimy, gut-sucking,
intestinal parasite!

1007
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,489
Eat me!

1008
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,090
Eat me!

1009
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,290
What’s up?

1010
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:32,562
You just going to eat and run, huh?
What about dessert?

1011
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:40,524
That’s it?

1012
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:43,579
Where you going?
This party's just getting started.

1013
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,530
Where’re you going?

1014
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:49,016
Where you going?

1015
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:51,495
Listen.

1016
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:54,827
There’s one way off this planet, baby,
and that’s through me.

1017
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:40,214
Where’re you going?

1018
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,232
Why you runnin’, huh?

1019
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:44,487
I’m still standing.

1020
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,220
Come on. Bring it.
Bring it.

1021
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:09,522
I’m sorry.
Was that your auntie?

1022
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:13,773
That must mean
that’s your uncle, huh?

1023
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,745
You know you all look alike.

1024
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,048
Well, well.

1025
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,664
Big bad bug got a bit
ofa soft spot, huh?

1026
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:37,724
What I can’t understand
is why you...

1027
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:40,616
got to come down here
bringing all this ruckus.

1028
01:25:41,036 --> 01:25:43,256
Snatching up galaxies and everything.

1029
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:48,119
My attitude is, don’t start nothing,
won't be nothing.

1030
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:57,316
You need to ease up out my face
before something bad happen to you.

1031
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:00,958
Too late.

1032
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:33,062
Call the Arquillians.
Tell them we have the galaxy.

1033
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:34,765
You got it, friend.

1034
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,608
Going to get your gun back, huh?

1035
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:40,621
l like this gun.

1036
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:45,654
While you were in there playing around,
I was here doing all the work.

1037
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:48,684
First, 1 had to bean him in the head
with this big rock.

1038
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:50,854
Then I was going to hit him
with a two-by-four.

1039
01:26:51,173 --> 01:26:52,633
He kicked me.
You know, it hurt.

1040
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,931
Then I got the fire.
I was "yah" with the fire.

1041
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,277
Not bad for your second day
of work, is it?

1042
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:02,367
This definitely rates about a 9.0
on my weird-shit-o-meter.

1043
01:27:02,851 --> 01:27:06,361
Should’ve been here
for the Zeronion migration in 1968.

1044
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:11,274
I guess you weren't
even alive in’68.

1045
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:20,139
Interesting job you guys have.

1046
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:39,018
Look, I know we got rules
and everything, but...

1047
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:43,291
she did help us bust that bug.
Maybe we don’t have to flashy thing her.

1048
01:27:45,494 --> 01:27:48,594
Come on. Who she gonna tell?
She hang out with all dead people.

1049
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,496
It’s not for her.

1050
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,226
It’s for me.

1051
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:55,139
What?

1052
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:58,549
They're beautiful, aren’t they?

1053
01:28:00,142 --> 01:28:01,162
Stars.

1054
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:04,620
I never look at them anymore,
but they actually are quite...

1055
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,119
beautiful.

1056
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:16,028
Kay, you’re frightening
your partner.

1057
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:19,704
I haven’t been training a partner.
I’ve been training a replacement.

1058
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:22,178
Wait a minute, Kay.

1059
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:24,714
I cannot do this job by myself.

1060
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:27,696
Hey, guys.
My apartment isn’t anywhere near here.

1061
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,806
It’s not even
on the same island.

1062
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,142
Days...

1063
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:33,684
months...

1064
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:35,402
years.

1065
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,137
Always face it forward.

1066
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:49,275
I’ve just been down the gullet
of an interstellar cockroach, kid.

1067
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:51,964
That’s one of a hundred memories
that I don’t want.

1068
01:29:09,411 --> 01:29:10,871
See you around, Jay.

1069
01:29:17,252 --> 01:29:18,422
No...

1070
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:20,637
you won't.

1071
01:29:56,291 --> 01:30:00,211
Zed called. The Solaxiant 9 consulate
wants floor seats for the Knicks game.

1072
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:03,228
Put in a call for Dennis Rodman,
he’s from that planet.

1073
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:07,127
Rodman? You're kidding.

1074
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:08,705
Nope.

1075
01:30:09,337 --> 01:30:11,007
Not much of a disguise.
