00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,859
Welcome to the Kung Fu Panda 2
commentary.

2
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,858
- I'm Melissa Cobb, the producer.
- I'm Jen Nelson, the director.

3
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,901
I'm Raymond Zibach,
the production designer.

4
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,833
I'm Rodolphe Guenoden, supervising
animator and fight choreographer.

5
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,663
So this shadow puppet idea, Raymond,

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,631
can you talk a little bit
about where that came from?

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,012
Well, it's funny. We had that one shot
towards the end of the movie

8
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,559
where we needed something to kind of...
We wanted to do a shadow play

9
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,392
and have the cannon cast a shadow.

10
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,601
But when it came to doing the opening,
we were originally gonna do a tapestry.

11
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,917
And I thought, well, it would
be cool to do the shadow puppets

12
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,141
telling the story, you know,
the backstory, of Shen.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,680
And who's doing the narration there?

14
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:44,638
That's Michelle Yeoh. She does an
amazing job as the soothsayer's voice.

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,942
What's really nice about her
is she gives that sort of wisdom

16
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,942
and the gravitas of that voice.

17
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:53,627
‘Cause we wanted to make sure this area
felt like a historical story.

18
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,914
And that it has to have a sort of
grand weight to it,

19
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,702
so you know to pay attention
to what's going on here.

20
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,791
- And her voice is so velvety.
- It's a great delivery, yeah.

21
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,411
Yeah, that sense
of history is really strong.

22
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,097
And what was the animation technique?

23
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,015
It was sort of a combination
of different techniques, right?

24
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,184
Yeah, it was combination
of After Effects and...

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,050
But because After Effects is so smooth,
you know, we had to add, actually,

26
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:21,338
kinks into the animation to make it look
like it was puppets held by somebody.

27
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,005
I think when you came up with the fact
that everything's kind of held

28
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,881
more from, almost the head,
like a real...

29
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,453
- Right.
- .. shadow puppet is,

30
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,658
with a stick,
usually the anchor point is up high.

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,610
When you kind of got that pivot in it,
it really started having the right feel,

32
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,496
and added with the jitter.

33
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,671
Feeling the actual hands holding the...

34
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,646
- Right.
-..puppets, yeah.

35
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,372
That was crazy cool.

36
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,514
And I think it really helped, too,
when you went through

37
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,866
and got the exact facial acting, when
you were going through and doing that.

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,630
That really took a real jump
when you did that.

39
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,009
And then that transition shot
into the CG is really,

40
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,175
- pretty much a matte painting.
- Yeah, that...

41
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,450
One of the first CG shots
you see in the whole movie

42
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,282
is a fully painted shot mapped on
to some geometry,

43
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,244
but it's a beautiful matte painting.

44
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,901
I think what really helps it
is the dimensional camera move-in

45
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,440
and the use of effects
in the smoke stack

46
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,442
so it really looks like a real CG shot.

47
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,938
Yeah, it's quite a cheat, but it works.

48
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,434
It is. We kind of enter the movie
on a matte painting

49
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,643
and leave it on a matte painting.

50
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,728
The wolves forging the metal,
using that to bring the title in,

51
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,351
that was kind of an idea
that came up towards the end.

52
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,096
It was another kind of last minute...

53
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,632
“We gotta finally do something
and put it up on the screen,”

54
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,042
and I love that you had the beat
of showing Peacock getting more metal.

55
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,365
And then we were like, "What are
we gonna do for these titles,

56
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,513
and how do we transition?”
I was like, "Let's make 'em metal

57
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,639
and just have that flash be...
it's what Peacock's after

58
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,149
and it's also the title.”

59
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,797
So coming off the title,
there's a couple of kids playing

60
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,029
- with action figures there.
- One of which is your daughter.

61
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,711
- That little pig right there.
- Nice job.

62
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,067
I don't know.

63
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,675
And there's a little misdirect here
with the reveal of Po.

64
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,658
Yeah. That was funny.

65
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,197
The idea that you hear all these sounds
of violence in the background.

66
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,305
Extreme violence, and the
more violent the sound effect,

67
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,801
the more you think something really,
really extreme is going on

68
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,191
and then you see that.

69
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,704
And he says here "38 bean buns,"
but I think it's nine

70
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,997
- that he actually has in his mouth.
- It's only nine? Gotta be more.

71
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,247
It's hard to imagine
how it would've looked with 38.

72
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,724
We had to pull back
on the amount of slobber, didn't we?

73
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,943
Yeah. Definitely, we had an
ultra-slobber pass

74
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,569
that effects was very proud of.
Had to cut it back a little bit.

75
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,070
Beautiful effects,
but it was a little bit too messy.

76
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,405
- Yeah. It was stringy and goopy...
- Yeah.

77
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,571
- It was stealing the show.
- Yeah.

78
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,406
We don't want people to get nauseous
at the beginning of the movie.

79
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,783
So what about the 3-D effects
on that dumpling?

80
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,749
- That's a super stereo moment.
- Yeah, it is.

81
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,631
I think it’s fun just
seeing the camaraderie

82
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,133
between Po and the Five
again at the top of the movie.

83
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,632
Yeah. This is a shot that you
actually had painted forever ago.

84
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,173
This location, I just,
I don't know, for some reason it was

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,909
so early on,
but I wanted to make sure

86
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,424
that we had that mystical kind of beat.

87
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,680
And I think when... when Phil pitched
the idea of a dragon statue,

88
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,184
I was like, "Let's build that out
and do the grotto, and..."

89
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,885
“l know exactly where it should go”.

90
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:09,722
We had this spot
in the main painting of the first film.

91
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,843
So I loved fitting it in
to the world of,

92
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,059
especially for the
top of the Jade Palace.

93
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,542
Remember, Rodolphe, this whole water
drop thing was actually your boards

94
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,360
- off the first movie.
- Yeah.

95
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,594
It was actually the ultimate test
for Po to be the Dragon Warrior.

96
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,004
It was Oogway
that was giving him the test.

97
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,695
- Yeah, it was a great scene.
- Yeah.

98
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,347
Yeah.

99
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,196
- I still have that stack of paper.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,899
So many cool ideas didn't
make it into the first one

101
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,777
and ended up in the second one,
including character designs and...

102
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,891
- Yeah, the wolves.
-..and beats like this.

103
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,443
Yeah, ‘cause this one... I think
it was cut out of the first movie

104
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,043
because there really wasn't
the room for it.

105
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,558
It needed more, you know, than what
we had the time for in the first film.

106
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,753
It was nice to give it this level
of weight in the second one.

107
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,544
Just really hinge a lot of
the movie on this whole test.

108
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,798
Yeah, and this idea of Shifu
being now more like Oogway,

109
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,176
more the spiritual leader
of the Valley, I think is...

110
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,976
- It totally fit, yeah.
- Yeah, it's really a cool use.

111
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,866
Setting up the green theme for later
and the knowledge side for Po,

112
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,718
I think this whole sequence
has just about everything,

113
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,248
you know, to kick off the movie
in a great way.

114
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,417
Do you wanna talk a little bit
about the water imagery,

115
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,433
and how you were using that
through the movie?

116
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,224
Yeah, it's the whole yin and yang
between Po and the peacock

117
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,762
and the liquid movement.

118
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:35,537
The water theme is something that
I know you put a lot into, visually.

119
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,733
It always seemed like a great idea to
try to somehow really have the themes

120
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,803
kind of oppose each other.

121
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,955
In the first one, Tai Lung
was kind of bringing cool blue

122
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,546
and Po was always going towards gold.

123
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,286
But I don't think we ever had them clash

124
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:55,897
the way we build and set them up
to clash in this movie.

125
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,176
So, even down to the materials
are actually doing it, too,

126
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:04,173
and Po, in the end, is going right up
against Peacock's firepower.

127
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,685
Yeah. And it just was such
a beautiful image for this.

128
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,925
It's sort of... was all about
that whole inner peace feel

129
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,721
and the clarity
and the simplicity of it.

130
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,421
There was the worry, with
all the beautiful water droplets

131
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,488
going on in this... l was thinking,

132
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,170
“Gee, I hope the kids
don't have to go pee

133
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,564
- in the middle of the movie."
- That is funny.

134
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,535
I was also worrying if it was
gonna end up too loud, you know?

135
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,534
If we were really using real sound,
we'd be drowning out everybody.

136
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,362
- 1 think it looks beautiful.
- Such gorgeous water.

137
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,198
- Yeah.
- 1 love this scene.

138
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,402
I wonder if people notice that it’s
actually Oogway's staff that Shifu has.

139
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,501
- It's been fixed.
- Yeah.

140
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,829
- Repaired since the first movie, right.
- Yeah.

141
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,142
Repaired very beautifully.

142
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,325
And this location
is a really great environment.

143
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,846
I was just looking at that
original concept art for this,

144
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,272
and we originally had it like
an outpost in the middle of a field.

145
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,491
Yeah. We were just looking
at some art the other day

146
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,077
and it was kind of ona
flat land area of the Valley,

147
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,075
maybe towards the end of the Valley,
or the river entrance.

148
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,633
And then, I think early on
we realized it's gotta be more epic.

149
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,190
- It's Po living his dream.
- It's the opening of the movie.

150
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,562
We gotta have a location
that was pretty crazy epic.

151
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,596
And perilous, you know,
at the cliff edge.

152
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,401
Yeah. And there are some shots
in this sequence that are

153
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,517
right out of
Po's dream from the first movie,

154
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,159
but rather than 2-D,
they're executed in CG this time.

155
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,664
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

156
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,080
And that's the whole idea, trying
to re-live Po's dream in real life.

157
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,597
Now he's got it. He's actually doing
what he always wanted to do.

158
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,885
- This one right here?
- That's one.

159
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,280
- Now he's in it with...
- It's the exact same composition.

160
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,916
He's still the geek, you know?
Still the geek and enjoying it.

161
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,794
- Yeah.
- That's what I like...

162
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,123
The great challenge
was to actually find Po,

163
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,525
but the Po that we had
left from the original movie.

164
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,069
He has evolved a little bit
but still has got the same personality.

165
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,632
And in terms of his kind of
fighting style, Rodolphe,

166
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,565
how do you feel like that's
evolved when we see it in this scene?

167
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,857
Well, that's one of the...
I mean, that's the sequence that we,

168
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,404
you know, we tried to show that he's
still improvising into his fighting.

169
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,005
He's still not...
He's not Bruce Lee, but...

170
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,524
- Yeah.
- And it still takes a lot of work.

171
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,524
When he's fighting or when he's
running away, he's always bug-eyed.

172
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,671
He's all bug-eyed and out of breath,
and I think it makes him super cool.

173
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:25,187
Il love some of Philippe'’s shots
that actually set this tone for...

174
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,145
- When he's heavily breathing, and...
- Yeah.

175
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,645
The teamwork side, I just love that
you really felt connected between

176
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,280
all of them and they
somehow have formed this unit.

177
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,780
It's a beautiful piece of choreography
all through this.

178
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,379
This was just added in animation,
wasn't it? This area?

179
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,829
- Yeah.
- And you did a lot of 2-D reference

180
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,068
for all of this action
through this area.

181
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:52,064
Remember we were discussing it
very early that you wanted them to be...

182
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,086
.. you know, shown as a team
and everything, and...

183
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,303
“It would be so cool if he was calling
out the names of the fights,

184
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,344
but also doing some of the moves
of their own styles

185
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,772
-as the same time as calling them."
- Yeah.

186
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,052
I mean aficionados will probably notice,

187
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,141
but a regular audience
just sees them as fighting together

188
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:15,904
and being totally...
intertwining their fighting.

189
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,465
It was cool. was happy to do that.

190
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,866
It's one of those shots that, like,
you wanna frame through, though,

191
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,228
because there's so much going on,
you almost can't see it all.

192
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,714
It's really exciting and then you stop,
frame by frame, and you're like,

193
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,863
“What's going on there and there?"
It's really fantastic.

194
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,969
I think that's one of those things
that's really cool about it,

195
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,861
that it is authentic.

196
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,409
You actually took the time and
made those moves something cool.

197
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,865
l looked at each of the styles
and tried to get Po to do, you know,

198
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:43,196
some of the moves from the original
styles and... and, you know...

199
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:48,193
..a sparkling in there,
and Pierre animated the CG shot. Yeah.

200
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,975
When martial arts experts
come up to you after the fact and go,

201
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,039
“I'm so happy you showed off
what we've known forever now

202
00:09:56,696 --> 00:10:01,146
in an animated film for kids,
with the integrity of the moves."

203
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,104
- They're always pretty stunned, yeah.
- Yeah.

204
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,091
And then there's a flashback there
which is now in a different kind of 2-D

205
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,217
than the opening of the movie.
Wanna talk a little about that, Jen?

206
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,143
That was actually a tricky thing,
‘cause there are multiple types

207
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,815
of 2-D in this movie,
or animation in this movie,

208
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,922
and the opening would
have that historical feel

209
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,928
and that's why there's
that puppet theater look.

210
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,630
- Yeah.
- It's ancient.

211
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,798
But whenever we go into Po's mind,
it has to be that sort of sharp anime,

212
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,633
sort of stylized feel
that we had in the first movie.

213
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,665
But we're also asking that look to do
a lot more acting than we ever had

214
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,943
in the first movie, a lot more emotion.

215
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,671
So, there are a lot more
frames involved.

216
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,158
It wasn't so much still frames
that we could morph in between.

217
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,731
This had to be more
fully animated this time.

218
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,818
And that little flashback,
since, Rodolphe,

219
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,241
you actually animated it yourself,

220
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,553
it had to have an enigmatic question
that was raised, but not tell too much.

221
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:59,735
Exactly. That was a really tough line
to get, is not reveal too much

222
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:05,597
but still be emotionally, you know,
involved, indicating a lot, you know?

223
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,566
So, yeah. Thanks to you,
you know, we finally got there.

224
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,811
Because I always tried
to follow your storyboards

225
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:18,114
and in the animation, I kept,
like, going beyond the storyboards

226
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,121
and too far away from the boards

227
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,530
and I had to really stick
with what you had done.

228
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,622
I gotta say that's gut-wrenching,
though, when you have

229
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:29,358
this gorgeous animation and I go,
“It's beautiful, but it's too much."

230
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,803
And then we go to the noodle restaurant

231
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,911
and now it's
“Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu."

232
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,850
Oh, my gosh. You've
completely pimped out that place.

233
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,406
Dad, he's the king of marketing.

234
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,156
So what's up with those posters,
if you notice in the background.

235
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,179
What do those say on them
or what are they doing?

236
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:53,295
Well, he's got a new sign above
the entrance to his noodle courtyard.

237
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,603
At least that's what
we call the location.

238
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,608
And it says
“Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu."

239
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,368
And then each one has, like,
I think "Dragon Warrior"

240
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,619
written on the poster.
And, you know, he's got his...

241
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,559
... Usually a graphic of a
bowl of noodles or something.

242
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,542
He was really trying to tie it together
with Po so that if people love Po,

243
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,419
they'll come to his place
and eat his food. I love that.

244
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,848
And what about James Hong,
working with him?

245
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,464
Oh, my gosh, James is such a peach.

246
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,843
I think he was
the first actor that recorded.

247
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,241
And he came in, and he came in many
times as we were building this story

248
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,721
between Po and his dad.

249
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,703
And he has such sweetness
in his delivery,

250
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,303
but also has so much wit to it.

251
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,869
So you're dealing with moments
that could come off

252
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,078
as being overly emotional, overly
saccharin, but they always are so real

253
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,256
- because of his performance.
- Right.

254
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,681
It always has that little bit
of an edge to it,

255
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,446
which makes you just,
you know, go with him.

256
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,554
And there's always that love for his son
that permeates everything that he does.

257
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,202
Mr. Ping is probably one of my favorite
characters of all time.

258
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,072
Yeah, absolutely.

259
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,617
Yeah, and this is
a great scene that was...

260
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,822
I think one of the really early
scenes supported by Phil Craven,

261
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,914
our head of story,
and has really remained intact

262
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,557
- through the three long years, right?
- Completely. It hasn't changed.

263
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,411
I mean, he did a pass of this
and it stuck.

264
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,537
We did many different changes on it

265
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,332
and we always came back
to the original version.

266
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,535
And the... It's just so sweet.

267
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,307
And these moments here
where the baby Po was just

268
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,371
having so much fun in the kitchen
and the bonding with his dad,

269
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,122
they were all in those boards.

270
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,798
Remember the days
when we first were introduced

271
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,304
to the model of Po, of baby Po?

272
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,470
- Yeah.
- Like, everybody just went instantly...

273
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,103
Yeah.

274
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,385
The biggest fan...
The entire studio, we spread it...

275
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,957
The news spread so, so fast,
everybody was just a fan.

276
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,449
We thought it would
bring about world peace.

277
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,416
If we could all just look at baby Po...

278
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,903
Send baby Po into a battlefield
and everybody stops the war.

279
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,400
So funny. And that's Nico Marlet,
who designed the baby.

280
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,001
- 1 don't know if you want...
- Yeah, he took...

281
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,753
Well, he took our kind of research trip,
and we went and saw, you know,

282
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,424
and you got to hold
a little tiny baby panda.

283
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,060
We took all those photos
and gave them to Nico

284
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,058
and it took a little bit
to get the eyes just right,

285
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,631
but, I mean, he is
the most charming character.

286
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,571
And how Nico worked with modeling
and how we were able

287
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,422
- to get that design through again.
- To keep him so round.

288
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,944
- He's literally like a ball shape.
- It's the way you draw it.

289
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,321
- In the boards.
- Little circle.

290
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,554
- Like a dumpling shape.
- Yeah.

291
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,759
Yeah. And it's beautiful just like
how fuzzy, like, the surfacing on him.

292
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,276
- Yeah.
- You know?

293
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,603
Originally, I painted some of
the first digital paintings of him

294
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,677
over Nico's drawings and I was
thinking of those kind of fan brush

295
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,410
watercolor ink paintings
‘cause they're so soft.

296
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,457
I'm like, "How can we get
that softness out of CG fur?"

297
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:01,564
I think Wes Burian in surfacing
did an amazing job.

298
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,605
Yeah, baby Po... he's so cute.

299
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,004
Then, you know, the big question:
adoption.

300
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,510
That was a tricky thing
because it's a hot topic.

301
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,795
It's something you have to do right.

302
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,397
And you don't want to pander,
you don't want to, you know,

303
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,633
do something that's inaccurate.

304
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,101
And also we want to make sure
that we're not just saying

305
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,334
“birth parents” or “adopted parents.”

306
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,001
- It's all families.
- Yeah.

307
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,770
And so we wanted to make sure
that we treated it right.

308
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,723
But it's something that was
very carefully thought through

309
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,252
for the entire three years,
every single moment,

310
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,768
trying to make sure the relationship
between him and his dad is real.

311
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:42,301
And the revelation
of what the truth was is real,

312
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,595
and that was just very, very tricky.

313
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,771
And then Gongmen City,
amazing location.

314
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,138
Oh, my gosh.

315
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,169
Inspired a little bit
by our trip to China, of course.

316
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:20,025
Yeah. It's kind of a combination
of all the great things we saw

317
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,393
and then things we thought
we were gonna need, you know,

318
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,896
to make an impressive place
that Peacock would take over.

319
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:32,901
I think, in the end, I couldn't
be happier with the way it turned out.

320
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,829
That the fact that the technology
could let us have this?

321
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,194
It's all built,
none of it's matte painted.

322
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,180
You're actually able to go anywhere
in this place, to me,

323
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,221
and have it look the way it does,
you know.

324
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,529
All the work that the art
department did as far as detail

325
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:50,162
and then surfacing and modeling,
it's... to me, it's a marvel.

326
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,400
But then, you're able to art direct
on top of that something

327
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:58,953
that's got such a strong statement,
and have it hold up and...

328
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,598
- This sequence is one of my favorites.
- Yeah, it's one of mine, too.

329
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,375
And those three masters are
all re-used from the first movie.

330
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:12,014
They were... I think a couple had
already been drawn and, I think...

331
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:16,192
Well, the wolves were already started.
A croc had been modeled.

332
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,587
Rhino was kind of built off
of the rhinos from the prison,

333
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,920
but we did a whole new head. But they
were all characters that we already knew

334
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,617
and it was great to kind of have them
in this movie

335
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,099
and model them, final,
and put them in this sequence.

336
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:34,373
Yeah, Master Croc and Master Ox
used to, originally, be

337
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,244
- members of Tai Lung's posse.
- Tai Lung's henchmen.

338
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,953
Yeah, they were designed for Tai Lung.

339
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,395
But then we thought, "Tai Lung is
too badass to require a posse.”

340
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,135
Yeah. They were all
supposed to kind of square off,

341
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,298
each one against
one member of the Five,

342
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,190
so that Po and the Five might have
all been fighting at the same time.

343
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:54,243
But I think to make it
more Po's story, it was simplified

344
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,427
and made Tai Lung stronger
in the end, like you said.

345
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,224
There's some great cameo voices
for those masters.

346
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:05,983
Yeah. Dennis Haysbert plays Master Ox,
and Victor Garber plays Master Rhino

347
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:11,046
and of course Jean-Claude Van Damme
plays Master Croc.

348
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,451
That was truly one of my
peak experiences in life.

349
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,828
How was he to record with, Jen?

350
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,413
He was super nice
and he did one of those...

351
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:23,149
He did a kick towards the camera
for the EPK. That was pretty awesome.

352
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,429
l actually had a picture taken with him.
I had a geek-out moment.

353
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,597
- He was pretty cool.
- He was pretty cool.

354
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,121
And then the news comes back
to the Valley of Peace.

355
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,237
We see the Five find out
about what happened.

356
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,116
Yeah, that was...

357
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,801
That's the thing, because you're
basically hearing something pretty dark,

358
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,194
but we wanted to make sure
that it stayed light.

359
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,730
Until you get to the emotional beat
when Po and his dad actually talk.

360
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,673
The first half is the set up
for the journey, the mission.

361
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,964
But the real meat of that sequence
is when Po goes down to talk to his dad.

362
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,572
Yeah, ‘cause the thing was pulling
the pieces of comfort away from Po.

363
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,075
First his adoption issue and
then possibly threatening kung fu

364
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,168
and to kind of unsettle him a little
bit at the beginning of the movie.

365
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,235
- Yeah.
- It's also supposed to leave you

366
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,110
with a bit of a hanging unfinished
business between the two of them

367
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,463
that should be a little distracting
for Po as he's going on this journey.

368
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,411
We don't want Po and his dad
to have a bad time.

369
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,736
We want them to make up.
We want them to be good.

370
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,441
And to see them leave with that
hanging moment and that

371
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,944
rather heart-wrenching moment
where Dad says "Noodles" is like...

372
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,831
- Yeah.
- That was a funny moment, though,

373
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,466
where Jeffrey kept asking,

374
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,591
“l need longer before he says
‘Noodles.’ Let that moment hang longer.”

375
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,898
We're like,
“No, we can't hold on for that long.”

376
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,926
But we did and it actually helped.

377
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,448
Yeah, no, it's really great acting
by James Hong right there, too.

378
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,366
I think every screening
I've been in, or public screening,

379
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,227
little kids always say "noodles."

380
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,343
When she says, "We'll be back
before you can say ‘noodles,

381
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,252
they say it, actually,
before the dad does. I love that.

382
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,575
And Po's brought his
action figures along.

383
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,431
Yes, that's a little thing. You notice
that all of the Five are action figures,

384
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,822
and they're all in that basket
and that comes handy later.

385
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,909
I think that's a really funny beat
to bring that back from the first film

386
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,037
and then actually use it
as a tool later on. I love that.

387
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,770
I really like the color signature going
from that red one to the gold sequence

388
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,786
and Po basically, you know, he's
attained everything in that Valley.

389
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,333
Now he's gonna have
to leave it and that's...

390
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,202
The palace, you know,
over his shoulder and his dad,

391
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,808
and that kind of line that's drawn
through them while they're talking.

392
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,872
I think that's really strong
just as a cinematic, you know,

393
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,011
kind of visual, reminding you
of what's important to Po...

394
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,541
- Yeah.
- .. before he has to leave.

395
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,633
Yeah, and then through the montage
you're kind of intercutting

396
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,865
Po's point of view with the peacock,
and there's some kind of interesting

397
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,504
split-screen stuff
that happens in there as well.

398
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,137
It's always fun to do those montage...

399
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,346
You know, we did a big one in
the first movie when he's training...

400
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,880
..and then to echo that again here
but now it's contrast against Peacock.

401
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,539
l remember Guillermo...
that was a Guillermo thought,

402
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,502
and I thought it was
really a good one, where he said,

403
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,810
“Treat it like an action scene. It's
not a montage, it's an action scene."

404
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:32,047
You go from a heavy emotional beat
to a very quiet, intimate talking scene,

405
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,475
and that moment really
needs to have the excitement

406
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,384
and has to have the momentum
of these two freight trains

407
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,357
coming together to face off.

408
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,692
Yeah, you definitely get
a sense of the epic scale of China

409
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,714
and the fact that they're going on
a big journey through that whole area.

410
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,167
Yeah, and Peacock's power is growing.

411
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:48,746
- Yeah.
- It's great.

412
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,594
And Po can't even run.

413
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:53,971
Gets winded.

414
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:55,627
Yeah.

415
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,223
So this moment on the boat
after Po wakes up,

416
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,672
there's just some great animation
there from Dan Wagner.

417
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:34,444
Oh, yeah. It was just that one held shot
where Po is trying to find inner peace.

418
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,724
And we just locked off the camera.

419
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,962
And there were thoughts of moving
the camera around but, you know,

420
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,021
it's just gotta be all about
the animation in that shot.

421
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,900
And Po's acting in that shot,
Dan just did that.

422
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,552
He just did that in a pass
and it was perfect.

423
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,610
- Just hilarious.
- Yeah.

424
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,993
And the idea of sort of finding another
side of Tigress, potentially...

425
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,593
Yeah, ‘cause if we don't have Shifu,

426
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:01,107
we gotta have somebody that is
Po's main relationship in the movie

427
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,550
and, really, it has to be Tigress.

428
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,613
And in the first movie,
we get to see her being really hard

429
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,732
and he earns her respect.

430
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,686
But in this movie, you get
to see their friendship grow,

431
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,972
and you get to see the softer side
of her that we barely got a peek of

432
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,398
in the first movie when you see her sad
when she was a little kitten.

433
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,379
When Shifu turned his back on her.

434
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,208
This scene is really all about,
you know, having a heart to heart

435
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,010
with the scariest person in the world.

436
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,349
And the little peek into Tigress,
showing that side of her,

437
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,923
and really realizing that people's
expectations of who she is

438
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:41,754
are not jiving with who
she probably is inside.

439
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,045
Yeah and Angelina Jolie
brought a lot to that, I think.

440
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:50,059
Yeah. ‘Cause you think of her
as being really hard-core

441
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,563
- because, you know, she’s...
- She's pretty tough.

442
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,111
..she's pretty tough.

443
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,153
But she's also very sweet,
and I think this side of her

444
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:01,953
allowed her to explore Tigress
as much more multi-dimensional.

445
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,628
And this sequence is... is almost...

446
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,779
..iS probably the quietest, most
intimate that we get for a long time.

447
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:15,367
It's just about Po trying
to talk about this awkward subject.

448
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,288
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

449
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,403
The beginning of sort of an
interesting relationship and dynamic

450
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,305
between Po and Tigress in the movie
that kind of evolves.

451
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,223
- Yeah.
- 1 don't know where it's going.

452
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:27,341
- I'm just saying.
-l loved setting all of that

453
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,726
against that softness of the misty,
kind of pre-dawn.

454
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,083
And... it's hard-core
for when it needs to be with her.

455
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:39,434
And then they've got this relationship
that's kind of getting worked out here

456
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,452
and Po's working out his trouble.
I just love it.

457
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,908
- I love...
- It's a nice set to do it in.

458
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,871
It's that whole thing of guys
don't talk about their feelings

459
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,090
until it's beaten out of them.

460
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,775
So that's what this scene's
kind of about, you know.

461
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,824
The only way these
two martial arts masters can talk

462
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:00,674
about it is if they spar.

463
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,686
- Yeah.
- And she's, she's cool.

464
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,633
Yeah, and I love her reaction
when he says that he just found out

465
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,389
that he was adopted,
this really great moment of, like...

466
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,790
- She's trying to be constructive.
- Yeah. Yeah.

467
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,580
- That was William's shot, right?
- Yeah.

468
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:17,912
Yeah.

469
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,557
William Salazar,
and it's just amazing... animation.

470
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,677
Yeah, it's really subtle,
really great stuff.

471
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,700
And just that held look where
her eyes dart over and back again.

472
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:36,204
And between that and Dan's shot
here of Po,

473
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:41,119
- sort of saying his problem here.
- Here's the eyes of that...

474
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,544
- My favorite.
- l love that.

475
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:47,636
The eyelids opening on that...
the punctuation of it, for that scene.

476
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,333
These are all these tiny, subtle things
that are added in animation.

477
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,526
And you can't ask for it anywhere else
but in animation.

478
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:59,154
And it's just brought
by the animator on the shot.

479
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,792
You don't talk about it, you just do it,
and you show it and go,

480
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,127
-"Oh, my gosh. It's alive.”
- Right. Everyone laughs.

481
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,597
Yeah.

482
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,029
There's a great line from Mantis here
about his dad, his daddy issues.

483
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,779
- Didn't we have that in the first film?
- We tried.

484
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,968
- We tried?
- We tried to hint on the fact that,

485
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,424
yeah, that's what happens
for those kind of bugs,

486
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,606
but... it never made it.

487
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,792
And I was so glad the day
that that joke was put back in.

488
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,018
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

489
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,726
And Seth Rogen’'s delivery
is always just spot-on.

490
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,380
Always spot-on. And someday maybe
we'll be able to see that female mantis.

491
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,035
- Get him a nice romance.
- We did design her. We did.

492
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,208
We got the design, so maybe
we'll have to see her someday.

493
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,665
- 1 just love that shot...
- So this tower location is incredible.

494
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,135
Oh, my gosh, with that water.

495
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:48,201
And this whole interior is so beautiful.

496
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,520
I think it's a testament,
though, to how gorgeous it is

497
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,693
by how you actually used the
atmosphere and fuzzed some of it out.

498
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,567
Yeah, ‘cause in order to be
able to focus on parts of it,

499
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,120
you actually have to take some away,
and lighting did an amazing job.

500
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,225
We have probably a better feel
for atmosphere and light

501
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,941
in this movie than the first one.

502
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,827
Probably ‘cause we even built more,
and our sets are a little more layered

503
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,550
because we were very aware
that we were gonna be in 3-D.

504
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:18,631
And then lighting just doing an
amazing job putting all of that together

505
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:23,128
and with all that complexity, being able
to focus on what you need to focus on.

506
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,649
That's a pretty tall order.

507
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:29,178
Isn't that that whole symmetrical
composition you were trying to go for?

508
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,801
Differentiate?

509
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,606
I love that for the bad guy,
to always kind of be on axis,

510
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,789
and he's always gonna be
kind of driving forward,

511
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:41,108
straight on the line to the viewer,
you know, so this one is perfect.

512
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,210
You put a cannon in the middle
and that's the line

513
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,096
that he's gonna stand on, you know.

514
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,074
But then Sooth takes
you off that and I love it.

515
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,048
Yeah, so even though
the composition is straight on,

516
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,434
I know in animation we always had to...

517
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,913
You were the policeman for making sure
we didn't get it too symmetrical.

518
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,410
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

519
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:04,311
Because he's got such a long neck, such
a round head that if he's facing camera,

520
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,367
- he just looks like a lollipop.
- Yes.

521
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,633
I was always, "No, no.
Roll the head axis. Turn it slightly.”

522
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,440
You know, just like any actor would have
to find his best profile for a shot,

523
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,064
we would have to find his.

524
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,404
Michelle is great through here.

525
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,576
It's a really funny little exchange
between the two of them.

526
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,291
Yeah, it's really, really funny.

527
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,476
And I think the key to her
is just making sure that...

528
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,955
She carries a lot of weight as far as,
you know,

529
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,898
serious compositional stuff
that she's gotta do.

530
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,961
But in order to make sure
she doesn't come off as stodgy,

531
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,560
I think Joel Crawford
came up with this pass...

532
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,306
Yeah, a lot of great gags.

533
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:43,081
...where he just came up with this
character for her where she's a goat.

534
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,772
And the fact that she's
a goat lightens her character,

535
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,155
so she can go to dark places,
but you still enjoy watching her.

536
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,188
It's not like, "Oh, no,
she's coming on." It's dark...

537
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,308
There were passes
where she was pretty dreary.

538
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,870
Yeah, that was before
Joel's pass of the scene,

539
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,476
and she was very much
a straight soothsayer.

540
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:03,888
- Yeah.
- Then he made her a little bit peckish.

541
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,100
- Yeah.
- And also he was playing with how

542
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,453
they would have a little bit
of that repartee

543
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,541
where she was playing
with his mind, more, in that pass.

544
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,165
I think that really
showed off very well.

545
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:19,571
- And the boss wolf, great character.
- Great character.

546
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,661
Danny McBride's voice I think
is really... was a great idea.

547
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,196
I think it was interesting for him.
He evolved as well, ‘cause at one time,

548
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,486
he was more of like, the lug,
just a straight lug,

549
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,936
more of a scary dude.

550
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,532
But him being too scary
undermined the peacock being scary,

551
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,162
and it was like they canceled
each other out a little.

552
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,771
And to make him more "the idiot."

553
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:47,609
The sort of goodhearted guy
that does bad things.

554
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,277
Right.

555
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,645
I think he's a little bit
more redeemable.

556
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,055
But his voice, Danny's voice,
is just amazing for that.

557
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,845
Yeah, that's funny.

558
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,623
So you see a lot of the city through
this sequence which is beautiful.

559
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,773
These two first shots,
l love these shots.

560
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,717
- love this.
- 1 wanna loop those shots forever.

561
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,428
- It's gorgeous.
- Yeah.

562
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,337
I do know, from the beginning,
one of the ideas was

563
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,319
that maybe Po wouldn't
be so good at stealth mode.

564
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,685
Yeah, ‘cause you don't
want him to be, like,

565
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,774
super, super confident all the time,
because then he's not Po anymore.

566
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:24,142
He can do kung fu, because otherwise
you don't have a Kung Fu Panda movie.

567
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,483
But something like stealth mode,
that's just not him.

568
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,700
And this sequence was actually really,
really challenging.

569
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,197
- We were crazy...
- A lot of passes on this sequence.

570
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:38,793
A lot of passes, because it's just
purely about having fun with him

571
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,528
going from point A to point B.

572
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,342
That's all it is.

573
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,409
But trying to find the most fun way,

574
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,091
and we worked a lot of that
through layout and animation,

575
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,100
trying to get through these sets
in the funnest way possible.

576
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:57,258
Marc Scott's team in lighting,
he actually lit that first wide shot

577
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:02,269
and then... this sequence came through
pretty hot and heavy at the end,

578
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,198
and look how much stuff is in it.

579
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:08,154
They did an amazing job
lighting this sequence.

580
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,622
And Po has his little drag moment here,
towards the end.

581
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,595
Oh, dear.

582
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,473
Clever use of a kite.

583
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,193
A nice... yeah.
Nice setup there.

584
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,635
I think we should bring up the fact
that these crowds

585
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,690
played a big part in this movie.
We have a whole city to populate,

586
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,148
and every shot has
people walking and doing stuff, and...

587
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,031
New characters, sheep and antelope,
were added to our crowd characters

588
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,825
to get a new feel in the new city.

589
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,210
Yeah, we couldn't do any of this
in the first film.

590
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,152
Yeah. It's definitely more
ambitious than the first film.

591
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,895
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and you feel like

592
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,424
he's really gone someplace new
compared to the Valley.

593
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,393
..which was so small.
This is like this huge metropolis.

594
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,976
- Yeah.
- Well, there's stuff in here that...

595
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,836
..when we're looking at certain shots,

596
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,895
- 1 feel like we're back in Pingyao.
- Yeah.

597
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,393
- You know?
- Yeah.

598
00:31:56,715 --> 00:32:00,345
That was an inspiration where
we stayed overnight in a banker,

599
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,419
an old banker city,
which was really cool.

600
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,702
And shots here remind us, I think,
exactly of what it was like to be there.

601
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,389
- The gates through the town...
- The picture of the stone.

602
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,549
You can actually feel
the warmth of the stone.

603
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,435
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the way the light was playing.

604
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,595
That slight rosy color,
you really captured that.

605
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,128
And this beloved sequence
of the wolf getting pooped out.

606
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,698
Remember the meetings, the animation
meetings with that pooping moment?

607
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,389
- Oh, yeah.
- And, you know,

608
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,023
there was the pass where it was too
poopy and one not poopy enough.

609
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,821
And, and... yeah.

610
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,812
There was a time
when we should have had that...

611
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,000
- Yeah.
- Too much straining in that pass.

612
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,998
Yeah, everyone's idea
of what a poop is like

613
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,587
when it comes out
is a little bit different.

614
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:54,432
But it led to the whole subsequent
pooping montage that's about to occur.

615
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:59,093
Yeah. And all the swallowing
of wolves and pooping them out.

616
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,430
Whose shot was it
when Monkey gets pooped out?

617
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,349
- Michelle.
- Michelle's shot.

618
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:10,351
And the fact that in talking through
the shot when we're launching it,

619
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,742
that replacing Monkey for one
of the wolves as being pooped out.

620
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,901
That's one of the ideas that we came up
with as we were launching the shots.

621
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,915
- And it totally works, yeah.
- Very funny.

622
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,017
Yeah, and it was just so good.
All of these little additions,

623
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,737
every step of the way, just builds it.

624
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,180
l love that even the dragon costume
that they're in...

625
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,332
..jit actually worked in real space.

626
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,155
We didn't have to build a whole hero one
for them to be inside of.

627
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:50,651
Yeah.

628
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,212
I think that adds to the
believability of everything,

629
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,448
is that we're not cheating. You
can actually go and shoot this city.

630
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,202
You could be in that costume,
running around.

631
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,967
Yeah, I really found that costume
point of view in 3-D, particularly,

632
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,339
as you're running through the city,
it was really fun.

633
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,115
Remember as you were animating it, too,

634
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,637
it was a question of making
that costume a real character,

635
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,507
so it behaved like a character.

636
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,339
- It wasn't like a guy in a suit.
- Yeah.

637
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,797
It was a large dragon
sneaking through town.

638
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,943
- With his little eyes switching back...
- So funny.

639
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,659
- Yeah. The googly eyes.
- It's great.

640
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,086
So this scene went through
a lot of different versions.

641
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:24,897
- Oh, my gosh.
- Had some trouble with this one.

642
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:29,482
- This one was trauma.
- It was a fight club, it was a tavern,

643
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,395
as far as locations go, let alone
what was happening within it.

644
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,195
Yeah, because it really had
to just fulfill the same story point,

645
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:42,472
which is the... meeting these people
that you thought was hope.

646
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,181
And it's taking away everything
that Po could hang his hope on

647
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,391
and go, "OK, I gotta do this myself.”

648
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,456
That's what this scene
was supposed to be.

649
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,662
And that story point could be
fulfilled in many different ways.

650
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,415
And that's why we boarded it
in every way possible.

651
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,306
They're in tutus doing a
little stage show for wolves...

652
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:01,849
Oh, my...

653
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,247
Oh, my goodness, there were so many
different ways of doing this.

654
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:08,103
They were fighting for money because
they had fallen down to gambling.

655
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,520
It just went all over the place.

656
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:15,072
And, really, the only thing that showed
them giving up completely and clearly

657
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,924
was them sitting in jail, not fighting.

658
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,372
Yeah. And fighting to stay in.

659
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,569
Yeah. And it just seemed
so simple afterwards.

660
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,370
And this choreography through here

661
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,221
of the fight with the jail cell door,
I think really gave it some...

662
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:39,255
Yeah. It's a nice thing to have
that sort of line in the sand

663
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,901
where you have to keep them in
or get them out.

664
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:47,428
And any of these fight scenes,
you gotta have a clear objective.

665
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,516
Otherwise, you don't know who's
winning at any given point.

666
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,141
- That's brilliant.
- That's a Dave Pate shot.

667
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,990
- So funny.
- Just hilarious.

668
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,135
It's so crazy and I think
Joel boarded that one.

669
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,152
- Yeah.
- And Dave Pate took it and said,

670
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,337
“No, I'm just gonna
follow exactly what the board did.

671
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:08,948
As complete single panel as that was,
I'm just gonna do that."

672
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:12,421
And all you see is a little jiggle
in the butt and that's it.

673
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,924
The music in this sequence
is really fun, too.

674
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,479
It has kind of a retro...
kind of kung fu feel.

675
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,165
Originally, we had a version of music
that was much more traditional.

676
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:28,502
And it just gave the scene a real,
sort of, tonally down.

677
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,707
And this is supposed to be
a fun conversation

678
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,383
where he's trying to assert his point
that kung fu is not dead.

679
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,394
And I think Hans was
there late one night...

680
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,447
- It was very late, I think.
- It was very late.

681
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,082
We were sitting there, kind of
being a little punchy after a while.

682
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:48,608
He said, "I got an idea.” And he
played this and it was just... Oh, man.

683
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,404
Wasn't this Lauren's cue?

684
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,109
- I think it was, yeah.
- 1 think it was Lauren's cue.

685
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,557
She just really brought this

686
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,945
whole fun energy to the scene.

687
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,236
Yeah, it's
very retro martial arts movie.

688
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:58,881
Yeah.

689
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:03,817
That shot right there
with boss wolf is Rodolphe.

690
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,816
- 1 could tell.
- That was terrific.

691
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,967
I wasn't even animation and when I saw
this shot in lighting, I was like...

692
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,607
- "That's Rodolphe.”
- It looks just like him.

693
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,461
They filmed you doing this.

694
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:18,116
Helped the animator get that, and
it's exactly your facial expression,

695
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,957
the way you bob your shoulders.
Oh, my goodness.

696
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,400
Oh, the rickshaw.

697
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,295
This is one of the early scenes,
one of the early ideas

698
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,080
for the big city rickshaw chase,
sort of a car chase idea.

699
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,753
Yeah, the idea of having
a car chase in ancient China

700
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,029
with no engines was quite challenging,

701
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,234
but made for a cool idea
for an action sequence.

702
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,541
But we cover, pretty much,
half the city.

703
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,060
Yeah. This city was built for the
rickshaw chase, in a lot of respects.

704
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,625
We figured out all the technology
to create the city,

705
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,546
you know, because of this.

706
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,864
Yeah, you and Damon would sit there
and you plotted out

707
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:01,241
every single block that we could use,
every eyeline that we were gonna see.

708
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,890
It was insanely complicated.

709
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,015
And making sure that we had
all the elevations

710
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,346
- to make all these moments work...
- Yeah.

711
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,866
- Look how vast that city is.
- It's huge.

712
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,692
- And that's all practical.
- Yep.

713
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,894
That's not matte painting.
It's a real city.

714
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,657
And that's something we never
could've done in the first movie.

715
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,372
No. And I think for...
and it pays off in stereo again,

716
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,040
where you really just believe
the whole thing. I mean, it all works.

717
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:30,551
Didn't, on the first movie, when Tai
Lung and Po is on that firecracker cart,

718
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,902
there was like one city block
and we could barely get that.

719
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,827
Yeah. Yeah, the technology's gotten
better, computers have gotten fast...

720
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,960
You know, just in three years, you know,
what happened with the technology

721
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:47,341
- allowed us to go crazy, really.
- Yeah.

722
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,359
This is a moment I very much enjoy.

723
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:54,605
I think it’s one of those, again,
one of those cranky weekend thoughts

724
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,960
where I needed to have Tigress
hit Po in the butt

725
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,543
and create a firestream for the inertia.

726
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,279
Yeah, that's great.
Like a sonic boom moment there.

727
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:09,526
Yeah, and that beautiful effect from
afar of that firestream is amazing.

728
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,948
Yeah. And the close-up shockwave
with the air bending, then refracting,

729
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,986
you know, what you're seeing,
it just really adds to that moment

730
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,567
before they jettison Po down the street.

731
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,634
Didn't Lawrence have to look
at a bunch of shots of planes?

732
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:26,471
There was a lot of sonic boom footage
we were looking at.

733
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,528
- That was really fun.
- Yeah.

734
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,330
Just beautiful research
gone to a butt-hit.

735
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:33,931
Yeah.

736
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,309
That's Philippe, again,
that animated that. Philippe Le Brun.

737
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,399
This is a great animation
thing here, too. Just...

738
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,812
- Yeah.
- l love the timing of that hit, there.

739
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,082
Yeah. Bang!

740
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,231
It's like pancake batter hitting
a counter. It's like, splat!

741
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,627
Everybody in the theater
always goes, "Ooh!"

742
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,546
Everybody feels that.
The timing's perfect.

743
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,729
For it to all be in wide, as well.

744
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,421
Yeah.

745
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:00,964
There's some great crowd work here
with the wolves,

746
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,006
the wolf army and the movement
of those characters.

747
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,471
Again, we never could have had this
in the first movie.

748
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,531
This many characters in a shot and
you can't tell which ones are crowd

749
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,361
- and which ones are main.
- Right.

750
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,625
They're all very carefully integrated

751
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:20,147
and it just gives that sort of threat
that they're surrounded.

752
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,285
This was tricky to figure out
how to actually lock these guys up

753
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,598
because they're all such
strange creatures.

754
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,701
I think I had Jason build, like,
four or five different sets of manacles

755
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,128
and they were all chained together
at one point,

756
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,143
and it just got too crazy, so...

757
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,962
Wasn't it a case of "If we chain them
together, it would be the complexity

758
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,538
- of an entire battle sequence"?
- Yeah, so that was out.

759
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:45,052
Now the gorilla just has a stick
with a hook on it and he grabs Po.

760
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,173
And then sort of everybody else follows,

761
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,535
so they didn't have to be
all chained together.

762
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:53,791
This is a beautiful moment to see,
really, what that rig is capable of

763
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,065
and the cloth and...
cloth and feathers working together.

764
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,728
The peacock fighting,

765
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:02,156
all that beautiful choreography
that you did, it's just so gorgeous.

766
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,300
We had to cut it down a lot, but...
just to hit more of a story point,

767
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:13,145
but, yeah, it was fun to just make a
showcase of his elegance and still being

768
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,909
- very fierce and dangerous, but...
- This was actually a tough call

769
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,676
because we actually animated
a pass of that sequence before.

770
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,800
And it was a talking sequence
where they were just talking,

771
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,975
standing and talking, and it did not
feel like it was interesting.

772
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,554
You know, it was beautifully animated,
but just was not interesting.

773
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:36,843
And it didn't show his issue.
It didn't show his fear very well.

774
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,928
We showed his fear, at one point,
by having him

775
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,918
practicing in the mirror,
seeing how he looked.

776
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,394
And then decided to go with
a little bit more action slant on it.

777
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,051
- Not badass enough.
- Yeah. It wasn't very cool.

778
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,237
It definitely makes it more of a cage.

779
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,752
Like he's ready for a fight
and he's practicing

780
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,352
and it builds that moment
when Po is gonna get there.

781
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,654
- Po's headed into trouble.
- Yeah.

782
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,514
And this is a little...

783
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,405
The stairs.

784
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,453
It's probably the biggest laugh
in the movie.

785
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:08,999
Yeah.

786
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,377
And I think we made that atrium
originally, just like,

787
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,559
it would be cool
to have this in the movie,

788
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:17,335
and then as we kept working on the
movie, everybody started brainstorming:

789
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,139
“How can we use this?”

790
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:22,866
And I think that all led to the demise
of the whole tower, but...

791
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:25,618
Il love that shot of looking up
at all those stairs.

792
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,157
Oh, that's right.

793
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,998
There was a whole pass early on
where we did not blow up the tower.

794
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:33,035
No. Po got blown out of the tower.

795
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,621
Yeah, they ran out of the tower
and they jumped into a sewer.

796
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,361
Yeah.

797
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,424
If it's that beautiful,
we gotta destroy it.

798
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:43,937
Yeah.

799
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,996
- Destroy.
- Yeah.

800
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,189
This scene is one of the first times,
or one of the only times

801
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,602
we had Jack Black and Gary Oldman
together to record.

802
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:58,013
Yeah, imagine the universe imploding,
the two of those guys in the same room,

803
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,116
riffing off each other.
That was pretty crazy.

804
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,950
Yeah, it was really fun.

805
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:06,362
The fact that they're both fans
of each other was pretty cool,

806
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:09,538
and you could tell that they're
checking each other out,

807
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,608
making sure they're doing a good
performance in front of the other one.

808
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,754
And they came up with really good
ad-lib lines that we used for this.

809
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,044
Yeah, the scene had been struggling
for a while and then we got

810
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:20,363
the two of them together and they
just started working off each other.

811
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,377
You get this energy between them, and...

812
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:26,307
..they're similar enough to their
characters in real life, you know?

813
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,811
Because Gary Oldman
is a little intimidating.

814
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,109
Yeah, he's a little scary.
But, no, he’s a wonderful person,

815
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,050
but he's scary like in a
performance set up. Oh, my gosh.

816
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,551
He just becomes that intense,
you know, like on a dime,

817
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,473
he'll just become that
intense peacock character.

818
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:44,425
Yeah. This sequence batted through
a million different versions again,

819
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,279
‘cause if you're having the good guy
and the bad guy meet for the first time,

820
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,368
that's a pretty big event.

821
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,480
And finally when Phil Craven cracked it,
he just went away into his room

822
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:56,945
and we left him alone
for about two weeks, I think?

823
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:58,432
Yeah.

824
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,225
We didn't hear anything, see anything,
and then he comes out,

825
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,429
and it is absolutely an amazing
sequence he just pulled out of ether.

826
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,070
Yeah. Although, you know,
in any of these things,

827
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,703
so many people work on it over time,
it's all these little bits and pieces,

828
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,932
and it takes somebody to just...
finally pull them all together

829
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,735
and create the final version,
just the great collaboration.

830
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:21,136
Originally, this was
all taking place over dinner.

831
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:25,122
- Dinner of deception.
- Dinner of deception.

832
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,400
- Long ago...
- That was a great sequence.

833
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:28,698
That was really funny.

834
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,610
- And everybody was dying of poison.
- Yeah, everybody was dying...

835
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,620
We killed a lot of people
on that version.

836
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,579
Shen's trying to poison Po,
and Po's not eating the right poison,

837
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,053
- he's eating everything else...
- Everybody else's food.

838
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:42,649
Yeah.

839
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,129
But that was when the peacock
was trying to be more stealthy.

840
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:50,282
- He doesn't have to hide.
- Yeah.

841
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:55,469
- Many different versions for that.
- This whole exchange here, I love it.

842
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,804
Yeah, that was part of
the whole ad-libbing

843
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,446
when the two of them were facing off
against each other in the same room.

844
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:05,225
It just gives that energy between
the two of them. That was really cool.

845
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,946
This scene's a great one
to really see the cannon, too,

846
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:11,395
the design of the cannon
and what the inspiration for that was.

847
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:14,223
Well, we always...
in our world, if we could,

848
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,292
we wanted to push an animal theme,
and with the cannons,

849
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,395
we actually pushed more towards,
like, these fire-breathing demons

850
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,848
‘cause we wanted the lore

851
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:27,492
of what Shen's doing
to kind of spread throughout the land.

852
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,702
And you would, you would design things
to be more intimidating, you know.

853
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,279
So, it fit perfectly, I think.

854
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,391
We did that in the first film
with some of the equipment in the dojo.

855
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:42,429
And then this one is just taking it
to a whole new level of just cool,

856
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,377
you know, in demon technology.

857
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,060
- Demon technology.
- Yeah.

858
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,316
- Very cool.
- Yeah.

859
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,972
And that whole action figure thing
in there,

860
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,828
that was a tricky thing,
how to make sure that you could see it.

861
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,281
And not see it, right?

862
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,929
‘Cause you don't wanna blow the gag
for everybody until you have to.

863
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,640
And I think we just moved the bars
enough apart

864
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:08,196
for that one angle on Mantis’
little toy head

865
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,989
and then the touch
of actually moving the head

866
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,929
so everybody would realize
it was just, like, on a hinge.

867
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,458
And then we have a big,
big story turn here

868
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,867
where Po has another flashback
and makes a realization.

869
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,330
This is the big pivot,
the really big pivot

870
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,209
where everything
all comes together for Po,

871
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,855
where this mission is now personal.

872
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:29,598
And he's now off-balance as a master.

873
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,290
And I think that shift was really...

874
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:35,437
The whole point of that lead-up,
it's all fun and games until...

875
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,133
..that moment where
everything changes for Po

876
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:41,726
and he now has real reason
to be scared of the peacock.

877
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,323
Yeah.

878
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,824
And this whole thing,
this whole escape is to sort of show

879
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:51,158
how Po is so off-balance that he's
putting his friends’ lives in danger.

880
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,562
This was originally not meant
to have an exploding tower in it.

881
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,342
No.

882
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:01,471
No, but with the cannons being
developed more and then Peacock,

883
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,973
and in almost everything,
Peacock's always ahead of Po.

884
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,273
l love that addition to this story,

885
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:10,272
that it made him
that much bigger of a threat.

886
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:11,695
Right.

887
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,956
And this is just a really
fun sequence in 3-D,

888
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:16,801
and I know you worked a lot
with Damon to get that.

889
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,141
Yeah, trying to make sure
that we get the scale,

890
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,383
‘cause it's sometimes tricky when
you're pushing things really depthy.

891
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,370
Things might become miniaturized.

892
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,905
Damon was always very, very careful
to make sure that we kept the scale

893
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,532
of this tower, so it feels like
this massive thing.

894
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:33,956
It's not a little toy.
It's not matchsticks.

895
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:37,345
It is a massive building
that is coming down.

896
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:42,432
And all that sort of depthy shots
of them going in and out of the tower

897
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,807
and running up the tower
and this huge thing falling down,

898
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,400
was a huge feat for them
to do in layout.

899
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,490
Yeah. And then obviously the effects
team, Lawrence and that whole gang,

900
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,223
really pulled out everything
to get this one to work.

901
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,100
Yeah, I think to be able
to take what layout did

902
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,803
and then keep working with it
and enhancing it

903
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:07,424
on the scale that they did,
I think effects just really...

904
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:10,887
It's totally impres... I think...

905
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,885
We kept watching 1600 over and
over because it was a hard one to do,

906
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:17,705
but we never got bored
because it's got everything you want.

907
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,613
And all the little tiny additions
through this...

908
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:26,789
l remember when Tigress and Po are
flipping each other up the tower,

909
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:30,705
Lawrence and his team was like,
“Can we add a little flaming arrow

910
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,558
barely missing them?
Can we just put one in there, please?"

911
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,973
I mean, it's not like
I have to ask for anything.

912
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,224
They're like, "Can we put
something in because it's cool?"

913
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,171
- That's the fun part, yeah.
- More cool stuff.

914
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,511
- Yeah, it’s just so beautiful.
- And the lighting is beautiful.

915
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:48,598
Yeah. Showing off the red, you know,
with this kind of paler blue-gray,

916
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,943
and just really showing off Peacock's
theme, it's just growing and growing

917
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:54,483
as we move through these sequences.

918
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,442
He's getting more out of control. Now
that he knows that Po is off-balance.

919
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,273
Now that he knows the relationship...

920
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:05,749
Now... Shen is now growing in his
instability and his sense of power.

921
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:09,346
And the thing that's cool about that
is that intensity of the color.

922
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:13,604
And the growing of his threat...
is now ratcheting up in the movie.

923
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,840
- Poor wolf.
- He's very intense, isn't he?

924
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,642
That's one of the great shots
that I loved from Jeremy Shaw.

925
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,876
You know, the wolf boss lowering
his head and looking away.

926
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,239
Totally being like a dog
that has just been reprimanded.

927
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,429
I loved it.
The first take he did that, I was...

928
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,129
It just gives more texture
to the character, you know...

929
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,399
You feel for him.
The little lick of his lips, like...

930
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:40,233
- Yeah.
- Nervous.

931
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:43,768
- His boss is kind of mean.
- Yeah. He's so mean.

932
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,500
There's another great crowd shot
on the rooftop. I love that shot.

933
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,718
And along with the camera work,
raking across the roofs

934
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,641
that the wolves are streaming past.

935
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,653
That one is one of those
3-D moments, too.

936
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,348
Where you're just coming
sort of diagonally down

937
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:01,987
and you see layer upon layer
of these guys running.

938
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,306
I think Damon even, like,
kicked the camera a little bit

939
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,835
as something goes... a wolf goes
close by, you get a little, like...

940
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:09,578
You really feel like you're right there.

941
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:11,197
Right.

942
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,779
And this is some really sweet acting
from Jack Black through this scene.

943
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,096
- Yeah.
- You feel his vulnerability.

944
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,734
Now he has to explain to his friends
why he screwed up, and that's awkward.

945
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,902
They were working so well together
in the beginning and now it's...

946
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:27,935
Again, a guy won't talk about his
feelings until it's beaten out of him.

947
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:29,996
He gets a nice beating in this scene.

948
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,551
He gets a little bit of a beat-down
in this scene.

949
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,400
Especially when it's admitting
something to Tigress, which is so hard.

950
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,862
And this is also the bookend
of the boat sequence,

951
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,895
‘cause all those compositions between
Po and Tigress are the same.

952
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,548
What they're doing is the same.
She's sparring with him,

953
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:50,321
exactly the same gestures,
but now it's serious.

954
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:54,817
Before it was light and playful and
now it's ratcheted up where it's real.

955
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,328
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she sort of has to step up

956
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:02,095
as the leader of the group right here,
and it's... pretty intense for him.

957
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,940
Yeah.

958
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,949
Again, that "ready,"
that's exactly the same gesture,

959
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,208
her expression is totally different.

960
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:13,827
And Po's gonna get his butt
handed to him on a little platter.

961
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,762
Because she's definitely better
than he is at this.

962
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:24,294
That's one of the sequences that
totally gets me every single time.

963
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:28,479
I get choked up every time I see it,
you know, toward the end.

964
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,259
- Yeah.
- I've seen it like 20 times, but...

965
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:34,122
You're such a softie, Rodolphe.

966
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,825
Poor...

967
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:41,098
The acting on Po and Tigress
and the moment,

968
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:44,952
it's that turn you're talking about,
about their relationship.

969
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,469
Yeah. This is where he admits it.

970
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:50,655
- And that one expression, yeah.
- The delivery.

971
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:54,428
And this moment that you came up with,
this unexpected hug here,

972
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,595
I think, it’s just such a great idea.

973
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:59,201
I think that was, again,
one of those cranky weekend thoughts.

974
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:01,263
You've had a lot of cranky weekends
with Jack...

975
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:05,662
It was a weekend. I had a weekend...
because I was sitting there and going...

976
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,620
“I'm working on a weekend.”

977
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,588
But the idea that...
‘Cause she didn't originally hug him.

978
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:16,332
And the idea that she shows her feelings
instead of talking about it.

979
00:52:17,034 --> 00:52:18,874
She's a person of action.

980
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,292
And that hug is, again, if...

981
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:26,712
It's the most quickest way of going
to an uncomfortable reaction on a boy.

982
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:29,477
Hug him.

983
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,333
For me, it always
made the stakes really real.

984
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:35,209
That's what you would do because you
have no idea what's about to happen.

985
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,963
This thing is blowing up,
it's getting crazy,

986
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:41,292
and I'm gonna, you know, have this
moment with my friend before I leave.

987
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:42,939
They may never see each other again.

988
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,190
They may go off
to get themselves killed.

989
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,999
And she's really doing this
because she cares for him,

990
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,488
- and I think that's really important.
- And getting to see that tenderness.

991
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,071
It's the first time we've really
seen that emotion from Tigress.

992
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:54,827
It's pretty cool.

993
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,782
Again, you undercut
the emotion with Crane.

994
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,484
- Yeah. Gotta have a joke.
- It's awkward. They're hugging.

995
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,489
This scene with Peacock actually is
one of my favorites. I think the acting

996
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:09,428
in this scene... Pierre did was
just really, really extraordinary.

997
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,919
That's Sharon Bridgeman's
boards on this one.

998
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,782
It just really caught
some of the damage in that.

999
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,252
And Pierre, wasn't this one of the
scenes where he really concentrated

1000
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:23,659
on animating himself,
being the lead on Peacock?

1001
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,024
Well, yeah.
l remember, he put a clip together,

1002
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:31,071
putting up different clips
from Gary Oldman from different movies,

1003
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:35,582
but having still the text
from the Panda movie.

1004
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,470
And over his acting and just getting
the right mannerisms and stuff,

1005
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:43,394
it's... It's brilliant.
All those close-ups are fabulous.

1006
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:46,541
Yeah, and you just see the depth
of how hurt this guy is,

1007
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,247
and how dangerous that can be.

1008
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,337
And this is the moment where
he had that choice, really,

1009
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:54,823
of finding out his parents loved him

1010
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:58,285
and then, you know, he could say,
“Oh, it was all a misunderstanding.

1011
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:02,119
I guess I did all this for nothing.
Maybe I could be redeemed.”

1012
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,279
But I think it just shows
how far gone he is that he would

1013
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:09,294
rather continue doing
something he knows is wrong.

1014
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,410
Because he can't admit
that it was all him.

1015
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,424
You know, he's been blaming
everyone else for a long time.

1016
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,290
Yeah, well, if he massacred
all those pandas by accident.

1017
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:22,534
- You gotta justify your evil actions.
- Yeah.

1018
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:27,006
- Just stick with the plan.
- 1 guess I was in the right, right?

1019
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,511
And that last shot where he's left,

1020
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,743
rimmed by that red light,
all alone, is really his choice.

1021
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,218
Yeah. That's one of my favorite shots,

1022
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,569
again, where it's
just like a strong silhouette,

1023
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,652
his color theme,
you know what it's all about, you know,

1024
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,522
and every time that gets echoed
further down the line,

1025
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:48,855
it takes you back to that emotion,
you know, that you saw with him

1026
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:54,272
and you kind of know just how deep
all this is to him, in a bad way.

1027
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,362
Yeah.

1028
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,560
Yeah, he’s not gonna recover
very easily from what he's done.

1029
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,470
- This is a great location.
- l love that location.

1030
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:05,831
That jagged towered, cool place.

1031
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:10,156
The factory setting,
I think Ritche Sacilioc started it,

1032
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:14,067
and Mike Yamada helped us
flesh it out further,

1033
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,428
and Tang art directing.

1034
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:19,477
- The color is amazing on that.
- Incredible.

1035
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:23,767
Again, this is like
the fire theme in this sequence.

1036
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,354
This is the fight sequence,
the confrontation sequence.

1037
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,630
It's really based on the idea of fire.
Trial by fire.

1038
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:33,324
Yeah, it was all about all the design,
all the color, all those ideas

1039
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:37,941
kind of culminating here when Po
really is gonna go confront Peacock

1040
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,569
and try to find out
what really happened.

1041
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,814
And I remember the original concept art
for this sequence. It was all misty.

1042
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,679
It was always filled
with smoke and mist and...

1043
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:49,405
Yeah.

1044
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,586
And it always made it, actually,
feel even more dimensional,

1045
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,415
that things, you knew they
were disappearing into something

1046
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:58,758
and I actually think that
ended up being a cool detail

1047
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:04,466
or addition in 3-D to have things
in smoke and in mist, layer the shots.

1048
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,139
And also it reflects a story point,

1049
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,553
where he's trying to find
the truth through all this.

1050
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,610
He's actually searching for something,

1051
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:15,842
and that sort of layers of sort
of illusion... is always very cool.

1052
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,730
Yeah, and just how the peacock
kind of comes in and out of the mist

1053
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,428
and creates that mystery and
uses that mystery to his advantage.

1054
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,356
It just makes him...
maybe a little smarter than Po.

1055
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:29,769
Yeah, just a little bit.
And he's theatrical, too, which is cool.

1056
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,928
What was really cool about this,
too, is, and challenging,

1057
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,584
is it is a rescue for the Five.

1058
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:40,445
And Po is driven on this quest
to do what he's gotta do,

1059
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,951
but the Five are trying to save him
because they know

1060
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,030
bad things are gonna happen
when the two of them meet up.

1061
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,060
Yeah. And he knows it's wrong,
but he can't help himself.

1062
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:52,033
So that's a kind of vulnerability
I think that's really interesting.

1063
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:56,612
And the layers is what makes this, their
relationships, all very interesting.

1064
00:56:57,314 --> 00:56:59,594
It's not just cookie-cutter.
It's very layered.

1065
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:00,983
Yeah.

1066
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:06,106
Yeah, I like that this...
This whole structure and figuring out

1067
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,509
all the choreography, it was
quite complicated to figure out.

1068
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,370
How are you gonna keep
the Five on this side?

1069
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,338
- Po's down there on the conveyer belt.
- Where's the scaffolds?

1070
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,660
Yeah. Peacock is with him. How are
we gonna... Where's it all gonna go?

1071
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:19,514
And setting it up
for the end of the sequence.

1072
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:23,873
We just saw go by the wok with
Tai Lung's face from the first movie.

1073
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:25,714
If you look closely,
if you freeze-frame.

1074
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,969
- Little Easter egg there.
- You'll find it.

1075
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:30,462
Where did they get that, anyway?

1076
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,404
It's a little odd.
It was in the junkyard.

1077
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,653
We dug through the trash
and found that sucker.

1078
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:39,074
That's the fun thing about a sequel.
You can find all those little pieces.

1079
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,253
- Yeah.
- It keeps 'em alive.

1080
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:45,058
We're masters of re-use.
We just don't let anything go to waste.

1081
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:50,134
I felt so proud the day I noticed that.
It was the dailies, and it's rolling...

1082
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:52,191
I know. We never really told anybody.

1083
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,969
We were just like,
“Here effects, take this."

1084
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,012
When you look at a shot 50,000 times,
you start noticing things.

1085
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:03,741
And this final confrontation,
you know, this moment here...

1086
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:06,681
This confrontation
has always been like...

1087
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:10,404
It is the moment where Po gets
all his fears realized, essentially.

1088
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:15,361
All his worries, it's all played on
by the peacock and it's so cruel of him.

1089
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:20,406
And that emotional death
is just really powerful here.

1090
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,774
I think the acting
on their faces are amazing.

1091
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,656
The read that Gary does is amazing.

1092
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:27,815
Everything culminated
to make this just... so mean.

1093
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:30,272
- Yeah.
- He's so mean.

1094
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:34,784
He's even surrounded by Peacock’'s
you know, theme of color red.

1095
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:37,999
It's at his back
and Peacock’'s red, in front of him,

1096
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,325
and then... and then he's blasted.
Amazing.

1097
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,925
And the conversation he's talking about,
he's talking about himself.

1098
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,892
He's talking about what he thinks
of his parents

1099
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:49,702
and what his parents thought of him.

1100
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,960
He's not talking about Po at all, that's
the part that makes it interesting.

1101
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,460
He's starting to be able

1102
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,868
to put voice to what
he's been feeling all this time.

1103
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,730
Yeah. And that's part of what
I like about the peacock.

1104
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,861
He's just so messed up.

1105
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,790
And then we get to see Shifu again.
He's been missing for a while.

1106
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,209
- Yeah.
- A little glimpse of Shifu.

1107
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:09,731
Didn't William do that
entire sequence himself?

1108
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,203
Yeah. Those... three shots, four shots?

1109
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:15,229
Yeah. We finished that one pretty early.
That was a good one.

1110
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:19,562
That was early.
Very pretty, watery, but very early.

1111
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:25,185
This sequence, we see the huge
centerpiece of the movie,

1112
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:28,232
in a way, one of the very first
sequences that you did.

1113
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,872
It was very, very...
The first sequence we boarded.

1114
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,491
And the ideas in this sequence
were the images

1115
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:37,005
that we used to pitch the movie
to Jeffrey to say,

1116
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,370
“This is the movie we're gonna make.”

1117
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:44,292
And the two images were
little baby Po with radishes,

1118
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:48,622
and then the image of his mom, the point
of view of the baby in the basket,

1119
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,246
looking up and seeing his mom
for the last time.

1120
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:54,818
And those two images are what
we've built the entire movie around.

1121
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,825
And after the initial talks
with Jon and Glenn, the writers,

1122
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:02,213
and Phil, the head of story,
and Melissa and me,

1123
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,936
we're sitting there and talking about it

1124
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,957
and I said,
“L volunteer to board that first.”

1125
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:10,194
And Phil volunteered to board
the part right after this.

1126
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,580
And so I! went in my room and
I thumbnailed out this sequence,

1127
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:16,044
and it was the first boarded
sequence that we had.

1128
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,260
And then your sister actually
cleaned up your...

1129
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:21,292
Yeah, my sister made it gorgeous
and fleshed it out

1130
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,338
and made it into a sequence.

1131
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:27,955
But really, every beat in this
was there from the very beginning.

1132
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,808
Yeah, and even the idea of the
2-D and the CG working together

1133
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,844
was one of the really early
concepts as well.

1134
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:37,857
It's very important, too,
when that moment of 2-D becomes 3-D,

1135
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:42,012
because once Po finally fully
understands what happened,

1136
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:45,862
then it becomes real,
and before that, he can't do that.

1137
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,906
He can't get to the real version.

1138
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:50,908
It still stays in his mind,
which is why it’s 2-D.

1139
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:55,808
Yeah, it can't unlock until he does
the move, which is so powerful.

1140
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:59,272
And the moment where it
was supposed to go to 3-D

1141
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,462
was originally that point-of-view shot

1142
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:04,518
that was the first image that we pitched
when pitching the movie.

1143
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:06,904
It was supposed to be
the shot of the mom,

1144
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,580
as seen by the baby from the basket.

1145
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:13,026
But we pushed it forward by one shot
so that we made that transition to 3-D

1146
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:15,973
when the baby was put in the basket,

1147
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:20,423
because the shock of seeing it
go from 2-D to 3-D made you go,

1148
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,363
“What the...?”
for half the shot with the mom,

1149
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,577
and it didn't read, emotionally.

1150
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,202
Yeah, you would've been too distracted,
I think, by that changeover.

1151
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:34,239
Rather than now, you cut to the shot of
the mom, and it's much more powerful.

1152
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,625
I just did this little thing of shifting
the whole shot right before it to gold.

1153
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,725
As a transition,
it almost feels like it's going to CG,

1154
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,976
but it's actually,
it's just the color changing,

1155
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,648
and then the next shot matches
that gold color exactly.

1156
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:50,706
That transition was great.

1157
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:56,174
This environment is beautiful in terms
of really touching Po's color theory.

1158
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,947
This was really based on that trip,
wasn't it?

1159
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,602
When we were in Qingchengshan
in Chengdu, China,

1160
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:08,573
and we were all there in the mist,
on this...

1161
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:13,806
..where Taoism was formed,
and we kind of all had

1162
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:18,198
this crazy mystical connection
to this mountain, at least I did.

1163
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:20,648
I think everybody,
when we talked about it,

1164
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:24,441
you just had a deep connection
to the mountain and...

1165
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:29,115
.. kind of at a natural level,
and we just wanted to get that in here.

1166
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:33,356
And we also kind of wanted
this green against red to play, also,

1167
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:37,234
and it seemed to fit perfectly
against what we saw there.

1168
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:43,611
And to have that tied to where Po
was born, I thought was really strong.

1169
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,834
Those images of the trees with the red
eyes are based off Tang's paintings.

1170
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:53,655
Yeah. We actually did that idea of
birch trees with eyes in the first movie

1171
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:59,453
for a Wu sister idea, kind of a
spooky forest that we never used.

1172
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:03,000
But then,
Peacock's tail-feather-eye theme

1173
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:06,415
became so strong in this movie
that we were like,

1174
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,973
“We gotta use it here
because this is the moment to do it."

1175
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,817
This moment here makes me cry
every single time I see it,

1176
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,057
and I've seen it so many times,
it's crazy.

1177
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,448
- The animation is gorgeous.
- It's just beautiful.

1178
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:21,205
Dan Wagner's, yeah. It's gut-wrenching.

1179
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:25,011
Yeah, right there. When she touches his
little soft face, you're just like...

1180
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,775
- The sound.
- It hurts.

1181
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:29,198
Yeah.

1182
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:32,935
And the fact that you
realize what she did

1183
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,943
with just that little gesture there,
it's heart-rending.

1184
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,799
And that's why
he's been stuffing it all this time.

1185
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,594
And the 2-D in this sequence,
throughout the sequence,

1186
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:45,948
is really beautiful, the graphic nature.

1187
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:49,013
You and Pierre
just went to town on this.

1188
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:52,745
Yeah. That coordination of CG to 2-D,

1189
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:56,403
and then you guys animating
in and out of that.

1190
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,280
And the screen direction, it's such
a great flow, along with his move,

1191
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,348
it's flowing and the cinematog...
Everything's flowing together.

1192
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,560
The way you've used that water drop
as a transition between the mediums,

1193
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:10,040
- it's beautiful.
- Matching it perfectly for the position

1194
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,290
on screen, and depth and stereo.

1195
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,837
It's a very beautifully cut sequence.

1196
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:21,223
And the flashback, with some images
from the first movie

1197
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:23,915
was kind of an idea
that came along later.

1198
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,411
This was an addition.
I think it was Bill.

1199
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:30,647
Where we didn't have this
and we went straight from that emotion

1200
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:35,167
of Po realizing what happened,
going into battle, and it was so sad.

1201
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,861
You were left with the sadness
for a very long time.

1202
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,524
It was hard to dig out of that
during the battle itself.

1203
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,550
And so this euphoric moment, which
was all about bringing him back up

1204
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,905
and finding out what he did
with all that his mom sacrificed,

1205
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:52,745
it was empowering. This moment
was just such an uplifting moment,

1206
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:57,806
and it came out of a review meeting
in editorial with Bill Damaschke

1207
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:01,174
and he said, "I feel like we need
to have something here.”

1208
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:03,067
- Something uplifting.
- Something uplifting.

1209
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:04,923
And also that helps
with the adoption theme,

1210
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:08,615
the idea that even though his parents
couldn't raise him, that his life

1211
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:12,886
became what he made it and it was a
sum of the different kinds of family.

1212
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,033
- Yeah.
- You know.

1213
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,781
Tigress and the Five and Mr. Ping
and all those things become his family.

1214
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,606
Yeah, the rest of the story,
which is very, very sweet.

1215
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,759
- I'm glad we had that.
- Yeah. It's really beautiful.

1216
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:37,105
This moment here where Tigress is
chained up and she's still snarling...

1217
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,427
She's so menacing here.

1218
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:43,263
We had that as well in the factory,
you know, when she faces the gorilla.

1219
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:45,487
I thought, "Oh, and add it here."

1220
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:50,355
The CFX department added
all the creases on the nose.

1221
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,727
Finally, we have
some animalistic traits.

1222
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,790
That's what I really like about Tigress.
She is so cool.

1223
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:04,377
And this whole idea of putting this,
the water versus fire battle,

1224
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,184
was something I think,
the art department really helped.

1225
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:08,804
Yeah, you guys just made it up.

1226
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:12,172
I think it was all supposed
to take place on a desert battlefield

1227
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:16,428
and I think we had a chance
to do a quick blitz.

1228
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:20,386
I think it was two weeks
and we had like four or five guys,

1229
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,680
and we just did big what-ifs.

1230
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:25,006
Yeah, it's like,
“What could make it special?"

1231
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:26,738
Yeah. And the only thing I told them was

1232
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:30,040
I thought fire against water
would be a cool idea.

1233
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,400
And they knew the things
that we had built already

1234
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:38,707
and the Gongmen Harbor and a lot
of them just naturally were using that.

1235
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:42,869
And we had a ton of imagery
that came out of that.

1236
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,930
None of it really had a story,
but it was just like:

1237
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:49,520
“the Five are gonna be on rooftops while
the city is filled with red torches."

1238
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,643
All these visual ideas
that looked really epic

1239
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,922
were kind of just a launching point for,

1240
01:06:56,479 --> 01:07:00,928
I think Ale took that and fleshed
it out as an actual sequence.

1241
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:05,317
- That was a lot of fun.
- It was very much an inspirational pass

1242
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:07,829
just to see all that art come out
because every image,

1243
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:10,567
even though they're
all different, was unique.

1244
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,370
Yeah.

1245
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,479
They were all things
you had never seen before.

1246
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:16,298
You've seen an army on a field.

1247
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,746
You've never seen some of the images
that were brought up.

1248
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:23,712
And you had barges and huge scaffolded
rivers and stuff all over the place.

1249
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:28,817
And this also gave real structure
to what the battle was about.

1250
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:30,889
Yeah, where Shen needs to go.

1251
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,267
Yeah, ‘cause otherwise
you don't know who's winning.

1252
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,586
You don't know what progress is made

1253
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,709
and you've gotta have
that on something this big.

1254
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,595
Yeah. And it felt right
to have it confined, too,

1255
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:45,961
that it would be more of a close combat,
or close quarters, you know, fight.

1256
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:50,173
And that the Five and Po would have
to figure out what to do with this army.

1257
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,523
And that was the real structural thought

1258
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,060
that Ale had when he was doing
the board sequence of this,

1259
01:07:56,472 --> 01:08:00,282
contrasting the tunnel,
which is the canal section of this,

1260
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,590
to the wide, open waters of the harbor,

1261
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:07,102
which was the more
sort of Zen moments of this battle,

1262
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,520
which goes more to the emotional core
of what Po has to deal with.

1263
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,227
So you go with the physical battle

1264
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,305
and then the emotional battle
on the second part.

1265
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:18,384
But some of these ideas were from the
earlier pass that Gary Graham had done

1266
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:22,541
out on the battlefield, like this whole
idea of Po making a speech and...

1267
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:26,506
No one can hear him. That was from the
desert pass and Gary had just added it

1268
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:30,506
in a storyboard pass of his,
and it was so hysterical.

1269
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,160
We were just cracking ourselves
to pieces re-watching that thing.

1270
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:36,853
And this idea of Po
kind of outrunning the cannons.

1271
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:40,212
Yeah, where he has to sort of do
the blitz-dodge

1272
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,593
and then get down amongst the cannons
so they can't fire on him.

1273
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,583
That was all stuff that
we had in that previous pass

1274
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,050
and it was a great previous pass.

1275
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:52,952
That desert fight sequence finale
was really awesome

1276
01:08:53,595 --> 01:08:57,955
and this was really about trying
to get the location to feel as special.

1277
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:04,166
Gary also went through and boarded
a lot of this new version as well,

1278
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:08,367
trying to get the nuances
of this battle to work.

1279
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:11,881
And once Po frees the Five, this is
the first time in Kung Fu Panda world

1280
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,288
where we've had them fighting
against an army of characters.

1281
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:19,221
And then there's... Rodolphe, want to
talk about the opportunities there?

1282
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,500
Absolutely.

1283
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,613
I'm seeing always some
of those scenes there. I'm just...

1284
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,050
No, but it was... It was a great
challenge to have so many wolves

1285
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,447
onscreen at the same time,
you know, fighting with Po...

1286
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,554
Yeah, it was so cool.

1287
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,659
Logistically, to work with crowds
and layout and setting everything up

1288
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:44,108
as a moving chain through
the city and... it was a lot.

1289
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:46,564
One thing on some of these specific
moves I think you came up with

1290
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:49,263
towards the end there, Rodolphe,
where we really just see,

1291
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:52,446
like, each of them gets their moment
to do something kind of extraordinary.

1292
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:56,648
It was so neat to fit
all the animation team with all this.

1293
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,450
Discuss it with Jen, you know,
finding the right tone for everybody.

1294
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:06,826
And that return of Shifu...
it's epic, you know.

1295
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:10,124
Il remember I was so glad
when we had the screening

1296
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:13,913
and the audience was cheering
and clapping. It was like... wow.

1297
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:17,238
- They like that little guy.
- Yeah.

1298
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,020
This whole section, coming up here,

1299
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:22,541
l remember it was a brainstorming
session with you, Rodolphe,

1300
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,522
and Gary and Phil and me sat in a room

1301
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:28,072
and tried to figure out how to get,
you know,

1302
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,074
the Five to be super cool
in their each, individual moments.

1303
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:35,054
And the barges, this whole barge thing
was something from the first movie

1304
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,538
that you had actually thought of
for the final battle against Tai Lung,

1305
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:41,212
and we couldn't figure out how to do.

1306
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:47,384
And we actually got this barge,
boat sequence to work in this one.

1307
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:50,551
I'm pretty sure Rodolphe came up
with this, and that moment, too.

1308
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,246
“love you guys.”

1309
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:53,452
Yeah.

1310
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:55,753
Like, "Yeah, you sure you
don't want this super slow-mo?"

1311
01:10:56,152 --> 01:10:58,322
And you acted it out. It was so funny.

1312
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,219
That is cool.

1313
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:06,105
The animation through here,
that revolving shot... it's amazing.

1314
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:11,465
Yeah, and you made every single move.
It's like... It's crazy.

1315
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,281
Yeah, trying to find moves
that fit the characters,

1316
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:16,697
each of the characters, you know?

1317
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,830
All working together despite
the camera and the entire crowd behind.

1318
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:21,776
It was fun.

1319
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:27,865
This little intercutting to the peacock
finally blowing them all to pieces...

1320
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,815
..that was a whole very
challenging thing to get right.

1321
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,498
To get the timing right through there.

1322
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:36,403
‘Cause it is, like, it is a dance.
It is trying to get the rhythm of

1323
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:40,646
that momentum right before you
just yank the rug out from them.

1324
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,350
I mean, throughout the movie,
I think you worked so closely with

1325
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,836
the editor, Clare Knight, on all of
those timings and really, you know...

1326
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:52,817
-..it was ongoing to the very end.
- Yeah, she's so good.

1327
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:55,383
She's so good with the pace

1328
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:59,032
and trying to get that
to really have that emotional hit.

1329
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,959
Wow, we just were working with a lot
of previz shots on that as well

1330
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:06,626
and she somehow constructed that
to really hit you really hard.

1331
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:10,323
The Wolf Boss has his
heroic moment there.

1332
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:14,147
Yeah, he wasn't all bad.
He couldn't blow up his dudes.

1333
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:18,834
Didn't we originally have a line
where he says, "I know that guy.

1334
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:23,322
I play with his kids on Sundays"
or whatever. I forget.

1335
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,591
We cut that line out.

1336
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,774
At least he had a little character arc.

1337
01:12:31,314 --> 01:12:33,864
But he's not dead. He just fell off...

1338
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,583
Yeah, I always wonder,
“Did he die? I don't know.”

1339
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:38,758
- Does anybody really die in this world?
- 1 think the wolves are OK.

1340
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:43,272
And the explosion, that explosion
of those gates is huge.

1341
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:45,283
- Beautiful.
- Effects...

1342
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:47,588
I love that they were
able to stylize it enough

1343
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,809
so that it has that graphic punch,
you know, and not...

1344
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,871
We were always on the edge of,
“Don't make it look like a gasoline..."

1345
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,741
you know, like a real fire,
but it needs to have as much impact.

1346
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,005
- Yeah.
- 1 thought they did that beautifully.

1347
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,735
To have it be graphic
and have it be intense,

1348
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,693
but still have some design to it
so it doesn't have to be so realistic.

1349
01:13:09,352 --> 01:13:10,932
Yeah, throughout the movie,
the explosions of the cannons

1350
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,870
was a really visually unique
kind of cannon explosion.

1351
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,440
David Tidgwell. Yep.

1352
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:18,248
Incredible work with
the spiraling smoke plumes

1353
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:24,271
and the trails of swirling sparks and
how all that works... It's incredible.

1354
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:26,901
And then we take full advantage of it
here at the end of the movie,

1355
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:32,373
‘cause we stage it in a darker sequence
that this light show just looks amazing.

1356
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,312
The sound effects guys really worked
hard to get a unique sound for that.

1357
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:40,392
Yeah, they want to make sure that
it wasn't, you know, recognizable.

1358
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,070
It's a fireworks-based sound effect.

1359
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:44,995
We wanted to make sure that
it was fizzy and different,

1360
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:49,118
and it didn't sound Civil War or
World War Il or anything like that.

1361
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:52,782
It was definitely
ancient-animal-run China.

1362
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:56,052
Yeah, they went out to the desert
and they recorded all these explosions

1363
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,679
- of fireworks and then...
- It was pretty cool.

1364
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:00,365
..created a whole kind of unique sound

1365
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:02,403
so there was that kind of
signature feeling to it.

1366
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:03,915
Very unique.

1367
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,340
That moment where Po is gathering
himself to reflect the cannon ball,

1368
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:12,558
that was one that has
been around for a long time.

1369
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,202
We had that in every version
of the final battle.

1370
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,611
Yeah, it seems like that was the one
thing you knew from the beginning,

1371
01:14:18,054 --> 01:14:20,224
which was he was gonna
have to fight a cannon.

1372
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:23,299
And it actually was
that second scene, you know.

1373
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,666
There was the first scene that I boarded
and the second scene that Phil boarded

1374
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,859
and that had, again, those elements
from the first movie

1375
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,889
where the water test that you had,
Rodolphe.

1376
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:36,712
And he had done that and that was
originally taking place in the village.

1377
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,180
It wasn't in the midst of the battle.

1378
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,948
But the problem with doing it all in
the village was it gave away everything.

1379
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:46,919
He had nothing to resolve in
the battle, and there was no tension.

1380
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,742
So this moment where he sees
the cannon finally coming to him

1381
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:52,664
and he deflects it in that last moment

1382
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:55,362
and you see the cannonball
turning into the water drop,

1383
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:58,788
that was in every version...
of that final battle.

1384
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:01,702
Yeah, you're putting those two
pieces together, resolving his past

1385
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:05,268
and finding his inner strength in
this moment to defeat the cannonballs.

1386
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:07,508
Really crucial piece of storytelling.

1387
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,333
But I thought putting it
on that water setting just gave

1388
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,770
that water drop even more resonance.

1389
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:14,909
‘Cause you have the water on the fire,
as you said,

1390
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:17,531
when you're doing
that visual development.

1391
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,974
And, visually, it still takes advantage
of kind of what the desert scene did.

1392
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,330
It was one guy and almost in the middle
of nowhere is gonna block a whole army.

1393
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:29,622
And the fact that that just...
putting that one guy standing on water

1394
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,549
and he's gonna...
What's he gonna do, you know?

1395
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:34,855
Then you just have this amazing show
of how it plays out.

1396
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,174
It was even more pathetic
with that little bit of flotsam

1397
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,970
that he's standing on, you know?

1398
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:42,525
Like a little wood boogie board that
he used to drag over there to...

1399
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:44,399
Yeah.

1400
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,331
This is a great scene
that Jon and Glenn wrote.

1401
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:07,477
I think just a really fun,
interesting way

1402
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,960
to kind of get at the final moment
between the two of them.

1403
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,799
Great little dialogue between them where
he's talking about, you know, scars...

1404
01:16:14,437 --> 01:16:16,867
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's brilliant.
- It was just so funny.

1405
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:19,043
‘Cause it's hitting the theme
and all of the issues,

1406
01:16:19,442 --> 01:16:22,052
but in such a kind of sideways way
that it's really entertaining.

1407
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:26,648
It's almost the parody of the big final
moment of understanding speech

1408
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:28,753
between the good guy and the bad guy.

1409
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:33,658
But only Po could do that where
he really, honestly, is not equipped

1410
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:36,627
for that kind of gravitas.

1411
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,023
Yeah, there's just a brilliant piece
of animation from Dan

1412
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:41,302
where he talks about
how his shoulders...

1413
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,980
-"Keep the shoulders loose."
- It was really cute.

1414
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:45,777
Yeah.

1415
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:49,005
But it was also a challenge, too, to
make sure that Po comes off as sincere.

1416
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:50,942
He's not making fun of
the peacock through all this.

1417
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:53,206
- He sincerely wants to help him.
- Yeah.

1418
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:56,662
And any pass that we did where Po came
off as being a little bit too goofy,

1419
01:16:57,246 --> 01:17:00,846
we had to dial back to make sure he
was deeply sincere through all this.

1420
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:03,916
- Otherwise you don't like him.
- Yeah, he has to stay sweet.

1421
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:06,700
That was always also the highest goal
of kung fu was to actually,

1422
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,913
if you could fix your opponent, if you
could actually heal your opponent...

1423
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,389
- Yeah.
-... that's the highest,

1424
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:15,438
that's the best thing
you could ever try to do, so.

1425
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:20,355
I always love that kind of message,
that Po is operating at that level.

1426
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:22,307
But, yet, you still want them to fight.

1427
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,478
Oh, yeah. You still gotta
see something blow up.

1428
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:26,744
- You want the two of them to go at it.
- You still gotta do that.

1429
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:29,016
That's the yin and yang of it.

1430
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:33,097
And this little moment with Tigress...

1431
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,292
That was one of the latest things
that we did.

1432
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:37,738
One of the very last
animated shots that we did.

1433
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:39,677
Yeah. It seems so obvious now
that of course

1434
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:41,759
this is what would have to happen,
he'd have to hug her,

1435
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,468
but we didn't think about
doing it till towards the end.

1436
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,630
Yeah, wasn't that, again,
a cranky weekend thing?

1437
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,289
I think it was another
one of your cranky weekends.

1438
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:51,321
- 1 think you need more of those.
- 1 need more cranky weekends.

1439
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:19,397
And this sequence, my goodness.

1440
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:21,222
Yeah, then we get to go back
and see Dad, and...

1441
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:23,467
- That kid gets a laugh every time.
- He's pretty miserable.

1442
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:28,259
It's such a heart-tugging moment
to this,

1443
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:33,397
and it was always hoped for that it
would be a deeply emotional moment.

1444
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:36,426
And it was a matter of crafting
the subtleties on this

1445
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:41,102
to get it to the point where
it could make you sort of choke up.

1446
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,630
It's amazing, though, that
you leave him for a whole movie

1447
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,693
and you come back and
that emotion’'s still there.

1448
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:48,958
When you come back to this,
everybody is totally invested in what...

1449
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:50,924
“What are they gonna
say to each other?"

1450
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:54,133
It's only three scenes. The moment
where dad tells him he's adopted,

1451
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:55,897
the moment where they say goodbye

1452
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,542
and then the moment
where they make up at the end.

1453
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,820
There's three sequences that their
entire relationship is hinged on.

1454
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:04,727
Yeah. It's such a primal relationship.

1455
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:08,137
You feel it tugging Po
throughout the movie and so,

1456
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:11,961
knowing he's finally worked it out
is just such a release.

1457
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:15,741
And I think the voice acting, both James
and Jack in this scene is just...

1458
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,658
- Yeah. The way Jack just...
-..really beautiful.

1459
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:23,224
...he just had so much emotion in his
voice, and I think that really inspired

1460
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:26,129
William and Dan
when they did their animation.

1461
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,325
l remember when you came back
from the recording session,

1462
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:30,751
saying "You're not gonna believe it."

1463
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:33,877
We cried in the recording booth,
and that doesn't happen very often.

1464
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:35,173
We were like...

1465
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:36,611
- We cried.
- Yeah.

1466
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,599
And then you showed me...

1467
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:43,482
We showed you the record and it
was put up against rough board and...

1468
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:47,043
And even off the rough board
it's like... "Oh, gosh.”

1469
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,363
It's so emotional.

1470
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:51,892
And then Dan and William
got super excited

1471
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:55,048
and they ran off and they did,
like Dan did all the Po shots

1472
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:59,871
and William did all the Dad shots
and it was just so beautifully animated.

1473
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,559
This shot was no easy feat.

1474
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:32,622
Yeah, and everybody loves it.
They start clapping here.

1475
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,092
And they go, "Wait a minute,
what's going on..."

1476
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:36,791
“Where are we going?”

1477
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,942
Matte painting. Look at this.
The length of China.

1478
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:41,478
That's a matte painting feat.
That's insane.

1479
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,166
Yeah.

1480
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:46,192
Yeah, and you really wanna know
that you're going somewhere.

1481
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,545
It's a really important story point
to get that sense of distance.

1482
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:51,497
Jen kept pushing for distance.
“Il wanna feel like we're really moving

1483
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,004
and getting out of here.”

1484
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:55,275
Yeah, far, far. Not the next valley.

1485
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:57,418
And that, you know,
looks like it might be Oogway there.

1486
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:00,190
I love that. I don't even think
we thought of that misdirect

1487
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,329
when we were kind of
originally working on it

1488
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:04,365
and then as soon as we saw the shot,

1489
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,900
people started saying,
“I thought that was Oogway.”

1490
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,383
- It's great.
- And this is just... ] don't know.

1491
01:21:09,832 --> 01:21:13,202
l always get a little teary
on that spot, too, ‘cause it’s such a...

1492
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:15,476
That's the shot that we

1493
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:19,378
added later because it was
after we went to China.

1494
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:21,758
- Yeah.
- And we saw how people

1495
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,366
revered the panda so much.

1496
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:27,657
Can't leave people thinking
that every panda in the world is dead.

1497
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,767
- Yeah.
- There are kids going home, going,

1498
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:33,112
-"Hey, Mommy, did all the pandas die?"
- Yeah.

1499
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:35,769
- Just a downer.
- It's a little grim.

1500
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,565
Yeah, we have to have
a few of them alive somewhere.

1501
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:39,931
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1502
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:44,179
We used a little bit of architectural
reference and location reference

1503
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:48,059
a little bit from that trip,
you know, from Qingchengshan again.

1504
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,040
It was nice to kind of echo
that through that bit because

1505
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,560
- that's where the pandas are from.
- Right.

1506
01:21:53,976 --> 01:21:55,286
There's a little something
written on the rock there.

1507
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:57,607
Yeah. Yeah, it’s actually
the name of that mountain.

1508
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:00,096
- Yeah. Little Easter egg.
- Yep.

1509
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,695
And these end titles, also sort of a...

1510
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:08,741
We always like bookending, right?
We like bookending our movies.

1511
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,838
The first movie started with a 2-D
sequence and ended with a 2-D one.

1512
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:16,201
And this one starts with the shadow
puppet sequence and ends with one.

1513
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:20,619
And it was another fun one
to kind of figure out and work out.

1514
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,323
Yeah, the guys at Shine created this

1515
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,962
but Tang, I think,
did all the art himself.

1516
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,932
I think he pretty much...

1517
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:32,230
I think Jason...
Jason Brubaker did a couple also.

1518
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,028
Tang was like booking,
trying to beat his baby being born.

1519
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:40,704
He was expecting his son
and I was like, "I need this done.”

1520
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,550
We're, like, full-blown in lighting.

1521
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,072
He's like, "I hope she doesn't
have a baby right now.”

1522
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,110
We're half-expecting him to be gone,
half painting.

1523
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,548
And then I love these ideas
that the story team came up with

1524
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,851
of what it might've been like to be
Po growing up in the Valley of Peace.

1525
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:57,835
Januel.

1526
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,050
Januel, who was one of the board guys,
came up with a lot of these scenarios,

1527
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,860
and came up with quite a few,

1528
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:07,825
and that inspired Tang to go
and make a lot of these images.

1529
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:13,644
And the legend of how Po got,
you know, to Mr. Ping's back door,

1530
01:23:14,523 --> 01:23:16,573
Il love that whole
little bit of traveling

1531
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:18,605
during the voice acting credits.

1532
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,773
And you never know
what really happened.

1533
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:22,596
No. Yeah.

1534
01:23:22,965 --> 01:23:24,715
Who knows, maybe it did
involve a volcano, but...

1535
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,393
I think so.

1536
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:28,972
- Surely.
- 1 believe it.

1537
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,629
There's eating the bamboo furniture,
which was imported.

1538
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:36,541
I do like seeing little
bits and pieces of that.

1539
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:38,775
“It was imported, too.”

1540
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,233
That was very cool.

1541
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:43,811
Little Po.

1542
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,522
- Yeah, we have long credits, don't we?
- We do.

1543
01:23:45,888 --> 01:23:47,198
We do. We have a lot of people
making these movies.

1544
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:48,635
We try to make it look pretty, though,

1545
01:23:48,924 --> 01:23:51,354
so people will sit through
and watch all the credits.

1546
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,670
Yeah and give the crew something to
kind of look at while they're looking

1547
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,480
- for their name or whatever.
- Yeah, this was all done, finally,

1548
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,636
I think, at the very,
very eleventh hour.

1549
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:03,075
The last pass of this came in
right under the wire.

1550
01:24:03,672 --> 01:24:05,451
Credits are always the last thing,

1551
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,094
‘cause otherwise
we might miss somebody.

1552
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:10,327
I didn't help them either by...

1553
01:24:10,746 --> 01:24:13,026
You know, every transition
is actually an animating one,

1554
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:16,205
so it's not like you can really
find a clean cut point to redo things.

1555
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,562
So when they were re-rendering, there's
only three cuts to the whole thing.

1556
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:22,022
And so when anything
had to be changed,

1557
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:24,631
they re-rendered, basically,
a third of this thing.

1558
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:27,233
And one of the things we decided
to do right during the mix, obviously,

1559
01:24:27,696 --> 01:24:29,626
right at the end of the movie,
was adding the song,

1560
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,115
- or this remix by Junkie XL.
- Yeah.

1561
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,938
And, again, it's a matter of tone.

1562
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:36,553
It was after an
Angelina Jolie screening,

1563
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,518
where she had brought all her kids
and afterward, her only comment was

1564
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:43,166
“You know, you might want
to pick a really, really upbeat song.

1565
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:44,632
Have you thought of a song yet?”

1566
01:24:44,947 --> 01:24:47,167
I thought, "Well, we haven't
had a song yet.”

1567
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,349
Because in the first movie
we had a big, upbeat song,

1568
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,091
but we didn't have one yet.

1569
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:54,913
And so it was one of those
eleventh-hour things where Junkie XL

1570
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:57,517
came in and came up with a remix for us

1571
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,710
and it just had a nice,
happy, upbeat tone to it.

1572
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,403
Yeah, and it really, like,
lifts your mood when you're coming out

1573
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:06,702
and you connect back to baby Po
and the Po themes in a really fun way.

1574
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,789
I think it helps a lot.

1575
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:11,221
It celebrates the film in a great way,

1576
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:14,137
and I love that the,
the way Shine put the art together

1577
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:16,693
from the shadow puppet things
that we gave them,

1578
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:19,955
it was just kind of focusing in
a little bit on

1579
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,625
how these shadow puppets
were kind of created in art.

1580
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:26,245
- It's a nice detail to show everybody.
- Yeah.

1581
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:28,285
Yeah, there's so much gorgeous art
that gets created

1582
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:31,407
over the course of these movies,
just infinite piles of art.

1583
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,830
- It's staggering.
- Yeah.

1584
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:35,636
Very cool.

1585
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:39,552
We didn't get to talk
much about Guillermo.

1586
01:25:40,035 --> 01:25:41,995
- Would you like to?
- Yeah, like for instance,

1587
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:45,277
the peacock... the peacock fighting.

1588
01:25:45,841 --> 01:25:49,271
I think he talked me out of
all the logic camera stuff,

1589
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:51,991
‘cause I was always feeling
very sad that we had

1590
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:54,617
a Mr. Burns of a peacock
who doesn't fight.

1591
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,303
When we had all of that
cool action stuff, you know?

1592
01:25:57,786 --> 01:25:59,866
And you get stuck in the logic loop.

1593
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:02,252
And he said,
“How can you have a martial arts movie

1594
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:06,351
with a bad guy that doesn't
do martial arts? He's like Mr. Burns.

1595
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:10,539
I mean, he's such a lame villain
if he can't do martial arts."

1596
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,719
And I thought,
“You're absolutely right.”

1597
01:26:14,236 --> 01:26:16,635
And we have a villain
that was designed to do martial arts.

1598
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:19,659
His initial concept is
that he should be a martial artist

1599
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,745
who also has this thing that beats
everything he personally can do.

1600
01:26:24,413 --> 01:26:29,192
It's far more menacing if a guy
can beat something he understands

1601
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,658
than can beat something
he can't understand.

1602
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:32,924
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1603
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:36,181
Guillermo came in about halfway
through the moviemaking process

1604
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:38,598
and really helped us
identify things like that

1605
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,667
where we had maybe talked ourselves
out of good ideas.

1606
01:26:41,063 --> 01:26:42,353
Yeah. He said,
“Well, why don't you do this.”

1607
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,038
I was like, "Well, we had
all these logic issues."

1608
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:46,949
Like, “Well, forget that.”
I'm like, "Yes!

1609
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:48,919
Let's do what's cool!"

1610
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:50,347
He was the 14-year-old boy in the room

1611
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:51,982
who was rooting
for it to be cool all the time.

1612
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,090
Yeah, and that was such a breath
of fresh air.

1613
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:56,879
He just was like always looking for,
“What's cool? What's cool?"

1614
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,309
And I thought, "That's brilliant.”

1615
01:26:59,748 --> 01:27:02,298
Yeah. It's so valuable
to have just a fresh pair of eyes

1616
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:05,658
and such a big-hearted person
come in and really kind of...

1617
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,731
Yeah, and often it just brought back
what the movie was trying to be.

1618
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,942
I mean, that's the thing
that he was really good at.

1619
01:27:12,294 --> 01:27:15,014
He didn't assert himself on the movie.

1620
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:19,224
He was just very good at seeing
what the movie was asking for.

1621
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,421
Just as a story, as...
what the characters are asking for.

1622
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:25,368
He just looked at it and said,
“This is what it's screaming to be."

1623
01:27:25,874 --> 01:27:29,744
And I thought that was just so nice,
so invigorating.

1624
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:35,279
And he, in a very short period of time,
came up with so many great ideas.

1625
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:38,094
- Thanks for listening.
- Thank you very much.

1626
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:39,423
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

1627
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,861
- We love talking, so it's great for us.
- Yeah.

1628
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:43,951
Hang out.

1629
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:45,536
Bye.

1630
01:27:46,328 --> 01:27:47,318
Bye.

1631
