00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,110
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP.

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,713
Buena Vista Home Entertainment,
Mitsubishi and Toho PRESENT

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,670
Only in silence the word,
only in dark the light,

4
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,047
only in dying life:

5
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,684
bright the hawk's flight
on the empty sky.

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,054
.
- The Creation of Ea

7
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,301
Ease the sail!

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,170
It's blowing too hard!

9
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:57,022
Curse it! A storm this time of year?
Where's my Weatherworker?

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,508
What are you waiting for?
Calm the waves before we sink!

11
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,975
What's wrong?

12
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,713
Captain... l can't remember them.

13
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,374
I can't remember the True Names
of wind and waves.

14
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,045
What? Are you mad?

15
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,461
Captain!

16
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,771
There's something above the clouds!

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,770
Where?

18
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,354
What is that?

19
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,945
A dragon!
What is it doing here?

20
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,969
There's another one!

21
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,762
Dragons fighting? That's impossible !

22
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,585
More than 2.000 sheep
have taken the fever in Enlad alone.

23
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,803
Half of them have died.

24
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,533
Seven hundred cattle
have been infected.

25
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,852
We've lost 50 head so far.

26
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:16,325
In fact, a baby on Taon
has also come down with the fever.

27
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,342
Silence!

28
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,735
If we panic.
what will become of the People?

29
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,049
Seal off the affected areas.

30
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:31,124
Send every healer
in the kingdom to find a cure.

31
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,558
Send provisions
to those who need then.

32
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,355
Wizard Root!
Find out what's behind this.

33
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,478
Your Majesty.

34
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,195
And the drought
in the provinces?

35
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,661
We sent Weatherworkers
but the results were disappointing.

36
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,572
Soon it may be too late
for the spring planting.

37
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,120
Why have these misfortunes
befallen us, Root?

38
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,254
I sense the Light dimming,
Your Majesty.

39
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,073
The Light?

40
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,685
The Light of the Balance
that sustains the world.

41
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,149
Your Majesty!

42
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,649
What now?

43
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,325
Terrible news!

44
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,280
Dragons have been sighted
off the coast!

45
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,200
- Dragons?
- Two, Majesty. One was killed.

46
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:26,191
Dragons here, in the East?
Can this really be true?

47
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,124
Long ago, dragons
and men were one.

48
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:36,094
But men who coveted possessions
chose the land and the sea.

49
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,147
Dragons who wanted freedom,
chose wind and fire.

50
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,384
Since then, dragons and men
remained apart.

51
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,771
To hear that dragons have been seen,
and were even fighting...

52
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,053
The twilight that threatens
us is ever deepening.

53
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,954
Bring the captain to me.
l would hear more of this.

54
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,311
Root, ! want you there too.

55
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,332
Please... Your Majesty!

56
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,480
- We'll get in trouble!
- Lhave to!

57
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,836
- What is it?
- Have you seen Prince Arren?

58
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,200
He's been gone since last night.

59
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,986
Prince Arren? Gone?

60
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,364
That's enough.

61
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,796
His Majesty is occupied.

62
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,329
Surely you can see that.

63
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,931
Forgive me.

64
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,243
It's just... he seems so sad lately.
We were worried.

65
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,120
That's absurd!
Arren is 17, not a child.

66
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,092
Forgive this disturbance, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,162
Your people are more important.

68
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,931
- Very well, then.
- Your Majesty.

69
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,217
I must tend
to my correspondence.

70
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,643
We await your command, sire.

71
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,018
I'm imagining things.

72
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,943
Arren!

73
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,662
So you are my death...

74
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,073
Are you hurt?

75
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,046
Steady there, lad!

76
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,175
Is this what you seek?

77
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,226
This is dangerous country
for travelers.

78
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,950
You were lucky this time.
You must be hungry.

79
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,061
It's not much,
but you're welcome to it.

80
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,332
What is your name, lad?

81
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,005
My name is Arren.

82
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,104
Arren, is it?
It means sword, doesn't it?

83
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,103
So you hail from Enlad.

84
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,434
How did you know?

85
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,077
That blade
was forged with magic.

86
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:28,048
[ doubt you could unsheathe it.

87
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,967
What is it?

88
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,561
It's nothing.

89
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:56,345
Arren?

90
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,260
If you have nowhere to go,
why not come with me?

91
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,921
] doubt our meeting here
was an accident.

92
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,109
And I'd welcome
a companion on the road.

93
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,592
Arren! Are you coming?

94
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,603
What should I call you?

95
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,077
Call me Sparrowhawk.

96
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,240
Another abandoned farm.
Farmers leaving their land...

97
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,541
There's more to this
than poor harvests.

98
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,435
Come, Arren.
We'd better push on.

99
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,761
Lord Sparrowhawk?

100
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,257
Sparrowhawk will do.
What is it?

101
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,667
Sparrowhawk?

102
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,879
Where are we heading?

103
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:02,518
First. we go to the next town.
But after that...

104
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,146
...even [ don't know.

105
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,146
- Getting tired?
- No.

106
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,231
Come along.
We're almost there.

107
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,291
There it is.

108
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,094
Hort Town.

109
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,614
Are they prisoners?

110
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,400
They are slaves.

111
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,005
Here, people are goods
to buy and sell.

112
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,481
Trading in human lives!

113
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,766
Two guineas, gentlemen!
Do ! hear two guineas?

114
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,697
Il have two guineas!

115
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,548
Three! Sold to the gentleman
for three guineas!

116
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,788
No, sorry!
Couldn't possibly find room!

117
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,802
Gauzes from Sowl!
Silks from Lorbanery!

118
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,302
Furs and felts and woolens!

119
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,562
Is this a market day?

120
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,818
No. It's like this year round.

121
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,200
Silks and satins!
Canvass and fleecefells!

122
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,426
What can I show you?

123
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,729
This is Lorbanery's finest silk!

124
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,300
Fine as a mayfly's wing!

125
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,033
I don't have a wife.
l need a cloak for my friend.

126
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,271
Wizards! No girlfriend, eh?

127
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,977
- But I don't need a cloak.
- You can't go about like that.

128
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,490
You should hide
that thing on your belt.

129
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:31,966
What about this?

130
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,915
Fleece from Gont.
Highest quality.

131
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,785
Four warp strings.
This is Andradean work.

132
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,277
On Gont they use six or more.

133
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,754
You used to be a sorceress.
Why are you selling fakes?

134
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,719
People don't believe
in foolish tricks any more.

135
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,785
My goods are
not what I claim.

136
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,956
But at least they're real...

137
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,628
...not mere lies and air
like magic and sorcery!

138
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,983
Sparrowhawk!

139
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,178
Thank you!

140
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,435
What!

141
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,355
Unhand me!

142
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,570
Calm yourself, young master.

143
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,420
l have something for you.
It's the door to bliss.

144
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,402
What is it?

145
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,694
Hazia, my lord. Ha-zi-a.

146
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,286
Take one.
Leave sorrow and fear behind.

147
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,780
No more sorrow or fear...

148
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:14,916
You'll never be troubled
with the pain of this world again.

149
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,995
You needn't pay me.
It's my pleasure.

150
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,268
Arren.

151
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,529
What are you doing?

152
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,235
Is this your friend, my lord?

153
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:34,036
And what about you?
Don't wizards have troubles too?

154
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,607
I'm sorry. 1 have no use
for what you're selling.

155
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,269
Save us from the arrogance
of sorcerers!

156
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,024
I suppose you've lost
your powers too!

157
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,328
Hazia is not something
to toy with, Arren. Look!

158
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,726
The hazia eater feels
himself in paradise.

159
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:02,833
Then the spirit leaves the body
and wanders aimlessly in darkness.

160
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:08,056
When it returns? More hazia.
And finally, death.

161
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,875
What's the matter?

162
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,485
Feeling better?

163
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,451
The wind is fresh up here.

164
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,687
Something's wrong with this town.

165
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,492
Not only this town, lad.

166
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:44,119
Farmers' crops wither.
Their sheep and cattle are falling sick.

167
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,467
Even people's minds
have lost their way.

168
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,021
ls it some sort of pestilence?

169
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,787
No. A pestilence
is how the Balance restores itself.

170
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,902
But this? 1 fear someone
is trying to destroy the Balance.

171
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,706
There's only one creature
in Earthsea capable of such evil.

172
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,668
Only one.

173
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,362
Well then.
Shall we go back to the inn?

174
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,923
I'd like to rest a little longer.

175
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,742
Very well.

176
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,099
I'll be waiting.
Keep your wits about you.

177
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,185
1 will.

178
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,760
Slave takers?

179
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,615
A witch, are you?

180
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,844
And an ugly one at that!

181
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,336
Won't fetch much with that face.

182
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,530
Just a few guineas.
But we can still have a little fun.

183
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,942
Oww! My finger!

184
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,172
The witch has spirit!

185
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,207
I'm going to enjoy this.

186
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,646
Who's there?

187
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,055
Step forward and show yourself!

188
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:38,976
Well, well.

189
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,361
What are you
doing here, boy?

190
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,495
Go ahead. Take him!

191
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,879
No hard feelings. boy.
Just following the boss's orders.

192
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,806
I'll make it quick.

193
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,058
Or maybe you'd like to be a slave?

194
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,073
Beg for your life!

195
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,296
Changed your mind?

196
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,445
Life is nothing to me.

197
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,098
So you want a fight. eh?

198
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,290
Draw your sword!

199
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,661
All right. Now it's my turn.

200
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,437
Uh oh.

201
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,263
Hold on there son.
You don't care about the girl?

202
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:04,926
Do it.

203
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,078
If you want her so much,
here she is!

204
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,436
Come on men!
Let's go!

205
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,322
Are you...

206
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,923
Therru!

207
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,056
Therru!

208
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,380
Therru...

209
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:57,579
A bird...

210
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,480
So! We meet again, boy.

211
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,440
Take him!

212
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:29,335
He'll fetch a good price.
Don't be too rough.

213
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,251
Take him away!

214
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,388
Just an old piece of junk.
Couldn't give it away!

215
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,289
Give it up, it's no use.

216
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,461
Quiet!

217
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,893
Silence!
Or I'll feed you to the hounds!

218
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:04,772
Come on!

219
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:06,617
Get moving!

220
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,200
What's going on?

221
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,574
I don't know.
Move, you lazy animals!

222
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,197
Confound it! What's wrong?

223
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:47,264
Sparrowhawk...

224
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,281
Let's go, Arren.

225
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,860
Can you stand?

226
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,392
What about the others?

227
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,961
I left none bound.
Now it's up to them.

228
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:36,085
How did you know
where to find me?

229
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,732
When you didn't come,
I scoured Hort Town.

230
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,409
Finally, someone told me
a young man was taken by slavers.

231
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,771
l had to make
a spell of finding.

232
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,456
lam sorry. I was foolish.

233
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,629
No, it was my fault.

234
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,525
I should've been more careful.

235
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,750
I'm sorry.

236
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:08,256
Who's there?

237
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,480
It's me, Sparrowhawk.

238
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,122
Sparrowhawk?

239
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,006
Someone's been hurt.

240
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,643
I'm sorry. It's late.

241
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,564
It's been a long time, Ged.

242
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,154
He's asleep.

243
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,093
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you've lost your bed.

244
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,581
It's his now.
Here, this will warm you.

245
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:49,934
Thanks.

246
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,516
You haven't changed.

247
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,440
No.
You're keeping well, Tenar?

248
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,407
] suppose.
It hasn't always been easy.

249
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,750
And you?

250
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,958
Do you still wander?

251
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,218
That was good.

252
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,576
It has been a long time.

253
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,004
Yes, it has.

254
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,430
As Archmage, I have no time...

255
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,488
...to wander as I once did.

256
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,670
And what brings the Archmage
so far from home?

257
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,531
Evil tidings come
from every corner of Earthsea.

258
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,118
Things are out of balance...

259
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:42,644
...as if the sun's light
were ebbing.

260
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,732
Is the Art Magic ebbing too?

261
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:52,096
Yes. As if our very blood
were flowing from our veins.

262
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,014
So you search for the answer?

263
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,427
Yes.

264
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,045
Oh dear, we woke you up.

265
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:08,816
Come, child. Don't worry.
This man is an old friend of mine.

266
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,145
This is Therru.
She's been with me five years.

267
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,944
Call me Sparrowhawk.
I'm sorry I woke you.

268
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:27,527
Hawk?

269
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:36,886
Well, you should be honored.
Therru never speaks to strangers.

270
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:38,839
What is it?

271
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,721
Could she really be...?

272
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:45,913
Lord Cob.

273
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,197
Enter.

274
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,383
Forgive my intrusion.
I beg leave to speak.

275
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:57,715
What is it?

276
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:00,566
I'm afraid some
of our slaves escaped.

277
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,393
I see. You let
my precious merchandise go.

278
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,227
No. We've captured most of them.

279
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,784
And?

280
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,681
What about the others?

281
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,527
We're scouring the countryside.
We'll find them.

282
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:22,856
You're a fool.

283
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:26,575
Do you think
l can't manage without you?

284
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,956
It was a wizard!
A wizard with a scar on his face!

285
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,084
What?

286
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,271
A sear on his face?

287
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,961
It's Sparrowhawk.
The Archmage pays me a visit.

288
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,886
Find him for me,
Hare... or else.

289
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,666
I won't fail you, my lord.

290
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,821
I've waited long
for this day... Sparrowhawk.

291
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,648
Tenar! l brought the water in!

292
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,471
Where is she?

293
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,096
Tenar? Are you still asleep?

294
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,750
Tenar?

295
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,379
Are you sick?

296
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,113
Who was that?

297
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,910
It's that girl!

298
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:11,712
That must've been a surprise.
I'm sorry dear. 1 should've told you.

299
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:15,453
Don't worry. Arren is with me.

300
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,627
You have nothing to fear.

301
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,369
Sometimes his eyes are wild,
but he has a good heart.

302
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:27,468
Good morning.

303
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,406
Good morning.

304
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,760
I'm done eating!

305
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,212
Well!

306
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:39,008
Did you sleep well?
How do you feel?

307
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,495
I'm all right.

308
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,274
I didn't do anything to her.

309
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,477
Of course you didn't.
Come have breakfast.

310
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,044
Can't work if you don't eat.

311
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,096
Work?

312
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,095
Ouch...

313
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,580
Are you getting blisters?

314
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:31,966
Yes.

315
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,554
Shall we rest a bit?

316
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,321
What a good smell.

317
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,364
- But...
- Yes, lad?

318
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,551
You're a wizard. aren't you?

319
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:48,265
Oh, I see.

320
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:53,737
You want to know why a wizard
toils in the field like a farmer?

321
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,342
Yes.

322
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:57,901
Listen, Arren.

323
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:02,381
Everything under the sun
and stars depends on the Balance.

324
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,965
The wind and seas.
The power of earth and light.

325
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:14,462
All that these do is well
and rightly done within the Equilibrium.

326
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,030
But now, men hold
the power to control the world.

327
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,719
So Man must learn
to keep the Balance...

328
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:28,405
...and do what leaf and whale
and wind do of their own nature.

329
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,507
You know everything
has its True Name.

330
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:38,267
Magic is the power to command,
if you know a thing's True Name.

331
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:43,464
Use that power in ignorance
and the Balance is easily damaged.

332
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,922
Spells should be made
only of necessity.

333
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,942
You've been busy.

334
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,604
I suppose you two
deserve some lunch.

335
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,823
Are you feeling better, Arren?

336
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,336
Now eat hearty,
or you won't get your strength back.

337
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,007
What about the girl?

338
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:07,383
Oh, Therru?

339
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,254
One of the spring lambs is sick.

340
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,815
She's nursing it today.

341
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,667
Shall we change places?

342
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,496
No, I can manage.

343
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,792
- How did it go?
- That's it for today.

344
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,312
Dinner will be ready soon.
Better wash up.

345
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,905
- I'll put the ox in the stable.
- Thanks, lad.

346
00:41:57,382 --> 00:42:01,602
There, you should be feeling better.
Now you need your mother's milk.

347
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:07,514
That's it.

348
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:14,531
Good girl.

349
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,026
What do you want?

350
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,494
Oh... nothing.

351
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:27,504
Why did you come here?

352
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,739
To hurt me?
To kill this little one?

353
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:33,806
You don't understand!
] was just...

354
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,691
Stay away! Get out of here!

355
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,604
l hate anyone who doesn't value life!

356
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:47,898
I'm sorry.

357
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,437
Step aside!

358
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,562
Let's eat.

359
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,498
It's so good having men
to help with the farm.

360
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,829
Even you two.

361
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,664
I'm no good with a plow,
but 1 do know animals.

362
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,246
You used to be a goatherd.

363
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,464
What's wrong, Arren?
Aren't you hungry?

364
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,496
No.

365
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,265
What is this place?

366
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,682
Come, Arren. This way.

367
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,245
Sparrowhawk?

368
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,366
Come. Take my hand.

369
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,827
Arren!

370
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,396
No! Leave me alone! Stop!

371
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,308
Arren!

372
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:13,686
Arren! Wake up!

373
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:15,432
Arren!

374
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:23,517
What's wrong?

375
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,993
A bad dream, I think.

376
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:27,777
A dream...

377
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:41,761
Spring is very short, you know.
I need all the help I can get.

378
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:46,332
I'm sorry, Tenar.
Il have an errand that cannot wait.

379
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:49,528
I still can't rely on you.

380
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:51,791
Come now, Tenar.

381
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,527
Should you be taking Arren's horse?

382
00:45:56,454 --> 00:46:00,434
He's better off without it.
Tell him ! borrowed it.

383
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:04,888
Tenar. Keep a close eye
on him for me.

384
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:08,255
1 promise.

385
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:11,596
I'll be back tonight!
And back at work tomorrow!

386
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,622
I certainly hope so.

387
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,850
Haven't seen him around here.

388
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,102
And that scar!

389
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,683
He must've come
from that woman's house.

390
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,259
She's a witch.
I don't like the looks of it.

391
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,494
Yes, she's an odd one.
And that little girl she keeps!

392
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,629
That child will bring
bad luck on us all.

393
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,893
No! Don't say that out loud!

394
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,355
Who was that?

395
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:07,463
He's not from around here.

396
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,435
He's a friend of ours.

397
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,364
He's helping us out.

398
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,062
Is that so?

399
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:14,764
Can I help you?

400
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:19,112
My child has a fever ma'am.
I need that potion again.

401
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,737
All right. Just wait there.

402
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,046
Quit sticking to me!

403
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,991
I'm afraid!

404
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,483
Spare us from evil!

405
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,214
That's enough!

406
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:39,502
There. If the child's not better,
.
come see me again.

407
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,597
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

408
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:44,827
Actually, ! was wondering...

409
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,847
Yes, I know.
Pay me when you can.

410
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,770
Thanks ma'am. You're very kind.

411
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:56,209
Hope she feels better!

412
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:59,757
l wish there were more
decent people in the world.

413
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,561
Therru never hurt anyone.

414
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,685
Well, at least the woman
looks after her own.

415
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:14,053
As for Therru, her parents
abused and abandoned her.

416
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:19,136
They burned her.
That's how she got that scar.

417
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,808
What a frightful child!

418
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,327
My goodness!
Did you see her eyes?

419
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,680
Please, have mercy!

420
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,321
No one will buy
an old woman!

421
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:22,316
Nothing to fear ladies.
Maybe you can even help me.

422
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,390
Seen any strangers around here?
Be much obliged for any help.

423
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,525
And I'll pay.

424
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,060
There's one at Tenar's farm!

425
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,801
And one with a scar
on his face!

426
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,995
Tenar? Who's that?

427
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,680
The witch! She lives
right up this road.

428
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,499
Thanks for the help. old hags!

429
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,661
Wait! Where are you going?

430
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:55,286
Stop! Liar!
You promised to pay!

431
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,393
There it is! That's it!

432
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:09,736
What's that?

433
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:18,291
What are you doing?

434
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:23,287
You're looking fit. boy.
Didn't think I'd find you here.

435
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,345
Swine!
What are you doing here?

436
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:31,117
Now, now. I'm not here to fight.
Where's your wizard friend?

437
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:34,819
He's gone!
Sparrowhawk's not here.

438
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:38,116
You'd better not be hiding him.

439
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,499
Why should 1?

440
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,181
You're no match for him.

441
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:48,522
Looks like she's telling the truth.
All right, we'll be back!

442
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,417
Till then!

443
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:59,538
Never come back, you swine!

444
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,495
Lord Cob will reward me for this!

445
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:20,161
So that's what happened.

446
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:23,198
Neither of you
said a word about it.

447
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:28,096
I think we fixed most of it.

448
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:29,632
Let's rebuild the fence.

449
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:37,203
Tenar? Have you known
Sparrowhawk for a long time?

450
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,828
Yes, ] guess have.
A long, long time.

451
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,447
He's always been a wanderer.

452
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:51,043
It's the life he chase.
He does it because he has to.

453
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:56,196
And finally he became Archmage,
the greatest of all wizards.

454
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,457
Head of the Great House of Roke?

455
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:03,227
Yes. But years before that,
he rescued me.

456
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,236
Rescued me, and
led me into the light.

457
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,843
One man, all alone.

458
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:23,833
He brought me out
of the Tombs of Atuan.

459
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,090
Welcome.

460
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:48,548
Don't get many wizards.
Looking for a weapon?

461
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,949
Show me that sword.

462
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:57,249
Can't recommend this one.

463
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,921
Very unusual workmanship,
so I bought it.

464
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,274
But it's rusted solid.
Can't be drawn.

465
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,396
You there, wizard!

466
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,729
Are you deaf?
I'm talking to you!

467
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,519
You said something, sir?

468
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,120
Is there something
stuck to my face?

469
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,417
Wrong wizard!

470
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:32,339
You! If you see a wizard
with a scar on his face...

471
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:35,603
... tell him Lord Cob
wants to see him!

472
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:40,223
Cob? Never heard that name
back where I come from.

473
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,801
You will. when he's Lord
of the Two Lands!

474
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:46,398
Don't forget it!

475
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,217
Yes sir.

476
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,944
I'll take the sword.
How much?

477
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,426
Wait a minute... your face!

478
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,154
What's wrong?

479
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,178
Nothing... 1 suppose.

480
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:03,648
Have you heard of
this wizard named Cob?

481
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,794
Careful! Keep your voice down.

482
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:12,028
Only wizard in these parts
who still has his powers.

483
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:16,026
Can't say he's loved
by people around here.

484
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:20,457
He lives in the fortress outside town.
Best keep away from there.

485
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:27,835
I never thought
I'd find you here, Cob.

486
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:39,723
You're good at farm work.
You hardly seem a beginner.

487
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,077
Thank you.

488
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,840
Won't you stay on
for a while and help?

489
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,160
Therru would like that too.

490
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,249
But...

491
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,793
You don't have to decide now.
Think about it, all right?

492
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:54,346
All right.

493
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,962
Stable the ox for me.

494
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,374
Yes. Tenar.

495
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:03,756
I'm home!

496
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:08,108
Therru? Now where is she?

497
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:18,291
Arren! I can't find Therru.
Check the back pasture for me.

498
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,566
Tell her to come inside
before dark.

499
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:23,352
1 will.

500
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,241
Therru?

501
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:48,388
Therru...

502
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:54,132
Far, far above the clouds
against the setting sun

503
00:55:55,285 --> 00:56:01,404
A falcon flies alone
soaring in the wind

504
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:08,649
! hear his lonely cry
so sad must he be

505
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:15,407
Riding the silent wind
a falcon flies alone

506
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:22,676
Reaching out with his wings
grasps the empty sky

507
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:29,827
Riding the silent wind
never can he rest

508
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:38,373
What it is within my heart
none can ever know

509
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:45,330
A heart like a falcon's
is this very heart

510
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:52,319
What it is within my heart
none can ever know

511
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:59,859
Lonely faicon in the empty sky

512
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:08,216
! walk alone along
deserted country roads

513
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:15,179
Walking with me side by side
you are always there

514
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,510
! feel your loneliness
lonely you must be

515
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:29,380
Crickets whispering
in the grassy fields

516
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:36,370
You walk there by my side
you walk the path with me

517
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:43,817
But you never say a word
never do you speak

518
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:52,467
What it is within my heart
none can ever know

519
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:59,604
Here inside this heart
that walks its path alone

520
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:06,421
What it is within my heart
none can ever know

521
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:13,846
The sadness of one
who always is alone

522
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,950
I killed my father.

523
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,218
I stabbed him and ran away.

524
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:44,031
I don't understand it.
Why did [ kill him?

525
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,858
Did he hurt you?

526
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,398
No. My father
was a great man.

527
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:55,548
lam nothing. I failed my father
and I fail myself.

528
00:58:56,767 --> 00:59:01,277
And yet, I'm filled
with a rage can't control.

529
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,580
It's as if there were
someone else inside me.

530
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,924
You saw it too, didn't you?

531
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,940
You were right.
I shouldn't be here.

532
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,087
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

533
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,115
No, you were right.

534
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:22,149
If 1 don't leave,
it will come again.

535
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:36,025
A woman?

536
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,579
She lives past the marshes.

537
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,580
And the Archmage is with her?

538
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,360
He was seen in the town.
There are many witnesses.

539
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:49,862
Splendid.

540
00:59:57,461 --> 00:59:58,511
My lord.

541
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,424
Let's go, men!

542
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:26,527
A greeting from the Archmage.
Thank you, Sparrowhawk.

543
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:44,702
Therru! Arren!
Dinner is ready!

544
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:46,982
Where's Arren?

545
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:49,822
Isn't he with you?

546
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:50,962
No.

547
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:55,191
Maybe he's resting.
Therru, go see if he's there.

548
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:56,805
Yes. Tenar.

549
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:01,537
He's not here.

550
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:05,069
That's strange.
Where's he gone?

551
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:07,496
I'll look outside.

552
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:26,181
Arren...

553
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:43,484
Tenar, Therru... take care.

554
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:11,616
Doesn't matter
which way I go.

555
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,939
Looks like a dead end.

556
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:46,808
It's here!

557
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,085
Il wonder if that's Arren?

558
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:07,923
Arren?

559
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,175
Sparrowhawk?

560
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:19,414
That's odd.

561
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,692
What are you doing?

562
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,930
It's you! You're back!

563
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:29,729
So sorry, but it seems
you'll do in place of the wizard.

564
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:30,977
What?

565
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,427
Tenar, what's wrong?

566
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,462
Run away!

567
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,070
What a surprise!

568
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:38,332
Fancy meeting you here, princess.

569
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,017
No! Leave her alone!

570
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,009
Therru!

571
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:56,817
Well now princess,
where's your prince?

572
01:04:57,494 --> 01:04:58,894
Hey! Watch those teeth!

573
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:03,539
I need you to deliver a message.
Tell this to the wizard!

574
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,604
If he wants his woman...

575
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:10,509
...he can find her
at Lord Cob's castle.

576
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:12,891
Take her away!

577
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:13,869
Therru!

578
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,627
Tenar!

579
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:20,260
Let me go, I tell you!
Let me go!

580
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,665
Therru!
Are you all right? Therru!

581
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,064
Stop it! Let her go!

582
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:34,817
You stay here and be good
till the wizard gets back!

583
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,183
Lord Cob's waiting.
Let's get moving!

584
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,006
Tenar!

585
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,656
Tenar!

586
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:23,553
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
he's coming with me.

587
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:30,149
Go!

588
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,360
Where am [?

589
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:03,856
You're safe now.
The Shadow can't follow you here.

590
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,493
You saw it?

591
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:10,067
l know a bit of Magic myself.

592
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,407
know what
you're running from.

593
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:17,464
You were wise
to flee from that man.

594
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:19,744
What man?

595
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,436
Sparrowhawk,
That is, the Archmage.

596
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:28,344
Here, drink this.
It will soothe you.

597
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:36,286
What's wrong?
It's not poisoned.

598
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:54,734
Now lie still
and rest here for a bit.

599
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:59,285
The Archmage is more dangerous
than you can imagine.

600
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:03,023
No... Sparrowhawk is a good man.

601
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:05,529
He protected me.

602
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:10,609
Then tell me. Did you ever
wonder what he seeks?

603
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:15,046
No.

604
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:19,496
He seeks eternal life.

605
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,019
Eternal life?

606
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:28,281
The Archmage stands
at the pinnacle of sorcery.

607
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:33,522
Only the secret of eternal life
lies beyond his grasp.

608
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:37,188
And yet, he covets it.

609
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:41,914
But as he covets, so does he fear
another will discover it first.

610
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:47,398
That would be unbearable
to one so proud as the Archmage.

611
01:08:48,256 --> 01:08:50,866
What does that have
to do with me?

612
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:55,395
Because it is you
who have been chosen...

613
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,182
...to gain the secret
of eternal life.

614
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:03,545
That's why Sparrowhawk
follows you. To kill you.

615
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:06,017
To bring me death...

616
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,633
Arren, will you come with me?

617
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:11,923
I've already found it.

618
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:15,470
found the door
between life and death.

619
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:19,256
Together we can open that door.

620
01:09:19,921 --> 01:09:22,062
And together,
we will live forever.

621
01:09:22,457 --> 01:09:25,587
We will conquer every form
of fear and suffering.

622
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,371
Fear and suffering...

623
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:33,698
Come with me, Arren.
The face of death is terrible!

624
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:40,161
I] don't want to die.

625
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:44,523
Listen to me, Arren.
Tell me your True Name.

626
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:48,243
Then you will have that
which you most desire.

627
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:55,277
Come, give me your True Name.

628
01:09:57,593 --> 01:10:01,193
Lebannen...

629
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:11,263
Now I'm ready for you,
Sparrowhawk,

630
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:23,093
Where are you, Hawk?

631
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:00,115
Hawk !

632
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,360
What's wrong, Therru?

633
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,039
They came and took
Tenar away!

634
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,972
You have to go
to Cob's castle!

635
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,451
Where is Arren?

636
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:18,057
He left! He said it would
come again if he didn't go!

637
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:20,932
Cob...

638
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,384
Don't worry, Therru.

639
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:28,616
I'm going to help Tenar.
Wait for my return.

640
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:33,612
Keep this sword.
Arren will need it.

641
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:43,504
Stay home, Therru!

642
01:11:58,114 --> 01:11:59,454
Here-we-are!

643
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,070
Come on!

644
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:07,685
I'm not going anywhere!

645
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,061
Lord Cob.

646
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:17,143
We brought the woman.
Just as you ordered.

647
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:21,156
You've done well, Hare.

648
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:26,381
It was nothing, my lord.
My pleasure is to serve you.

649
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,333
Stand aside!

650
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:30,178
Why, you!

651
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:31,976
Are you the boss?

652
01:12:32,582 --> 01:12:35,742
Why did you kidnap me?
Let me go right now!

653
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:39,396
So sorry for the rough treatment.

654
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,892
l have business with Sparrowhawk.

655
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:46,911
You're a wizard. aren't you!
You should be ashamed!

656
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,663
Go find him yourself!

657
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:52,863
He's an old friend of mine.

658
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,058
I'd like to invite him here.

659
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:00,366
And I'm the bait!
You're going to hurt him!

660
01:13:01,244 --> 01:13:03,853
Women tax my patience.

661
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,414
Put her in the dungeon.

662
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:08,759
Do it!

663
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,142
Answer me!

664
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,061
If something happens to
Sparrowhawk, so help me!

665
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:18,663
- Arren...
- This way!

666
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:32,992
Come. Lebannen.
l have something special for you.

667
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,197
Get in there!

668
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,660
Make yourself at home.
You'll see your wizard soon enough.

669
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:35,821
This place reminds me
of the Tombs.

670
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:39,664
Sparrowhawk...

671
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,787
Cob! Are you making
the same mistake again?

672
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:04,225
At ease!

673
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:06,281
Any sign of the wizard?

674
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,235
Not yet, sir.

675
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:12,352
Where is that confounded wizard?

676
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:16,630
Let's see...

677
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,440
There he is!
Take your positions!

678
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,170
Here he comes!

679
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,281
Don't let him escape! Now!

680
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:47,548
Hear me! Open the path!

681
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,241
Stop! Wait!

682
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,330
He tricked us!

683
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,612
Well? Don't just stand there!

684
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:08,718
Cob! It's Sparrowhawk.
I'm here!

685
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:10,785
Show yourself !

686
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,900
It's been a long time,
Sparrowhawk,

687
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:20,618
I've been waiting.

688
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:24,124
Cob of Havnor!
l left you at the border...

689
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:26,197
...of the land of death.

690
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:29,866
I hear you're the Archmage now.

691
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:31,979
Congratulations.

692
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:36,162
I'm here, Cob.
Now release Tenar!

693
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,953
You're pitiful. Sparrowhawk.

694
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:44,139
The great Archmage,
smitten by a woman.

695
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:48,223
You used her to lure me here.
What do you want?

696
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:50,827
What do you think?

697
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,220
l haven't forgotten
how you dragged me...

698
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,949
...to the gates of the Dry Land.

699
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,725
But you've forgotten why!

700
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,545
You used
the Pelnish Lore...

701
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:05,004
...to toy with the spirits
of the living and the dead.

702
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:07,300
Isn't that enough to repent?

703
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:11,877
You taught me a splendid lesson
there at death's door.

704
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:15,278
Now I know I can
never accept extinction.

705
01:17:16,432 --> 01:17:19,802
So l gathered every
ancient lore book ! could find.

706
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:24,090
Alas, some of their owners
were not cooperative.

707
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:28,665
What evil are you planning. Cab?

708
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:32,132
I've done it, Sparrowhawk!

709
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:35,331
I've woven the greatest spell of all.

710
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,921
The door between life and death
has been closed...

711
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:42,581
...since the beginning of time.
But I will open it!

712
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,635
That is forbidden!
Don't you understand?

713
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:50,506
Those with power
must wield it with wisdom.

714
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,680
Would you destroy the Balance
that sustains the world?

715
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:56,647
What nonsense!

716
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:59,596
The Balance is long gone.

717
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:03,196
You know that
better than anyone.

718
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,776
The Balance was destroyed by Man.

719
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:11,375
You think you can limit
Man's desire? It's impossible!

720
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,777
] will live forever.

721
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:17,707
I will gain existence without end!

722
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:23,154
Cob! Without the cycle
of death and rebirth, there is no life!

723
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,473
lam above Nature!

724
01:18:33,576 --> 01:18:36,856
Sparrowhawk! There's someone else
who wants to meet you.

725
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,644
Arren! What are you doing here?

726
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:53,038
Lebannen! This man would
deprive you of eternal life!

727
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,106
Arren! Did you reveal
your True Name?

728
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:08,661
I'm going to live forever!

729
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:15,631
I'm tired, Sparrowhawk.
Tired of living in fear.

730
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:19,422
Arren! Life without death is not life!

731
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:23,629
Refuse death, and
you refuse life as well!

732
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:26,814
Don't lie to me!

733
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:47,745
Listen to me, Arren.

734
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,807
No man nor any thing
in this world lives forever.

735
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:56,619
But only to us is it given
to know that we must die.

736
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:01,029
And that is a precious gift.

737
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:07,291
This life that is our torment
and our treasure does not endure.

738
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,120
It is a wave on the sea.

739
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:14,102
Would you force the sea
to grow still, to save one wave?

740
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:16,587
To save yourself?

741
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:28,840
Arren...

742
01:20:39,468 --> 01:20:41,577
Thought you made
a fool of me?

743
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:45,201
There's more than
one entrance to this castle!

744
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:49,125
What's happening?
I'm getting weak.

745
01:20:50,713 --> 01:20:54,463
Coming here was another
of your blunders, Sparrowhawk.

746
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,549
Your powers are useless
in this place.

747
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,680
Hare! Put him in the
dungeon with the woman.

748
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:03,931
I'll finish them tomorrow...

749
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:07,470
...in the most painful
and humiliating way.

750
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:09,614
Yes, my lord.

751
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:12,138
On your feet. chickenhawk!

752
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:36,718
Sparrowhawk!

753
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:40,509
Sparrowhawk! Are you all right?
Sparrowhawk!

754
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:42,820
It'll all be over tomorrow.

755
01:21:43,132 --> 01:21:46,121
Say your goodbyes
while you still have time!

756
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,343
Sparrowhawk! Sparrowhawk!

757
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:01,652
Tenar...

758
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:05,197
Haw did they do this?
You're the Archmage!

759
01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:09,835
I'm sorry, Tenar.
Il keep getting you into trouble.

760
01:22:10,526 --> 01:22:12,546
Stop talking nonsense!

761
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,685
Which way should I go?

762
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,510
Arren?

763
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:46,908
Arren! Wait!

764
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:52,016
Arren! Cob's men came
and took Tenar away!

765
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:04,101
l have your sword!

766
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:07,125
Sparrowhawk said
to give it to you!

767
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,160
Follow you?

768
01:23:56,565 --> 01:23:59,525
Tenar is a prisoner here.

769
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,175
Sparrowhawk too.

770
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:03,611
Even Sparrowhawk.

771
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:07,606
This is yours, isn't it?
Sparrowhawk brought it for you.

772
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:12,201
We've got to hurry.
They need our help!

773
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:17,619
Il can go no further.
You must go alone.

774
01:24:18,854 --> 01:24:21,514
Bring me that sword.

775
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:24,121
l know you can do it.

776
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:28,427
What do you mean?
You're right here.

777
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,315
I'm not here.

778
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:34,994
Cob is holding me
against my will.

779
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:37,681
Then who are you?

780
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,280
Stay away! Get back!

781
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:42,952
Don't come closer!

782
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,681
Arren's heart was always
full of fear.

783
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:55,661
The fear filled his heart
with darkness.

784
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:58,922
Fear of what?

785
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:03,195
The darkness stole his body
and ran away with it.

786
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:06,522
But it left something
important behind.

787
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:16,351
Wherever there is darkness,
there also you will find light.

788
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,085
Now the light
that was left behind...

789
01:25:19,815 --> 01:25:21,745
... wanders alone,
like a shadow.

790
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:23,804
A shadow?

791
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:30,207
What you see now is just
a shadow chasing its body.

792
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:39,393
Father...

793
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:43,920
You are Arren, aren't you?

794
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:49,301
Don't worry.
I'll be with you.

795
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,089
I'll give you my True Name.

796
01:25:54,116 --> 01:25:58,246
My True Name
is Lebannen... Lebannen.

797
01:26:00,589 --> 01:26:01,879
Lebannen...

798
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:16,777
It's him.

799
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:23,229
He should be ashamed
to call himself Archmage!

800
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:26,605
Remember who
he was up against.

801
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:29,039
No wizard in Earthsea
is a match for Lord Cob!

802
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:30,721
Well spoken!

803
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:35,947
By the way. what's our
little friend up to?

804
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:38,641
He shut himself in his room.

805
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:41,705
Arren's really here!

806
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:44,707
He's a lucky one, that boy.

807
01:27:45,127 --> 01:27:49,317
It's just like Lord Cob
to steal the wizard's apprentice.

808
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:52,607
He's not much
use though, is he?

809
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:54,608
None at all.

810
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:58,240
When we're through with
the wizard, we'll sell the boy!

811
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,830
All right! Go get
Sparrowhawk and his woman.

812
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:14,716
The Archmage's time
has finally run out!

813
01:28:17,259 --> 01:28:18,959
They're going to kill them.

814
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:36,370
Arren!

815
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,059
Arren?

816
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:44,926
What are you doing here?
Did they kidnap you too?

817
01:29:54,189 --> 01:29:56,469
Here. This belongs to you.

818
01:29:57,525 --> 01:30:00,105
I'm not worthy to hold
my father's sword.

819
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:04,590
Arren, they've got Tenar
and Sparrowhawk.

820
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:06,523
They're going to kill them.

821
01:30:06,835 --> 01:30:09,465
Please! Help them
like you helped me!

822
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,362
I can't help anyone.

823
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:15,427
All l can do is fail.

824
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,641
What's wrong with you?

825
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:20,409
They'll die
if we don't do something!

826
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:28,210
They'll die!
We'll lose both of them!

827
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:41,059
We'll lose the most important
thing in the world.

828
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,620
Therru?

829
01:30:50,078 --> 01:30:52,298
What's the most important thing?

830
01:30:56,351 --> 01:30:58,340
Life is the most important thing!

831
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:03,758
We'll all die someday.
What does it matter?

832
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:09,373
Why fight for life?
We know it's going to end anyway.

833
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:13,608
Na! Life is precious because
we know we're going to die!

834
01:31:14,169 --> 01:31:18,179
You're not afraid of death.
You're afraid of life!

835
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:21,724
You want to live forever,
then you say nothing matters.

836
01:31:22,177 --> 01:31:24,076
It's the same thing!

837
01:31:24,446 --> 01:31:27,106
You're afraid to live
the only life you have!

838
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:29,590
Therru...

839
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:32,101
You think your life
belongs to you?

840
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:38,612
Tenar gave me life.
That's why ! have to live...

841
01:31:39,127 --> 01:31:41,787
...to give life to someone else.

842
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,160
Lebannen...

843
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:51,293
That's the only way
we live forever.

844
01:32:06,421 --> 01:32:09,201
Therru... how did you know
my True Name?

845
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:11,821
You told me yourself.

846
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:18,873
Now I'll tell you mine.
My True Name is...

847
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:22,177
Tehanu... it's Tehanu.

848
01:32:23,438 --> 01:32:24,838
Tehanu...

849
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:49,799
It'll be dawn soon.

850
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:53,224
Come on, Therru.
We've got to help them!

851
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:04,535
Arren, wait!

852
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,410
What is it?

853
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:07,464
There!

854
01:33:13,221 --> 01:33:14,920
It's Sparrowhawk and Tenar!

855
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:16,950
Come on!

856
01:33:21,496 --> 01:33:22,456
Jump!

857
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:24,948
I can't! It's too far!

858
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,940
Don't worry!
You can do it!

859
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:35,331
Let's go!

860
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:04,544
Sparrowhawk!

861
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,270
Time to say goodbye,
Sparrowhawk,

862
01:34:09,177 --> 01:34:12,047
Your lover is going
.
on a Journey.

863
01:34:12,547 --> 01:34:14,736
Why don't you
send him off yourself?

864
01:34:20,755 --> 01:34:23,685
Don't worry, Sparrowhawk.

865
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,845
This world will be
in good hands after you're gone.

866
01:34:28,363 --> 01:34:31,143
What can l do, Sparrowhawk?

867
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:33,097
Tenar.

868
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:37,692
It's not over yet.
The sun will rise soon.

869
01:34:39,908 --> 01:34:41,248
What do you mean?

870
01:34:42,744 --> 01:34:47,164
Don't you hear it, Tenar?
Help is almost here.

871
01:34:51,386 --> 01:34:53,756
That's enough time
for goodbyes.

872
01:34:54,222 --> 01:34:56,302
Do it! Finish him!

873
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:57,771
No!

874
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:02,869
Let them go!

875
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:04,715
It's you!

876
01:35:04,933 --> 01:35:06,223
Arren! Therru!

877
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:08,851
Stay out of this. boy!

878
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:12,318
Don't show him any mercy!

879
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,288
Get back!

880
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:20,827
Take him!

881
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:34,601
Please don't hurt me!

882
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,219
I'm disappointed.

883
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,462
I thought you
and I had an understanding.

884
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:44,409
Silence!
You don't control me any more.

885
01:35:45,273 --> 01:35:49,113
Then you shall see
the face of death, Lebannen!

886
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:57,143
A summoning spell!

887
01:36:02,824 --> 01:36:03,404
Arren!

888
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:04,851
Stay back!

889
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,101
Now die!

890
01:36:28,483 --> 01:36:30,853
Please! Let me draw it.

891
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33,600
For Life!

892
01:37:11,459 --> 01:37:14,479
That sword was
forged with magic!

893
01:37:38,653 --> 01:37:40,113
He's an old man!

894
01:37:40,922 --> 01:37:42,852
Disguised by sorcery.

895
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:45,138
Lord Cob!

896
01:37:48,396 --> 01:37:50,206
You can't stop me.

897
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:53,292
I will never accept death.

898
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:57,456
Wizards shouldn't fear death!

899
01:37:58,373 --> 01:38:00,043
You wretched girl!

900
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:02,705
I'm not like you!

901
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:05,440
I'm better than you.
Insignificant worms!

902
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,491
I studied the wisdom of the ages!

903
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,983
I wield power! ] am almighty!

904
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:18,262
Scorned as a fool by
the wizards of Roke.

905
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:20,706
Driven out like a dog!

906
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:26,590
But I'll have my revenge.
I will never die.

907
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:30,071
I'll be the supreme Archmage!

908
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:46,683
Therru!

909
01:39:19,387 --> 01:39:20,727
Therru!

910
01:39:29,096 --> 01:39:31,266
That little fool!

911
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:35,796
Hear me, stones.
Il unbind you!

912
01:40:26,921 --> 01:40:28,761
Sunrise...

913
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:33,076
Let me go!

914
01:40:37,665 --> 01:40:38,805
Does it hurt, girl?

915
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:40,056
Cob!

916
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:43,256
Let her go!

917
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:45,391
Stay back!

918
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:48,636
Death is terrifying!

919
01:40:49,944 --> 01:40:50,844
Don't do it!

920
01:40:54,582 --> 01:40:57,272
So terrifying.

921
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:03,116
Wait!

922
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:30,110
So terrifying... very terrifying...

923
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:33,895
Cob! You're just like me.

924
01:41:34,622 --> 01:41:37,752
You turn away from light
and see only darkness!

925
01:41:40,161 --> 01:41:41,861
No! Keep away!

926
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:46,862
You forgot that all life
is connected.

927
01:41:47,301 --> 01:41:49,931
Life can't be hoarded,
it can only be given!

928
01:41:50,972 --> 01:41:53,751
Deny death.
and you deny life!

929
01:41:54,642 --> 01:41:56,892
No! You're wrong!

930
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:01,852
Face the truth, Cob!
Everyone fears death!

931
01:42:03,818 --> 01:42:07,658
No! I don't want to die.

932
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:10,213
Cob!

933
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:12,514
No!

934
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:14,804
Therru!

935
01:42:26,007 --> 01:42:27,967
Therru... Arren...

936
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:38,798
Arren!

937
01:42:49,230 --> 01:42:51,450
Time to die! Time to die!

938
01:42:51,866 --> 01:42:52,946
Arren!

939
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:56,151
And you will join him.

940
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:04,950
Let her go! Don't kill her!

941
01:43:08,082 --> 01:43:11,592
All who oppose me must die!

942
01:43:41,849 --> 01:43:45,189
She's dead, she's dead.
Poor thing.

943
01:43:56,497 --> 01:43:58,367
Sun is rising.

944
01:44:02,603 --> 01:44:05,263
Hurry... must hurry...

945
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:07,050
Stop!

946
01:44:44,545 --> 01:44:45,685
Therru!

947
01:44:53,521 --> 01:44:56,861
Eternal life!

948
01:45:02,797 --> 01:45:04,576
Shadow. return to darkness!

949
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,450
Give me life!

950
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:17,405
I want life... life!

951
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:26,075
Life!

952
01:45:31,592 --> 01:45:34,371
I want to live!

953
01:46:05,059 --> 01:46:07,639
Tehanu!

954
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:53,078
So you're safe too.

955
01:46:58,512 --> 01:46:59,772
What about them?

956
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:04,455
They'll be fine.
They have wings.

957
01:48:28,402 --> 01:48:30,512
Thank you... Therru.

958
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:39,907
I'm going back
to pay for my crime.

959
01:48:41,248 --> 01:48:43,388
And to face myself.

960
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:46,843
Arren.

961
01:48:48,956 --> 01:48:52,206
Can I come to see you
again someday?

962
01:48:58,432 --> 01:48:59,302
Come on.

963
01:48:59,733 --> 01:49:02,803
We have to thank
Sparrowhawk and Tenar.

964
01:49:18,619 --> 01:49:25,098
The lone hawk in the sky

965
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:33,116
Struggles against the wind

966
01:49:34,301 --> 01:49:45,091
Here there is only light and darkness
He has the sky to himself

967
01:49:52,886 --> 01:49:59,306
You who looked up to the sky and wept

968
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:07,137
You who live alone

969
01:50:08,502 --> 01:50:14,712
Let me hear your True Name

970
01:50:15,809 --> 01:50:24,929
For one day you'll be gone

971
01:50:28,088 --> 01:50:34,268
As light dissolves into darkness

972
01:50:35,729 --> 01:50:42,439
Your song passes straight
through my heart

973
01:50:43,871 --> 01:50:52,371
Let me sing it for you

974
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:06,830
