1
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,215
It's perfect.

2
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,887
Oh, great.

3
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,683
I'll take it.

4
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,324
Wonderful. I'm so happy.

5
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,906
There's one thing.
I'm gonna need some references.

6
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,926
I don't have any of those.

7
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,447
Oh, dear, that's serious.

8
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:43,766
I don't know that we can do business
together if you don't have references.

9
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,694
Bye, now!

10
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,303
-Daddy.
-What's going on, Isabel?

11
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,339
I'm moving here.

12
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,745
To the Valley?
Why on earth would you do that?

13
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,453
Because it's normal.

14
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,934
You're normal. You're just--

15
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,103
I know. But I'm not gonna
be one anymore.

16
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,582
You have no choice in the matter.
It's what you are.

17
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,645
Orange is a great color.
Orange is happy.

18
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,407
Why don't we just paint it yellow?

19
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,672
We can't, we're gonna
paint the bathroom yellow.

20
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,368
Since when are we doing that?

21
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,109
They're arguing about paint.

22
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,708
Yes, I can see that.

23
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,745
Il wanna argue about paint.

24
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,398
-With whom?
-With someone.

25
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,784
Aman?

26
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,485
-Yes!
-Oh, Isabel.

27
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,724
I'm through with warlocks.
They're all like you.

28
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,586
Even when you and mom
were married...

29
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,658
.. you were casting spells
on other women.

30
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,720
Your life is total
instant gratification, Daddy.

31
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,483
-It's fantastic, isn't it?
-No. No, it's not.

32
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,596
Because how do you know that
anyone really loves you for yourself?

33
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,066
It's like those rich men who are never
sure why women sleep with them.

34
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,829
But women sleep with them,
so it's not really a problem.

35
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,342
I want a man who needs me.

36
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,076
Needs you?

37
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,914
Because he is a completely
hopeless mess.

38
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,722
Oh, no. You're talking about love,
aren't you?

39
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,893
What do you suppose it's like?

40
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,661
Oh, it's simple. You say, "I love you"
to someone you want to go home with.

41
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,195
And then when things get messy,
you say, "I don't love you anymore."

42
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,255
And that's pretty much it.

43
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,891
l feel as if I'm pressed against
a glass window.

44
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:08,537
It's right there on the other side.
I can see it, but 1 can't feel it.

45
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,536
l can't touch it.

46
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,357
-Does your mother know about this?
-She disappeared again.

47
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,522
$420.56.

48
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,933
Money. Money.

49
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,737
That was my last thing as a witch.

50
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,018
l wanna be like everyone else.
Il wanna have friends and I wanna....

51
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,414
And I wanna go
to the Coffee Bean...

52
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,088
.. where we all discuss our problems,
which are absolutely unsolvable.

53
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,988
You can have anything you want.
Every woman wants to be a witch.

54
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,952
I don't. wanna feel thwarted.

55
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,184
I want days where my hair
is affected by weather.

56
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,116
Yeah, hi, what can I get you?

57
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,095
Scrambled eggs, please.

58
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,640
lam through with just snapping
my fingers and getting my way.

59
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,157
No breakfast after 11.

60
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,719
My absolutely last thing.

61
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,578
Don't do this.

62
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,979
You'll meet someone,
you'll get this close.

63
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,866
-And when he finds out about--
-lf he loves me, he won't care.

64
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,046
I'm going to get an umbrella.

65
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,295
Go on. Get yourself one.

66
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,904
No, Daddy. No. I mean it.
No. Never again.

67
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,947
-You'll get wet.
-l hope so.

68
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,784
I know what you're gonna say.
I'm a mess.

69
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,700
Get a grip, Jack. Get a grip.

70
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,065
Il can't help it.

71
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,717
Hey, how do I look?

72
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,146
You look great.

73
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,411
-l look great?
-Yeah.

74
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,114
l always look great. That's a given.

75
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,534
-And the important thing is....
-What?

76
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,945
I have no idea what
the important thing is.

77
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,819
I'm telling you, I feel like
I'm about to go out of my mind.

78
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:09,075
You know, I want my life back. Okay?
I want my wife and my house.

79
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,953
Il wanna be a movie star again. ! mean,
what the hell happened, Richie?

80
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,116
Things were going so great
for a while.

81
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:19,012
Last Year in Katmandu.
It cost 140 mil to make.

82
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,073
Grossed 1.6.
The only DVD to sell no copies.

83
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,594
We probably shouldn't have shot it
in black-and-white.

84
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,735
But now you're gonna do a television
series and it's gonna be a hit.

85
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,911
So pull yourself together, man,
because you look like Don Johnson.

86
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,181
-But in a bad way.
-Okay, I got it.

87
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,046
-I'll pull myself together.
-Let's go.

88
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,942
And don't get all nice on me.
Be mean.

89
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,224
I'm gonna be mean.
I'm gonna be mean.

90
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,829
Hit me. There you go.

91
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,591
You're the Jackerator, baby.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

92
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,236
Yo, gentlemen.
How are you? Oh!

93
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,930
-Hey, hello.
-Jack Wyatt.

94
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,457
-Hi, I'm Jack.
-Oh. Huge fan. Huge.

95
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,637
-How are the kids, guys?
-Great.

96
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,409
Good. Well, let's cut the chitchat.

97
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,474
-Thank you. I'm Jack, by the way.
-Nina.

98
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,806
-Jack wants to do the show.
-That's great.

99
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,415
-l wanna do it.
-That's great. That's terrific.

100
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,960
He only has one concern.

101
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,483
We had the same concern.

102
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,248
But we think everyone's forgotten
about Last Year in Katmandu.

103
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,001
Unless they saw it.

104
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,022
His concern is...

105
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,081
.. the witch has all the fun.

106
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,306
You will be fun.

107
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,073
We're changing it from the original.

108
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:22,275
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't all go crazy.
Okay? I mean, it is Bewitched.

109
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,719
I mean, Samantha should be strong.
Right? This should be a two-hander.

110
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,334
Oh, my God. Huh?
Hey. What a relief.

111
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,854
l was worried because Larry told me
you'd want to tilt the show toward you--

112
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,662
Stu, Stu.

113
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:39,673
We gotta have a great ensemble
is what I'm thinking. You know?

114
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,500
Endora, the next-door neighbors,
all those crazy family members.

115
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,964
Who's gonna play Uncle Arthur? Huh?
l used to love Uncle Arthur.

116
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,047
Well, we're looking for Uncle Arthur.

117
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,858
-Your table's ready.
-Thank you.

118
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,281
I don't know if you remember...

119
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,619
..but when he'd appear in the mirror,
it would crack. It would always crack.

120
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,812
And you knew it was coming,
and yet, every time it happened...

121
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,679
..[ laughed and I laughed
and I laughed.

122
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,785
-Can I talk to you?
-l loved it.

123
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,437
"Hi, Sammy."

124
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,059
One second, fellas. We'll meet
you guys at the table, all right?

125
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,172
Hey, I like those guys. What?

126
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,614
-You're being a pussy.
-What?

127
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,245
You're being a pussy, pussy, pussy!

128
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,334
No, I'm not!
I want the show to be good.

129
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,246
You want the show to be--
You know what?

130
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,288
Jack Wyatt's doing TV now
because his film career ate it!

131
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,171
And he's not even the clear star
of his own show.

132
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,037
Jack, screw Uncle Arthur.
Hell, screw ensembles, man.

133
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,901
-I'm being a pussy.
-Yes.

134
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,639
If this show tanks, you'll be on
Hollywood Squares for 10 years.

135
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,087
You will also be the mayor
of Pussytown.

136
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,941
I don't wanna be the mayor
of Pussytown.

137
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,394
Get in there and be
the sheriff of Ballsville.

138
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,010
-All right?
-Okay.

139
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,658
-Bring it.
-Okay.

140
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,250
Let's go.

141
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,491
-Stop that.
-Sorry, sorry.

142
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,349
Sorry, guys, where were we?

143
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,815
Couple of big names are available
for Samantha.

144
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,347
-To hell with that.
-Yeah.

145
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,435
I want an unknown in the lead.
All right?

146
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,088
A hot new face that's gonna look good
and set me up.

147
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,860
Because I have worked my ass off
to the bone for too long...

148
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,572
..to build up the brand value
of the name Jack Wyatt!

149
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,044
-This show has one star.
-And I want three trailers.

150
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,723
Nobody in television
has three trailers.

151
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,358
He wants them, you get them.

152
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,061
And l want my own makeup team
in matching jumpsuits.

153
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,132
And a leopard!
l want a pet leopard.

154
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,524
With a diamond-studded collar.
Real diamonds.

155
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,667
-That's enough, Jack.
-And a cake.

156
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,939
A two-story-high cake.
Every Wednesday's Cake Day.

157
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,086
And we're gonna bring it out...

158
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,114
..and we're gonna pretend
it's a surprise.

159
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,800
Because it's Cake Day.

160
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,318
We get it, Jack.

161
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,986
If we have a leopard, we're gonna
have major insurance issues.

162
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,137
We're willing to give
on the leopard.

163
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,749
It's getting hard to breathe.

164
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,837
-Should I be writing this down?
-No.

165
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,565
So this should be fun. Huh? Right?

166
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,773
l used to have the biggest crush on
Elizabeth Montgomery when I was 10.

167
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,434
-We all did.
-The nose. I mean...

168
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,826
It's not gonna be easy finding
a nobody to play Samantha.

169
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,738
Be the sheriff.

170
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,487
Well, Jack Wyatt says
get it done, y'all.

171
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,214
Hey, I'm turning on the sprinklers
in my front yard.

172
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,578
Dimming up.

173
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,371
Dimming down.

174
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,327
Dimming up.

175
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,021
Dimming down.

176
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:54,923
Wow!

177
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,438
I don't think you quite understand.

178
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,437
This is very confusing.

179
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,978
I put the black cable in the red plug
like they said...

180
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,990
..and the screen is still blue.

181
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,146
I'm here to give you cable.

182
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,699
Oh, thank you, I already have some.

183
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,278
Hello? Don't go away, please.

184
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,341
To heck with all this bunk!

185
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,426
There.

186
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,336
Let's just keep this
between us, Lucinda.

187
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,308
ls your self-esteem low because you
aren't participating in the real world?

188
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,785
Yes, my self-esteem is very low.

189
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,201
Well, let's face it, you need a job.

190
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,391
There's something I have
to tell you, Darrin.

191
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,963
-I'm a witch.
-I'm a witch.

192
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,228
lam a witch.

193
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,898
Good. Good.

194
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,923
Oh, my goodness.

195
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,756
God bless you.

196
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,015
Don't look, but Jack Wyatt
is staring at you.

197
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,798
My heart's pounding,
and l am feeling very weird tingles.

198
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,709
I know. He makes me sick too.

199
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,507
You know him?

200
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,857
Jack Wyatt? The actor?

201
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,756
Where have you been?

202
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,811
-May I join you?
-Sure.

203
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,189
-Hi, I'm Jack Wyatt.
-l know.

204
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,781
Thank you.

205
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,173
Look, I've never done this before.

206
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,130
How would you like to be
ona television show?

207
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,631
-Ms....
-Bigelow.

208
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,196
Bigelow?

209
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,132
Isabel Bigelow.

210
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,946
What do you think?
Wanna be a famous actress?

211
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,445
-Me?
-Yeah.

212
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,406
-An actress?
-Yeah.

213
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,379
Il can't act.

214
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,138
Anyone can act.

215
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,116
If l can act, you can act.

216
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,618
Amen.

217
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:48,183
I think those people over there
just finished their plate of hummus.

218
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,371
You might wanna help them
by clearing it. Thank you.

219
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,581
So, Isabel Bigelow,
do you have a job?

220
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,302
-No.
-Are you rich?

221
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,190
Because I am.

222
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,253
I'm extremely wealthy.

223
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,725
Which I'm about to prove to you
by taking care of this bill...

224
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,810
..for two dollars...

225
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,356
..and 31 cents.

226
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,178
-Wow.
-Yeah. "Wow" is right.

227
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,638
l have to remember
to get some money.

228
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,160
Yeah.

229
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,475
So do you wanna be
rich and famous?

230
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,116
I just wanna be normal.

231
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,072
Well, acting is better than normal.

232
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,702
Yeah. You get to pretend
to be normal.

233
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,157
And then if you're good,
you become a big star...

234
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,064
-...and guess what happens.
-What?

235
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,027
You snap your fingers and pretty much
anything you want materializes.

236
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,661
Oh, no. No, no, no.

237
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,447
Il have that now.
It's what I'm giving up.

238
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,654
Oh, it was lovely to meet you.

239
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,781
You seem very sweet
and unkempt and troubled.

240
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,748
Hey!

241
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,656
Hey, hey, hey. Those are bad things
to say to a person.

242
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,196
Oh, no, they aren't.

243
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:13,125
I think the fact that you're
a hopeless mess is very refreshing.

244
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,229
It moves me.

245
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,323
-lsabel Bigelow.
-Yes?

246
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,367
I need you.

247
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,933
What did you say?

248
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,215
-l said, need you.
-You need me?

249
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,381
I need you.

250
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,257
You don't have to come audition.

251
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,150
Just come and show everyone
what you look like when you do it.

252
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,620
Like this?

253
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,758
Uncanny.

254
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,263
-It's identical.
-l told you.

255
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,870
You go, girl!

256
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,490
We would just like you
to read the script.

257
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,320
Start on page 13.
Should be marked there.

258
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,956
Read it?

259
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,347
Okay-- Out loud.

260
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,352
Yeah. We want an idea
of what it could sound like.

261
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,900
"Int., honeymoon suite, night--
Dash, night.

262
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,170
Darrin and Samantha are sitting
on the bed."

263
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,861
Someone's not too bright.

264
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,107
Just.... Just read the part
that says "Samantha."

265
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:38,033
"Darrin, I know it's our honeymoon,
but there's something I have to tell you.

266
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,928
I'm a witch."

267
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,126
-I'm not a witch.
-Yeah, exactly.

268
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,835
-No, you're giving it up.
-Who told you?

269
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,434
You're about to. On the next page.

270
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,317
It's Bewitched. The TV show.
We're redoing it.

271
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,681
Oh, I wasn't allowed
to watch Bewitched.

272
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,169
Who wasn't allowed
to watch Bewitched?

273
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,123
-That's great, Jack.
-That's great.

274
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,126
Well, I play a mortal.
And I'm in love with you.

275
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,513
And I don't care that you're a witch.

276
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,519
You don't care?

277
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,054
No? Is that true?

278
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,553
Yes, it is. Yeah.

279
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,574
Now go ahead and read the lines.

280
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,701
I'll read with you.
We'll do it together.

281
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,219
Randall? Where are you?
Yes. Thank you.

282
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,929
This'll be easy.

283
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,783
-Here?
-Yeah.

284
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,302
I'm a witch, Darrin.

285
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:36,267
A house-haunting, broomstick-flying,
cauldron-stirring witch!

286
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,163
Great. Great.

287
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,637
Know what? Let's put the script down,
let's put it away, and we'll improvise.

288
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,498
Jack. That was only one line.

289
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,154
Not a big deal.

290
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,824
Go ahead, just set it down.

291
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,417
Randall.

292
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,249
I'm gonna ask you questions,
just answer them as if you're a witch.

293
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,787
-Sure.
-Yeah.

294
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,466
Were your parents
in the witch business?

295
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,324
Both of them. My mother fixed
the 1986 World Series.

296
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,622
-Funny.
-Make a note of that.

297
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,651
Do you carry around poison apples,
like in Snow White?

298
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:12,245
Oh, no, you have to have a permit
for a poison apple.

299
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,485
Permit? Okay, good to know.

300
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,444
That's good.

301
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,389
Oh, what's it like to date a warlock?

302
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,364
Oh! Horrible.

303
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:24,443
They're self-centered, not very bright,
and all that feel-good-in-the-moment.

304
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,584
Not at all like you.

305
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,547
What's so funny?

306
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,352
Nothing, J-Bone.

307
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,670
What's your favorite spell?

308
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:37,102
Oh, no, I don't like to talk about that
because I'm quitting and--

309
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,013
No, talking about it
just makes it harder, so....

310
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,466
Are you sure you never saw
Bewitched?

311
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,368
She's incredibly dialed-in.

312
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,884
-Can l ask a question?
-Sure.

313
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,096
How much longer do we have to
do this for?

314
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,595
Oh, this?
We're almost done with this.

315
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,801
I mean, if you do the show,
we'll be together forever.

316
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,314
-You and I?
-Would you please do the show?

317
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,957
-What? This show?
-This show.

318
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,251
-The Bewitched show?
-Absolutely.

319
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,274
We'll work together.
We'll be partners.

320
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,713
Be my TV wife.

321
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,081
-This is very complicated.
-Marry me.

322
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,229
Say yes.

323
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,684
What are you doing, Isabel?

324
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,599
Easy answer.

325
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,524
-Yes.
-Yes!

326
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,937
Great. Thank you.

327
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,810
Okay. Let's make the deal. Right?

328
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,185
Once upon a time,
there was a typical American girl...

329
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:35,255
...who happened to bump into
a typical red-blooded American boy.

330
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:40,278
And she bumped into him,
and bumped into him.

331
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,931
So they decided they'd better
sit down and talk this over...

332
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,397
...before they had an accident.

333
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,407
They became good friends.

334
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,442
-Hi!
-Hello?

335
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,304
They brought this while you were out.
I said I'd bring it over.

336
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,214
I'm your neighbor, Maria Kelly.

337
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:57,812
-Come in!
-Thank you.

338
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,793
What is all this stuff?

339
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,262
I just got the most amazing job.

340
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:06,061
I'm gonna be Samantha on Bewitched.
They're redoing it.

341
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,062
Are you an actress?

342
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,536
I guess lam.

343
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,052
I love that show.
Is that the one about the genie?

344
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,021
-No.
-This is so exciting!

345
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,095
Oh! There you are. Come here.
This is you!

346
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,008
Oh, I love this show.

347
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:26,931
You know it?

348
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:30,266
Watched it every night.
Love the song. Perfect.

349
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,743
There you are! You're great!
Look at the nose!

350
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,396
I hope you can do that.

351
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,421
That's how I got the job.
Wriggling my nose.

352
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,553
-Really?
-It's easy.

353
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,269
Who's gonna play your husband?

354
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:43,527
-Jack Wyatt.
-Oh, my God.

355
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,893
He believes in me. He wants to be
partners with me. Listen to this:

356
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,245
"Looking forward
to working with you, Isabel.

357
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,658
As dictated to
Jack's assistant, Randall."

358
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,534
Isn't that amazing?

359
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,330
He's single. It's in all the tabloids.
His wife dumped him.

360
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,047
-ls that true?
-Yes!

361
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,457
Oh, my gosh.

362
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,516
I don't know why we're doing this,
but it's fun.

363
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,348
I know!

364
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,440
Although, you shouldn't get involved
with someone you're working with.

365
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,680
It can destroy your references.
I'm a career counselor and--

366
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,416
Well, that's the only reason
I took the job.

367
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:21,146
He is the cutest mess you have
ever seen. He is hopeless.

368
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,522
Oh, gosh, he's beyond mortal.

369
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,506
My father would never approve.

370
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,039
Oh. Well.

371
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,098
l won't?

372
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,023
Daddy. Hi.

373
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,549
What are you doing here?

374
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,668
Hello, Isabel. Love the hat.

375
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,757
And who is this?

376
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,090
This is my father.

377
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,238
This is Maria Kelly.

378
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,385
How witchy was that? We talk
about your father and he turns up.

379
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,153
Maria is my neighbor.

380
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,815
Nigel Bigelow. Enchanté.

381
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,115
Okay.

382
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:02,984
And what won't I approve of?

383
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,982
A man Isabel thinks is cute.

384
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,867
I'm completely against it.

385
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,056
I'm gonna be an actress
in a television series.

386
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,851
She's gonna play Samantha
on Bewitched.

387
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,511
Bewitched?
That's an insult to our way of life.

388
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,102
Your dad is a hoot.

389
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,481
I'm gonna take one of these,
because you got a lot.

390
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:22,887
Oh, sure.

391
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:27,145
Anyway, if anyone's robbing my house,
let me know. I'll do the same for you.

392
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,193
Oh! And if you get a date
that has a friend...

393
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,326
.. make sure he's not secretly married
before you call me.

394
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,889
-Bye, Nigel.
-Bye, Maria.

395
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,738
Bye, Maria.

396
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,800
Why can't you be happy for me?

397
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,079
In less than a week I have become
a rich and famous actress...

398
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:47,087
.. living in a house I don't even have
to pay rent for...

399
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,336
.. Just like every other person
in the world.

400
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:50,835
Why wouldn't l be happy?

401
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,346
You've turned your back
on your own kind...

402
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,636
..and now you live down the street
from a Denny's.

403
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,946
Don't make fun of my life.
I could make fun of your life.

404
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,779
So, what about this man?

405
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,788
No, am not telling you anything
anymore, you're too negative.

406
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,885
One morning,
! shot a lion in my pajamas.

407
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:12,687
What he was doing in my pajamas,
lll never know.

408
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,831
Uncle Arthur. Classic.

409
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,497
Your brand of low comedy always did
appeal to adolescent mentality.

410
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,472
! won't do it.

411
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,543
Speaking of traveling,
remember that time....

412
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:30,922
Maybe I will.

413
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,110
Maybe I will.

414
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,672
--sent over from Europe.
It's simply gorgeous.

415
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,155
It reminds me
of the one in California.

416
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,385
Lucinda, you really should be
watching this.

417
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,410
I'm only trying to say
that you broke your promise.

418
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,880
You gave me your word, no more....

419
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,492
Stuff.

420
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,324
It's a little harder to break the habit
than I thought.

421
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,847
Well, you can do it.
I've got a lot of faith in you.

422
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,771
Thank you, darling.

423
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,043
Ladies and gentlemen...

424
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,061
.. please welcome the star
of the new Bewitched:

425
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,184
Jack Wyatt!

426
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,358
I didn't expect you guys to be here.

427
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,509
Okay, as you know,
we're here for Bewitched.

428
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:31,119
But it's not the same Bewitched
that you remember. It's being retooled.

429
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:33,287
But there is going to be a Samantha?

430
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,529
Of course.
Isabel, can you come out here?

431
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,676
Be brave. You look beautiful.

432
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,625
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press...

433
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,463
.I'd like you to meet the talented
and delightful Ms. Isabel Bigelow.

434
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,858
Say hello to the people, Isabel.

435
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,433
Hello.

436
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,293
No, no, into the microphone.
Here. Here.

437
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,035
-Hello.
-That's enough.

438
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,191
Now do that thing that you do.

439
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,623
Isn't that great?

440
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,936
That was great. Great.
Just stand there.

441
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,859
And guess who's playing Endora.

442
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,130
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the great, the legendary...

443
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,778
..Miss Iris Smythson,
as my mother-in-law.

444
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,652
That's right.

445
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,050
Iris Smythson. Iris?

446
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,814
-lris?
-All right, what's going on?

447
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,056
lris Smythson.

448
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,074
And of course she hates me.
Don't you?

449
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,265
Anything you say, Jerry.

450
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,950
Jack. See what 1 mean?
That's a joke, right?

451
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,279
Endora used to refer to Darrin
as Derwood.

452
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,758
No, I just forgot your name.

453
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,601
But the news here
isn't Iris Smythson...

454
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,570
..or Jack Wyatt,
who's trying the small screen...

455
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,663
.. after the twin disasters
of his last movie...

456
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,087
..and a messy split
from his wife, Sheila...

457
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,272
...who's already found
someone new...

458
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,271
.. after a marriage that lasted
only 19 months.

459
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,484
Didn't she leave him for a
snowboarder‘underwear model?

460
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,701
He's a moronjidiot.

461
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,149
-That's right.
-Aren't they living together?

462
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:26,852
Yes, in my house! My house
that bought before I even met her.

463
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,662
And she won't move
or sign the divorce papers.

464
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,802
The big news is the surprise casting
of an unknown as Samantha.

465
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,259
Her name is Isabel Bigelow...

466
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,902
..and she's quite the charmer,
isn't she?

467
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,061
-That's magic.
-So, what's Jack Wyatt thinking?

468
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,984
"My career has tanked,
so I'Il fix it by playing Darrin"?

469
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,710
Yeah. Because that's crazy.
Who's running his life?

470
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,973
Plus, he did not look well.

471
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,504
Not look well? I look fine.

472
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,665
I'm extremely healthy.

473
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,777
Richie. Richie.

474
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,968
What am I gonna do with you?

475
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,390
Boy.

476
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,149
This is Richie.

477
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,377
Richie. Why'd you talk me
into doing this show? Huh?

478
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,877
What was I thinking?
What were you thinking?

479
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,396
We were both thinking
the same thing, Jack Attack.

480
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,662
Cast a nobody.
You're completely safe.

481
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,018
Richie, can't you come over here?
I could use a little support on this one.

482
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,930
Jack, I can't because I'm about to step
into a meeting with the head of NBC.

483
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,962
lll be right there! One second.

484
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,699
Look, I don't know if you know this,
but I'm Darrin, okay?

485
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:33,464
They replaced Darrin on the original
Bewitched and no one noticed!

486
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,456
Nobody is going to replace you.

487
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,872
I'm Darrin! How did this happen?!

488
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,214
Hold the work!

489
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,269
Once upon a time, there was a typical
red-blooded American boy...

490
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,943
...who happened to bump into
a typical American girl.

491
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,323
And, cut!

492
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,620
-Jack, Jack.
-How was I? How was I?

493
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,059
-You were wonderful, man.
-So good.

494
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,781
-Don't lie to me.
-No. My ribs hurt.

495
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,701
It's what I get paid to do.

496
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,713
Jack? Uno mas? From the top?

497
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,038
One more?

498
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,060
Did you see what happened?
Good stuff.

499
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,625
Moving on!

500
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,210
You know it, dude. Nice one.

501
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,536
Here we go.
Off to a good start, huh?

502
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:03,107
And after a while, he did what any
red-blooded American boy would do.

503
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,109
Samantha, will you marry me?

504
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:07,588
Cut!

505
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,799
Great! Beautiful. That was good.

506
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,314
That was good.

507
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,714
-Action.
-You're a witch?

508
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:16,886
And you waited until our
wedding night to tell me?

509
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,549
I don't believe this! Oh, golly!

510
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:28,756
Samantha.

511
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,812
Cut! Cut!

512
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,806
Joey, for God's sake.

513
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,979
Are you trying to kill everyone?
Because we can't breathe.

514
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,436
And what's going on
with the lightning?

515
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:49,712
You can't nod to the audience in
the show. It just breaks the reality.

516
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,235
What?

517
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,152
You can't nod to them.
You can't do....

518
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,185
Go sit in your chair.
Back to your chair.

519
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,750
All right, but--

520
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,293
Take two up. Rolling!

521
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,521
You're a witch? And you waited until
our wedding night to tell me?

522
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,080
I can't believe this.

523
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,559
What's going on?

524
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,246
Samantha.

525
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,772
Why is she waving?

526
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,077
Who are you?

527
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:31,049
lam Samantha's mother, Endora.

528
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,646
A mortal? You married a mortal?

529
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,075
Oh, my poor, poor baby.
This is just horrifying.

530
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,735
I think I need a drink.

531
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,684
Freeze!

532
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,013
Unfreeze!

533
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,135
What a shame you didn't drink it.

534
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:56,603
If you had, perhaps you could've spent
your wedding night as a bullfrog.

535
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,905
Don't worry, Samantha. I won't do it.
Witch's honor.

536
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,694
My darling, we are quicksilver.

537
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,868
We're a fleeting shadow.

538
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,547
We're a distant sound.

539
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,209
-That's your mother?
-We live on the wind...

540
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,719
..in the sparkle of a star.

541
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,883
And you want to trade all that
for an acre of crabgrass?

542
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,772
Did she just call me
an acre of crabgrass?

543
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,445
Deal with it, Derwood.

544
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,973
Thank you. Thank you.

545
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,502
Thank you!

546
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,843
l want a piece of the show. Why?

547
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,309
Because I put this thing together,
that's why.

548
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,688
Because Jack Wyatt doesn't
parallel park without checking with me.

549
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:52,131
Let me call you back. J-Bone!

550
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,434
You're crushing it, baby.
Absolutely crushing it.

551
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,476
- think we got something.
-It's exciting.

552
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,298
-How's Isabel doing?
-She's perfect.

553
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,450
She looks hot and she lets you score
like a madman.

554
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:02,967
I know. She's great.

555
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,585
I can't believe you found her.

556
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,083
You think she's gonna notice?

557
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,341
What? That she doesn't have a part?
Not a chance. She's clueless.

558
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,844
Plus, I think she's got
a little thing for you.

559
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,394
It's freaking pathetic.

560
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,113
-You think so?
-Yes.

561
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,141
Man, that would be--

562
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,066
Such a nightmare. I know.
Can you imagine?

563
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:25,342
Although, she does have kind of
a cute little back end on her.

564
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,520
l wouldn't kick her out of bed
for eating a box of crackers.

565
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,144
Isabel?

566
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,420
-Did she hear us?
-Not a chance.

567
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,389
A couple of changes to the script.

568
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:40,615
It was running a little long,
so we cut your lines.

569
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,456
Think of it this way,
it's less to memorize.

570
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,223
Sorry.

571
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,165
Lunch!

572
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,083
Isabel!

573
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:10,854
I feel like a fool. A big, stupid,
sad fool, and yet I'm angry as well.

574
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:12,633
What's going on?

575
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,404
Let's set fire to his trailer.
Let's just do it.

576
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:19,134
Isabel, this is awesome!
You're on TV.

577
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,921
He lied to me.

578
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,471
He tricked me.
He said he needed me.

579
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,325
When all he needed was someone
to stand next to him...

580
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:29,575
.. while he says
his stupid clever lines.

581
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,005
-Hi, I'm Maria.
-Nina.

582
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:42,428
He seemed so messy and sincere.
But really, he's just a big fake.

583
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,894
We could electrocute him.
There's tons of wires around here.

584
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:50,344
l wanna cry, l wanna break things.
I wanna hurt him.

585
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,982
Yet there's a part of me that still
has a small amount of feeling for him.

586
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,200
How can this be?

587
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,681
When my first husband left me,
l wanted to cut the brakes in his car...

588
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,361
.. but instead we ended up
having sex on the elliptical machine.

589
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:08,216
He doesn't understand who
he's dealing with. He has no idea.

590
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,630
Look, you have three options:

591
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,402
You put up with it...

592
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,847
quit...

593
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,542
..or get mad.

594
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,139
What would Samantha do?

595
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,857
She chose mad, right?

596
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,433
Okay, everybody, settle down.

597
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:03,511
Okay, working very quietly,
like little mice.

598
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,423
I don't want to see or hear
what you're doing.

599
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,034
I don't want to see or hear
what you're doing.

600
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:12,803
Okay, so, Isabel, just to refresh
your memory, Darrin's ex-girlfriend--

601
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,798
l read the script.

602
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,093
Okay. Well, let's just go over it
one more time.

603
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,234
Oh, and we rehearsed it a lot.

604
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,157
Well, I'm aware of that.

605
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,049
Darrin's ex-girlfriend has invited you
both over for dinner.

606
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,730
And Darrin forced you
to come with him--

607
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,899
He tricked me. Because he is
a self-centered has-been.

608
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,729
No, no, baby, that's not it. No.

609
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:37,679
Because he wants his dog back,
and then Darrin says his line:

610
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:39,613
-"It's my dog.
-It's my dog.

611
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,708
-l want him back."
-l want him back.

612
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,627
It always kills me, Jack.
You ready to go?

613
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,373
Let's do it. Let's do it.

614
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,101
Saddle up. Rolling!

615
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,727
Action!

616
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,499
It's my dog.

617
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,455
My dog!

618
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,883
And I will die if l do not have him back.
Do you understand?!

619
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:08,251
I will die if l do not have him back!

620
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,642
Cut.

621
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,350
Well, that was a bit much, Jack.
You wanna take it down a notch?

622
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:17,995
Or five?

623
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,225
You know what? Just keep it going.
Let me just go. I'll get it this time.

624
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,790
Rolling!

625
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,031
Action!

626
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,296
Where art thou, dog?

627
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,562
Thy canine lover.

628
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,119
What's happening?

629
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,783
Where is your hot breath
upon the nape of my neck?

630
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,701
We shall form a bond of brotherhood:
man and beast.

631
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:43,305
You shall lick my face
and I shall lick your snout.

632
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:44,968
Cut. Jack.

633
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,630
Guys, I'm not doing this on purpose,
Il swear to you.

634
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,266
Okay. All right.

635
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:50,817
Rolling.

636
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,704
Oh, my God. Where's my dog?

637
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,507
Totally. l have a totally great dog.

638
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,236
Jack. Jack. What are you doing?

639
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:23,687
This is where the dog has to decide
between Darrin's ex and Darrin.

640
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,484
Samantha wiggles her nose
and the dog chooses Darrin.

641
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,466
Rolling!

642
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,608
I know how we can solve this, Darrin.
We'll let Satchel decide.

643
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,782
That's a great idea.

644
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,894
-Come to Daddy, Satchel.
-Look! Good boy.

645
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,874
-Come to Mommy.
-Good boy.

646
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,009
-Satchel....
-Okay, Isabel, wiggle your nose.

647
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,069
Satchel. Satchel. Come to Mommy.

648
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,121
-Satchel. Satchel.
-Come on. Come on. Up!

649
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,343
-Right here. Come to Daddy.
-Come to Mommy, Satchel.

650
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:53,804
I got it, Jack. I got it.

651
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,855
Don't you dare go to Daddy.
Come to Mommy!

652
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,401
-No, no, no. You love Daddy.
-Come on, Satchel.

653
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,263
-Come on.
-Come on.

654
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,796
Satchel, come to Mommy.

655
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,534
-He's coming. He's coming.
-He's just sitting there.

656
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:07,351
Come on! Come on, boy!

657
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:08,902
To Mommy, Satchel.

658
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,211
-Cut!
-Jim, what's going on here?

659
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,107
Joey!

660
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,563
If the dog runs to you again, try this.

661
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,046
Come to Daddy, Satchel.

662
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,697
Satchel, come to Mommy.

663
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,169
Come on! Come on, Satchel.

664
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,258
-Come on, boy, please?
-To Mommy.

665
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,044
Good girl.

666
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,884
Please, boy, come on!
Jump, boy! Jump!

667
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,240
Thank God you didn't have
a Great Dane.

668
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,682
Damn it!

669
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,712
Cut!

670
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,226
Darling, that was marvelous.

671
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,788
But.... Watch out for that.

672
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:59,989
Please don't say anything.

673
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:01,668
Calm down, you're not alone.

674
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,767
-I'm not?
-No.

675
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,927
-Are there others?
-There are many others.

676
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:13,181
Many actors, they develop tricks...

677
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,384
.. twitches, really.

678
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,554
You don't want to
become mannered.

679
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,033
-Oh, no, I don't.
-No.

680
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,475
Thank you, Iris.

681
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:42,966
Hello.

682
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:44,890
Daddy, what--?

683
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:48,453
If it isn't my spell-casting magical
daughter who gave up witchcraft.

684
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,177
You've had quite a day today,
haven't you?

685
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:54,236
l was provoked. I fell off the wagon.
It was a one-time thing.

686
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,663
So you're not in love
with him anymore?

687
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,134
I have never disliked a man
more in my entire life...

688
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:08,520
.. which proves that lam
completely over him.

689
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,740
Not necessarily. In fact--

690
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:14,261
Besides, it was just a crush, which is
an intense but superficial attraction...

691
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,936
.. that can easily be mistaken for
something deeper. Now go away.

692
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,620
l have a crush on Endora.

693
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,246
What?!

694
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,219
Daddy, where are you?

695
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,289
l said, l have a crush on Endora.

696
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,470
-Daddy! No.
-So lovely.

697
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,036
Her name is not Endora. It's Iris.

698
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,395
Iris. A spring flower.

699
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:48,001
You can't.

700
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:51,432
Now that I turned out to be so wrong
about him, my job is all that I've got.

701
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,226
-Please don't mess it up.
-How could I do that?

702
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,194
You'll sleep with her,
cheat on her...

703
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,854
.. she'll go crazy
and she'll take it out on me.

704
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,653
I don't want you to get involved
with Iris. 1 mean it.

705
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,981
You can't stop being a witch.

706
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,312
I can too. You'll see.

707
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,652
-Cannot.
-Can too.

708
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,198
-Just accept it.
-Never.

709
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:14,904
Tell me about Bewitched.

710
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:18,066
Some have said it's a crass attempt
by the network to market nostalgia...

711
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,969
father than take a risk
on new ideas.

712
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:24,836
This isn't the old Bewitched.
It's been refocused,

713
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,990
Let's just say the only thing
! won't be doing is this:

714
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,904
So you leave the nose-wiggling
to the witch.

715
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:37,824
But you do it so well,

716
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,893
Well, l don't know about that.
! did coach her, though.

717
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,575
Can we get a close-up
on the nose?

718
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:45,285
I'd rather not.

719
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,069
Which camera?

720
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,149
Here? Okay.

721
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,103
Shall we discuss...

722
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,095
. dare we discuss,
Last Year in Katmandu?

723
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,775
Hi, Nina.

724
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,270
Yes! Yes, l am watching him.

725
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,131
What's a dick?

726
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,693
No one ever sets out
to make a bad movie.

727
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,542
What does that have to do
with how obnoxious he is being?

728
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,914
Some movies are career-enders.

729
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,429
Right. Right, we need a plan.

730
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,259
What went wrong?

731
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:21,323
You know, I hate to point fingers...

732
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:23,806
..but I'm gonna blame
the wardrobe department.

733
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,312
The wardrobe department?

734
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,103
! think it got in the way.

735
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,891
Maybe I should quit.

736
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:30,557
Honey, you can't quit.

737
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,952
Why not? Isn't that what people do?

738
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,774
He has to quit, not you.

739
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,509
Yeah, like that's ever
gonna happen.

740
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,274
We have to make him quit.

741
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:41,163
If we get naked pictures of him
and pictures of farm animals...

742
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,019
....1 could just Photoshop them.

743
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:44,431
That's an excellent idea.

744
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,558
No, no, no. Wait.
Calm down. Calm down.

745
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:50,114
No, no, no, this not what I wanted.
I wanted something normal.

746
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,386
What should I do?

747
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,100
Oh, my.

748
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,788
What a mess.

749
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,224
Your Aunt Clara used to be able
to make a clean landing.

750
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,081
Aunt Clara?

751
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,173
Oh, Aunt Clara.

752
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,491
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

753
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:38,105
lam in the middle of a total,
total crisis at work. I'm quitting.

754
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,055
You mustn't quit.
The show must go on.

755
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:42,709
Isabel, are you all right?

756
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,230
Oh, my friends-- I have friends--
They don't know we're witches.

757
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,334
Mum's the word.

758
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,663
You know, there was an Aunt Clara
on the original Bewitched.

759
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,446
What a coincidence!

760
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,484
She was a witch.

761
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,286
So aml.

762
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,781
She was always screwing up.

763
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:05,851
-Really?
-l have made up my mind.

764
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,730
lam quitting tomorrow and I'll do
something else, like sailing...

765
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,098
..or polishing fruit.

766
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,163
It's too bad you're not a witch,
you could put a hex on Jack.

767
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:18,016
Oh, I can. I certainly can.

768
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,649
Who is Jack?

769
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,287
The reason I'm quitting.

770
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,039
Well, why not put a hex on him.

771
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,319
Because I'm giving it up.

772
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:28,084
-Just a little one.
-Aunt Clara.

773
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,942
Just to get him to behave.

774
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,825
I'll do it.

775
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,865
And then I can keep my job.
Which would help my self-esteem.

776
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,276
You know, there's only
one problem with a hex.

777
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,038
There's no such thing as magic.

778
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,273
So...

779
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,475
.. what's your idea,
Little Miss Doubtful?

780
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,094
-Well, l have a Taser.
-Nina.

781
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:53,353
l think we should Taser him and throw
him into the shark tank at SeaWorld.

782
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:58,515
No. You think we should do a hex.

783
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,781
Il think we should do a hex.

784
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,691
Pinch of jasmine.

785
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,094
Wolfbane.

786
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,160
Grapefruit pith.

787
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:19,119
Grapefruit pith.

788
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,727
I feel so alive.

789
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,532
I feel like one of those people
I'd make fun of.

790
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,302
I feel like I believe in unicorns.

791
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,866
Did I put in the wolfbane?
I can't remember.

792
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,917
-Aunt Clara.
-Thank you, darling. Thank you.

793
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:35,511
Oh, well.

794
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,673
Isabel.

795
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,067
Isabel, bo-bel

796
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,868
Bonana-fana fo-fel

797
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,707
Fee-fy-fo-fel

798
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,042
Isabel

799
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,640
"The Name Game"!

800
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,156
-Oh, boy.
-Good morning.

801
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,732
Randall, take that stupid sign
off that machine.

802
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,711
Free cappuccinos for everyone.

803
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,679
-How we doing? Anyone seen Isabel?
-No, why?

804
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,532
Because I miss her.

805
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,540
-Listen, Jack.
-Yes?

806
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,515
We got the test scores
from the pilot...

807
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,148
How did Isabel do?
Ninety-nine percent in the top box!

808
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:33,098
Why didn't you tell me?
This is great news.

809
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,750
Of course she got a 99 percent.
Because she's dynamite.

810
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:37,583
Absolute dynamite.

811
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:39,889
High-fives all the way around.

812
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,561
But, Jack, there is a problem.
Your scores...

813
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,393
Thirty-two percent.
That's better than zero, huh?

814
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,774
You know what?
That's constructive criticism.

815
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,787
The dog scored higher than me.
He's a cute dog.

816
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,529
What do the comment cards say?

817
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,325
Oh, they don't really...

818
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,629
"Jack Wyatt is a real tool."

819
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,994
But a good tool. Like a Jacksaw!

820
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:05,873
You know what? Who cares? This just
means we got hard work to do, okay?

821
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,060
Hey, I never said I was perfect.
The important thing is Isabel.

822
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,950
-lsabel.
-Yeah, no question.

823
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,572
-Agreed?
-Totally on board.

824
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:14,497
Good morning, everyone.

825
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,025
There she is!

826
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,753
Is it just my imagination, or is the room
actually brighter with her here?

827
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:23,468
Look at this bundle
of miraculous talent.

828
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:27,765
Forget 99, I give her 100! 100!

829
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,571
Rehearsing!

830
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:33,266
"Interior, apartment, day.

831
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:37,553
Samantha and Darrin are sitting
in their overcrowded apartment."

832
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:41,466
Darrin, I think we should buy a house
and I found one that I love.

833
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:44,123
You nailed that!

834
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:47,234
I'm about to have a heart attack.
Isn't she great?

835
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,445
And now I kiss her, because
she's in love with our new house.

836
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:52,975
Oh, you can't kiss me.
I'm not in this scene.

837
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,654
-You're not in the scene?
-No.

838
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,562
No, no, no. She isn't in the scene?
This isn't happening! What?!

839
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,300
She has to be in every scene!
Okay?

840
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,860
Rewrite! Go! Rewrite.

841
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,582
Everyone, Isabel needs a joke.

842
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,974
I would love a joke.

843
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,423
One joke, coming up.

844
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,934
Oh, and then I kiss her
because she's so funny.

845
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,083
And a job. She needs a job.

846
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:22,172
Yes! Yes! Make this woman the CEO
of a multinational corporation.

847
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:25,133
-Good idea, Jack.
-No. Great idea.

848
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,049
And then I kiss her
because she's so powerful.

849
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:34,106
It's too much, what happened?

850
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,752
Aunt Clara. Aunt Clara?

851
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,725
Please pick up the phone,
something terrible is happening.

852
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,377
Something terrible is happening.

853
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,013
I know, I know.
It wasn't supposed to, and--

854
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:48,406
You should never,
ever get involved with an actor.

855
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:51,156
I'm not involved with him,
I don't think.

856
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:53,819
-Witch's honor?
-What?

857
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,686
I'm just being Endora.

858
00:50:57,922 --> 00:51:01,732
Isabel, actors look normal,
sometimes better than normal.

859
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,178
But deep down,
there is no deep down.

860
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,428
l thought you were safe.
He loathed you.

861
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,121
What on earth happened?

862
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,246
A little witchcraft, l suspect.

863
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:14,388
Even though we weren't going to do it,
were we, darling?

864
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,194
I'm Nigel Bigelow, I'm Isabel's father.
How do you do?

865
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:20,826
Daddy, we talked about this,
remember?

866
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,719
-l'm....
-l know who you are.

867
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,641
I've seen everything
you've ever done.

868
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:29,283
Lysistrata in Florence,
Blithe Spirit in New York.

869
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,437
-Daddy!
-But your Endora is a marvel.

870
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:34,537
It comes so easily, really.

871
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,915
Oh, yes, because I am a witch.

872
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:38,471
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yes.

873
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:42,136
I put out all the lights in
Leicester Square just by walking past.

874
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,406
Oh, tell me more.
Tell me everything.

875
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:47,382
-Oh, please come in.
-Charmed.

876
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,057
This is just.... What--?

877
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:53,676
Isabel!

878
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:57,095
Hey! Isabel! Isabel!

879
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:01,632
Hi! Listen, maybe we could go
to dinner tonight. God, I'm so nervous.

880
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,741
- don't think so, I have to get home.
-We won't make it a date.

881
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,595
I'll just happen to stop by
and ask if you're hungry.

882
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:09,322
-No.
-Yes! That's a yes!

883
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,060
-No!
-I'll be by at great.

884
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,857
I mean, I'll be by at 8.

885
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,740
Stop by if you need anything.
I'm right here. Okay.

886
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,458
Aunt Clara!

887
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,603
Undo it! Undo it!
You overdid it! Undo it!

888
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,893
-Oh, dear.
-Aunt Clara!

889
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:32,261
I'm not too sure how to undo it.
Undoing it's not the same as doing it.

890
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,233
He wants to have dinner.
This isn't what I wanted.

891
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:37,933
Lorna Doone?

892
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:39,499
No!

893
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,633
Darling, I'm sure you can undo the hex
if you really want to.

894
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,105
I'm expected in Japan.

895
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:50,395
That certainly didn't work, did it?

896
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:56,062
Aunt Clara?

897
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,877
Aunt Clara,
come back here right now.

898
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,070
He's gonna be here any minute.
Aunt Clara!

899
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,069
But that doesn't matter,
because I'm not going out with him.

900
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,422
No, no, I'm not. I'm not!

901
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,191
Oh, I'd better--

902
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,833
Oh, who cares what I look like.

903
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,625
I'm just gonna undo the hex.

904
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:18,924
I'm not even gonna bother
dressing up.

905
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,890
I'm just gonna open the door,
undo it and slam the door in his face!

906
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,998
Hey. I just happened to be in the
neighborhood with these roses...

907
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,012
..and a Cat Stevens CD...

908
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,497
..and this bracelet...

909
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:46,062
..and I thought I'd stop by.

910
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,827
-You're sweating.
-Like a pig.

911
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,263
Oh, how divine.

912
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,840
You look stunning.

913
00:53:58,202 --> 00:53:59,982
No! Ravishing.

914
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,484
You look "stunnishing.”

915
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,099
Is this your purse?

916
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,214
You're not too cold, are you?

917
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,136
-No.
-You're not too warm?

918
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:15,628
Okay.

919
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,300
-Are we going somewhere?
-Dinner.

920
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,189
Here. Here you go.

921
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:25,067
l wanna know everything.

922
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:28,976
You talk, okay?
I'm just gonna listen.

923
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,973
Shed your radiance
and I'll just soak it up like a plant.

924
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:35,044
Start in kindergarten.

925
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,710
I didn't go to kindergarten.
l was homeschooled.

926
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,198
You were homeschooled? So was I.

927
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,319
How amazing. That's freaky.

928
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:45,902
I'm getting chills.

929
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,946
Yeah, that is kind of amazing.

930
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:49,662
My parents were hippies.
Were yours?

931
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,240
-No.
-That's so weird!

932
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:55,563
My parents were hippies,
and yours weren't. What are the odds?

933
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,706
But we did have incense
and candles.

934
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:59,355
-So did we.
-You did?

935
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,156
To this day,
incense makes me puke.

936
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:02,582
Yes, me too!

937
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,390
-Amazing!
-Wow.

938
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:05,968
I brought duck.

939
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:08,017
Il love duck.

940
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,478
So do I. How amazing is that?

941
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:12,250
Well, most people love duck.

942
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,098
You know what? No, they don't.

943
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,258
Wait. l wrote you a song.

944
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:18,671
No one's ever written me a song.

945
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,599
Well, I did.

946
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,510
Hey, pretty lady

947
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,934
Come back here with my heart

948
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:35,475
Hey, pretty lady

949
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:39,013
Are you a dream made real?

950
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:43,267
My soul, you have healed

951
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,761
Make me a better man

952
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:51,196
! wanna set up residence

953
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:55,072
In your promised land

954
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,439
Okay, and this is
the power ballad guitar solo.

955
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:05,957
Promised land!

956
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:07,573
Now you sing the chorus.

957
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,589
Promised land

958
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,676
Drum solo.

959
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:17,026
Promised land!

960
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:18,601
Leg kick.

961
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,113
Okay, I'm gonna break the guitar.

962
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,035
Promised land!

963
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,538
Promised land!

964
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,643
We're about to kiss, aren't we?

965
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,522
l thought so, but thanks for ruining
the moment, Miss Narrator.

966
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:49,674
Oh, my ruby jewel.

967
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,512
-What?
-My chocolate-covered strawberry.

968
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,702
I wanna bask in our love...

969
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,728
. like a house cat lying in the sun.

970
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,856
Jack, Jack, Jack.
Stop. Stop. I forgot.

971
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,025
Oh, I let myself forget.

972
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,444
It was so nice,
I couldn't help myself, and....

973
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:11,504
Oh, Jack!

974
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,435
This is sad. This is.... No.

975
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,571
Let's make love in a hot-air balloon.

976
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,060
Let's make love in a candy factory.

977
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:21,507
Let's make love in a petting zoo.

978
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:23,132
I have to undo this, I do.

979
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:26,023
Let's make love at SeaWorld,
on the back of a killer whale.

980
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,683
Because it doesn't mean anything
unless it's real.

981
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,576
What witches wish
No mortal needs

982
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:45,065
Let time repent
And unsow its seeds

983
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:49,881
And now, I speak the ancient word
of redemption and regret:

984
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,274
Rewind.

985
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,982
So you leave the nose-wiggling
to the witch.

986
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,899
-But you do it so well.
-1 did coach her, though.

987
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:34,629
Can we get a close-up
on the nose?

988
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:36,252
I'd rather not.

989
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,087
Which camera?

990
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,756
Hello, Nina.

991
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,235
I just knew it was you, that's all.

992
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:48,148
Yes, he is. He is a giant
male reproductive organ.

993
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,479
We don't need a plan, I already know
what I'm gonna do.

994
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,134
I'm gonna speak to him
about his behavior.

995
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:58,817
I'm gonna talk to him sensibly and
directly, and I know he will change.

996
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,149
You'll see. Bye.

997
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,565
Butt out, Samantha,
I know what I'm doing.

998
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:12,845
I mean it.

999
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,442
Jack, Jack, bo-back

1000
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:18,397
Bonana-fana fo-fack

1001
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:20,429
Fee-fi-bo-back

1002
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:21,844
Jack

1003
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,060
Guys, make me 20 cappuccinos.
Bring me the best one.

1004
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,547
Hey, J-Bone. Hey, buddy.

1005
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,135
The test scores are in.

1006
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:32,397
How'd I do? Ninety?
Hundred? One-twenty.

1007
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:33,946
-One-forty!
-Good ballpark.

1008
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,901
What did it say?
I got it. I got it right here.

1009
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:38,821
Thirty-two.

1010
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,402
I got a 32?

1011
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,414
ls that for real?

1012
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,303
The dog scored higher than I did.

1013
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,398
Well, it's not you, Jack, it's Darrin.

1014
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:50,791
"That Jack Wyatt is a real tool.
We hate him.

1015
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,611
We mean the actor,
not the character."

1016
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,162
Get a grip.

1017
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:00,669
Hug me.

1018
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,321
Come here.

1019
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:08,408
I'm gonna be doing dinner theater
in Boca Raton.

1020
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:11,405
They hate the show,
the whole show.

1021
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,295
They hate everyone on it.

1022
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,870
-Yeah, everybody.
-They did. Yep.

1023
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:16,792
Isabel must've gotten savaged.

1024
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,761
She got a 997!

1025
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,320
Ninety-nine? Is this for real?

1026
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,015
Is that a joke?

1027
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,253
She didn't say anything!

1028
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:27,618
How is it that someone
who doesn't say anything...

1029
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:30,078
..scores higher than someone
who had all the lines?

1030
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:31,854
Oh, my....

1031
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:34,091
Did anyone anticipate this
as a possibility?

1032
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:35,901
Hindsight's 20(20.

1033
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:38,643
-Good morning, everyone.
-And they think I'm a tool?!

1034
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,182
l haven't been called a tool
since Il was 15!

1035
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,127
Thank you, guys! Thank you!

1036
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,801
You know what?
No one ever liked Darrin! No one!

1037
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,341
Why did we ever think
that was gonna change?

1038
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,860
Il have something to say.

1039
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:55,341
This is unbelievable! A 32?

1040
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:57,942
That's for real?
A three in front of a two?

1041
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,408
Oh, my God!

1042
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:01,063
Wait, l have something to say.

1043
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,354
A 32 and she got 997!

1044
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:04,813
Were they high?!

1045
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,208
Were the people
in the test group high?

1046
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:09,751
Did we drug test them?

1047
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:13,263
Were they just sitting in the studio,
smoking crack, saying:

1048
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:17,970
"Let's give her a 99 and him a 32.
By the way, I'm high on crack"?!

1049
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,668
I have something to say!

1050
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,131
What?!

1051
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:23,495
You're a jerk.

1052
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,327
What did you just say?

1053
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,932
l said, you're a jerk!

1054
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:33,975
Everything is about you.

1055
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,611
You are selfish.
And you are self-centered.

1056
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:41,121
And you lied to me, you said you
needed me. You don't need anyone!

1057
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,308
Listen, sweetie, why don't you go to
your trailer and take a Midol?

1058
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:46,703
Hey! You be quiet,
or I'll give you a tail!

1059
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:49,788
-Just calm down.
-You sit down!

1060
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,801
Sit down!

1061
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:58,205
This show is supposed to be
about a marriage.

1062
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:03,195
Areal marriage, with real problems,
like what color to paint the kitchen...

1063
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:06,647
..or, L don't know, other problems,
l can't even think of them now.

1064
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,150
But the only problems you care about
are your own!

1065
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:12,692
No wonder the audience
doesn't like this show!

1066
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,280
A witch marries a mortal.

1067
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,945
Who in their right mind
would want to marry you?

1068
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:20,075
-Hey!
-Excuse me. That's it. You're fired.

1069
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:23,824
Doesn't matter. I quit!

1070
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,091
Yeah! So...

1071
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:29,488
.. you better call my agent.

1072
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:30,926
You don't have an agent.

1073
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:33,508
Then call my cable man!

1074
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,764
Sorry. So...

1075
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:47,826
You all right?

1076
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,031
No one's talked to me like that
in 20 years.

1077
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:52,457
Once a week a woman
talks to me like that.

1078
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,622
She just stripped me bare
and stuck the knife in.

1079
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,012
Let's go to The Peninsula
and get some oysters.

1080
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,671
You know what I think?

1081
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:03,290
-Hey. The woman needs a part.
-I'm sorry?

1082
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:06,253
I mean, if you got Sammy Sosa,
you don't bench him.

1083
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,770
If you got Gorbachev in the ballet,
you let him dance the big number.

1084
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,963
I don't think Gorbachev
was a dancer.

1085
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,395
Yes, he was, Richie,
he absolutely was. Look it up.

1086
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:23,398
Isabel! Hey!

1087
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,093
Hey, Isabel!

1088
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:27,045
Wait, wait, wait, don't go!

1089
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:28,547
Isabel!

1090
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:31,942
Please don't go. Please don't go.
That was incredible.

1091
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,531
-What?
-Just now. That.

1092
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,288
I mean, you yelled at me.
You were up-front, and honest...

1093
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:41,255
..and you called me out
on all my crap.

1094
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,451
It was just great.

1095
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:45,433
Oh, God, I'm hyperventilating.

1096
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,222
I've never done anything like this.

1097
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:50,220
It was very hard,
but secretly quite thrilling.

1098
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,330
Even my ex-wife, she never yelled.
She just locked me out.

1099
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,578
In my family,
we usually just disappear.

1100
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:01,061
No, no, don't disappear, Isabel.
One more show.

1101
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:02,778
One more show.

1102
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,916
-I don't think so.
-No, one more taping. Please?

1103
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:10,396
It's just that I'm feeling that--
I'm feeling like maybe....

1104
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:13,774
-I'm sorry.
-What'd you say?

1105
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:18,142
I'm sorry for how I've been.
I'm sorry.

1106
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,708
You're sweating again.

1107
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,313
I know, just...

1108
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:23,208
I just-- Look, one more.

1109
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,232
I love it when you sweat.

1110
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,968
One more! Just one more.

1111
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:31,865
And the second I'm being a jerk,
you can yell, "Hey! He's being a jerk!"

1112
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:34,312
And we'll shut the whole thing down,
I promise.

1113
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:36,288
We'll burn down the sets...

1114
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:39,223
..and sell the costumes,
and give the money to little children.

1115
01:04:39,743 --> 01:04:41,353
I mean, that's one
possible scenario.

1116
01:04:42,112 --> 01:04:43,922
You want me to say
"He's being a jerk"?

1117
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:45,867
Yeah. Or you can yell, 1 mean...

1118
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,828
He's being a jerk!

1119
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,525
He's being a jerk!

1120
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:52,247
Yes.

1121
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:58,589
I can't just walk back in there now.

1122
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:01,649
Once you show up on a golf cart,
believe me, all is forgiven.

1123
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,538
I've done it a lot of times.

1124
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:06,387
But I was fired.
Oh, no. That's right, I quit.

1125
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,122
Yeah. Here, let me carry your plant.

1126
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:20,482
Honey, your mother's here.

1127
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,049
Are you two getting along?

1128
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:23,815
Not exactly.

1129
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,841
-Like this?
-You're doing great.

1130
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,160
Really, really great. One more time.

1131
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:51,825
So it says here that marriage
can lead to a loss of passion.

1132
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:56,109
It's true.
feel empty and bored already.

1133
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,773
-Oh, great. It's you.
-Mother!

1134
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,279
Il see you two are
actually getting along?

1135
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:11,248
Endora, you rancid fruit bag,
get out of my room.

1136
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:14,168
-Darrin!
-And my daughter is happy?

1137
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:18,390
That is the cruelest twist of all.

1138
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:26,395
lam happy, Darrin.
Real, honest, no-spells happy.

1139
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,549
And cut!

1140
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,709
Actors, cut.

1141
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,248
Really, cut now.

1142
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:45,200
You were great today.
Just absolutely amazing.

1143
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,901
You were great today.
Just absolutely amazing.

1144
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,053
I don't think I've ever had
so much fun.

1145
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,022
Acting is fun.

1146
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,921
That is a profoundly true thing.

1147
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:57,906
Would you like a water chestnut?

1148
01:06:58,248 --> 01:07:00,418
I'd love a water chestnut.

1149
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,257
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know...

1150
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,009
.. Starting with...

1151
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:13,725
..the eye thing.

1152
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:16,557
The famous crazy-eye thing
of mine.

1153
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,265
Okay?

1154
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:24,718
This almost won me
a Golden Globe.

1155
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,578
Almost.

1156
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,533
-ls that it?
-That's good.

1157
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,030
Oh, that's even better.

1158
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:35,721
This is the "I just realized things
are worse than they seem" thing.

1159
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,099
Also known as "the Yikes Take."

1160
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,690
Yikes!

1161
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:44,189
Wow.

1162
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:46,328
Yikes!

1163
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:48,347
-That was terrible.
-It's okay.

1164
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:51,275
-No, I was terrible.
- don't think mine was good, either.

1165
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,205
That's it. I'm out of tricks.

1166
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:56,854
-What about the funny walk you do?
-The funny walk?

1167
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,770
-You don't wanna see the walk.
-l do.

1168
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:00,221
Funny walk is embarrassing.

1169
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:01,813
I'd like to see it.

1170
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:03,405
Yeah?

1171
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,866
Okay. Let's go to our place.

1172
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,893
Magic hour.

1173
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:20,935
-ls that it?
-That's great.

1174
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:23,948
It's much harder than it looks.

1175
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:48,778
Five, six, seven, eight.

1176
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,009
-Move back!
-Hey!

1177
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:05,748
Something magical happened
all by itself.

1178
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,316
Table read in 10 minutes!

1179
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,788
Okay, close it up!

1180
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:16,056
-Good morning, everyone.
-Morning, Jack.

1181
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,695
Look, Jack, I just need to talk to you
about a couple of these things.

1182
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,181
Number one,
we're thinking about moving...

1183
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,280
.. the whole kitchen scene.
Just-- It's such--

1184
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:28,904
It's a funny scene.

1185
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,065
It's really funny.
We'd like to get it in a little earlier.

1186
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:35,788
So probably what we're gonna do is
switch it with the office.

1187
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:40,994
But we're gonna drop that
to a little later on in the show.

1188
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,412
Dude. Dudes, are you watching Jack
throw the vibe to Isabel right now?

1189
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:48,563
How are you?

1190
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:53,504
I'm great.

1191
01:10:58,654 --> 01:10:59,964
That's for you.

1192
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:01,663
Thank you.

1193
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,889
-Call me.
-That's fantastic.

1194
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:07,852
Stop.

1195
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:09,217
Fine.

1196
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:11,522
Yeah. I mean,
I can find something for him.

1197
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:15,188
I'll put him in a little part with maybe
no lines or anything like that.

1198
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:18,115
What is going on
between you and Jack?

1199
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,008
Nothing is going on.

1200
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,126
We had a date and we kissed...

1201
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:24,855
..and now we just wanna spend
all of our time together.

1202
01:11:25,348 --> 01:11:27,978
That is the very definition
of something going on.

1203
01:11:28,518 --> 01:11:32,388
And you know what?
I didn't use any tricks. l am trick-free.

1204
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:35,049
Oh, my God, it's her.

1205
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:37,529
-Who?
-Jack's wife.

1206
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,230
l saw a picture of her in InStyle
when she was the fashion "don't."

1207
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:43,704
Excuse me. I'm looking for Jack.

1208
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,973
You must be Samantha.

1209
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:47,892
You look just like the old one.

1210
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,451
Thank you so much.

1211
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,510
Oh, excuse me.

1212
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,616
Love the nose.

1213
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,244
Good work.

1214
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:00,316
There he is. There's my guy.

1215
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:02,467
I've missed him so much.

1216
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:07,302
Let's just say the "Do Not Disturb" sign
will be on the doorknob tonight.

1217
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:13,888
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, God!

1218
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:16,813
Help me lift it. Help me lift it.
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

1219
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,763
That was a little harsh.

1220
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,310
I've missed him so much.

1221
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:29,852
Let's just say the "Do Not Disturb" sign
will be on the doorknob tonight.

1222
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,871
-Sheila.
-Hi, baby.

1223
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,611
What are you doing here?

1224
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:39,533
You want my car?
My grandmother's brooch.

1225
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:42,196
Oh! You want more money.

1226
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,798
Ding-ding-ding! Correct answer.

1227
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:46,768
No.

1228
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,480
-l want you back.
-What about Captain Underpants?

1229
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,160
I'm through with him.
Il love you, Jack.

1230
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,700
Oh, wait, wait, I get it. You heard
that the show's getting picked up.

1231
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:00,574
I heard it's gonna be a hit.

1232
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:02,893
But so what?

1233
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:06,226
I want you. I want my husband.

1234
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,688
You know, a week ago
I would've fallen for that.

1235
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,850
But now there's someone else.

1236
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:18,842
Someone who's incapable of guile.

1237
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:20,358
What's guile?

1238
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:22,711
I'm not gonna do it.

1239
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:24,342
I think it means tricks.

1240
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:29,201
-l love you, baby.
-No, I'm not.

1241
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:33,598
Maybe I will.

1242
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,820
-What the heck is going on?!
-Joey.

1243
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,660
This place is spooked. I quit.

1244
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:48,676
Joey. Joey, come back here.

1245
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:51,108
Get me a mirror! Jack!

1246
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:54,094
-Jack!
-Are you okay?

1247
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:56,204
Am I okay?!

1248
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:59,144
And one more time.

1249
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:05,106
I'm fine. And I'm signing
the divorce papers right now.

1250
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:07,849
You are?

1251
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:10,715
Maybe two.

1252
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,818
And I'm moving out of the house
this afternoon.

1253
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:17,478
Where are you going?

1254
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:20,090
Reykjavik.

1255
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:22,927
-Where is it?
-Iceland.

1256
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:25,955
I love ice.

1257
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:30,046
Goodbye, everyone!
I'm off to Reykjavik!

1258
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,548
Oh, my God.

1259
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:35,239
Everyone, did you just see that?

1260
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:38,034
She's gonna sign the papers!
This is incredible.

1261
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:39,007
-lsabel.
-Party at my house!

1262
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:40,788
-lsabel.
-Party at my house!

1263
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,670
You're out of control.

1264
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:12,525
Every time I think I have things
nailed down, I just lose it.

1265
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:16,362
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.
It's gonna be okay.

1266
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:19,419
Oh, whoa. Who is that?

1267
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,225
No, Maria. No.

1268
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:22,894
Too late.

1269
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:25,353
Second of all, like--

1270
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,958
Everyone, can I have your attention,
please? I just wanna say a few words.

1271
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:34,721
Randall, can we deal with this?
Thank you.

1272
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:40,246
Where do I start? What a night.
Is everyone having fun? Yeah?

1273
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:45,530
Great. I'm so grateful
for so many things tonight.

1274
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:51,133
The show, all of you amazing
and talented people...

1275
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:54,094
..and especially Isabel.

1276
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:57,748
To a woman who'd never trick me
into thinking...

1277
01:15:58,187 --> 01:15:59,967
..she was something she wasn't.

1278
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:04,161
From now on,
everyone tells the truth. Okay?

1279
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,790
Except if 1 don't look good,
say I do anyway.

1280
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:15,001
Isabel, you are a beautiful person.

1281
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:16,714
And that's the truth.

1282
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,776
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

1283
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,191
Have a great time.

1284
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:21,559
Cheers.

1285
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:23,457
Don't break anything, okay?

1286
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:25,596
-We won't, Jack.
-Thank you.

1287
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,265
l hope that touching speech...

1288
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,796
.. hasn't made you think
that you should tell the truth.

1289
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,812
-I'm going to.
-Oh, don't be silly.

1290
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:45,268
And he's gonna accept me. He's got to.
You can't live with a secret like that.

1291
01:16:45,868 --> 01:16:48,418
Of course you can.
For thousands of years.

1292
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:52,335
Don't do it. Big mistake. Won't work.

1293
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,684
Well, hello there.
Now, don't tell me....

1294
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:57,732
Coconut shrimps.

1295
01:16:58,114 --> 01:16:59,374
Oh, yes. Would you like one?

1296
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,005
Yes. Thank you.

1297
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,870
Do you know, you're quite fetching.

1298
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:06,574
And I'm Nigel Bigelow.

1299
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:12,549
Yes. I will sleep with you because
l have a thing for father figures.

1300
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,318
Well, that's great, then.

1301
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,060
But in the morning, I will not get
90 percent of your jokes...

1302
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:21,196
..and I'll go on and on about
opening an aerobics center in Agoura.

1303
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,132
Are you looking for me?

1304
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:30,001
Missing you, actually.

1305
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:32,919
-How strange.
-Not really.

1306
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:50,389
I'm just gonna say it like it's
a completely matter-of-fact thing.

1307
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,900
-Guess what.
-What?

1308
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,022
I'm a witch.

1309
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:58,231
-Guess what.
-What?

1310
01:17:58,741 --> 01:18:00,381
I'm a Clippers fan.

1311
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,738
Yeah, it's not like it's a big deal.

1312
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:08,991
I'm not a bad witch, and we're getting
it out there and telling the truth, right?

1313
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,965
Right. And I'm not just a fan.

1314
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:14,504
I made the mistake of buying
courtside seats.

1315
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:18,907
No, no, no, really. Jack. Jack, l am.
I, Isabel Bigelow, I'm a witch.

1316
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,798
Okay, great. So you're a witch.

1317
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,904
Come on, let's make out
in the hall closet.

1318
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,110
-Jack.
-Okay, okay, I'll play along.

1319
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,755
Like it's an improv. Prove it.

1320
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:33,399
So I just said, "Listen, you guys,
l believe Cher has another hit in her."

1321
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:35,442
-Really?
-Yeah.

1322
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:38,075
Wow, fantastic trick.

1323
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:39,624
Not a trick.

1324
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:43,947
Whoa! How'd you do that?

1325
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,317
To the most powerful witch ever.

1326
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,603
Can you make an umbrella appear
in this drink?

1327
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,134
-l can.
-Really?

1328
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:53,741
That's amazing.

1329
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:56,853
I had no idea you were
an amateur magician.

1330
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:01,233
Hey. Wait. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, I'm talking to you.

1331
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:04,054
Hey, Isabel. I'm--

1332
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:09,044
Jack, listen to me, ! was born a witch,
my parents are witches, I'm a witch.

1333
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,175
-A real witch.
-That's right, Isabel.

1334
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:13,246
-You go, girl.
-lsabel, you tell him.

1335
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:16,983
That is cool. That's great.

1336
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,929
You are very frustrating.

1337
01:19:21,457 --> 01:19:23,857
Do you have some Daniel Day-Lewis
thing happening here?

1338
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,188
How's it going?

1339
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:28,899
I'm leaving.

1340
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:33,804
Thank you.

1341
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,423
Hey there. I have hepatitis C.

1342
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:46,337
Isabel? Isabel.

1343
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:50,832
Isabel, what's going on?
Come back to the party.

1344
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,210
What are you--?
Where are you going? What--?

1345
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:57,134
Wow. That's really cool.
Did Props make that?

1346
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,779
-l keep trying to tell you--
-Can I get your car, miss?

1347
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:02,282
She doesn't need her car,
she has her broomstick.

1348
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:04,571
-You think I'm nuts, don't you?
-Of course not.

1349
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,160
I know plenty of women who
carry around collapsible broomsticks.

1350
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:11,351
-I'll get the car.
-It won't be there, I sent it home.

1351
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:13,804
This looks so real.
Il can't even see the buttons.

1352
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:15,553
It is real.

1353
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:17,328
Flies too.

1354
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:18,906
Oh, I'd love to see that.

1355
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:20,588
-Hang on.
-What?

1356
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:29,547
Put me down!

1357
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:35,403
I kept trying to tell you.

1358
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:39,991
It's no big deal, Jack.

1359
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,236
-It's no big deal.
-This is a huge deal!

1360
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,661
We can work this out.
It's just who I happen to be.

1361
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:46,247
-Get away from me.
-What?

1362
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:48,005
You tricked me!
You put spells on me!

1363
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:50,897
Well, only a few, yes, I did.
But I took most of them off.

1364
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:52,963
Help! Someone help!

1365
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:57,157
Jack. I thought this would be okay.

1366
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:58,759
How would it be okay?!

1367
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:00,608
Because it's me. It's still me.

1368
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:03,709
-I'm a little freaked out now.
-l know, but I can't change what I am.

1369
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:06,309
-Are you crazy? Are you even human?
-Jack!

1370
01:21:06,762 --> 01:21:07,962
-Am I gonna get pregnant?
-What?

1371
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:09,786
Because I can't get pregnant
right now!

1372
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:11,805
How does this work?
Will l get webbed feet?

1373
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,251
You're hurting my feelings.

1374
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:14,909
Shoo! Shoo!

1375
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,320
-Shoo?
-Shoo!

1376
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:18,808
-Now you're making me angry!
-Go! Scat!

1377
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:20,474
-You want me to leave?
-Yes!

1378
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:21,919
-Fine!
-Fine!

1379
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:23,353
-Fine!
-Fine!

1380
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:24,669
Goodbye, Jack.

1381
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,441
You jerk!

1382
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,302
Sorry, Mr. Wyatt, I can't find her car.

1383
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:10,394
So she quit. So what?

1384
01:22:10,826 --> 01:22:11,906
How's Jack taking all this?

1385
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,977
Let me tell you guys something.
Jack Wyatt's like a jet fighter pilot.

1386
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:18,431
Nothing rattles him.
I'm sure he's just at the gym.

1387
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:21,718
Hey, okay. Stop holding my arm.

1388
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,987
Found him picking up pennies
out of a shopping-mall water fountain.

1389
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:28,441
Thank you so much, officer.
How much do I tip you for that?

1390
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,911
-You don't tip me.
-Hey, Jack.

1391
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:32,396
-Hey, all.
-Hey, big guy.

1392
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,024
-How's it going?
-What's up, Jack?

1393
01:22:34,383 --> 01:22:35,313
-You all right?
-Boy.

1394
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,487
Yeah, I'm all right.
I've never been better. Come on.

1395
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,074
What's the bottle of ketchup for?

1396
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:42,986
-Come again?
-The....

1397
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:47,383
Oh. Forgot to leave it
at this diner in Mexico.

1398
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,630
Don't freak out on us, Jack.

1399
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:52,268
-You're fired.
-Classic.

1400
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:54,545
-Anyone have a light?
-Yo.

1401
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,010
-l do.
-Right here, pal.

1402
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58,022
Everybody. Let's just calm down.

1403
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:02,351
We've only shot two episodes.
We've got 10 weeks before we air.

1404
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,731
-So we recast. Piece of cake.
-Next.

1405
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,741
I don't know. It'll be hard to find
somebody with those scores.

1406
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:10,421
It's good scores, good scores.

1407
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,302
-She's a witch.
-That's more like it.

1408
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:14,588
You just keep
telling yourself that, man.

1409
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:15,923
I'm fine, really.

1410
01:23:16,225 --> 01:23:19,415
I mean, last night I ate three burritos
and smashed every dish in my house.

1411
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:23,799
Isabel. You can't let this guy
ruin your life.

1412
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:25,889
They're recasting your role.

1413
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:28,258
They're recasting my role already?

1414
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:31,564
-Well, you quit.
-Tough town.

1415
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,477
-l mean, like, what happened?
-He said I wasn't human.

1416
01:23:34,977 --> 01:23:38,317
And he waved a tree branch
at me. Like:

1417
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:40,648
There must be a solution.

1418
01:23:40,983 --> 01:23:42,353
No, there isn't.

1419
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:47,165
We're at the Coffee Bean
and there is no solution.

1420
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,520
Il love you, Jack!

1421
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:51,562
Jack, I dreamt about you last night!

1422
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,660
Jack, remember me? Amber?

1423
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:58,976
Oh, my stars.

1424
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:02,264
Darrin's coming home
and I haven't even made dinner.

1425
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:09,640
What?

1426
01:24:09,945 --> 01:24:11,554
You're great. You want anything?

1427
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,888
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much, that was--

1428
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:16,457
Thank you.

1429
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,590
Boo! Trick or treat!

1430
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:47,808
You guys look great.

1431
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:50,654
Happy Halloween.

1432
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:52,603
Mommy!

1433
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:56,319
I'm sorry I don't have any candy.

1434
01:25:08,337 --> 01:25:10,587
Hi, everyone, and welcome
once again to Jeopardy!

1435
01:25:11,073 --> 01:25:13,263
Another exciting half-hour
of answers and questions...

1436
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:16,732
...With these categories
in our first round of play.

1437
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:22,635
First off, "Cheese."

1438
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:27,018
Next, "Things That End In '-Zing.""

1439
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,947
! have no idea where we are.

1440
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:35,264
! mean, I literally could not find
Vietnam on a map.

1441
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:37,231
And now we're about to die here?

1442
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,410
! think it's next to Argentina.

1443
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:43,146
Well, at least nobody shot at us yet.

1444
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:47,835
Yikes! That's not good.

1445
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:49,230
"Yikes."

1446
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,790
! think the lions are here, Atticus.

1447
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:10,429
And there's Willy,
doing his famous Willy Walk.

1448
01:26:26,982 --> 01:26:28,682
Sherpa!

1449
01:26:34,056 --> 01:26:35,726
We've got to go.

1450
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:42,831
Don't look at me like that.
It's the only solution.

1451
01:26:49,438 --> 01:26:53,308
Isabel, would you please join me
in the dining alcove? Thank you.

1452
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:56,924
Daddy?

1453
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,055
Something very odd is happening.

1454
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:03,011
It's not odd, it's what you predicted.
I'm leaving.

1455
01:27:03,652 --> 01:27:05,322
Il can't stop thinking about Iris.

1456
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,590
You were right. 1 don't belong here.

1457
01:27:08,023 --> 01:27:12,003
I find myself uninterested in any other
woman. Now, that's not natural.

1458
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15,338
-Do you think there's a chance that....
-What?

1459
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:17,294
That she might be a witch?

1460
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:18,716
Don't be silly.

1461
01:27:19,034 --> 01:27:20,763
And she put a spell on me?

1462
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:22,189
Please.

1463
01:27:22,504 --> 01:27:26,604
Why not? You're a witch. I'm a witch.
She could be a witch.

1464
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:28,741
I guess she could.

1465
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,231
What else could it be?

1466
01:27:32,114 --> 01:27:33,424
Love.

1467
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:43,779
Isn't there a spell that can
make you stop crying?

1468
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:45,969
No, darling, there isn't.

1469
01:27:46,862 --> 01:27:50,112
He's idiotic, and yet I find him
completely charming.

1470
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:52,812
It's been like that
since the beginning.

1471
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:56,458
Only now, I also hate him.

1472
01:27:57,873 --> 01:27:59,133
Love.

1473
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,891
Daddy, what am I gonna do?

1474
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:06,280
Go home.

1475
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,175
Where's that?

1476
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,487
Wherever you've been the happiest.

1477
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,898
Perhaps I'll go to Aruba.

1478
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:16,601
-Aruba?
-But then again, perhaps I won't.

1479
01:28:25,534 --> 01:28:27,023
! don't know if I'm loving my haircut.

1480
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:30,122
Well, Conan, I can't believe
you're bringing this up.

1481
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:34,241
No. No. No, no, no. I'm not gonna
tell that story. There's no way.

1482
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:37,250
Okay, okay, if you insist.

1483
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:42,696
It was last June, and I actually cast
this witch as a witch...

1484
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,655
..and now brooms make me cry.

1485
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:49,551
I can't sleep, and I don't know
what's real or what's the TV show.

1486
01:28:50,192 --> 01:28:51,422
Hi-de-ho!

1487
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,030
Look what the cat dragged in.
Somebody is retaining water.

1488
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:58,030
Uncle Arthur. It's you.

1489
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,673
Oh, no, you're gonna crack the mirror,
aren't you?

1490
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:02,596
You watch too much television.

1491
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:05,111
-l know you'll do it. You always do.
-Don't be silly.

1492
01:29:05,574 --> 01:29:08,094
Come closer. Do I have something
in my teeth right there?

1493
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:09,540
-Where?
-Look!

1494
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,130
That was fun!

1495
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:19,629
Where's Sammy?
Where's my Sammy?

1496
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:22,168
She quit. Now, leave me alone.

1497
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:23,931
But she was the one.

1498
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:27,129
I know, I know.
I can't stop thinking about her.

1499
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,916
-But she's a witch.
-Yes, and?

1500
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:32,328
-Jack, you're on!
-Oh, no, I'm on.

1501
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:33,787
Go get them, tiger!

1502
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:35,652
--revival of the hit series Bewitched.

1503
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:39,057
You know him from such films
as Last Year in Katmandu...

1504
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:41,811
..An Onion For Willy and Atticus Rex.

1505
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:44,737
Please welcome our good pal,
Jack Wyatt!

1506
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:01,378
Oh, my God.

1507
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:02,925
It was a dream.

1508
01:30:03,832 --> 01:30:05,062
Thank God.

1509
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:07,451
No such luck, Jackie boy.

1510
01:30:08,937 --> 01:30:10,077
Stay back!

1511
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:14,094
Okay, okay. You are not real.
You're from the TV show.

1512
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:16,266
You have blond highlights...

1513
01:30:16,645 --> 01:30:18,545
..and had to wear a girdle
on your last movie.

1514
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,179
Who's calling who not real?

1515
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,765
Okay, I do not believe this.
lam not--

1516
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,271
You are....

1517
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:27,390
-You are real.
-Temporarily.

1518
01:30:27,856 --> 01:30:31,226
Oh, Uncle Arthur.
You're my favorite character.

1519
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,969
I know.

1520
01:30:33,295 --> 01:30:34,665
What the hell's going on?

1521
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:37,400
You need help.
Your love life's a mess, buddy boy.

1522
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,509
I know, I'm miserable.

1523
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:43,800
So am I. l have been in reruns
for 32 years.

1524
01:30:44,506 --> 01:30:47,966
I need the sizzle of prime time!
I need to get this show back on the air.

1525
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:51,219
Okay, this is very complicated
and unsettling, all right?

1526
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:53,236
I don't think I understand.

1527
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,785
Oh. All right.

1528
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:58,336
Do you want the short version
or the long version?

1529
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:01,733
Keep in mind that the long version
is in Aramaic.

1530
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,280
The short version.

1531
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:06,081
You got involved with a witch,
and when you do that...

1532
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:08,844
.. weird stuff happens.

1533
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:12,485
-That's it?
-Do I have to explain everything?

1534
01:31:13,001 --> 01:31:15,431
Okay, here's the deal. I'm not real.

1535
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:19,142
-lris is a witch.
-lris is a witch?

1536
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:21,454
Don't dwell. And, in my opinion...

1537
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,926
-... that manager of yours, Richie...
-What?

1538
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:25,839
isn't even human.

1539
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:27,764
-Now, where was I?
-When?

1540
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,899
Before you woke up. Oh, right!
Who wants to be with a witch?

1541
01:31:31,453 --> 01:31:33,323
Crazy crap like this
would always be happening!

1542
01:31:33,755 --> 01:31:34,745
And your point is?

1543
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:37,366
-The point is, you'd never know.
-What?

1544
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:40,639
Whether you were in love with her,
or whether she put a spell on you.

1545
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:44,296
Like when you first spotted her in the
bookstore. Probably her idea, right?

1546
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,069
No, that was my idea.

1547
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:50,155
-Oh, that's terrible.
-l know, I just love to blend.

1548
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:54,215
And when you got down on your knees
and you begged her to take the job.

1549
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:55,806
What are you saying?

1550
01:31:56,111 --> 01:31:58,010
She probably planted the words
in your head.

1551
01:31:58,446 --> 01:31:59,646
No way, my words.

1552
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:02,001
Yeah. What about the nose?

1553
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,940
Hello? Is that even really her nose?

1554
01:32:05,453 --> 01:32:07,003
Of course it's her real nose.

1555
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:11,199
Look. Is all's I'm saying is,
who wants to be with a witch?

1556
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:35,886
Ido.

1557
01:32:37,519 --> 01:32:38,509
She's going home.

1558
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:41,690
And once a witch returns home,
she can't come back for 100 years.

1559
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:44,027
She can't leave.

1560
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:47,432
I need her. I want her. I want Isabel.

1561
01:32:47,996 --> 01:32:49,746
Well, come on, let's go get her.

1562
01:32:50,165 --> 01:32:52,505
Here we go! Let's go!
Let's go get her!

1563
01:32:53,001 --> 01:32:56,071
Follow me! Follow me, here we go!
Come on, here we go!

1564
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,402
We'd better hurry.
She's leaving right this minute.

1565
01:33:06,848 --> 01:33:08,048
We've gotta stop her.

1566
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:10,130
Hey, wait.
You can't drive, remember?

1567
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:13,008
Remember that episode where
you pulled out and almost crashed?

1568
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:15,481
Yes, well, that wasn't exactly me.

1569
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,854
I, personally, am a great driver.

1570
01:33:20,028 --> 01:33:21,548
Whoopsie doodle!

1571
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:28,228
Take it easy!

1572
01:33:29,337 --> 01:33:30,627
Can you slow down just a tad?

1573
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:32,871
Is it "Porsche" or is it "Porscha"?

1574
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:36,028
Who cares? Watch the road, please.
We've gotta get Isabel!

1575
01:33:36,578 --> 01:33:39,298
Oh, all right, party pooper.
Let me drive!

1576
01:33:40,748 --> 01:33:42,357
-There she is!
-Where?

1577
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,120
Oh, no, she's flying away!

1578
01:33:44,486 --> 01:33:46,156
Pedal to the metal, buddy boy!

1579
01:33:48,423 --> 01:33:49,503
Watch it!

1580
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:54,583
Oh, I'm about to be killed
by a fictional character.

1581
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:56,646
Yes, you are.

1582
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:06,085
-We're here.
-Here. Where?

1583
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:08,548
Where is she?

1584
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:12,297
Our place. She's at our place.

1585
01:34:14,716 --> 01:34:16,886
Thank you.
Thank you, Uncle Arthur.

1586
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:20,473
Run to her, you idiot!

1587
01:34:47,282 --> 01:34:48,152
Isabel.

1588
01:34:52,754 --> 01:34:55,274
Oh, my God, you're here.

1589
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:56,930
I'm so happy you're here.

1590
01:34:57,592 --> 01:34:59,842
-I'm leaving.
-No, no, no, you can't.

1591
01:35:00,328 --> 01:35:01,998
You'll be gone forever if you leave.

1592
01:35:02,397 --> 01:35:04,977
You'll be gone 100 years without
being able to come back.

1593
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,840
That's ridiculous.
Who told you that?

1594
01:35:08,336 --> 01:35:09,476
He did.

1595
01:35:14,742 --> 01:35:17,432
Well, what are you doing here
if you're leaving?

1596
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:21,688
l was going home.

1597
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:24,423
But I don't know where that is.

1598
01:35:25,687 --> 01:35:27,267
Home is with me.

1599
01:35:28,356 --> 01:35:30,436
-Don't go. Please.
-But I'm--

1600
01:35:31,526 --> 01:35:32,925
-We'll work it out.
-We can't.

1601
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:34,193
Yes, we can.

1602
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:37,335
I can't be normal,
because I'm a witch.

1603
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:41,849
I can't be a witch,
because I really wanna be normal.

1604
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:45,167
-It's not possible.
-Of course it's possible.

1605
01:35:45,974 --> 01:35:48,374
There's tons of other witches
who've done it.

1606
01:35:49,377 --> 01:35:50,367
Who?

1607
01:35:50,678 --> 01:35:54,548
Well, maybe not tons of other witches,
but at least one.

1608
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:58,678
Samantha.

1609
01:36:00,388 --> 01:36:04,308
Caught between two worlds,
and yet completely happy.

1610
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:07,803
She lived happily ever after, in fact.

1611
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:10,513
Although there's no way to be sure.
She went off the air.

1612
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:12,976
We'll work it out.

1613
01:36:13,735 --> 01:36:15,605
Don't cry, little witch.

1614
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:20,497
l love you, Samantha.

1615
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23,120
Isabel.

1616
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:24,734
I knew that.

1617
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:26,533
I think.

1618
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:28,931
Il love you, Darrin.

1619
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:45,333
It just occurred to me,
you could have any guy...

1620
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,390
..in the whole world.

1621
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:49,999
Oh, but I chose you.

1622
01:36:50,705 --> 01:36:52,815
Honestly, I think you made
a mistake.

1623
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:55,324
If l did, l can always get out of it.

1624
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:03,269
Now we have things to do.

1625
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:06,392
-We have a show to do.
-Yes.

1626
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:09,751
And then, maybe after a while,
we could get married.

1627
01:37:30,044 --> 01:37:31,304
There it is.

1628
01:37:31,646 --> 01:37:32,816
Good brakes.

1629
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:37,346
Abner, come look!
The new neighbors are moving in!

1630
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:39,492
Not now, Gladys, I'm busy.

1631
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:42,839
Yes.

1632
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:46,317
I'm now going to carry you
across the threshold.

1633
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:52,620
Don't you think the front lawn
looks a little bare?

1634
01:37:53,101 --> 01:37:54,181
No, I don't.

1635
01:37:54,502 --> 01:37:56,642
But I think it could use
a little something.

1636
01:37:57,105 --> 01:37:58,915
It's fine the way it is, honey.

1637
01:38:05,747 --> 01:38:08,707
Abner! A tree just appeared
in the front yard!
