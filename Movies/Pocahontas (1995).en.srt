1
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,033
In 1607

2
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,786
We sailed the open sea

3
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,236
For glory, God and gold

4
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,308
And the Virginia Company

5
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,038
For the New World is like heaven

6
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,770
And we'll all be rich and free

7
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,127
Or so we have been told

8
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,339
By the Virginia Company

9
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,705
So we have been told

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,077
By the Virginia Company

11
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,729
For glory, God and gold

12
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,837
And the Virginia Company

13
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,925
- Ready to hoist the cannon?
- Aye!

14
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,537
Hey, look. Is that Smith?

15
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,758
That's him, all right.
The old sea dog.

16
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,911
Captain John Smith?
I've heard amazing stories about him.

17
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,207
Are you coming on this voyage too?

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,139
‘Course he is, you half-wit! You
can't fight Indians without John Smith!

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,020
That's right. I'm not about
to let you boys have all the fun.

20
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,865
On the beaches of Virginny

21
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,558
There's diamonds like debris

22
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,291
There's silver rivers flowin’

23
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,297
Gold, you pick right off a tree

24
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,506
With a nugget for my Winnie

25
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,288
And another one for me

26
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,505
And all the rest'll go

27
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,733
To the Virginia Company

28
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,453
It's glory, God and gold

29
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:47,586
And the Virginia Company

30
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,154
Full anchor release!

31
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,953
Come on, lads! Come on!

32
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,951
Give me a hand, someone!

33
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,273
Watch out!

34
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,551
Faster!
She's taking on more water!

35
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,255
Look out!

36
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,460
John! Get down here!

37
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,773
The cannons are breaking loose!

38
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,682
- Reef the topsails!
- Aye, sir!

39
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,535
Steady on your course!

40
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,246
It's all right, Thomas!
We'll get her tied off.

41
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,829
Say your prayers, lads!

42
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,627
Look out!

43
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,550
Thomas, watch out...!

44
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,679
Help!

45
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,151
Man overboard!

46
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,373
Help!

47
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,414
Stay your course! He's lost!

48
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,643
Help!

49
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,248
- Pull the pin.
- Aye, sir!

50
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:05,578
Smith!

51
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,873
Smith!

52
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,273
Are you crazy?

53
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,280
Hang on, Thomas. I've got you!

54
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,585
Quick... the rope!

55
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,671
Heave!

56
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,521
Come on, lads! Pull!

57
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,222
Pull! Pull!

58
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,011
Put your back into it!

59
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,716
Pull! Pull!

60
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,819
Hang on!

61
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,647
There, my lucky lads!

62
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,316
Well, that was refreshing.

63
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,373
- Well done, Smith.
- Of course...

64
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,413
.. you'd all do the same for me.

65
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,485
- Yes, yes.
- Sure, sure.

66
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,947
- Of course we would! Absolutely!
- We would!

67
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,007
Trouble on deck?

68
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,893
- Governor Ratcliffe!
- Thomas fell overboard, sir.

69
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,333
Thank heavens he's been retrieved.

70
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,642
- Well done, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.

71
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,734
Don't lose heart, men. It won't be long
before we reach the New World,

72
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,281
and remember
what awaits us there...

73
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,019
..freedom...

74
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,637
.. prosperity...

75
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,738
..the adventure of our lives.

76
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,317
You're the finest crew
England has to offer,

77
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,719
and nothing, not wind nor rain,

78
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,352
nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages
shall stand in our way.

79
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,306
Carry on, men!

80
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,340
A stirring oration, sir.

81
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,164
I'm sure the men were
most exhilarated!

82
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:46,741
Let us hope so. I'll need those witless
peasants to dig up my gold, won't I?

83
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,719
This New World's
going to be great, John.

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,705
I'm going
to get a pile of gold...

85
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:58,034
..build me a big house, and if any
Indian tries to stop me, I'll blast him.

86
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,948
Just worry about that fortune
of yours, Thomas.

87
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,534
Leave the savages to me.

88
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,229
Think they'll give us trouble?

89
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,084
Not as much trouble
as Smith'll give them.

90
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,624
We'll kill ourselves an Injun

91
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,413
Or maybe two or three

92
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:17,383
We're stalwart men and bold
of the Virginia Company

93
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,428
What do you suppose
the New World will look like?

94
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,431
All the others, suppose.

95
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,501
I've seen hundreds of New Worlds.

96
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,242
What could possibly
be different about this one?

97
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,495
It's glory, God and gold

98
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,726
It's glory, God and gold

99
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:36,217
And the Virginia Company

100
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,993
Steady as the beating drum

101
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,336
Singing to the cedar flute

102
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,674
Seasons go and seasons come

103
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,796
Bring the corn and bear the fruit

104
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,138
By the waters sweet and clean

105
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,537
Where the mighty sturgeon is

106
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,945
Plant the squash and reap the bean

107
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,835
Alf the earth our Mother gives

108
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,512
O, Great Spirit, hear our song

109
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,832
Help us keep the ancient ways

110
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,694
Keep the sacred fires strong

111
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,207
Walk in balance all our days

112
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,644
Seasons go and seasons come

113
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,119
Steady as the beating drum

114
00:06:55,482 --> 00:07:00,552
Plum to seed to bud to plum

115
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,175
Steady as the beating drum

116
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,784
It's good to be home.

117
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,305
The Massawomecks are defeated!

118
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,384
With the help of our brothers,

119
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,933
our villages are safe again.

120
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,393
Your return has brought
much joy to the village.

121
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,708
Look at all the smiling faces.

122
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:44,501
Yes. But there's
one smiling face I don't see.

123
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,175
Where is my daughter?

124
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,923
You know Pocahontas.

125
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,984
She has her mother's spirit.

126
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,967
She goes wherever
the wind takes her.

127
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,277
Pocahontas!

128
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,144
Your father's back.

129
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,113
Come down here!

130
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,131
He's back, Flit.

131
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,996
Come on, Meeko!

132
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,100
No! Not that... way.

133
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,811
Show off.

134
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,908
Pocahontas?

135
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,607
Pocahontas?
Are you all right?

136
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,707
You'd better be all right,
because I'm not coming in after you...

137
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,081
Don't you think we're getting
a little old for these games?

138
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,320
Help me turn this thing over.

139
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,853
What were you doing up there?

140
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,731
Thinking. Meeko!

141
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,904
About the dream again?
Have you figured it out yet?

142
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,790
I know it means something.
I just don't know what.

143
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,003
You should ask
your father about it.

144
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,789
Maybe I should.

145
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,997
Come on, Fit.

146
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,473
Quit playing around.
We have to get back.

147
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,409
..faced a determined enemy.

148
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,198
The battle lasted
from the rising of the sun

149
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,661
until the evening shadow fell.

150
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:18,357
Our warriors fought with courage,
but none as bravely as Kocoum,

151
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,572
for he attacked with
the fierce strength of the bear.

152
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:25,045
- He has proven himself to be...
- He is so handsome!

153
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,048
l especially love the smile.

154
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,517
. destroying
every enemy in his path.

155
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,175
Tonight, we will feast
in his honor.

156
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,713
- My daughter.
- Wingapo, Father.

157
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,258
Seeing you gives me great joy.

158
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,981
I'm so glad
you've come home safely.

159
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,127
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.

160
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,924
l want to hear everything
you have been doing.

161
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,161
For many nights now...

162
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,502
I've been having
a very strange dream.

163
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,988
It's telling me something's
about to happen... something exciting.

164
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,489
Yes. Something exciting
is about to happen.

165
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,100
Really? What is it?

166
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,558
Kocoum has asked to seek
your hand in marriage.

167
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,411
Marry Kocoum?

168
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,596
I told him it would make
my heart soar.

169
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,495
But he's so... serious.

170
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,742
My daughter,
Kocoum will make a fine husband.

171
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,699
He is loyal and strong and will build
you a good house with sturdy walls.

172
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,899
With him,
you will be safe from harm.

173
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,267
Father, I think my dream is
pointing me down another path.

174
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,198
This is the right path for you.

175
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,050
But why can't choose...

176
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,933
Pocahontas, come with me.

177
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,926
You are the daughter
of the chief.

178
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,385
It is time to take
your place among our people.

179
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,910
Even the wild mountain stream
must some day join the big river.

180
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,395
As the river cuts his path

181
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,563
Though the river's proud and strong

182
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,820
He will choose the smoothest course

183
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,319
That's why rivers live so long.

184
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,315
They're steady

185
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,429
As the steady beating drum

186
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,736
Your mother wore this
for our wedding.

187
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,146
It was her dream to see you
wear it at your own.

188
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,538
It suits you.

189
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,678
He wants me to be steady.

190
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,271
Like the river.

191
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,333
But it's not steady at all.

192
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,198
What I love most about rivers is

193
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,310
You can't step in the same river twice

194
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,541
The water's always changing

195
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,464
Always flowing

196
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,883
But people, I guess, can't live
like that we alf must pay a price

197
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,579
To be safe
we lose our chance of ever knowing

198
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,494
What's around the river bend

199
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,488
Waiting just around the river bend

200
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,237
! look once more

201
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,153
Just around the river bend

202
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,928
Beyond the shore

203
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,632
Where the gulls fly free

204
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,714
Don't know what for

205
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,824
What I dream the day might send

206
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,018
Just around the river bend

207
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,326
For me

208
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,733
Coming for me

209
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:45,454
! feel it there beyond those trees
And right behind these waterfalls

210
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,145
Can I ignore that sound
Of distant drumming?

211
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,269
For a handsome, sturdy husband

212
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,266
Who builds handsome, sturdy walls

213
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,026
And never dreams that
Something might be coming

214
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,850
Just around the river bend

215
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,564
Just around the river bend

216
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,858
! look once more

217
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,579
Just around the river bend

218
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,458
Beyond the shore

219
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,240
Somewhere past the sea

220
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,285
Don't know what for

221
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,227
Why do aif my dreams extend

222
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,866
Just around the river bend?

223
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,323
Just around the river bend

224
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,255
Should I choose
The smoothest course

225
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,109
Steady as the beating drum?

226
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,027
Should l marry Kocoum?

227
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:42,050
Is all my dreaming at an end?

228
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,091
Or do you stilf

229
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:53,314
Wait for me, dream giver?

230
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:59,156
Just around the river

231
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,864
Bend?

232
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,290
Is that my Pocahontas?

233
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,337
Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you.

234
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,945
Good morning, child.

235
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,515
I was hoping you'd visit today.

236
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,781
Oh! Your mother's necklace!

237
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,501
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

238
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,873
My father wants me
to marry Kocoum.

239
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,291
Kocoum?
But he's so serious!

240
00:15:56,856 --> 00:16:00,136
I know. My father thinks
it's the right path for me.

241
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,380
But lately, I've been having
this dream, and I think it's...

242
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,670
A dream!
Let's hear all about it!

243
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,176
Quiet!

244
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:13,919
Quiet!

245
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,882
Now, child, you were saying?

246
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,528
Well, I'm running through the woods,

247
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,231
and then right there
in front of me is an arrow.

248
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,823
As I look at it,
it starts to spin.

249
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,446
A spinning arrow? How unusual!

250
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,713
Yes, it spins faster and faster
and faster... until suddenly, it stops.

251
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,376
Well, it seems to me
this spinning arrow

252
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,453
is pointing you down your path.

253
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:48,840
But, Grandmother Willow,
what is my path?

254
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,621
But, Grandmother Willow,
what is my path?

255
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,538
How am I ever going to find it?

256
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:57,943
Your mother asked me
the very same question.

257
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,633
She did?
What did you tell her?

258
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,510
I told her to listen.

259
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,583
All around you
are spirits, child.

260
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,476
They live in the earth,
the water, the sky.

261
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,598
If you listen,
they will guide you.

262
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,395
- [hear the wind.
- Yes.

263
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,887
What is it telling you?

264
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,082
I don't understand.

265
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,069
You will understand

266
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,606
Listen with your heart

267
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,176
You will understand

268
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,793
Let it break upon you

269
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,907
Like a wave upon the sand

270
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,063
It's saying something's coming.

271
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,798
Strange clouds?

272
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,970
Listen with your heart

273
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,870
You will understand

274
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,557
What do you see?

275
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,779
Clouds.

276
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,171
Strange clouds.

277
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,570
Look at it, Wiggins, an entire
New World chock full of gold,

278
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,176
just waiting for me.

279
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:26,191
And scores of adventures
waiting for us, right, Percy?

280
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,448
Do you think we'll meet some savages?

281
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,404
If we do, be sure to give them
a proper English greeting.

282
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,456
Gift baskets!

283
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,969
And he came so highly recommended.

284
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,309
It's perfect, the water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore.

285
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,149
Hey, there, Percy.

286
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,109
- Very well, give the order.
- Already done.

287
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,364
I've got a crew assembled,
and ready to go.

288
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,246
About the natives...

289
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,812
I'm counting on you
to make sure those heathens

290
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,574
don't disrupt our mission.

291
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,327
If they're like the savages
I've fought before,

292
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,030
it's nothing I can't handle.

293
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,998
Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.

294
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,998
See ya, Percy.

295
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,688
The men like Smith, don't they?

296
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,793
- I've never been a popular man.
- l like you.

297
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,901
Don't think I don't know what those
back-stabbers at court say about me.

298
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,485
Being a pathetic social
climber who's failed at everything...

299
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,018
I'm very well aware
that this is my last chance for glory.

300
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,965
But mark my words, Wiggins,

301
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,639
when King James sees the gold
these peasants unearth,

302
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,320
success will be mine, at last.

303
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,739
Wake up! Shake a leg!

304
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,450
It's incredible.

305
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,706
And it's all ours.
I've never seen anything like it.

306
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,239
It can look like Ratcliffe's knickers

307
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,048
as long as I
get off this stinking boat!

308
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,101
Come on, men. We didn't come
all this way just to look at it.

309
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,503
Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut! Steady!

310
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,641
That's far enough!

311
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,112
All right now... tie her off!

312
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,952
Here, John, tie off this end.

313
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,400
John? John?

314
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,520
- What are you doing up there?
- Getting a better look.

315
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,459
Hey!

316
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,438
Well... you're a strange-looking fellow.

317
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,312
You hungry?

318
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,744
Here you go.
It's a biscuit.

319
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,237
It's food. Well, sort of.

320
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,215
You like it, eh?

321
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,010
Try eating it
for four months straight.

322
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,671
You got a friend back there?

323
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,626
Hey... what the... what...?
Watch out.

324
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,161
No... get that...
look out!

325
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,485
John, you better get down here!

326
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,185
- The governor's coming ashore.
- All right. I'm leaving.

327
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,246
They have hair
on their faces like dogs.

328
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:51,413
My brothers, we must know
more about these visitors.

329
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,667
Kekata, what do you see?

330
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,597
These are not men like us...

331
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:19,033
..but strange beasts
with bodies that shine like the sun,

332
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,331
and weapons that spout fire
and thunder.

333
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,209
They prowl the earth
like ravenous wolves,

334
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,674
consuming everything in their path.

335
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,860
Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors
to the river and attack.

336
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,882
We will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

337
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,479
Kocoum, in that battle we knew
how to fight our enemy,

338
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,220
but these pale visitors
are strange to us.

339
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,769
Take some men to the river
to observe them.

340
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,445
Let us hope
they do not intend to stay.

341
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,349
l hereby claim this land
and all its riches

342
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,896
in the name of His Majesty,
King James I,

343
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,178
and do so name
this settlement Jamestown.

344
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,322
Bravo! Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir!

345
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,210
Hurry now, Percy.

346
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,475
We must be all squeaky clean
for the New World.

347
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,499
Captain Smith, it appears I've selected
the perfect location.

348
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,370
Captain Smith, it appears I've selected
the perfect location.

349
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,175
Not a savage in sight.

350
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,806
Because we don't see them
doesn't mean they're not there.

351
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,699
Then perhaps you should venture forth

352
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,452
and determine their whereabouts.

353
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,635
If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them.

354
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,533
Now, gentlemen, to work.

355
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,252
You men, get the ship unloaded.
You men build the fort.

356
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,272
The rest of you...
break out the shovels!

357
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,215
- It's time to start digging!
- Digging?

358
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,501
Of course! Let's not forget
what the Spanish found

359
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,808
when they came
to the New World.

360
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,797
Gold! Mountains of it.

361
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,490
Why, for years, they've been
ravaging the New World

362
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,710
of its most precious resources.

363
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,596
But now...

364
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,550
. it's our turn.

365
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:52,601
. it's our turn.

366
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,999
The gold of Cortez
the jewels of Pizarro

367
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,066
Will seem like mere trinkets
by this time tomorrow

368
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,847
The gold we find here
will dwarf them by far

369
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:08,084
Oh, with all ya got in ya, boys

370
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,964
Dig up Virginia, boys

371
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:13,964
Mine, boys

372
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,503
Mine every mountain

373
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,113
And dig, boys

374
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,809
Dig till ya drop

375
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,721
Grab a pick, boys

376
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,506
Quick, boys

377
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,860
Shove in a shovel

378
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,456
Uncover those lovely pebbles

379
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,405
That sparkle and shine

380
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,857
It's gold

381
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:35,096
And it's mine, mine, mine

382
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,717
Dig and diggety dig

383
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,287
And dig and dig and diggety dig

384
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,386
- Hey, nonny nonny hi, nonny nonny
- Ooh, how I love it

385
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,499
- Hey, nonny nonny hi, nonny nonny
- Riches for cheap

386
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,695
- Hey, nonny nonny hi, nonny nonny
- There'll be heaps of it

387
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:54,395
And I'll be on top of the heap

388
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,827
My rivals back home
it's not that I'm bitter

389
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:01,417
But think how they'll squirm
when they see how ! glitter

390
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,084
The ladies at court
will be all a-twitter

391
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:06,991
The king will reward me

392
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,359
He'll knight me
No! Lord me

393
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:14,433
It's mine!
Mine, mine for the taking

394
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,400
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold

395
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:22,146
With those nuggets dug, it's
glory they'll give me

396
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:26,788
My dear friend King Jimmy
will probably build me a shrine

397
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,572
When all of the gold

398
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,346
Is mine

399
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,928
And dig and dig and diggety dig

400
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,750
And dig and dig and diggety dig

401
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,670
Alf of my life l have searched
for a land like this one

402
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:49,059
A wild or more challenging country
! couldn't design

403
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:56,216
Hundreds of dangers await
and I don't plan to miss one

404
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,703
In alandicanclaim
a landican tame

405
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:04,173
- The greatest adventure is mine
- Keep on working, lads

406
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,353
Don't be shirking, lads

407
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,202
Mine, boys, mine

408
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:14,285
Mine me that gold

409
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,367
- Beautiful gold
- Dig for that gold

410
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:21,193
This is my land, my land

411
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,513
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys

412
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,842
But I've got this crick in me spine

413
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,212
- This land we behold
- This beauty untold

414
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,579
- Aman can be bold
- It all can be sold

415
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,140
And the gold is

416
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:43,043
Mine, mine, mine

417
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,996
No! Wait! Please...

418
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,252
Please!

419
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,918
Don't run off.

420
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,756
It's all right.
I'm not going to hurt you.

421
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:58,233
Here. Let me help you out of there.

422
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,303
You don't understand a word
I'm saying, do you?

423
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,105
It's all right.

424
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,947
Listen with your heart

425
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,553
You will understand

426
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,627
Let it break upon you

427
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:50,077
Like a wave upon the sand

428
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,110
Who are you?

429
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,651
Listen with your heart

430
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:01,534
You will understand

431
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,264
Pocahontas.

432
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,839
What? What did you say?

433
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:10,239
My name is Pocahontas.

434
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,450
I'm John Smith.

435
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,543
That's it. Keep at it, men.

436
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,389
Keep digging.
It must be here somewhere.

437
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,807
- There's 30 more down by the ridge.
- That makes more than a hundred!

438
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,504
- Anything yet?
- Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.

439
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,417
How long are we going to keep
digging like this, sir?

440
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,201
We're busting our backs day and night...

441
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,841
For king and country.
I know, I know.

442
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,743
And I'm sure you're fatigued.

443
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,138
Wiggins!

444
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,939
Wiggins!

445
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,050
- Coming!
- Dispose of this.

446
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,377
Who's a good doggie?

447
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,447
Who's a good doggie?

448
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,519
Fetch, boy!

449
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,255
Savages! An ambush!
Arm yourselves!

450
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,131
Run!

451
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,466
Arm yourselves!

452
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,882
Make sure
every man has a musket!

453
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,689
Shoot!

454
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,713
Them, you idiot!

455
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:37,283
Where's that blasted Smith
when I need him?

456
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,416
Namontac!

457
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,241
Back to the village!

458
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,476
Shut up.
Shut up, you fools!

459
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,508
They'll be back.

460
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,382
Everyone back to camp.

461
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,953
Get the cannons ashore,
finish building the fort!

462
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,929
Aye, Governor!

463
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,464
And you...

464
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,897
..learn to use
that thing properly.

465
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,743
A man's not a man
unless he knows how to shoot.

466
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,665
These beasts invade
our shores...

467
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,324
..and now this.

468
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,458
This wound is strange to me.

469
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,337
We will fight this enemy,
but we cannot do it alone.

470
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,718
Kocoum, send messengers
to every village in our nation.

471
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,795
We will call on our brothers
to help us fight.

472
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:55,618
These white men are dangerous!

473
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,364
No one is to go near them.

474
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,094
It's called a helmet.

475
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,592
Helmet.

476
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,282
So... what river is this?

477
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,232
Quyukihanic.

478
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,904
You have
the most unusual names here.

479
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,590
Chicahomeni.
Quyu...Quyukihanic.

480
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,061
Pocahontas.

481
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,374
You have the most unusual name, too.

482
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,174
John Smith.

483
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,435
Hey! Is this bottomless pit
a friend of yours?

484
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,728
Meeko!

485
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,520
How do you do, Meeko?

486
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,597
It's all right.
It's just a handshake.

487
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,684
Here, let me show you.

488
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,935
Nothing's happening.

489
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:50,723
No, no.
I need your hand first.

490
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,757
It's how we say hello.

491
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:05,145
This is how we say hello.
Wingapo.

492
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,887
Wingapo.

493
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:15,143
And how we say goodbye.
Ah-nah.

494
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,189
l like hello better.

495
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,482
Yeah, I remember you.

496
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,534
Flit just doesn't like strangers.

497
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,777
But I'm not a stranger anymore.

498
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,986
Stubborn little fellow,
isn't he?

499
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,368
Very stubborn.

500
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,424
Hey!

501
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,272
Meeko! Come back here.

502
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,125
Don't worry. He can't hurt it.

503
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,887
Hey! What are you doing?

504
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,422
Meeko, bring that back.

505
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,653
No, it's all right.
He can keep it.

506
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,729
Call it a gift.

507
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,233
What was that?

508
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,088
- My compass.
- Compass?

509
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,153
It tells how to find
your way when you get lost.

510
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,471
It's all right.
I'll get another in London.

511
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,394
London?
Is that your village?

512
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,369
- Yes. It's a very big village.
- What's it like?

513
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,752
It's got streets
filled with carriages,

514
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:11,623
bridges over the rivers,
and buildings as tall as trees.

515
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,123
- I'd like to see those things.
- You will.

516
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,892
- How?
- We're building here.

517
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,974
We'll show your people how
to use this land properly.

518
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,680
- How to make the most of it.
- Make the most of it?

519
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,710
Yes. We'll build roads
and decent houses...

520
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,946
Our houses are fine.

521
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,615
You think that because
you don't know any better.

522
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,482
Wait a minute.
Don't take it that...

523
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,092
Hey! Wait!

524
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:41,955
There's so much we can teach you. We've
improved the lives of savages all over.

525
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,680
Savages?

526
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,822
Not that you're a savage.

527
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,651
- Just my people.
- No.

528
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,556
Listen, that's not what I meant.
Let me explain.

529
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,839
- Let go!
- No. I'm not letting you leave.

530
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,363
Look, don't do this.

531
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,799
Savage is just a word, you know?

532
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,558
A term for...
people who are uncivilized.

533
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,038
Like me.

534
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,754
When I say uncivilized,
what I mean is...

535
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,859
What you mean is... not like you.

536
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:23,290
What you mean is... not like you.

537
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,417
You think I'm an ignorant savage

538
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,951
And you've been so many places

539
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,410
I guess it must be so

540
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,988
But still, l cannot see

541
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,332
If the savage one is me

542
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:42,622
How can there be so much
that you don't know

543
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:48,198
You don't know

544
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:01,154
You think you own
whatever land you land on

545
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:05,733
The earth is just
a dead thing you can claim

546
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:10,211
But I know every rock
and tree and creature

547
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,848
Has a life, has a spirit
has a name

548
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,482
You think the only people
who are people

549
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:23,778
Are the people
who look and think like you

550
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:28,019
But if you walk
the footsteps of a stranger

551
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:32,816
You'll learn things
you never knew you never knew

552
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:37,824
Have you ever heard the wolf cry
to the biue corn moon?

553
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:42,043
Or ask the grinning bobcat
why he grinned?

554
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,770
Can you sing with all the voices
of the mountain?

555
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,605
Can you paint with alf the colors
of the wind?

556
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,353
Can you paint with alf the colors

557
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,107
Of the wind?

558
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,944
Come run the hidden pine trails
of the forest

559
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:14,134
Come taste the sun-sweet berries
of the earth

560
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,142
Come roll in all the riches
all around you

561
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,690
And for once, never wonder
what they're worth

562
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,858
The rainstorm and the river
are my brothers

563
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:31,488
The heron and the otter
are my friends

564
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,696
And we are aif connected to each other

565
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,570
In a circle in a hoop
that never ends

566
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,952
How high does the sycamore grow?

567
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,240
If you cut it down

568
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,998
Then you'll never know

569
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,761
And you'll never hear the wolf cry

570
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,469
To the blue corn moon

571
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:01,362
For whether we are white
or copper-skinned

572
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:05,856
We need to sing with all the voices
of the mountain

573
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:11,027
We need to paint with alf the colors
of the wind

574
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:14,375
You can own the earth, and still

575
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,929
Alf you'll own is earth until

576
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:20,606
You can paint

577
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:23,662
With aif the colors

578
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,418
Of the

579
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:31,879
Wind

580
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,226
What is it?

581
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,691
The drums.
They mean trouble.

582
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,488
I shouldn't be here.

583
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,548
- [ want to see you again.
- lL can't.

584
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,593
- Please, don't leave.
- I'm sorry.

585
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:05,895
l have to go.

586
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,537
All right!
This one's ready to hoist!

587
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,100
Two on each side.
Ready now? Push!

588
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:22,959
Watch it! It's slipping.

589
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,924
Come on, lads, it's only
a little picket fence.

590
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,359
- Steady!
- There you go.

591
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,846
That'll keep everything out.

592
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,501
- Something wrong, John?
- What?

593
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,660
- You've been quiet the last few days.
- He's mad he missed all the action.

594
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:43,211
Don't worry. You'll get your chance
to deal with the Indians.

595
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,061
We'll take care of them,
like we did last time.

596
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:49,762
We shot ourselves an injun

597
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,738
Or maybe two or three

598
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,279
All right, you howling nutter,
get to work.

599
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,775
Come on, Ben.
It's just a little fun.

600
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,568
Sure! We're having loads of fun, right?

601
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,961
Look at us. No gold, no food,

602
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:06,260
while Ratcliffe sits up in his tent
all day, happy as a clam.

603
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,988
I'm doomed!

604
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:12,857
I should be wallowing in riches by now,
and I haven't found as much as a speck.

605
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:17,667
Think. Think!
It's got to be around here somewhere.

606
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,967
Where could it be?

607
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,620
I've mined the forests and the hills
and the swamps... and nothing!

608
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,991
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?

609
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,860


610
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,642
l made it myself!

611
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,754
Take that silly...

612
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,479
Of course. The Indians.

613
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:48,016
Wiggins, why do you think
those insolent heathens attacked us?

614
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:51,453
We invaded their land, cut down
their trees and dug up their earth?

615
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,732
It's the gold!
They have it,

616
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,278
and they don't want us
to take it from them.

617
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,854
I'll just have to
take it by force, won't I?

618
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,790
You there!
Where's Captain Smith?

619
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:09,243
- Well, he's... gone.
- Aye. Your singing scared him off.

620
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,927
- Go get him, for heaven's sake!
- What if we run into the Indians?

621
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,933
That's what guns are for.

622
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,157
Now arm yourselves
and get moving!

623
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,674
Pocahontas.

624
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,533
You should be inside the village.

625
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,320
We'll be all right.

626
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:53,365
We're gathering food for
when the warriors arrive.

627
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:54,748
Don't go far.

628
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:57,975
- Now is not the time to be running off.
- Yes, Father.

629
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:03,647
When I see you wear that necklace,
you look just like your mother.

630
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,436
I miss her.

631
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,717
But she is still with us.

632
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,210
Whenever the wind moves
through the trees,

633
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,241
I feel her presence.

634
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,937
Our people look to her
for wisdom and strength.

635
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,680
Someday, they will look to you as well.

636
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,686
I would be honored by that.

637
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:23,505
You shouldn't be
out here alone.

638
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,844
- I'll send for Kocoum.
- All right, what is it?

639
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,721
- What?
- You're hiding something.

640
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,690
I'm not hiding anything.

641
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,828
Pocahontas, you can tell me.
I promise.

642
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,730
I won't tell anyone...
Pocahontas, look!

643
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,821
- It's one of them! I'm going to get...
- What are you doing here?

644
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,298
l had to see you again.

645
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:49,187
Pocahontas!
Pocahontas!

646
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,190
Please! Don't say anything.

647
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:52,849
Quick! This way!

648
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,484
- But...
- Nakoma.

649
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:58,665
- Where is Pocahontas?
- [haven't seen her.

650
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,897
Pocahontas can't keep running off.

651
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,053
It's dangerous out there.

652
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,135
Tell her that.
She listens to you.

653
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,621
Sure she does.

654
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,714
This place is incredible.

655
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:32,891
To think we came all this way,
just to dig it up for gold.

656
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,991
- Gold?
- Hey, Meeko.

657
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,659
- What's gold?
- You know, it's yellow.

658
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,060
It comes out of the ground.
It's valuable.

659
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,095
Oh! Here, we have lots of it.

660
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:45,383
Gold.

661
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:49,543
No, no! Gold is this.

662
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:51,914
There's nothing
like that around here.

663
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,546
- No gold?
- Not that I've seen.

664
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:57,339
All this way for nothing.

665
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:00,205
Those boys are
in for a big surprise.

666
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,661
- Will they leave?
- Some of them might.

667
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,309
Will you go home?

668
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:09,557
It's not like I have
much of a home to go back to.

669
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,194
I've never
really belonged anywhere.

670
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,516
You could belong here.

671
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,251
What was that?

672
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:29,288
- Did you see something?
- No. I just...

673
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,657
..1 didn't see anything.
Did I?

674
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,510
Look again.

675
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,426
Let it break upon you

676
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:43,042
Like a wave upon the sand

677
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,972
Hello, John Smith.

678
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,001
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

679
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,241
Then you should talk back.

680
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,266
Don't be frightened, young man.

681
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,908
My bark is worse than my bite.

682
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:02,029
- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?

683
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,560
Anything you want.

684
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,345
So...

685
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,752
Come closer, John Smith.

686
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:17,190
He has a good soul.
And he's handsome, too!

687
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,718
- [like her.
- [knew you would.

688
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:22,152
Smith!

689
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,288
Smith, where are you, mate?

690
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,942
- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.

691
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,734
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.

692
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,988
If you spot one, don't ask questions.
Just shoot.

693
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,121
Watch your feet, you big oaf!

694
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,990
It wasn't me! It was the tree.

695
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,437
Of course! The tree just felt like
lifting its roots...

696
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,445
Let's get out of here.

697
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,972
- Run!
- But what about Smith?

698
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,814
He's a big lad!
He can take care of himself!

699
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:58,308
Glad you're on our side.

700
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:01,189
There's still some snap
in these old vines.

701
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:04,122
I better get back before they
send the camp after me.

702
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:07,815
- When willl see you again?
- Meet me tonight, right here.

703
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:17,671
Well! l haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.

704
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,189
What am I doing?
I shouldn't be seeing him again.

705
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,235
I mean,
I want to see him again.

706
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:26,214
Who wouldn't?
I want to see him again.

707
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:30,117
But still, something inside
is telling me it's the right thing.

708
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,124
Perhaps it's your dream.

709
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,849
My dream? Do you think he's the one
the spinning arrow was pointing to?

710
00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:48,204
The warriors are here!

711
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:02,493
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing?

712
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,187
- There you are!
- Kocoum!

713
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:08,060
Look at them! Now we have enough
warriors to destroy those white demons!

714
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:14,311
Now that we are joined by our brothers,
we will defeat this enemy.

715
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,053
Father, I need to speak with you.

716
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:26,598
Not now, my daughter.
The council is gathering.

717
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:29,944
We don't have to fight them.
There must be a better way.

718
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,821
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

719
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,537
But maybe we should try
talking to them.

720
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,360
They do not want to talk.

721
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,851
But if one of them did want to talk,
you would listen to him, wouldn't you?

722
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,128
- Pocahontas...
- Wouldn't you?

723
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:47,244
Of course I would,
but it is not that simple.

724
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,118
Nothing is simple anymore.

725
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,161
Easy, Thomas, it's me.

726
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:41,558
- Oh, John! I could've killed you.
- Not aiming like that, you couldn't.

727
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:44,886
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.
You'll see twice as well.

728
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:48,204
Smith! There you are!

729
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,015
We were looking
all over for you.

730
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,050
Smith! Where have you been?

731
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,844
Il was out scouting
the terrain, sir.

732
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,459
Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.

733
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:01,216
- We'll need that for the battle.
- What battle?

734
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:04,192
We will eliminate these savages
once and for all.

735
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:05,875
No! You can't do that!

736
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,576
Oh, can't I?

737
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:11,386
We don't have to fight them.

738
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,522
- What's gotten into you?
- [met one.

739
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:15,874
- You what?
- Asavage?

740
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,190
They're not savages.
They can help us.

741
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,172
They know the land. They know how
to navigate the rivers.

742
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,143
- And look. It's food.
- What is it?

743
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:28,699
- It's better than hardtack and gruel.
- like gruel.

744
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,109
They don't want to feed us,
you ninnies!

745
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:34,052
They want to kill us!
All of us!

746
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,095
They've got our gold,
and they'll do anything to keep it!

747
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:38,804
But there is no gold.

748
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:40,783
No gold?

749
00:53:41,085 --> 00:53:44,865
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?

750
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:46,716
Yes.

751
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:50,176
Lies! All of it!
Murderous thieves.

752
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,594
There's no room for their kind
in society.

753
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,013
But this is their land!

754
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:57,254
This is my land!
l make the laws here.

755
00:53:57,768 --> 00:54:01,518
And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian

756
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:06,416
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason and hanged.

757
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:13,752
Pocahontas!

758
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,506
- Nakoma.
- Don't go out there.

759
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,689
I lied for you once.
Don't ask me to do it again.

760
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,529
I have to do this.

761
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,694
- He's one of them!
- You don't know him.

762
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,576
If you go, you'll be turning
your back on your own people.

763
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,046
I'm trying to help my people.

764
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,361
Pocahontas, please.
You're my best friend.

765
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,295
I don't want you to get hurt.

766
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,910
- L won't. [ know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no!

767
00:54:44,081 --> 00:54:46,631
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
around the world for nothing.

768
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:50,073
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?

769
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:53,424
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been
lying to us since we left London.

770
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,441
Listen to you,
you bunch of idiots.

771
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,836
Those savages didn't
attack us for nothing.

772
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,688
They're hiding something.

773
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,003
If they do have the gold,
l reckon we'll have to fight them.

774
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,750
Either too hot or too cold.

775
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,300
l haven't been comfortable
since we got here.

776
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,090
Me, too. I'm itching a lot.

777
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,586
- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.

778
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:24,062
l want to know where
he's sneaking off to.

779
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:27,067
- Yes, sir.
- If you happen to see any Indians...

780
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,795
.-Shoot them.

781
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:36,147
And, Thomas,
you've been a slipshod sailor

782
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,560
and a poor excuse for a soldier.

783
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:41,106
Don't disappoint me again.

784
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:53,201
- Kocoum.
- What is it?

785
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:57,837
- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?

786
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,156
I think she's in trouble.

787
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:09,624
The earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?

788
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,360
The warriors are here.

789
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:14,265
- Pocahontas.
- John!

790
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,895
Listen to me. My men are planning
to attack your people.

791
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:19,548
You've got to warn them.

792
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,860
Maybe it's not too late
to stop this.

793
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,082
You have to talk to my father.

794
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:26,638
Pocahontas, talking isn't
going to do any good.

795
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:28,537
I've talked to my men,

796
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,256
but everything
about this land has them spooked.

797
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,829
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen!

798
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,595
Percy?

799
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,583
- Easy, Percy! Come here!
- Meeko, come back!

800
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:51,435
Once two sides want to fight,
nothing can stop them.

801
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:54,712
- Come here both of you!
- It's all right. He's a friend.

802
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,258
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

803
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:01,145
- What are you doing? Meeko!
- Percy, get back here!

804
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:05,065
- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough!

805
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:14,646
It's enough to make your sap boil.

806
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,300
Now then, there's something
l want to show you. Look!

807
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:27,571
- The ripples.
- What about them?

808
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:32,158
So small at first,
then look how they grow.

809
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,357
But someone has to start them.

810
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,713
They're not going to listen to us.

811
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:42,836
Young man, sometimes the right path
is not the easiest one.

812
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:45,007
Don't you see?

813
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:49,135
Only when the fighting
stops can you be together.

814
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,037
All right. Let's go talk to your father.

815
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,529
Kocoum, no!

816
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:42,808
Kocoum!

817
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,288
Leave him alone!

818
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:05,674
Kocoum, stop!

819
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:10,167
Both eyes open.

820
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:20,917
- Thomas!
- Is he...

821
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,031
You killed him.

822
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:25,026
- [ thought that...
- Get away from him!

823
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,258
- Pocahontas, it won't help! He was...
- He killed him!

824
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,998
Thomas, get out of here!
Get out of here!

825
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,699
Who did this?

826
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,897
Pocahontas was out in the woods.

827
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,609
Kocoum went to find her
and this man attacked them.

828
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:50,327
Your weapons are strong,

829
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,647
but now our anger is stronger.

830
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,976
- At sunrise, he'll be the first to die!
- But, Father!

831
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:59,673
I told you to stay in the village.

832
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,830
You disobeyed me.

833
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,765
You have shamed your father!

834
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:05,644
I was only trying to help.

835
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:09,469
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!

836
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,673
Take him away!

837
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,503
Kocoum was just coming
to protect me.

838
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,555
Pocahontas...

839
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,524
..l sent Kocoum after you.

840
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:36,431
Il was worried about you.

841
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,880
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

842
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,782
All this happened because of me.

843
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,919
And now I'll never see
John Smith again.

844
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,839
Come with me.

845
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:57,200
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes
of the man who killed Kocoum.

846
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:02,006
Be quick.

847
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:22,017
Pocahontas.

848
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:26,541
I'm so sorry.

849
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:27,986
For what? This?

850
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,355
I've gotten out of
worse scrapes than this.

851
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,207
Can't think of any now, but...

852
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,152
It would've been better
if we'd never met.

853
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,214
None of this would've happened.

854
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,328
Pocahontas, look at me.

855
01:02:38,722 --> 01:02:43,882
I'd rather die tomorrow than live
a hundred years without knowing you.

856
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,368
- Pocahontas.
- L can't leave you.

857
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,092
You never will.

858
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:54,523
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.

859
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:09,924
Help! Somebody help!

860
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:11,363
Help!

861
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,048
Easy, lad. What is it?

862
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,786
It's Smith! They got him!

863
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:17,108
- Who got him?
- The savages!

864
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,010
Captured him!
Dragged him off!

865
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,725
- Where'd they take him?
- North.

866
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,926
- How many were there?
- At least a dozen.

867
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,166
Filthy beasts!

868
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,904
It's perfect, Wiggins! I couldn't
have planned this better myself.

869
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,102
The gold is as good as mine.

870
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,942
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us.

871
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,548
Thomas is right!
We've got to do something.

872
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:38,981
And so we shall. I told you those
savages couldn't be trusted.

873
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:42,172
And so we shall. I told you those
savages couldn't be trusted.

874
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,469
Smith tried to befriend them,
look what they've done to him!

875
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:49,462
But now I say it's time to
rescue our courageous comrade.

876
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,020
At daybreak, we attack!

877
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:56,792
What can you expect
From filthy little heathens?

878
01:03:57,267 --> 01:04:00,017
Here's what you get
When races are diverse

879
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,020
Their skin's a hellish red

880
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:03,674
They're only good when dead

881
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,160
They're vermin as I said
And worse

882
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:09,033
They're savages, savages

883
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:10,756
Barely even human

884
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:12,357
Savages, savages

885
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,104
Drive them from our shore!

886
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,757
They're not like you and me

887
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,542
Which means they must be evil

888
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:20,341
We must sound the drums of war

889
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:22,427
They're savages, savages

890
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:24,429
Dirty shrieking devils

891
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:28,038
Now we sound the drums of war

892
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,719
This is what we feared

893
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,524
The paleface is a demon

894
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,483
The only thing
they feel at all is greed

895
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:41,553
Beneath that milky hide

896
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,248
There's emptiness inside

897
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,566
! wonder if they even bleed

898
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,375
They're savages, savages

899
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,128
Barely even human

900
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,847
Savages, savages

901
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:53,265
Killers at the core

902
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,160
They're different from us

903
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:57,102
Which means they can't be trusted

904
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:59,947
We must sound the drums of war

905
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:02,113
They're savages, savages

906
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:03,895
First we deal with this one

907
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:05,656
Then we sound the drums of war

908
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:07,199
Savages, savages

909
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:08,959
Let's go get a few, men!

910
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,699
Savages, savages

911
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,497
Now it's up to you, men!

912
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:14,236
- Savages
- Savages

913
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:16,000
Barely even human

914
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:19,301
Now we sound the drums

915
01:05:19,816 --> 01:05:22,685
Of war

916
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,151
They're going to kill him at sunrise.

917
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:35,874
You have to stop them.

918
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:39,322
- lL can't.
- Child, remember your dream.

919
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:43,176
Il was wrong, Grandmother Willow.
I followed the wrong path.

920
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:45,606
I feel so lost.

921
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,980
The compass.

922
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,012
The spinning arrow.

923
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,402
It's the arrow from your dream!

924
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:20,554
I was right!
It was pointing to him!

925
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,410
Sunrise!

926
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,201
It's not too late, child!

927
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,860
Let the spirits of the earth
guide you!

928
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:39,302
You know your path, child.
Now follow it!

929
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,060
This will be the day

930
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,325
Let's go, men!

931
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:50,731
This will be the morning

932
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,779
Bring out the prisoner!

933
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,196
We will see them
dying in the dust

934
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,622
1 don't know what I can do

935
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,486
Still 1 know I've got to try

936
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,211
Now we make them pay

937
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:01,883
Eagle, help my feet to fly

938
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,491
Now, without a warning

939
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,333
Mountain, help my heart be great

940
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:06,912
Now we leave them
blood and bone and rust

941
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:10,496
- Spirits of the earth and sky
- It's them or us

942
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,279
Please don't let it be too late

943
01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:15,773
They're a bunch of
Filthy, stinking savages

944
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,242
- Savages
- Demons

945
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:18,427
- Devils
- Kill them!

946
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:19,925
- Savages
- Savages

947
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,429
What are we waiting for?

948
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:23,071
Destroy their evil race

949
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,038
Until there's not a trace left

950
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:30,321
How loud are the drums of war?

951
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:34,871
Now we see what comes
of trying to be chums

952
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:36,908
ls the death of all I love

953
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:40,056
Carried in the drumming of

954
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:41,983
- War
- No!

955
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:46,227
If you kill him,
you'll have to kill me too.

956
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:49,069
If you kill him,
you'll have to kill me too.

957
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,552
Daughter, stand back.

958
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:55,275
I won't! I love him, Father.

959
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,451
Look around you.

960
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,680
This is where the path
of hatred has brought us.

961
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,926
This is the path I choose, Father.

962
01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:13,522
What will yours be?

963
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:51,944
My daughter speaks
with a wisdom beyond her years.

964
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:55,402
We have all come here
with anger in our hearts...

965
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,541
..but she comes with
courage and understanding.

966
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:03,127
From this day forward,
if there is to be more killing,

967
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:06,023
it will not start with me.

968
01:09:09,412 --> 01:09:10,812
Release him.

969
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,965
Now is our chance! Fire!

970
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:32,846
- No.
- What?

971
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:35,476
- They let him go!
- They don't want to fight!

972
01:09:35,904 --> 01:09:38,804
It's a trick,
don't you see? Fire!

973
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,633
Fine! I'll settle this myself.

974
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,397
No!

975
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:51,837
John!

976
01:09:57,894 --> 01:09:58,794
You shot him!

977
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:02,215
He stepped right into it!
It's his own fault!

978
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:05,075
- Smith was right.
- We never should've listened to you.

979
01:10:05,468 --> 01:10:07,458
- Get the gun!
- Traitors!

980
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:09,474
Unhand me!
I say, how dare you!

981
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:11,476
Put him in chains!

982
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,084
I'll see you all hanged for this!

983
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:15,876
And gag him as well!

984
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:29,723
Is he going to make it?

985
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,742
The sooner he gets to England,
the better.

986
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:33,555
Let's hope the wind is with him.

987
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:36,019
- ls the ship ready yet?
- Any minute now.

988
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,621
Just loading
the last bit of cargo.

989
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,092
Untie me at once!

990
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,337
I'll have your head for this!

991
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,493
And he came so highly recommended.

992
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:00,367
The ship's almost ready.

993
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,146
We'd better get you on board.
We'll lose the tide.

994
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,489
No, not yet.
She said she'd be here.

995
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:08,362
Look.

996
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,631
Going back is his only chance.

997
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:40,103
He'll die if he stays here.

998
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:50,394
Here.

999
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,896
It's from
Grandmother Willow's bark.

1000
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,976
It'll help with the pain.

1001
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,210
What pain?
I've had worse pain than this.

1002
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,234
Can't think of any
right now, but...

1003
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,944
You are always welcome
among our people.

1004
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,610
Thank you, my brother.

1005
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:18,963
I thought you didn't like strangers.

1006
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:29,991
My mother's necklace.

1007
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:35,320
See ya, Percy.

1008
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:54,031
Come with me?

1009
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,911
You must choose your own path.

1010
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:18,506
I'm needed here.

1011
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:21,976
Then... I'll stay with you.

1012
01:13:22,298 --> 01:13:25,338
No. You have to go back.

1013
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:28,325
- But I can't leave you.
- You never will.

1014
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:32,488
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you...

1015
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,809
.. forever.

1016
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,707
- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed, John.

1017
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:20,341
Weigh anchor!
