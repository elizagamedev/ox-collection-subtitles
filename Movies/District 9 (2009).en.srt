1
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:49,235
Attention, Mr. Hayes,
your wife is waiting at the station.

2
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,370
Oh, it was after—
a
You know, after last year's corporate...

3
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,071
..my wife was always encouraging me, you know?

4
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,547
She said, "No, you did fine in the corporate."
I was a bit nervous.

5
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,943
This little guy. Hello? Sorry.

6
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,452
-That's nice, eh?
a
-Yeah.

7
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,167
Nice background with the people.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,320
-We are here at Must I look in there?
-Look into the lens.

9
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,210
We are here at MNU head office,
a
Department of Alien Affairs.

10
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,684
My name is Wikus van de Merwe.

11
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:19,133
And behind me you can see
other Alien Affairs workers.

12
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,333
And what we do here at this department is...

13
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:26,753
...we try to engage with
the prawn on behalf of MNU...

14
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,737
..and on behalf of humans.

15
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,065
To everyone's surprise,
the ship didn't come to a stop...

16
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,995
...over Manhattan or Washington or Chicago...

17
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:43,205
...but instead coasted to a halt directly
over the city of Johannesburg.

18
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,911
The doors didn't open for months.
Nobody could get in.

19
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,690
They eventually decided, after much deliberation,
that the best thing to do...

20
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,598
...would be to physically cut their way in.

21
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,394
We're gonna need a drill down here.

22
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:08,428
We were on the verge of first contact.

23
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,689
The whole world was watching.

24
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,088
We need some more light.

25
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,967
Expecting, I don't know, music from heaven and
bright shining lights.

26
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,414
Got a lot of moisture in here.

27
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,977
Yeah, just go slowly.

28
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,048
Oh, my God.

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,720
The creatures were extremely malnourished.

30
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,186
They were very unhealthy.
They seemed to be aimless.

31
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,436
There was a lot of international pressure
on us at the time.

32
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,636
The world was looking at Johannesburg...

33
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,875
...80 we had to do the right thing.

34
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,294
The government then established an aid group...

35
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,140
..that started to ferry the aliens to
a temporary camp that was set up...

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,480
..Just beneath the ship.

37
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,316
We didn't have a plan.

38
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,269
There was a million of them.

39
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,578
So, what was a temporary holding zone...

40
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,427
...800n became fenced, became militarized.
a

41
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,943
And before we knew it, it was a slum.
a

42
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,683
Well, the truth is nobody really knew
what this place was.

43
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,394
There's a lot of secrets in District 9.

44
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,950
At first, a lot of attention was given
to giving the aliens...

45
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,910
..proper status and protection.

46
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,320
They're spending so much money
to keep them here...

47
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,446
..when they could be spending it on other things.
But at least-

48
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,677
At least they're keeping them separate from us.

49
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,744
I wanna be realistic with everyone.

50
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,383
-The aliens will not be able to go home.
-The aliens are here to stay.

51
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,385
There were literally thousands of
theories as to why...

52
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,543
..the ship seemed inoperable.

53
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,106
And what was speculated was that
a command module had detached itself...

54
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,844
..from the main ship and then somehow
mysteriously become lost.

55
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,414
Did it fall by itself or was it programmed?

56
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,818
I don't know.

57
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,356
Examination of the old video footage...

58
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:19,755
.. Shows very clearly that
a piece falls from the ship.

59
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,104
We looked everywhere. There's pieces falling off
that vessel for months.

60
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,549
More energy weapon caches found.

61
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,464
The special task force conducted
raids in District 9....

62
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,997
Where there's a weapon, there's crime.
Tensions rose and rose.

63
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,601
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.

64
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:44,318
Residents in Tembisa rioted for
the third consecutive night...

65
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,561
{nan attempt to remove
all the aliens from their township.

66
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,080
I think they must fix that ship and they must go.

67
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,704
A virus, a selective virus.
a

68
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,697
Release it near the aliens.

69
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,728
They must just go. I don’t know where,
but they must just go!

70
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,012
If they were from another country,
we might understand...

71
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,140
...but they are not even from this planet at all.

72
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,746
The government have enforced a nationwide curfew.

73
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,209
These aliens-- Prawns.
--they take my wife away.

74
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,492
The derogatory term "prawn" is used.

75
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,348
Obviously, it implies something
that is a bottom feeder...

76
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,111
..that scavenges the leftovers.

77
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,581
You can't say they don't look like that.
They look like prawns.

78
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,821
Aliens made off with
an undisclosed amount of cash.

79
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,628
One bystander was hurt.

80
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,756
What for an alien might be seen
as something recreational...

81
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,146
...Setting fire to a truck, derailing a train...

82
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,959
..iS for us, obviously,
an extremely destructive act.

83
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,341
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.

84
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,150
They check the brand and take them.
They take whatever you have on you.

85
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,823
Your cell phone or anything.

86
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,399
After that, they kill you.

87
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,428
After 20 years,
public pressure forced the government...

88
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,601
..to ship the aliens out of Johannesburg.

89
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,472
They had had enough,
and they wanted District 9 to be moved...

90
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,991
..and more intensively policed and controlled.

91
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,279
To enforce this eviction,
a
the government turned to Multi-National United.

92
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,415
Welcome all, and thank you for coming.

93
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,419
Please listen very closely to this briefing.

94
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,926
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.

95
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,121
This is the largest operation
that MNU has ever undertaken...

96
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,326
..and we believe that it is going to be
undertaken successfully.

97
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,637
It is to move 1.8 million prawns...

98
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:39,087
...from their present home in District 9 to
a safer and better location...

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,070
...200 kilometres outside of Johannesburg city.

100
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,047
We've built a nice,
a
new facility where the prawn can go.

101
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,272
He can be comfortable. He can stay there.

102
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,220
The people of Johannesburg and
of South Africa are going to live...

103
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,383
...happily and safely, knowing that
that prawn is very far away.

104
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:03,251
UIO protocol dictates that
we give the aliens 24-hours' notice...

105
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,587
...of our right to evict.

106
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,546
Today, you will serve these notices...

107
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,621
...getting the aliens to sign the I-27 form.

108
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,855
The legality that MNU is using to
evict the aliens is simply a whitewash.

109
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:21,203
So I'm going to appoint a field officer
to take direct command.

110
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,986
Wikus van de Merwe.

111
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,867
Everybody always said that
Wikus was not a very smart boy...

112
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,964
...but he was a wonderful son.

113
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,397
That was my Wikus. Just--

114
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,525
Yes. Like up on the big stage.
Thank you, Piet. Mr. Smit.

115
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:43,205
I had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to Wikus.

116
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,332
That didn't factor in my decision.

117
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,687
It's almost as big as my wedding day.
You know, not as big.

118
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,137
Wikus was always making me things.

119
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,852
He said that way, they just mean so much more.

120
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,038
He left this papier-mache ball
on the sofa one day...

121
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,453
..and I didn't see it and I sat down and I-

122
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,041
I kind of squished it.

123
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,196
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation...

124
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,979
...and [ made them bring it all back.

125
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,400
-Congratulations, man.
-Oh, thanks, man.
a

126
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,939
-Okay, you're gonna go to P-7.
-Wikus. Wikus.

127
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,651
Leslie. How's it going, man?
There's the shake. P-9 for you.

128
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,972
I'm not saying what he did was right.

129
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,005
He took the choices that were given.

130
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,037
This is Trent. Fundiswa, Trent. Trent, Fundiswa.
a

131
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,630
Hi.
-Fundiswa's the guy that I've selected...

132
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,043
..to replace me. If he can make it today, eh?

133
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,914
-'ll make it.
-You think you can?

134
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,067
I just want everyone watching this...

135
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,183
..to learn from what has happened.

136
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,599
You would think things like this happen to
somebody else, not me.

137
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,063
Guys, don't forget to pack the stun grenades.

138
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,899
Tovi. There's Tovi.
How's it going, man? A long time, eh?

139
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,102
-You got my stuff?
-Hey, big boss.

140
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,904
-How’s it going?
-I'm all right.

141
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,172
This is Fundiswa. He's training with us today.

142
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,301
I think I was-- "Disgusted" would be the word.

143
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,013
There was always a hint of something
not kosher with van de Merwe.

144
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,684
Nobody saw it coming.
None of us had any idea of what he was doing.

145
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,127
I think it's a great thing that it's not the
military guys in charge this time.

146
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,045
Not to say that Koobus and the cowboys are not
wanted. You're always wanted.

147
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,793
You see now? These are the cowboys.

148
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,302
-Get out!
Fire!

149
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,721
They shoot first and then answer the questions.

150
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,660
You can see-- Hey, sorry, sorry.

151
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,095
That's above the allocated amount of ammunition.

152
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,351
Your pouches are full, but you still carry.

153
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,447
Maybe you should speak to the colonel.

154
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,305
just think that you should—

155
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,430
FNG over here says that
we got too much ammunition.

156
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,887
All I'm saying, Koobus, is that, you know,
you should find ways...

157
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,734
...of making your guys more efficient, you know?

158
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,420
Listen to me, you fuck!
Get that fucking camera out of my face.

159
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,021
Fucking doos.

160
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,609
There are rules. We're all living by rules.

161
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,260
I don't think he can be forgiven.
It was like a betrayal.

162
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,329
I've gotta get going, guys. I think we're gonna
have to cut this. We're gonna go.

163
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,434
This is tangled. This is tangled.

164
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,453
-Move it, move it.
a
-Come on, let's go.

165
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,089
-Hurry up. Go on. Go on.
-Go, go, go.

166
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,286
We've got four teams in the air and
three teams on the ground.

167
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,786
Got a visual on the ground crew.
We can take it into position.

168
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,347
Copy that.

169
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,269
These are full. Check your magazines, people.
Come on. Let's go.

170
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,603
The prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.

171
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,031
So we have to come there and say,
"Listen, this is our land.
a

172
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,202
Please will you go?"

173
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,651
It's difficult to put the vest on by yourself.

174
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,867
-Thomas, can you help me?
-They told me I was going to get a vest.

175
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,294
Just look-- Thomas, just look on the side
if there's a vest there.

176
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,853
-I'm concerned about my family.
-Look, don't worry. It'll be fine.

177
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,421
Rights groups have demanded that mercenaries...

178
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,797
.. Should comply with
all UlO regulations in District 9.

179
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,105
We're coming to you from
the entrance of District 9...

180
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,944
...a8 today Multi-National United
sets out to relocate...

181
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:19,295
.. approximately 1.8 million
alien residents from their homes.

182
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,829
Human-rights groups are keeping a watchful eye,
as many suspect...

183
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,466
...abuses might occur.

184
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,811
We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces...

185
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:50,318
...being deployed into District 9,
backed up by significant air support.

186
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,297
We go shack to shack and
get them to sign the form.

187
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,439
First one, E-X-triple-seven.

188
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,955
We're seeing the convoy stop and
the operation is about to begin.

189
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,783
-Arriving at destination.
-Just stay focused.

190
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,112
-You ready, Thomas?
-Yeah.

191
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,045
-Okay. Yeah, that's it.
-Here we go.

192
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,784
-Ready, boss?
-That's the signal.

193
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,076
Doors will now open. Please mind the step.

194
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,265
-You stay behind us. Good luck, boy.
-Sure, sure.
a

195
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,631
-No, no. Don't split up.
-Shit!

196
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,754
-Thomas.
-We've got the bastard.

197
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,799
Stay, stay, stay. Stay low.
Where is he going? What is he--?

198
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,379
Okay, Thomas, move away.

199
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,460
It's clear that security is very high...

200
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,204
..and it's only the beginning of
a total clampdown.

201
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,665
We are here to assist you.

202
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,241
Move out. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go!

203
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,550
Let's go. Move out. Let's go!

204
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,242
This is MNU agents.

205
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,208
-Open the door, please.
-Open up, open up. MNU are here.

206
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,012
-MNU.
-Always hold your badge up.

207
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,140
Hello. Hello. Hello.

208
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,060
Okay. This is Wikus van de Merwe from MNU.

209
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,490
We are here to serve you an eviction notice.

210
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,008
You just put your scrawl there.

211
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,560
Fuck offl

212
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,902
Okay, all right. Thomas, hold it.

213
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,888
We've got the scrawl. As he hit it--

214
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,260
That's what I was saying, it counts as a scrawl.

215
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,778
First time you come in, there'll always be a
little bit of tension between us—

216
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,695
Hey! Hey, food sack, you can't eat that, man.

217
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,431
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
Like a marshmallow.

218
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,287
No, no, no! Don't prod him.
Don't prod him like that.

219
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,547
Don't prod him.

220
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:41,786
Fuck.

221
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,581
You see that. Breaking the rules.

222
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,280
No, stay calm.

223
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,402
Okay, this is gonna be problems.
All the prawns are coming out.

224
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,837
They wanna see what's going on.
No, hey. Stop it! Stop it!

225
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,304
Horace, bring my goed.

226
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,444
See? Everybody's gathering now. Don't shoot.

227
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,514
-You're gonna turn it into a war zone.
-What is that? Tear gas?

228
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,853
-ls that tear gas?
-No, it's cat food.
a

229
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,329
It's cat food. I just distract them.

230
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,415
No, it's not my house. I don't live here.

231
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,319
That's a pity, because you know this--

232
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,959
Hell, this is a nice cat food, you know?

233
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,918
But it's not your house,
so we'll give it to someone else.

234
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,328
Yes! It is my house!

235
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,619
We need you to sign there. Okay, there it is.

236
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,605
Now you can take that. Okay, all right. Thomas.
Thomas, wait. Take it easy.

237
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,909
The creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food.

238
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,661
Something about that. It was like catnip for cats,
only a lot more intense.

239
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,296
Get down on the ground or I'll shoot.

240
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,858
Come on. Come on. That's it. Come on.

241
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,578
MNU are your friends.

242
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,367
Hello? MNU. We are here to serve eviction notices.

243
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,583
What is eviction?

244
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:46,948
Hold it, boys.

245
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,266
What we have stranded on Earth in this colony,
is basically the workers.

246
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,902
Don't think for themselves,
a
take commands, have no initiative.
a

247
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,422
They've lost all of their leadership through,
we presume, illness.

248
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,184
-We are here for you.
-Keep your fucking hands up.

249
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,951
--holding stable in The Nigerian compound area.

250
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,221
Where there's a slum, there's crime...
a

251
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,824
..and District 9 was no exception.

252
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,252
The Nigerians had various scams going.

253
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,625
One of them was the cat-food scam...

254
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,261
...where they sold cat food to the aliens for
exorbitant prices.

255
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,601
You put the money here first.

256
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,236
You don't get anything until you pay.

257
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,395
What are you trying to do?
I'l chop your balls off.

258
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,311
Not to mention interspecies prostitution.

259
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,186
And they also dealt in alien weaponry.

260
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,916
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there.

261
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,166
See that? That's somebody's car in there.

262
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,314
The Nigerians in District 9 are headed
by aman called Obesandjo.

263
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,306
He's a very powerful
underground figure in Johannesburg.

264
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,397
Don't play with these boys.
He'll cut you in four pieces.

265
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,949
-He will put you on each side of-
-Boss. Boss.

266
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,742
That's the boss there. Okay, no problems.
No. Keep walking.

267
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,066
Don't look at him. That's gonna cause problems.
Trent, don't film here now.
a

268
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,617
Double up, baby, double up.

269
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,603
-You've been drinking a little bit, eh?
-Watch the suit, man.
a

270
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,530
What are you doing with
these television sets here?

271
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,069
What's this?

272
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,425
Hey. Smile for the cameras there, eh?

273
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,967
-That's a first-day find.
-That's a big find.

274
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,920
You see this? Look at this. Trent.
Trent, look at this.
a

275
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,768
There's weapons all over here.

276
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,330
TK-57572.

277
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:43,607
Some of the guns are small.
But if it shoot you, it make a big mess.

278
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:52,045
MNU is trying to move the aliens
for humanitarian reasons...

279
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,285
...but the real focus, just as it has been right
from the beginning, is weapons.

280
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,400
MNU is the second-largest
weapons manufacturer in the world.

281
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,617
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien gun...

282
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:07,327
..and be able to shoot it.
It didn’t work like that.

283
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,199
As we discovered, their technology is engineered
in a biological manner...

284
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,674
..and interacts exclusively with their DNA.

285
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,656
So it just doesn't work with humans.
It's as simple as that.

286
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,565
This is basically a guy and
there's three humans here.

287
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,977
Basically, trying to make a warning, you know?

288
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,512
He's saying, "I killed three humans.
Watch out for me."

289
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,050
Hey, don't urinate on your own bloody--
Okay. Back up. Back up.

290
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,491
Back up, back up, back up. Guys. Thomas.

291
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,676
Control, this is Wikus requesting
First Battalion air support, please.

292
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,658
You want to talk to them or
you want to talk to me? Yeah, you can talk--

293
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,226
No, not them!
a

294
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:47,835
No.

295
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,070
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah, no, he had a spade.

296
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,118
Look! I find some!

297
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,824
I tell you before...

298
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,895
..this is human technology...

299
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,501
uit is useless.

300
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,005
Only our technology contains the fluid.

301
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,961
That is not our technology?

302
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,827
No, it's junk.

303
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,129
Keep looking.

304
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,917
I find something.

305
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,039
Yes. This is what we need.

306
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,857
Good, little one.
a

307
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:45,593
Get down.

308
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,501
Careful. Wait.

309
00:18:58,738 --> 00:18:59,758
There.

310
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,157
Why must it take so long?

311
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,193
Because it is very difficult...

312
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,060
..80 much can go wrong.

313
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,695
Twenty years of work.

314
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,594
Our plan is ready now?

315
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,869
Quiet. Listen.

316
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,480
They are coming.

317
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,602
To Control, van de Merwe unit.
a
This is Yankee-Foxtrot-5-3-0.

318
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,923
This is a dangerous area, you know.

319
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,909
You must hide this...

320
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,412
..they must not find it.

321
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,966
Answer the door and be polite.

322
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,533
Nol You take it.

323
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,273
Okay, now, you see, this is a problem.
This is a gang sign. You see this?

324
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,454
So again, looks like we have a--
Thomas, look sharp, eh?

325
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,517
Looks like we have more gang members.

326
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,122
Fundiswa, you just stay back.
You stay behind Thomas.

327
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,685
This place is swarming with MNU.

328
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,936
Open up!

329
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,171
will be searched.

330
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,928
I must get back to my son.

331
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,887
Don't make them angry. Be polite!

332
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,080
MNU agents. Open the door, please. Hello.

333
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,644
Nobody is here.

334
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,321
We would like you to please sign--
That's unacceptable.

335
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:19,781
Move out! Move out!

336
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,579
-That is totally unacceptable!
-Get out, you stupid prawn.

337
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,342
-That's bloody rude. Get outside.
-Come on. Move!

338
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,168
-Move! Move!
-Get outside.

339
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,990
We tried to talk nicely with you.

340
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:33,115
I tried to talk nicely with him, I did.
Get him out to the front there, Thomas.
a

341
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,323
-Keep moving.
-Cheeky bastard.

342
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,074
You got something in your house?

343
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,993
-All the way, Thomas.
-On your knees.

344
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,095
-I'm gonna have a look.
-Just stay there. Right there.

345
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,815
Sir, we have to serve you an eviction notice.

346
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,360
Do you understand that?

347
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,412
No.

348
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,293
This is a classic kind of gangster shack.
I can tell you...

349
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,110
...we gonna find weapons here.

350
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,705
Trent, watch your head. Don't hit the cow's head.

351
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,971
Just checking for panels.

352
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,643
You hear that? Yeah, it's hollow there.
a

353
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,924
See? Look at that. Look at that.

354
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,614
I haven't seen this type of setup.

355
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,252
It's almost like a chemistry type of a set.

356
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,334
There's gonna be something.

357
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,043
What is this kak?

358
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,811
What is this?

359
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,860
I don't know. This has got the markings there of-

360
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,256
So it's definitely alien.

361
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,083
But it's not a weapon.

362
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,887
But I don't trust it.
You know, I don't trust anything that--

363
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,224
Are you all right?

364
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,593
-Wikus, are you all right?
-Cut it. Turn it off.

365
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,077
Just switch it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

366
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,596
You gonna just-- You gonna cut that part,
Trent, out of this?
a

367
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,346
-Yeah.
-Where it sprays me.

368
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,583
We'll cut that.

369
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,106
We just found a dangerous object here.

370
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:04,943
It has a fluid in it that ! suspect might leak
onto people or cause damage.

371
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,714
So we just check that in and
we take that down nicely to the lab.

372
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,004
It's not a weapon, but it's dangerous.

373
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,893
He's got weapons somewhere here.

374
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,929
My sense is telling me that.
Let's check the other side here.

375
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,499
-Thomas.
-Yes, sir?
a

376
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,537
-Thomas, keep the gun on him.
-l got him.

377
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,962
Keep the gun on him, Thomas. There's weapons here.

378
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:27,082
This is Christmas. This is Christmas, my friends.

379
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,676
This is the biggest find that I've ever seen.

380
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,109
Control, come in. This is Wikus van de Merwe...
a

381
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,485
..fequesting First Reaction Battalion...

382
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,704
...at Foxtrot-Yankee-5-3-0.

383
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,925
-I'll send them out to you now, sir.
-Stand by, guys.

384
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,425
This I've never seen. Have you seen this?
Amazing. Look at this gun.

385
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,992
-Fuck, man.
a
-What gun is this?

386
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,488
-This is absolutely amazing.
-Just hold it still.

387
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,021
-What are you doing?
-l wanna show this to Thomas.

388
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,816
-You said we can't handle them.
-I'm just gonna show it.

389
00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:00,363
I'm not gonna use it.
It doesn't even work with humans.

390
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,803
-Thomas, look at this gun.
-Yeah. That's a big one, man.

391
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,217
That's not mine.

392
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,218
You're a dealer?

393
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,339
No.

394
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,196
You hear this? You see what's happening?

395
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,795
First Battalion, my friend,
you know what that means?

396
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,514
That means your days of flaunting
the law are over.

397
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,930
Have a look there. You see that? What's that?
That's a hiding for you.

398
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,763
That's a hiding.

399
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,355
-Hey. Hey.
-Stop that!

400
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,481
-Stand back!
-Hey.

401
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,143
Wikus!

402
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,492
Come here.

403
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,939
-Wikus, are you all right?
-Come here.

404
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,160
Where do you think you're going? Hey. Come on.

405
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,726
-Are you okay?
-Fuck offl

406
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,180
You don't run away from a chopper.
Where are you going?

407
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:02,904
No. No.

408
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,198
Skeet off. brother. Skeet off.
a

409
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,528
Koobus to base, come in.
a

410
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,718
I've got two people down.

411
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,203
MNU guard, MNU agent.

412
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,887
It's Foxtrot-Yankee-5-3-0, copy?

413
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,144
And we need a medevac ASAP.

414
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,606
No, that's fine, Koobus. I don't need the medevac.
a

415
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,276
-Wikus, you burned your arm.
-I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

416
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,047
It's not serious. I'll treat it here.

417
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,586
I think you must go to a doctor, a hospital.

418
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,065
-No.
-Get it checked out.

419
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:45,663
I'll just have it treated by the medics.
Just help me-- Help me up quick.

420
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,786
Did you see how fast that one was, Trent?

421
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,301
Yeah, he was fast.
a

422
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,586
Hell, this guy was fast, I promise you.

423
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,396
Look, I fix it...
a

424
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:03,821
... make it work.

425
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,279
I told you not to touch that.

426
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,097
What is wrong?

427
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,251
Nothing. Go outside and watch for humans.

428
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,522
Where is your friend?

429
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,359
He's gone.

430
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,673
-Are you okay?
-Just a bit hot. Are you hot?

431
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,272
-Are you hot, Trent?
-Yeah.

432
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,443
Yeah. If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

433
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,677
That's what [-- That's what I say.

434
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,129
-They are too dangerous. I understand.
-You see.

435
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:45,068
Another kid. There's just kids everywhere.
Kids everywhere.

436
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,921
This is what I mean.
This is why we get rid of them.

437
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,087
-The little ones.
-That's why we abort.

438
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,006
-Should I shoot the little bastard?
-You can't shoot it now.

439
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,542
It's illegal to do that.

440
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,587
-MNU agent, come out.
-Hello.

441
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,302
Hello, little guy. MNU.
Here's a sweetie for you, okay.

442
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,725
There you go. Eat your sweetie.

443
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,214
Yeah, he's gonna eat his sweetie.

444
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,686
Works like a charm every time, you know.

445
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,596
-Hey. Hey, come on! Hey!
-Fuck, man.
a

446
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:12,071
You almost poked my eye out
with a fucking lollipop.

447
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,514
-I tried to be fucking nice to you!
-Hey.

448
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,223
Fuck. Is this your fucking little runt here?

449
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,973
Inside, go!

450
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,544
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

451
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,903
You teach him some manners. Thomas, get him out.

452
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,725
Come. Get down! Had enough of you stupid things.

453
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,196
What do you want?

454
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,352
We're from MNU.

455
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,560
I know.

456
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,321
We require your scrawl on
this eviction notification.

457
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,411
Why aim I being evicted?

458
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,260
Yes, it's eviction notice.
a

459
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,688
Put your scrawl on the bottom. There's your name?

460
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,036
Yes?

461
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,237
Christopher Johnson. Put your name at the bottom.

462
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,454
It says you must give me 24 hours notice.

463
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,306
You're going to another place.
A city built for prawns.

464
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,033
And we're not even going to charge you. Okay?

465
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,415
This isn't legal.

466
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:55,616
Sign the fucking paper.

467
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:56,848
No.

468
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,522
You don't have a choice.
You have to sign the document.

469
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,712
This guy's obviously-- He's a little sharper.

470
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,278
You know? So we're gonna have to try something.

471
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:06,960
Hello.

472
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,922
Okay, seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?

473
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,820
Okay. So you've got a little one, eh?
Do you have a licence for that?

474
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,367
Yes.

475
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:20,242
You see this litter out here?
This is dangerous conditions for your child.

476
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,399
Article 75 says that because your child is living
in dangerous conditions...

477
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,097
...l'm gonna take him to Child Services.
I'l have a chat with your son.

478
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,144
You keep away from my child!

479
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,739
Don't-- Don't point your fucking tentacles at me.

480
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,952
Don't point your fucking tentacles at me.

481
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,577
You want to stay,
your boy is coming down with me...

482
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,629
..to Child Services. He's gonna spend
the rest of his life in a 1-by-1 metre box.

483
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,467
-Put the gun on him, Thomas.
-Hello, little guy.

484
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,513
It's the sweetie man coming.

485
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:51,056
Fuck. Look at this, Trent. Fuck.
a

486
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,360
Thomas. Thomas, keep the gun on him,
he's definitely a criminal.

487
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,403
He's got a whole computer shop here.

488
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,208
He's going nowhere, boss.

489
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,310
You know, this is amazing. I mean, this--

490
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:03,086
These are obviously, you can see,
stolen computers now...

491
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,225
..that he's decorating his place with.

492
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,761
Definitely doesn't have a permit for this.

493
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:11,077
Where is that fucking little runt?

494
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,707
Hello, it's the sweetie man.
a

495
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,601
Here's a sweetie-

496
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,896
Hey, I've got a s—

497
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,247
-Hey. Wikus.
-Trent, turn it off.
a

498
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,613
-Tur off the fucking camera, man.
-Wikus, are you okay, boss?

499
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,877
-Are you all right?
-Fuck off. Fuck offl

500
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,582
Shit.

501
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,624
-Shall I leave him?
-Just leave him here.

502
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,136
You're lucky.

503
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,333
We'll come back for you tomorrow, my friend.

504
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,132
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow, Christopher Johnson.

505
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,326
When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite but firm.

506
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,427
-A smile is cheaper than a bullet.
-Are you feeling better?

507
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,580
-What?
-How are you feeling?

508
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:04,045
I'm f- I'm fine. I'm all right.
I'm just-- I'm a bit dizzy.

509
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,547
Actually, just pull up there on the side.
I just wanna get something to eat here.

510
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:19,251
Are you sure you should be having that
after your whole puking episode?

511
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,192
actually feel a lot better.

512
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,139
-I think I needed to cleanse.
-Boss.

513
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,850
Boss.

514
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:27,948
-Boss. Your-
-Wikus, that's-- That's—
a

515
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,950
Black stuff coming out of your nose there.

516
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,167
Telephone call for Mr. Clark on Line 5.

517
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,164
It's a silver cylinder.

518
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,242
I can't find it.

519
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,341
We must find it.

520
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,703
It contains the fluid.

521
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:46,947
It's not here.

522
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,589
It has to be, keep looking.

523
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,880
We trade for 10,000 cans.
a

524
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,377
Certain factions of Nigerian gangs
want to extract weaponry from District 9...

525
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,629
..and have been trying to for years.

526
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,251
Give them one hundred cans.

527
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:23,978
One hundred.

528
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,866
Yes, yes, but we take all of them now.

529
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,154
All right, boys.

530
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,506
Get them the cat food. Hurry up.

531
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,473
And they amassed thousands of these weapons...

532
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,654
...without the ability to use them.

533
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:38,963
Fuck off! Gol

534
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,077
Hey, friend, not you. You stay here.

535
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,673
What do you want with me?

536
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,404
We just want to talk.

537
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:47,507
Talk about what?

538
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,754
Stupid prawn. They'll believe anything.

539
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,352
Muti is a South African word.

540
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:57,478
Today, it's synonymous
with witch-doctory and magic.

541
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,896
You cut it here.

542
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,518
This is the heart.

543
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,374
It cures high blood pressure when you boil it.

544
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,466
It cures diabetes, all diseases.
a

545
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,312
The Nigerians were consuming alien body parts.

546
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:17,995
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power...

547
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:20,857
..to use alien weaponry.

548
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,678
You must eat them...

549
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,966
..-and their power will live in you.

550
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,966
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man.

551
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,186
-Oh, baby, thank God.
-Hi, baby.

552
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:47,995
-[ need to get to the toilet.
-Why?

553
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,270
-Why are the lights off?
-What's the matter?

554
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:54,195
-[ might have crapped in my pants.
-Surprise!

555
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,710
-What's this for?
-Your promotion.

556
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,861
Oh, right. Got my promotion.

557
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,184
-Oh, Dad, how's it going?
-Good to see you.

558
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,265
Mom, how's it going? That's good.
Yeah, what a surprise, man.

559
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,755
-Congrats on the promotion.
-Yeah, no, thanks.
ce

560
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,091
Congratulations, boss. You're gonna be great.

561
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,927
-Thanks.
-Wikus, what happened?

562
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,906
Just had a small incident.
I'm just gonna go to the toilet...

563
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,482
..and then I'll talk to the people, okay?

564
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,425
-[ need to talk to you. Come with me.
-Okay, I just gotta—

565
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:25,398
-Guys, can you give us a moment?
-Sure, no problem.

566
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,427
What happened out there?

567
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,239
A small incident.

568
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:34,834
You know, an unruly prawn and
I just had to get him in my grasp.

569
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,920
Listen to me,
a
too many aliens died out there today.

570
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,816
UIO is all over my backside.

571
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,699
Focus. You're not going to fuck this up for me.

572
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,463
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can.

573
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,126
-Hi, there.
a
-Hey, it's nice to see you again.

574
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,654
Now, does this mean
a
he's in charge of this new operation?

575
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,880
-Yes.
-That's nice, eh?
a

576
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,178
Wikus? Baby, are you okay?

577
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:16,826
Okay, let's cut some cake.

578
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,339
Cut some cake.

579
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,754
-He doesn't look very well.
-Are you all right?

580
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,165
Just calm down, okay?

581
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,266
Wikus.

582
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,607
Dr. Smith, please come to Room 405. Dr. Smith.

583
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,685
Is it-? Is it badly infected?

584
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,654
There's a lot of suppuration.

585
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,029
Also, you should know on my right hand...

586
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,082
...some fingernails were coming loose.

587
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,464
And I had a black fluid coming out of my nose...

588
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,670
..and sort of a black vomit.

589
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,262
What happened to my arm?

590
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,284
-Just breathe deeply.
-What happened?

591
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,026
-This is oxygen.
-What is this?

592
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,846
Just breathe deeply. Calm down.

593
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,743
-Stay calm.
-Doctor, tell my wife.

594
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,817
Go tell my wife.

595
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:34,283
Attention, all medical staff members,
a
evacuate Ward 11 immediately.

596
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,290
All medical staff members,
a
evacuate Ward 11 immediately.

597
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,985
Who the fuck are you, man?

598
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,918
What the fuck is wrong with you?

599
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,150
Fuck you! Fuck you!

600
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,796
Get the fuck off me, you bitch! Fuck!

601
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,163
What are you assholes planning on doing?

602
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,016
Stop right there, madam.

603
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,731
What's going on? What are you doing to him?

604
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,464
-Let go of me!
-All right.

605
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,442
-Let me through. Let me through!
-Good to go. Come on.

606
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,775
-Wikus.
-Madam, get your hands off me.

607
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,101
Where are you taking him?

608
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,738
We have the infected agent onboard.

609
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,070
We're en route to MNU HQ
with an ETA of five minutes.

610
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,723
Unzip it. Unzip it.

611
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,321
Okay.

612
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,054
-You got him? You ready?
-Yeah. Got him.

613
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,910
Decided not to use any anaesthetic.

614
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,677
The reason being, with nitrous,
the subject reacts to-

615
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,185
-Blood pressure is way above normal.
-Calm down.

616
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:44,005
The arm is doing some really interesting things.

617
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,279
Aaron, what do you think we've got here?

618
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:51,112
We would have expected it to-
The antibodies to react and maintain.

619
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,016
-Dr. Visser?
-Yes?

620
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,645
I think you should see this.

621
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,287
I found it in his jacket.

622
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,013
Do you think this is alien?

623
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,935
No. No. No.

624
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,357
No, don't.
a

625
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,310
Don't. No.

626
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,383
Sons of bitches leave me-- Fuck.

627
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,049
Where is this?

628
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,944
What?

629
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,011
What--? What are they doing to these prawns?

630
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,330
Pain threshold, test one, DBX-7.
ee

631
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,342
Commencing test one, DBX-7.

632
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,433
Now that's a strong pain reaction.

633
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,442
That means the nerves have fused.

634
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,544
I mean, it's almost completely integrated.

635
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,834
Okay, do it.

636
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,497
-BD.
-Testing AMR-B5.

637
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,213
All right. Okay.

638
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,056
-Clear the range.
-Range fire.

639
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,998
-Now. Quickly.
-Quiet, please. We are now recording.

640
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,953
Swing it around.

641
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,270
-What are you doing?
-There we go.

642
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,768
What are you doing?

643
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:14,287
-Can you grip that?
-What is this?

644
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,946
-Put it through.
-Why are you doing that with the gun?

645
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,139
-Stand by to fire.
-Stand by.

646
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,614
-You want me to shoot that?
-Stand by.

647
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,712
-Stand back.
-[ cannot use this weapon.

648
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,125
And fire.

649
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,399
That's good.

650
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,533
-It worked. That's satisfactory.
-AMR-B5 test complete.

651
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,131
Right. Thanks very much. Load up another target.

652
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,482
-You got this?
-Do you know where my wife is?

653
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,669
Do you know if my wife knows where I am? Sir?

654
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,182
Where's my wife?

655
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,162
-Pull. Pull.
-I won't do that.

656
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,918
No, sir, I will not pull it.

657
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,193
What did you say about your wife?

658
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,971
-Fuck your wife.
-No, sir. No, please, sir. [ will--

659
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,458
-[ will not pull.
-Have to use the prod again.

660
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,334
Fire.

661
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,902
-B7.
-AMR-B7.

662
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,978
I'll pull it.
-He says he can pull it.

663
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,549
I can pull the trigger.

664
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,730
I said I would pull it.

665
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,082
-You rotten pig!
Fire.

666
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,879
-B21.
-AMR-B21.

667
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,734
Move. Hurry up. Move.

668
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,893
We want him in the centre, by the chain.

669
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:26,639
-Get this off me.
-Come on. Time. Time.

670
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:30,035
Hey, leave that fucking prawn, man.
will shoot a pig.

671
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,385
I'll shoot Sir. Listen.
I'll shoot a pig again for you.

672
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,632
I'll pull the trigger,
but I'm not shooting that prawn, hear me?

673
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,548
-Untie that fucking guy, man.
-B21. The human hand.

674
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,642
That's good. It worked.

675
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,737
Just untie that guy. Untie that guy, sir.

676
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,841
This is-- You can't use the real guy.
He didn't do anything.

677
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,721
Right. wanna observe this one. You prod him.

678
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,168
-Everybody standing by.
-Let him go.

679
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:56,497
Ready to go?

680
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,258
-Don't use a-- Oh, no.
a
-Three, two, one...
ee

681
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:00,997
-Don't, don't, don't.
oe
-...J0.

682
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,203
Amazing.

683
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,994
AMR-B?1 test completed.

684
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,542
All right. I think that’s all we need.

685
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,973
Gentlemen, you're running out of time.

686
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,002
This is the key stage in the metamorphosis.

687
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,077
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.

688
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,504
The problem is, as the infection spreads...

689
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,400
..the transition becomes
permanent and less active.

690
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,497
He's going to turn into one of them, a prawn?

691
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,486
What happens to him isn't important.

692
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,828
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.

693
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,497
This body represents hundreds of millions...

694
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,850
..maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology.

695
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,013
There are people out there,
governments, corporations...

696
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,444
...who would kill for this chance.

697
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,043
-Will he survive the procedure?
-No, of course not.
a

698
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:59,015
We need everything. Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

699
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,821
The procedure's gonna basically
strip him down to nothing.

700
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,801
What about next of kin?

701
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:08,386
Please, help me. Don't let them do it.

702
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,113
I'll handle that.

703
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,740
Okay. I say, let's go.

704
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,067
Good. Thank you.

705
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:31,028
I don't understand. None of this makes any sense.

706
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,639
He just hurt his arm, Dad.

707
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,690
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

708
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,804
They're doing their best to save him.

709
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,638
We're starting to harvest material
from the specimen.

710
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,890
We'll start with soft tissue first.
Cut through the chest cavity.

711
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:52,345
We need to get the heart out quickly.

712
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,120
Once the septicaemia set in, it just spread.

713
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,364
-Don't touch me with this gas!
-Calm down.

714
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,377
You know Wikus.

715
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,850
He never was very strong.

716
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,096
I'll go through the chest,
straight into the heart.

717
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,173
-That should quiet him down.
-Fuck you!

718
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:11,965
Can I see him?

719
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,779
Not a good idea.

720
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,214
Fuck you. Fuck you!

721
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,110
You don't fucking come near me.
Don't fucking come near me.

722
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,417
Fuck you. You big fucking man, huh?

723
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:43,116
Hey. Hey. Drop the knife.

724
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:46,658
Fuck you! Drop that thing or
I'll fucking cut his eyes out.

725
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,787
Okay. All right. Okay.

726
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:53,929
-We're gonna get you, mate.
-l'll fucking kill you. I'll kill you.

727
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:06,611
You need to let go of him now.

728
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:14,194
That's okay, Tania. Everything will be okay.

729
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,127
Smit.

730
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,027
When?

731
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,279
Get Koobus.

732
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,716
Hey, hey, wait, man.

733
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,634
Wikus van de Merwe, white male, mid-30s...
a

734
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,898
..ls considered highly dangerous.

735
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,257
-Hello?
-Hi, baby.

736
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,318
-Wikus? Is that you?
-lt's Wikus—

737
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,747
Mrs, Smit? Hi.
-How dare you phone us.

738
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,626
-What are all these people doing?
-None of your business.

739
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,973
I need to speak to Tania straightaway.

740
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,571
It's my house.
This is my phone that you are using.

741
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,937
-I'm fucking-- What?
-It's disgusting.

742
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:36,067
-He tried calling me.
-Anton, it's me. It's me. Accept--

743
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,717
Accept the call.

744
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,884
I've been friends with you
for fucking 19 years, man.

745
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,622
Fuck offl What are you watching, man? Fuck offl

746
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:46,334
We thought it was for the best
because he needed help.

747
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:51,185
Special medical help.
And he wasn't gonna get that as a fugitive.

748
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,383
Move, move, move.
oe

749
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,130
Go, go, go.

750
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:02,031
He became the most valuable
business artefact on Earth.

751
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,722
He was the only human who had ever...

752
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,701
.. Successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive.

753
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:15,076
But his real value was
that he could operate alien weaponry.

754
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,145
Hello.

755
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,799
Can I get seven schnitzel burgers
and a large sauer klopse, please?

756
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,770
We interrupt this programme
to bring you breaking news.

757
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,986
A patient has escaped from
the isolation ward and is loose in the city.

758
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,811
Wikus van de Merwe was recently apprehended...

759
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,673
...after prolonged sexual activity
with aliens in District 9.

760
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,394
Oh, you bliksem.

761
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,822
[ have to call my manager.

762
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:48,637
That's totally untrue.
You are legally obliged to serve me.

763
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,790
--which Is causing bodily disfigurement.

764
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,235
Can I buy your burger, please? If ! could just--

765
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:55,118
-It's contagious.
-Don't listen.

766
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,098
Police warn people to stay
at least 20 metres away.

767
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,529
No, look at this hand. This hand is fine!
a

768
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:04,182
If you have any information regarding the
whereabouts of Mr. van de Merwe...

769
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:07,729
...please contact us immediately on
0-800-STOP-WIKUS.

770
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,991
-You fucking freak! Stop!
-Don't go away, after the break...

771
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:23,569
-Hi. This is Tania.
-And Wikus.

772
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,831
We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message. Bye.

773
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,042
-Bye-bye.
-Good things!

774
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:44,424
Control, this is Bird Dog 7.
We're set up at all major exits to the city.

775
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:49,549
There's no sign of Mr. van de Merwe.
We are in total lockdown at this point.

776
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:16,397
The entire world was watching him.

777
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:20,561
He was on every radio station,
every image on television.

778
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:23,612
Anything you could find had his face on it.

779
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,431
So he had nowhere else to go.

780
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:29,084
He ended up hiding in the one place he knew...

781
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:32,277
...No0 one would ever come looking for him.

782
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,853
I'm not playing here. 6 rand 50 or nothing.

783
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,296
I pay you next week, I promise.

784
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,165
No money, you get nothing.

785
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,850
Fucking prawn, this isn't a charity.

786
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:08,079
Hello. I'd like to buy some meat, please.

787
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:14,151
Yes, have you got hamburger or,
you know, steak roll?

788
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:16,872
Does it look like a hamburger shop?

789
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:18,938
-Which one do you want?
-Goat, then.
a

790
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,346
Come on, come on, come on, man.
a
I don't have all day here.

791
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,714
-ls that cat food there?
-Yeah, itis.
a

792
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,209
That's cat food, eh? I'll have some of that, guys.

793
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:28,567
-ls that all?
-Yeah.

794
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,990
Fuck, man.
a

795
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,606
Hello? Hello?

796
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:16,816
Ba--

797
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,898
Baby, is that you? Tania?

798
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,505
Oh, God, please, let it be you.

799
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,455
-Yes, it's me.
a
-Baby—

800
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:30,342
I'm so happy you called me, baby.

801
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,461
-Wikus, listen to me.
a
-Okay.

802
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:38,675
I have something to say to you
and it's not gonna be easy.

803
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,799
No, okay, look. Listen, baby,
before you say anything.

804
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,576
Your father is working against me, baby.
He's lying to you.

805
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,413
I did not have sex with one of these...

806
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,611
..fucking creatures, man.

807
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:54,326
I would never have
any kind of pornographic activity...

808
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:57,281
...with a fucking creature. Baby--

809
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,250
But they said that
you'd become obsessed with them.

810
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:02,754
I can't do this.

811
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,529
Baby, please, don't give up on me, you know?

812
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,410
Don't give up on me because ! can-- I--

813
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,647
I wanna see you again, baby.
And I'm gonna fix my arm...

814
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,903
..and I'm gonna see you again...

815
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,619
..and I'm gonna kiss you and
I'm gonna hold you again.

816
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:20,982
I don't want you to hold me again.

817
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,678
Baby?

818
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:29,722
Baby?

819
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,653
Hey, hey. What the--?
Hey, hey. Hey, man. Hey.

820
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:08,014

824
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,315
What do you want?

825
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,265
Copy, control. No sign of the target.
Moving to Sector 6.

826
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,695
You have to go.

827
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,990
Okay, please, I need your help. Okay?

828
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,874
Okay. We gonna play hide and seek.

829
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,226
Yes! Yes!

830
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,321
You wanna help me hide?

831
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:22,502
No, get back.

832
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:23,793
Show me your favourite hiding place.

833
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,004
Please, just go.

834
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:27,370
Leave us alone.

835
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,134
No. Please, you don't- I need to hide.

836
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,838
Okay? They're coming.
They wanna kill me. All right?

837
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:38,018
I just need to hide here, sir, for five minutes.
Okay? I just need to-

838
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:52,566
What is this kak? What are you doing here?
l remember you.

839
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:54,897
Nothing. You must hide somewhere else.

840
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:58,702
Please, sir, you have to help me.
I'm losing blood. They're trying to kill me.

841
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,173
Only one thing that could make that happen.

842
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:19,896
Quick, we have to hide him.
a

843
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,760
Now you, get down there.

844
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,800
Where the fuck I am?

845
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,078
Where's the fluid?

846
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,639
What did you do with it?

847
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:41,881
Please.

848
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:43,116
You took it.

849
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:44,414
I don't know what you're talking about.

850
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:45,858
I know you did.

851
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,705
I can see what's happening to you.

852
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,866
Tell me where it is.

853
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:55,154
Right, right.

854
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,090
Was it a black fluid in a glass container?

855
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:01,159
Yes, that's it. Yes!
a

856
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,995
Right. confiscated it,
and the guys at the lab took it.

857
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,416
It'll be at MNU. MNU has it.

858
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,666
Okay. Okay.

859
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,698
What is this?

860
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:21,267
You ruined everything.

861
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,232
Where is this?

862
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:28,627
Is that your shack?

863
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,951
This whole thing's under your shack?

864
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:37,033
For 20 years you've had
this fucking thing hidden down here. This is

865
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:40,132
This is very illegal.

866
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,941
[ mean, this is a fine, you know, if they--

867
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:45,748
If they catch you with this.

868
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,879
Fuel goes in here!

869
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,638
That's enough! Quiet!

870
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:55,761
Then we fly away.

871
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,070
I said quiet! We cannot trust him.

872
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:01,802
What is he saying about the fuel?
Are you trying to start this thing?

873
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:05,558
Are you little fuckers
trying to start this and get away, eh?

874
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,806
Never mind.

875
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:10,015
Yeah, you sneaky fucking prawns, eh?

876
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,644
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

877
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,310
What? What did you say about the fixing?

878
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,241
What, you could fix me?

879
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,480
Forget it.

880
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:22,815
It doesn't matter, it's too late.
a

881
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,933
No. No. Listen, listen.
a
Are you saying that you could turn this--

882
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:30,611
This prawn hand into a human hand?
You can make me human again?

883
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,261
We have medical machines on
the mother ship that can fix you. Yes.

884
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,453
We can use this ship to fly up there.

885
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,090
That's fantastic. You guys are brilliant, eh?

886
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,435
! always thought the prawns were intelligent.

887
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,192
Let's do it.

888
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,440
I don't have fluid.

889
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:53,125
I could fix you and I could fly away.
But I don't have fluid.

890
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,497
Right. Right. Okay.

891
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,783
All right, I'll tell you what, why don't we go--?

892
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:01,252
Let's get some more. Let's go collect some up.

893
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:05,437
It took 20 years to collect that amount.

894
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,769
Fuck, man. Fuck!
a

895
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:12,076
Fuck! The only one is the one I confiscated?

896
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:13,953
Yes.

897
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,114
It's four storeys under ground.

898
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,187
Why's he keep looking at me like that?

899
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,038
He likes you.

900
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,081
We are the same.

901
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,346
Fuck off, man. I'm not the same.
a

902
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,910
Not the fucking same.

903
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:43,185
There is a way out of this.

904
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,550
We get the fluid back from MNU.

905
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:52,616
And what then? Then we both die, eh?
a
Both of us dead.

906
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:57,537
That's a suicide mission. Can you not fill my head
with that sort of nonsense?

907
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,510
The transformation is accelerating.

908
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,879
You do not have much time.

909
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,639
Oh, Christ.
a

910
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:40,015
Fuck. Okay.

911
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:01,215
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

912
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,271
-Hello?
-Wikus?

913
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,781
-Tania? Baby.
-Are you okay?

914
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,064
Oh, God. Thank God.
a

915
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,366
Where are you?

916
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,969
All those things my father said...

917
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,645
I know he was trying to protect me.

918
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,946
just don't know what to believe anymore.

919
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:45,089
Baby, baby, I know, but listen to me.
It's all lies.

920
00:59:45,649 --> 00:59:49,049
I swear to you. Everything he said to you is lies.

921
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,013
I know.

922
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,573
What? What?

923
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:57,271
I believe you, Wikus. I just want you back.

924
00:59:57,861 --> 00:59:59,881
I want everything back the way it was.

925
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:04,462
That's-- Baby, that's what ! want.
That's what-- That's great.

926
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:09,485
That's great news. 1 can make it the way it was,
if you take me back.

927
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:14,227
But how? How can we go back?

928
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:21,198
I have a plan, and I know how to fix it.
All right?

929
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,781
I know how to fix myself. And it'll be me...

930
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:25,864
..and we'll be back together.

931
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:28,363
You promise me?

932
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:30,522
I promise you, baby.

933
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:36,755
Don't give up on me, okay?
Because I haven't given up on you, all right?

934
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,834
I won't.

935
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:41,209
I love you.

936
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,808
I love you too.

937
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,791
-Tell me you got a fix on him.
-D-9.

938
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:57,972
How many moons does our planet have?

939
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,197
Seven.

940
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,926
This planet only has one.

941
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,984
I can't wait to see our planet.

942
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:14,836
It is bigger than this one, isn't it?

943
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,138
Enough.

944
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:19,882
We go home now?

945
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:24,437
Not home. No.

946
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:28,742
This is where we must go.

947
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,230
See that tent there?

948
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,821
That might be ours.

949
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,161
[ want to go home!

950
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:44,029
We can't go home. Not anymore.

951
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,457
Hi. You don't wanna go to the tents.
They're not better.

952
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,754
They're smaller than the shacks.

953
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,229
Actually more like a concentration camp.

954
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:03,172
If can get you that black fluid,
what happens then?

955
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:05,797
We go up to the mother ship.

956
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,003
And you can start that thing?

957
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,391
Yes.

958
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:14,577
Okay. So just to be clear, this is gonna go back--

959
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,460
This is gonna go back to be human like this.

960
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:22,310
I can go home.

961
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:25,256
And then, you can go home. You can take your boy.

962
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:28,619
You can take all the prawns.
If could get you that fluid, right?

963
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:32,659
You said it was a suicide mission.

964
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,403
Maybe you were right.

965
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,413
We have no weapons. They'll shoot us on sight.

966
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,538
Look. Look, Christopher.

967
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,697
I know where we can get weapons.

968
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,945
Hi, guys. Hello. Hi, hi. Hello.

969
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,940
-I'd like to buy some weapons, please.
-No, no, no. Hold it.
ce

970
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,583
How did you do this one, my man?

971
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,757
It's doggy-style with a demon.

972
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:13,211
You're one brave white man.

973
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,360
Were you wearing a condom?

974
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,553
I need to buy weapons, please.

975
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,337
You and I both know that
there are illegal weapons inside there.

976
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:29,105
I have money and I would like to
buy some of those wea--

977
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,613
Okay. Okay. Okay.

978
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,128
-I brought you here to make me money.
-Sit. Don't move around.

979
01:03:38,715 --> 01:03:41,055
You're fucking wasting my time.

980
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,335
Shut up. Fucking lying bitch.

981
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:56,281
Thank-- Thank you, sir, for your time.
Thank you very much for seeing me.

982
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:59,770
! would like to buy some weapons.

983
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:04,926
AK-47, some grenades, maybe tear-gas canisters.

984
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,505
I see you have limpet mines here, as well.

985
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:11,924
And l also see you guys have
alien weapons there, which is great.

986
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,901
I could have one or two of those.

987
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,728
I have money, okay?

988
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,274
Now, I'm s—
a

989
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,214
Sir. Please, sir. Please, sir. Please, sir.
a

990
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,110
I've heard about you.

991
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:29,932
Where do you have it?

992
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,466
Show me.

993
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:33,202
Oh, shit!
a

994
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:36,281
Come here. Come.

995
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,203
Shit.

996
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,246
No, no, no. No, please.

997
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:53,939
Why are you doing that? Why is he--?
What is he--? What do you want?

998
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,161
-What do you--?
-Shut up.

999
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:57,955
Please.

1000
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,231
Sir, don't.
a

1001
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,732
Forget the weapons. Forget the weapons.

1002
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,192
Forget the weapons.

1003
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,053
I want the arm. Cut it off.

1004
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,658
What's he saying? What does he want?
What did he say?

1005
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:10,361
What does he want? What does he-?

1006
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,013
I'll show you. I'm gonna teach you.

1007
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:23,856
Hey, hey, hey.

1008
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:26,815
Holy shit.

1009
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,272
You tell them to stand down.

1010
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:41,433
You tell them to be quiet.

1011
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:44,448
You, back off. Put your gun down.

1012
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,437
Tell them to put the weapons in the bag, man.

1013
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:50,841
Fuck. Give me the fucking weapons, man.

1014
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,812
Don't you fucking look at me.

1015
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,958
I said don't fucking look at me.

1016
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,467
How did you get that hand?

1017
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,060
Fucking hurry up, man.

1018
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:10,828
Look at me when I fucking speak to you.

1019
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:12,254
What is your secret?

1020
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,595
What did you do?

1021
01:06:13,937 --> 01:06:15,167
Tell me.

1022
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,310
! want that fucking arm.

1023
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,455
What the fuck did you do?

1024
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:22,654
You fucking mizungo, I'm coming for you.

1025
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,419
I'm coming for you. I'm going to get you.

1026
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:27,526
Drop the fucking knife.

1027
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:30,104
-Drop your fucking knife!
-Easy, easy.

1028
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:40,100
And no live ammo. He's useless to us dead.

1029
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:41,937
Would you relax?

1030
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,612
For fuck's sakes. My men have done this
a hundred times before.

1031
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:49,582
Maintaining a visual on that location at
November-Alpha-1-9-1-1.

1032
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,793
-The unit is closing in now, sir.
-It's gonna be quick.

1033
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:55,974
It's gonna be clean.

1034
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,350
And best of all...

1035
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:00,952
..it's gonna be quiet.

1036
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,381
Van de Merwe hasn't got a clue
what's coming his way.

1037
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,725
It's empty.

1038
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:11,113
Where are they?

1039
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,445
The target is gone. The place is empty.

1040
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:17,104
What do you mean, "empty"? Where the fuck is he?

1041
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,886
That little shithead has got no idea
what's coming his way.

1042
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,731
I'm gonna find him.

1043
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,440
Security breach, Level 2.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.

1044
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,337
Do not use—

1045
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:36,185
There are the guards. At the gate.
Watch the guards at the gate, man.

1046
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:38,083
Come on.

1047
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,006
Security breach, Level 2.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.

1048
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,779
Move. Get out. Get out!

1049
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,024
-Don't shoot!
-Go.

1050
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,204
Going down. Four storeys down.

1051
01:07:54,037 --> 01:07:56,227
This is alien weaponry. Give me a status report.

1052
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,289
Security breach, Level 4. Bio lab.

1053
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,428
-It's van de Merwe. He's on Level 4.
-Switch to live ammo.

1054
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,151
-We're taking him out.
-Colonel.

1055
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,397
We were ordered not to use live ammunition.

1056
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,019
-They want him alive.
-Security breach--

1057
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:14,077
Open up! Get the fuck out!
Don't fucking look at me. Get out!

1058
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:15,797
Get the fuck out!

1059
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:22,567
Okay.

1060
01:08:29,671 --> 01:08:32,631
-Move, move, move.
oe
-Get out! Everybody get the fuck out!

1061
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:35,996
Get out! Go! Move out of here now!

1062
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:39,038
I'l send you home in a fucking jar. Go!

1063
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,179
What is this place?

1064
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,296
Don't worry about that.

1065
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,210
What do they do in here?

1066
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:46,895
It's in one of these.

1067
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,415
Check these. Check these boxes.

1068
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:54,133
Any kind of a box that looks like it
can hold a tube. Just check that.

1069
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:56,353
These fuckers.

1070
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,769
Go, go, go.

1071
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:05,609
Clear.

1072
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:13,636
-Security breach...
-I got it! I got it.

1073
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:20,323
Chris, I got it. Let's go. Let's go.

1074
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,401
Christopher.

1075
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:30,586
Christopher, listen, look at me. Listen to me.

1076
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,477
We need to leave now. Okay?

1077
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:36,023
The whole of MNU is gonna come down here.

1078
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,936
He's going to destroy us.

1079
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:42,068
We are big, but quick. We can do this.

1080
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,819
-Okay, we're gonna get out of here.
-Target. Fire!

1081
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,019
Move, move, move.
oe

1082
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,003
Move down the row. Move.

1083
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:57,939
Cover the sides.

1084
01:10:01,264 --> 01:10:02,694
The bugs, the bugs, the bugs!

1085
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:06,887
Think of your boy, for fuck's sake.

1086
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,612
What are you doing?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1087
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,198
Move, movel
a

1088
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,101
You'll get us killed.

1089
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,533
What do we do now?

1090
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,985
Fuck, yeah, man. Come on.

1091
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,661
It's a fucking dead end.

1092
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:31,616
I thought you had a way out?

1093
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,081
I didn't say anything about a way out.
I promised you we'd get in. We're in.

1094
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:36,568
I have an idea.

1095
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:37,859
What? Where are you going?

1096
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:39,281
Follow me.

1097
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,155
Follow you?

1098
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:45,874
What are you doing?

1099
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,225
Making a bomb!

1100
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:48,217
I've got you, Wikus.

1101
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:48,991
Let's go!

1102
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:49,728
It's a dead end.

1103
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:04,595
Come on. Get in.

1104
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,873
Go! Drive!

1105
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:10,478
Okay.

1106
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:14,346
Okay, hold on.

1107
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:27,392
Reports are coming in of an explosion
in downtown Johannesburg.

1108
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,457
Well, there was a terrorist attack,
a
but l can assure you we've dealt with it.

1109
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:39,702
Drop it now. We drop it now. The cunt!

1110
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,144
They're really pissed at us now.

1111
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,410
Shit.

1112
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:01,996
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1113
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,236
Don't drop that fucking thing.

1114
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:17,648
Come on, come on, come on. Move. Get down there.
a

1115
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,747
Go down and initiate the binary commands.

1116
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,003
Set it down right now.

1117
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,819
When we get to the mother ship,
how long is this gonna take?

1118
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,485
To do what?

1119
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:31,927
The fixing. To fix me.

1120
01:12:32,582 --> 01:12:34,312
It's going to take a bit longer than I thought.

1121
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,090
Okay. All right. That's fine.
How long do you need?

1122
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,117
Three years.

1123
01:12:39,589 --> 01:12:41,639
Sorry, wait. Just go slowly with the clicks there.

1124
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:45,523
It sounded like you said "three years.”
Like human years.

1125
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:48,329
Yes. Three years.

1126
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,208
What? Three fucking years?

1127
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,517
[will fix you...

1128
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:57,630
..-but first ! must save my people.

1129
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,334
The deal was, you go home, I get fixed.

1130
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:05,318
I will not let my people be medical experiments!

1131
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:08,155
I'm a fucking medical experiment. You hear me?

1132
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:10,991
'm a fucking medical experiment, man.

1133
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,880
I must go home and get help.
I must use all the fluid to travel quickly.

1134
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,957
I'll just stay here, Christopher.
I'll just stay here in this shack.

1135
01:13:22,665 --> 01:13:24,215
And I'll see you in three years tine?

1136
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:25,944
I will come back. I promise.

1137
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:27,735
Hey, Christopher.

1138
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,770
Arriving on the ground.
First Reaction Battalion is in pursuit. Over.

1139
01:13:50,393 --> 01:13:51,683
Where the fuck is he?

1140
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:54,995
Hey.

1141
01:13:55,398 --> 01:13:57,648
You got Wikus down there, my boy?

1142
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:00,268
Father!

1143
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:04,366
No. Your daddy needs to stay there to
sort out a few things, all right?

1144
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:08,384
But we're gonna go and we're come back
and fetch him. Okay? All right?

1145
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:13,435
In here?

1146
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:14,416
In there.

1147
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:15,826
It goes in here, eh?

1148
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:18,555
How the fuck do you open this, prawn?

1149
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,418
Father.

1150
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:26,706
Tell me, you fucker.
You want me to fucking kill you?

1151
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:30,859
Hey? Is that what you fucking want? Hey?

1152
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:36,915
Hey?

1153
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:43,169
Okay. Let's see.

1154
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:47,088
What?

1155
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,849
What? Okay. There's no buttons.

1156
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:51,676
-On.
-Openit.

1157
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:55,232
-Activate.
-You have five seconds to tell me.

1158
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:58,628
One prawn, one bullet.

1159
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:07,187
I can't believe I get paid to do this.

1160
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:12,268
I love watching you prawns die.

1161
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,360
What the fuck, man?
a

1162
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,530
Oh, fuck.
a

1163
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:24,947
All right. Okay. Okay.

1164
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,115
Father!

1165
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,401
Get out! Now!

1166
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:42,974
This is remarkable.

1167
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:45,589
It looks like something is
emerging from the ground.

1168
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:48,128
Something is definitely coming out of the ground.

1169
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:50,691
All right. All right. Okay. Okay, steady.

1170
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,849
Fuck it.

1171
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:02,692
Go sit down. You can't play here now.
Your Uncle Wikus is flying.

1172
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,782
Uncle Wikus is flying now, all right?

1173
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:07,528
Fuck. Fuck off.

1174
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:17,631
-Hold your track on that target.
-Affirmative, colonel.
a

1175
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:19,664
Fire when locked.

1176
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:25,942
It seems to be drifting towards
the centre of the territory.

1177
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:27,922
-We have a lock.
Fire!

1178
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,622
Something has fired upon it. Yes, it's been hit.

1179
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,821
What the fuck is that?

1180
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,916
One of the engines is billowing smoke.
It's out of control.

1181
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:42,701
It's going down, boss.
Should I send the boys to fuck him up?

1182
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,625
--now, and-- And it's hit the ground.
A massive impact.

1183
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,792
And it's come to a standstill.

1184
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,210
My son!

1185
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,516
My son's in there!

1186
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:05,191
Shut the fuck up! Get this fuck inside.
We're moving out. Come, let's go!

1187
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:09,775
-Move him out. That's it.
-Move!

1188
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:12,729
We're banking around,
trying to get a better view...

1189
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:14,629
...Of the ship, which is wrecked.

1190
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,610
Waiting for some of the smoke to clear.

1191
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:22,499
Somebody has been pulled out of the vehicle.

1192
01:18:22,965 --> 01:18:24,425
It looks like a human being.

1193
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,293
We are getting unconfirmed reports
that this might be...

1194
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,386
...Wikus van de Merwe,
a
a fugitive that has been on the run...

1195
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,900
..from Multi-National United for the past week.

1196
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:37,392
They're loading him into a vehicle now
and heading off.

1197
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:45,634
Battalion One to Control,
a
confirming prisoners are secured and travelling.

1198
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:49,252
Expect delivery by 1600 hours.

1199
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,163
What the fuck?

1200
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:09,473
Back up.

1201
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:16,941
Watch out. Watch out.

1202
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,195
We found him, boss.
a

1203
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:22,760
Bring him to me.

1204
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,622
Get up. Move! Move!

1205
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,252
-Take cover. Fall back.
-We need to regroup.

1206
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:44,916
What the fuck?

1207
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:52,813
Control, we're taking enemy fire.

1208
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:55,442
We need support. Backup. Backup now!

1209
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,000
Fuck off! No, fuck off, man!
a

1210
01:20:13,776 --> 01:20:15,736
Get your hands off me. Fucking get off me!

1211
01:20:20,049 --> 01:20:23,329
Get your fucking hands off me!
I'll fucking kill you.

1212
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:02,433
Didn't I tell you...

1213
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:03,938
...that I'm going to get you?

1214
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:07,223
You came that day and left with something
that belongs to me.

1215
01:21:09,665 --> 01:21:10,835
Fuck you.

1216
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:23,074
Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck youl

1217
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:34,485
Go, go, go.

1218
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:37,788
Arriving at location. Over.

1219
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:47,369
Additional troops are moving into place.

1220
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,307
Go, go, go.

1221
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:52,723
Kill them! Kill all of them!

1222
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:56,411
Move it.

1223
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,885
-Koobus!
-Cover the eastern block.

1224
01:22:00,716 --> 01:22:01,676
I told you...

1225
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,848
..that the day would come.

1226
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,970
You've been running around with my prize.

1227
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:11,697
All l want is to eat that arm and become like you.

1228
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:14,001
No, no, no. It won't work.
ce

1229
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,135
-Go, go, go.
-Move it.

1230
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:20,027
Once ! have that power...

1231
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:21,869
..-no one will stop me.

1232
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:23,321
It was your turn...

1233
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:25,576
..Now it's mine.

1234
01:22:28,911 --> 01:22:31,841
With MNU security forces,
this armed faction is st-

1235
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:35,005
It won't work.

1236
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,188
Let's cut here.

1237
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:46,884
Fuck.

1238
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:55,892
Fuck.

1239
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:05,017
We're getting reports of alien devices activating
throughout the city.

1240
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:09,187
--starting to work again after 20 years-

1241
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,299
-Pienaar?
-Yeah.

1242
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:09,344
-See that prawn in the Casspir?
-Yeah.

1243
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,928
He knows what the fuck is up with that ship.

1244
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,751
Get the fucker out and get him talking now.

1245
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,085
-Kronier.
-Cover.

1246
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,813
--contractors are closing in on
the Nigerian compound, and it-

1247
01:25:33,028 --> 01:25:37,308
Over here, cunt. Come outside,
ce
you fucking alien. Come here.

1248
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:48,466
What's your plan, huh?

1249
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,746
Move, move, move.
oe

1250
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:15,552
How are you doing that?

1251
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,298
Who's moving that ship?

1252
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:23,059
All right. That's very comfort--

1253
01:26:23,612 --> 01:26:25,102
Fucking bliksem.

1254
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:31,446
Wait for my command.
Make sure you fucking shoot to kill.

1255
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:39,643
-Fall back.
-What the fuck?

1256
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,868
Move it, move it.
a

1257
01:26:42,798 --> 01:26:45,728
Take the right flanks. Take that fucker down.

1258
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,800
Hold your fire. Hold your fire
and keep your positions.

1259
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:57,754
It's van de Merwe.

1260
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,857
Hey, Dickus.

1261
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:19,063
You may have the prawn.
Okay? Just let me fucking go.

1262
01:27:19,668 --> 01:27:21,128
-Run, Wikus.
a
-You let me go.

1263
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:23,086
-Run!
-You let me go.

1264
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:27,925
And keep on running, you fucking coward. Run! Run!

1265
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:30,114
Control. This is Control.

1266
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:33,911
Get the air support up and
get on his fucking tail now!

1267
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,952
Copy that. Air support is dispatching now. Over.

1268
01:27:37,486 --> 01:27:39,236
It's not gonna work, boss.

1269
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:42,148
He's a tough one. He's not gonna talk.

1270
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:44,534
Then just fucking kill him.

1271
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,744
-He's not gonna talk.
-Then just fucking kill him.

1272
01:28:02,244 --> 01:28:03,114
Fuck.

1273
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:07,014
-He's a tough one. He's not gonna talk.
-Then just fucking kill him.

1274
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:29,406
Hey. Come on.

1275
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:31,880
I'll get you out of here.
I'll get you to the drop ship.

1276
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:33,544
I can't, it's too far.
a

1277
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:35,608
It's not too fucking far. Get up.

1278
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,504
I'm gonna get you there.
I'm gonna get you to your boy.

1279
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,507
Come on. Stay behind me. Stay behind me.

1280
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,230
Retreat! Fall back! Fall back!

1281
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:56,543
Fall back, fall back, fall back.
a

1282
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,794
Come on, run, run, run. Go.
a

1283
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:06,934
Arriving at location now.

1284
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:08,982
We have clearance to engage.

1285
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:11,754
It's coming towards us. Get down, get down.

1286
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:17,044
Take up positions to the east.

1287
01:29:17,419 --> 01:29:18,318
Go, guys. Go. Move.

1288
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,730
JJ, go for point three. Okay, go, go, go.

1289
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,840
He's heading for the drop ship.
Cut those fuckers offl

1290
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:41,608
What the fuck?

1291
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:49,729
-Shit.
-You fuck.

1292
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:52,022
Are you hurt?

1293
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:56,834
No, we can make it. I think the ship's stopping.
We can make it. Come on.

1294
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:06,018
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1295
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:17,045
Listen, you go ahead. You can make it.

1296
01:30:17,646 --> 01:30:21,306
I'm gonna just hold him off here
and I'll join you soon.

1297
01:30:22,017 --> 01:30:25,617
No, we stick together. I'm not leaving you here.

1298
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:28,574
Take your boy and go home. You have to make it.

1299
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,520
Don't make me go through this and not make it.
Understand?

1300
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,403
[will come back for you.

1301
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:37,809
Go. Go now before I change my mind, man.

1302
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:39,236
Gol

1303
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:41,267
Three years, I promise.

1304
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:07,396
Fuck! I'm not fucking scared of you.

1305
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:16,593
Big fucking men.

1306
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,358
Come on! Bring what you got!

1307
01:31:39,761 --> 01:31:41,311
Come on!

1308
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,378
You want me? You want me?

1309
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:11,986
Is that all you've got?

1310
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:16,366
Is that all you've fucking got?

1311
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:22,845
Some sort of quite extraordinary light
from the mother ship.

1312
01:32:23,438 --> 01:32:25,778
I've never seen anything like it.
It's a beam of li-

1313
01:32:32,347 --> 01:32:34,397
Select weapons. Okay, fuck. Which one?

1314
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:37,133
No, not that one. Go forward. Forward scan. Okay.

1315
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:41,845
Fire.

1316
01:33:09,551 --> 01:33:13,011
Report. Come in.

1317
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:15,178
Get to the vehicle now. Get going.

1318
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,730
-Yes, colonel.
a
-Go, go, go.

1319
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:27,571
Fuck!

1320
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:43,440
Fuck. Fuck.

1321
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:46,982
You wanna fucking play with me, Koobus?

1322
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,762
You fucker!

1323
01:34:08,443 --> 01:34:09,733
He almost got me.

1324
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,652
Go. Come on.

1325
01:35:51,012 --> 01:35:52,882
We go home now?

1326
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:54,578
Yes.

1327
01:36:21,276 --> 01:36:23,116
Unbelievable.

1328
01:36:24,212 --> 01:36:26,402
Now I know why everybody wants a piece of you.

1329
01:36:30,518 --> 01:36:32,688
I can't wait for those med boys to cut you up.

1330
01:36:34,055 --> 01:36:38,275
But you know what?
You're not gonna waste any more of my time.

1331
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:41,702
You half-breed piece of shit.

1332
01:36:43,564 --> 01:36:46,524
I'm gonna just fucking kill you myself.

1333
01:36:55,243 --> 01:36:56,703
Stay back, you fucker.

1334
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:58,565
Stay back.

1335
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:02,218
Stay back!

1336
01:38:26,534 --> 01:38:28,933
And people everywhere across Johannesburg...

1337
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:32,430
...are flooding the streets,
are pouring out of their offices.

1338
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:36,670
And all eyes are pointing up
towards the sky on this momentous day.

1339
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:41,128
It's the first time, ladies and gentlemen,
in over two decades...

1340
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:43,989
..that the mother ship has shown any movement...

1341
01:38:44,485 --> 01:38:46,094
..and people are tremendously excited.

1342
01:38:46,521 --> 01:38:49,151
The city has come to an absolute standstill.

1343
01:38:49,724 --> 01:38:53,674
And everybody wants to know
what's going to happen next.

1344
01:38:54,429 --> 01:38:57,179
There's no way of knowing
whether Christopher Johnson will return.

1345
01:38:57,765 --> 01:39:01,925
We don't know if he was escaping,
whether he will effect a rescue plan...

1346
01:39:04,839 --> 01:39:06,739
..and as the so-called free press says...

1347
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:10,107
...whether or not he'll come back
and declare war on us.

1348
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:39,186
This is the last known footage of
Wikus van de Merwe.

1349
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:44,157
And we can only speculate as to
what has happened to him.

1350
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:48,579
The more zany conspiracy theories state that...

1351
01:39:49,283 --> 01:39:53,063
..he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.

1352
01:39:53,788 --> 01:39:55,777
Or by perhaps some shady government agency...

1353
01:39:56,257 --> 01:39:58,626
..and is actually being held in captivity.

1354
01:39:59,227 --> 01:40:01,157
If we knew where he was, we would help him.

1355
01:40:01,629 --> 01:40:04,789
And that is the most difficult part,
just not knowing where he is.

1356
01:40:05,466 --> 01:40:07,076
Wikus, sadly, is gone...

1357
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:11,722
..-but I'm the one who stays behind
with all the questions.

1358
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:13,616
I can't give the answers.

1359
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:17,092
He died in my mind a long time ago.

1360
01:40:17,945 --> 01:40:18,815
And that's that.

1361
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:22,370
Wikus van de Merwe is a name
that will become very widely known...

1362
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:26,297
...because of this pivotal role
that he played in this whole event.

1363
01:40:26,988 --> 01:40:29,678
He was an honest man and
he didn't deserve what happened.

1364
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:33,511
I know. I looked into the computer system
and I found stuff.

1365
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:37,184
I mean, the whole data was there, you know?

1366
01:40:37,798 --> 01:40:39,788
They didn't even do a good job of hiding it.

1367
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:01,426
You guys haven't seen my wife.
Let me show you my wife.

1368
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:03,916
She's my special angel.

1369
01:41:04,325 --> 01:41:06,985
She even looks like a angel with a halo.
You want to see?

1370
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:11,432
With the white veil over the head,
a
she even looks like an angel.

1371
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:15,506
Everyone says his wife's an angel,
but this is a real angel that you're seeing.

1372
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:18,830
On the cameras. They won't put that in the video,
I don't think.

1373
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:30,513
I found this at my front door,
as though somebody had just left it there.

1374
01:41:32,987 --> 01:41:36,387
My friends say ! should throw it away
because it's just a piece of rubbish.

1375
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:41,209
And it couldn't possibly come from him.

1376
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,527
I know it's true.
