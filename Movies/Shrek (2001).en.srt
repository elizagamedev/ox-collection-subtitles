1
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,660
Once upon a time,
there was a lovely princess.

2
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,580
But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort...

3
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,710
.. which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.

4
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,760
She was locked away in a castle...

5
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,890
.. guarded by a terrible,
fire-breathing dragon.

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,680
Many brave knights had attempted to
free her from this dreadful prison...

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,990
.. but none prevailed.

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,280
She waited in the dragon's keep,
in the highest room of the tallest tower...

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,980
..for her true love
and true love's first kiss.

10
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
Like that'll ever happen.

11
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,520
What a load of

12
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,670
It's in there.

13
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,160
Let's get it!

14
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,820
Hold it.
You know what it could do to you?

15
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,590
Yeah.
It'll grind your bones for its bread.

16
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,760
Actually, that would be a giant.

17
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,649
Now, ogres...

18
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,490
..are much worse.

19
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,530
They'll make a suit
from your freshly peeled skin.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,720
They'll shave your liver...

21
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,260
.. squeeze the jelly from your eyes.

22
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,350
It's quite good on toast.

23
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,570
Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn you.

24
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,320
Right.

25
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,679
This is the part where you run away.

26
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,310
And stay out!

27
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,480
Wanted. Fairy Tale Creatures.

28
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,020
This one's full. Take it away.

29
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,590
He ho hi he

30
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,030
Dwarf prisoners are we.

31
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,409
Give me that!

32
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,159
Your flying days are over.

33
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,820
Twenty pieces of silver for the witch. Next.

34
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,790
Lousy twenty pieces.

35
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,330
Sit down.

36
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,440
Keep quiet.

37
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,090
This cage is too small.

38
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,990
Please don't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again.

39
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,859
l can change, give me another chance.

40
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,560
Shut up.

41
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,680
Next.

42
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,500
-What have you got?
-This wooden puppet.

43
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

44
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,960
Five shillings for the possessed toy.
Take it away.

45
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,830
Father, don't do this!

46
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,520
Next. What have you got?

47
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,330
have a talking donkey.

48
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,250
Well, that's good for 10 shillings,
if you can prove it.

49
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,609
Go ahead, little fellow.

50
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,570
Well?

51
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
He's just nervous.
He's really quite a chatterbox.

52
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,710
Talk, you dolt!

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,470
I've heard enough. Guards!

54
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,440
No! He talks. He does.

55
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,530
I can talk. I love to talk.
I'm the talkinest damn thing you ever saw.

56
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,599
Get her out of my sight.

57
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,909
l swear! Let me go!

58
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,289
He can talk!

59
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
Hey, I can fly.

60
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,520
-He can fly.
-He can fly.

61
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,860
He can talk.

62
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,230
That's right, fool.
I'm a flying, talking donkey.

63
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,020
You might have seen a house fly.

64
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Maybe even a super fly.

65
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,380
But I bet you ain't
never seen a donkey fly.

66
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,020
Seize him!

67
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,180
Get him!

68
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,539
This way! Hurry!

69
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,740
You, there. Ogre.

70
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,080
Aye?

71
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,599
By order of Lord Farquaad, 1 am
authorized to place you both under arrest...

72
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,140
..and transport you to
a designated resettlement facility.

73
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,800
Oh, really? You and what army?

74
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,160
Can I say something to you?

75
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,760
You was really something back there.
Incredible!

76
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,640
Are you talking to...

77
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,190
..me?

78
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,380
Yes, l was. You were great.
Those guards thought...

79
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,060
.. they was all that.

80
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,809
You come, they trip over themselves
like babes in the woods.

81
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,040
It was good to see that.

82
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,270
That's great.

83
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,930
It's good to be free.

84
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,390
Why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

85
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,830
But, uh...

86
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,870
..[ don't have any friends.
And I'm not going out there alone.

87
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,410
I know! I'll stick with you!

88
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,680
You a mean, green fighting machine.
We'll scare anyone who crosses us!

89
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,540
Wow! That was really scary!

90
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,090
And if that don't work,
your breath will get the job done.

91
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,280
You definitely need Tic Tacs...
your breath stinks!

92
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,420
You almost burned the hairs on my nose.

93
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,640
Just like the time...

94
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,770
.. ate some rotten berries.

95
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
Strong gasses
eeked out my butt that day.

96
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,570
Why are you following me?!

97
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,080
I'll tell you why.

98
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,930
‘Cause I'm all alone

99
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,470
There's no one here beside me

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,510
My problems have all gone

101
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,120
There's no one to deride me

102
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,760
But you gotta have friends

103
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,560
Stop singing!

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,750
No wonder you don't have any friends.

105
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,050
Wow! Only a true friend
would be that cruelly honest.

106
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,960
Listen, little donkey,
look at me. What am I?

107
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,760
Really tall?

108
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,829
No! I'm an ogre!

109
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,410
You know,
"Grab your torch and pitchforks!"

110
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,980
Doesn't that bother you?

111
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,420
Nope.

112
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,959
Really?

113
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
Really, really.

114
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,090
I like you. What's your name?

115
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,150
Shrek.

116
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,760
Shrek? Well, you know
what I like about you, Shrek?

117
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,830
You got that "I don't care what
nobody thinks of me" thing.

118
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
l like that. l respect that, Shrek.

119
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,340
Look at that. Who'd want to live
in a place like that?

120
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,189
That would be my home.

121
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,400
And it is lovely! Just beautiful.

122
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,880
You are quite a decorator.

123
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,070
You've done so much
on such a modest budget.

124
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,480
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

125
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,949
You don't entertain much, do you?

126
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,209
I like my privacy.

127
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,520
Me, too. I hate when
someone's in your face...

128
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,760
..and you give them a hint
and they won't leave...

129
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,920
..and there's this awkward silence....

130
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,530
Can I stay with you?

131
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,270
What?

132
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Can I stay with you, please?

133
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,250
Of course.

134
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,500
-Really?
-No.

135
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
I can't go back!

136
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,540
You don't know what it's like
to be considered a freak!

137
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,120
Well, maybe you do.

138
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,490
But that's why
we got to stick together!

139
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,400
Let me stay! Please!

140
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,010
Okay! Okay! But one night only.

141
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,520
Thank you!

142
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,630
This'll be fun.

143
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,430
Weill stay up late,
swap manly stories...

144
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,040
..and in the morning, I'll make waffles!

145
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,660
Where do I sleep?

146
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,430
Outside!

147
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,939
That's cool.

148
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,600
I mean, I don't know you,
you don't know me...

149
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,700
..So0 I guess outside is best.

150
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,290
Here I go.

151
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,190
Good night.

152
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,220
I do like the outdoors.

153
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,330
I'm a donkey. I was born outside.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,190
I'll just be sitting by myself
outside. By myself, outside.

155
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,540
I'm all alone

156
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,820
There's no one here beside me....

157
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,430
I told you to stay outside.

158
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,920
lam outside.

159
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,600
It's a far cry from the farm,
but what choice do we have?

160
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,190
It's not home, but it'll do just fine.

161
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,189
What a lovely bed.

162
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,230
Gotcha!

163
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,719
l found some cheese.

164
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,500
Awful stuff.

165
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,050
-ls that you, Gorder?
-How did you know?

166
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,209
Enough!
What are you doing in my house?

167
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh, no.
Dead broad off the table!

168
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,330
Where do we put her?
The bed's taken.

169
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,880
What?

170
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,820
I live in a swamp! I put up signs!

171
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,580
I'm a terrifying ogre!

172
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,930
What do I have to do
to get a little privacy?

173
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,839
Oh, no.

174
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,360
Oh, no.

175
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,920
-Quit it.
-Don't push.

176
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,930
What are you doing in my swamp?!

177
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,110
Get out of here! All of you...

178
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,930
.. move it! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya!

179
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,740
No, no, not there. Not there!

180
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,990
Don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

181
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,100
Gosh, no one invited us.

182
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,900
-What?
-We were forced to come here.

183
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,210
-By who?
-Lord Farquaad.

184
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,250
He huffed und he puffed und he...
signed an eviction notice.

185
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,040
All right.

186
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,030
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

187
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,220
Me! I know where he is!

188
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,470
Does anyone else know
where to find him?

189
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,180
-Anyone at all?
-Me! Me!

190
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,130
-Anyone?
-Oh, pick me!

191
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,260
I know! I know! Me, me!

192
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,400
Okay, fine.

193
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,569
Attention, all...

194
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,209
. fairy tale things!

195
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,239
Do not get comfortable!

196
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,410
Your welcome is officially worn out!

197
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,020
I'm gonna go see
this guy Farquaad right now...

198
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,430
..and get you off my land
and back where you came from!

199
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,250
You.

200
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,370
You're coming with me.

201
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,450
That's what I like to hear.

202
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,040
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends,
off on a whirlwind, big-city adventure!

203
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,030
On the road again

204
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,290
Sing with me, Shrek!

205
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,840
I can't wait to get On the road again

206
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,850
What'd I say about singing?

207
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,010
-Can I whistle?
-No.

208
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,410
-Well, can I hum?
-All right. Hum.

209
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,180
That's enough! He's ready to talk.

210
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,490
Run, run, as fast as you can.

211
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,540
You can't catch me,
I'm the Gingerbread Man!

212
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,290
Monster!

213
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,310
I'm not the monster, you are!

214
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,470
You and the rest of that fairy tale trash,
poisoning my perfect world.

215
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,480
Now where are the others?

216
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,530
Eat me!

217
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,800
I've tried to be fair to you creatures.

218
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,890
Now my patience has reached its end!

219
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,140
Tell me, or...

220
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,170
Not the buttons! Not my gumdrop buttons!

221
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,180
All right. Who's hiding them?

222
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,920
Okay, I'll tell you.
Do you know the Muffin Man?

223
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
-The Muffin Man?
-The Muffin Man.

224
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,620
Yes, I know the Muffin Man.
Who lives on Drury Lane?

225
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,010
Well, she's married to the Muffin Man.

226
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,090
-The Muffin Man?
-The Muffin Man!

227
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,440
She's married to the Muffin Man.

228
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,200
My Lord, we found it.

229
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,569
What are you waiting for? Bring it in.

230
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,900
Magic Mirror....

231
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,729
Don't tell him anything!

232
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,210
Evening.

233
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,419
Mirror, mirror, on the wall...

234
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,740
. is this not the most
perfect kingdom of them all?

235
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,579
Well, technically, you're not a king.

236
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,240
Uh, Thelonius.

237
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,810
You were saying?

238
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,850
What I meant is, you're not a king yet.

239
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,580
But you can become one.
Just marry a princess.

240
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,930
Go on.

241
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,050
So, just sit back and relax, my Lord...

242
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,379
.. because it's time for you to
meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

243
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,130
And here they are!

244
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,440
Bachelorette #1 is a mentally
abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away.

245
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,340
She likes sushi and hot-tubbing.

246
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,320
Her hobbies include cooking
and cleaning for her two evil sisters.

247
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,090
Please welcome...Cinderella!

248
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,770
Bachelorette #2 is a girl
from the land of fancy.

249
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,480
Though she lives with 7 other men,
she's not easy.

250
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,000
Kiss her dead, frozen lips
and see what a live wire she is.

251
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,430
Give it up for...Snow White!

252
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,960
And last, but certainly not least...

253
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,690
... Bachelorette #3, a redhead from a dragon-
guarded castle surrounded by hot lava!

254
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,129
But don't let that cool you off.
She likes Pina Coladas...

255
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,220
..and getting caught in the rain.
Yours for the rescuing...Princess Fiona!

256
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,530
So will it be Bachelorette #17

257
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,270
Bachelorette #27

258
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,850
Or Bachelorette #37

259
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,540
Two, three, one. Three.

260
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,730
Pick number three, m'Lord.

261
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,100
Okay! Okay! Uh...number three!

262
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,030
Lord Farquaad,
you've chosen Princess Fiona.

263
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,139
Princess Fiona.

264
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,310
She's perfect.

265
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,440
I'll just find someone to go...

266
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,420
-There's this thing that happens at night...
-I'll do it.

267
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,990
-Yes, but after sunset...
-Silence!

268
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,930
I will make Princess Fiona my queen...

269
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,870
..and DuLoc will
finally have the perfect king!

270
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Captain, assemble your finest men.

271
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,120
We're going to have a tournament.

272
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,820
That's it. That's DuLoc.
I told you I'd find it.

273
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,580
So...

274
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,630
.. that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

275
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,210
That's the place.

276
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,510
You think maybe
he's compensating for something?

277
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,920
Hey, wait! Wait up, Shrek!

278
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,580
Hurry, darling! We're late!

279
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,919
Hey! You!

280
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,360
Wait a second.
Look, I'm not going to eat you.

281
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,680
I just...Look, I just...

282
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,190
It's quiet.

283
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,590
Too quiet.

284
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,960
Where is everybody?

285
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,080
Look at this!

286
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,879
Welcome to DuLoc Such a perfect town

287
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,350
Here we have some rules
Let us lay them down

288
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,950
Don't make waves, stay in line
And we'll get along fine

289
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,500
DuLoc is a perfect place

290
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,020
Please keep off of the grass
Shine your shoes, wipe your...face

291
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,900
DuLoc is

292
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,770
DuLoc is

293
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,260
DuLoc is a perfect place!

294
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,640
Wow.

295
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,500
Let's do that again.

296
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,790
No.

297
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,130
Brave knights!

298
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,540
You are the best
and brightest in all the land!

299
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,250
Today, one of you shall prove...

300
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,570
You're heading for a smacked bottom.

301
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,980
Sorry about that.

302
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,149
The champion shall have the honor...
no, no, the privilege...

303
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,510
.. to go and rescue...

304
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,490
..the lovely Princess Fiona...

305
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,800
.. from the fiery keep of the dragon.

306
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,030
If, for any reason,
the winner is unsuccessful...

307
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,180
. the first runner-up
will take his place.

308
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,610
And so on and so forth.

309
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,050
Some of you may die...

310
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,409
.. but it's a sacrifice
lam willing to make.

311
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,550
Let the tournament begin!

312
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,680
What is that?

313
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,710
It's hideous!

314
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,620
That's not very nice.

315
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,430
It's just a donkey.

316
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,770
Indeed. Knights! New plan.

317
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,170
The one who kills the ogre
will be champion! Have at him!

318
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,500
Oh, hey, now, come on.

319
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,080
Hang on now.

320
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,950
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

321
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,100
No?

322
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,480
All right, then.

323
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,890
Come on!

324
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,340
Hey, Shrek! Tag me! Tag me!

325
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,850
The chair! Give him the chair!

326
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,390
Thank you!

327
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,590
Thank you very much.
I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal.

328
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,550
Shall I give the order, sir?

329
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,919
No, I have a better idea.

330
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,940
People of DuLoc...

331
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,040
...[ give you our champion!

332
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,550
What?

333
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,270
Congratulations, ogre.

334
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,960
You've won the honor of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

335
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I'm already on a quest.
A quest to get my swamp back.

336
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,890
Your swamp?

337
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,149
Yeah! My swamp...where you dumped
those fairy tale creatures.

338
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,679
Indeed.

339
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,910
I'll make you a deal, ogre.

340
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,680
Go on this quest for me,
and I'll give you your swamp back.

341
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,389
Exactly the way it was?

342
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,070
Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

343
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,780
And the squatters?

344
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,620
As good as gone.

345
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,510
What kind of quest?

346
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,530
So you're going to fight a dragon...

347
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,200
..for a princess,
so Farquaad will return a swamp...

348
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,610
.. you only don't have

349
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,620
‘cause he filled it
with freaks to start with.

350
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,370
You know, maybe there's a
good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

351
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,690
I don't get it.
Why not pull some ogre stuff on him?

352
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,659
Throttle him, attack his fortress,

353
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,700
grind his bones for bread?
The whole ogre trip.

354
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,830
I know. Maybe I could
decapitate an entire village...

355
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,939
..put their heads on a pike,

356
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,990
get a knife, cut open their spleen...

357
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,159
..and drink their fluids.
Does that sound good to you?

358
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,500
Not really, no.

359
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,840
For your information,
there's more to ogres than people think.

360
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,480
Example?

361
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,090
Okay, um...

362
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,070
..ogres are like onions.

363
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,150
-They stink?
-Yes...No!

364
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,899
-They make you cry.
-No.

365
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,000
You leave them out
in the sun and they get brown.

366
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,370
No! Layers!

367
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,640
Onions have layers.

368
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,290
Ogres have layers. Onions have layers.

369
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,540
Get it? We both have layers.

370
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,770
Ohhh. You both have layers.

371
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,230
You know, not everyone like onions.

372
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,460
Cake! Everyone loves cake!
Cakes have layers.

373
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,900
I don't care what everyone likes.

374
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,240
Ogres are not like cakes.

375
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,909
You know what else
everyone like? Parfaits.

376
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,689
Who ever says,
"No, I don't like parfaits"?

377
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,010
They're delicious.

378
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,030
No! You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

379
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,010
Ogres are like onions!
End of story. Bye-bye.

380
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,780
See you later.

381
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,660
Parfaits may be the most
delicious thing on the planet.

382
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,570
I think I preferred your humming.

383
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,590
Do you have a tissue or something?

384
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,250
Just the word "parfait"
make me start slobbering.

385
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,330
Shrek, did you do that?

386
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,150
You got to warn somebody
before you crack one off.

387
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,690
Believe me, Donkey,
if it was me, you'd be dead.

388
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,780
It's brimstone.
We must be getting close.

389
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,740
Yeah, right. Brimstone.

390
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,410
I know what I smelled
and it wasn't no brimstone.

391
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,630
Didn't come off no stone, neither.

392
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,330
Sure, it's big enough.
But look at the location.

393
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,409
Shrek, uh, remember when you said...

394
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,700
. that, that ogres have layers?

395
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,240
Well, 1 have a confession.
We wear our fear on our sleeves.

396
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,320
Donkeys don't have sleeves.

397
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,760
You know what I mean.

398
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,170
Don't tell me you're afraid of heights.

399
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,460
No, I'm just uncomfortable being on
a rickety bridge over boiling lava!

400
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,889
Come on, Donkey.
I'll be right here beside you...

401
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,930
..for emotional support.

402
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,240
We'll tackle this together,
one baby step at a time.

403
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,760
-Really?
-Really, really.

404
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,830
That makes me feel much better.

405
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,580
Just keep moving. And don't look down.

406
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,630
Don't look down.
Keep moving. Don't look down.

407
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,500
Don't look down.
Keep moving. Don't look down.

408
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,350
Shrek! I'm looking down!

409
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,800
I can't do this! Let me off.

410
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,960
You're already halfway.

411
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,570
But I know that half is safe!

412
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,510
I don't have time for this. You go back.

413
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,870
Shrek! Wait!

414
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,440
Let's have a dance. Come on.

415
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,100
Don't do that!

416
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,900
I'm sorry. Do what?

417
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,770
This?

418
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,919
Yes, that!

419
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,110
Yes? Yes. Do it. Okay.

420
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,530
No, Shrek!

421
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,610
-Stop it!
-You just said do it! I'm doing it!

422
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,480
I'm going to die!
I'm going to die! Shrek!

423
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,740
That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

424
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,570
Cool.

425
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,850
So where is the
fire-breathing pain in the neck?

426
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,790
Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

427
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,180
l was talking about the dragon, Shrek.

428
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,620
You afraid?

429
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,710
No.

430
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,680
But, shhh.

431
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,379
Good. Me, neither.

432
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,510
There's nothing wrong
with being afraid.

433
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,260
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

434
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,780
If a dragon breathes fire and
eats knights and breathes fire...

435
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,540
. it doesn't mean you're a
coward if you're a bit scared.

436
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,179
I know I'm no coward.

437
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,870
Donkey, two things...okay?

438
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,720
Shut. Up.

439
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,220
Go see if you can find any stairs.

440
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,490
Aren't we looking for the Princess?

441
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,980
She'll be up the stairs in the
highest room in the tallest tower.

442
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,070
How do you know?

443
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,070
I read it in a book once.

444
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,750
Cool. You handle the dragon,
I'll handle the stairs.

445
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,090
l'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt, too. That's right.

446
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,960
Gonna take drastic steps.

447
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,159
Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master.

448
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,989
I've mastered the stairs.

449
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,410
Wish I had a step now,
I'd step all over it.

450
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,460
There's the Princess.
But where's the...

451
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,100
Dragon!!!

452
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,830
Donkey, look out!

453
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,780
I'm coming!

454
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,140
Gotcha!

455
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,390
No, don't.

456
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,409
No. Oh, no!

457
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,990
What large teeth you have.

458
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,400
White, sparkling teeth.

459
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,580
You probably hear this
all the time from your food.

460
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,800
You must bleach,
‘cause you have one dazzling smile.

461
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,520
Do I detect a hint
of minty freshness?

462
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,180
You know what else?

463
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,540
You know what else?
You're...you're a girl dragon!

464
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,380
I mean, of course you're
a girl dragon, ‘cause...

465
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,740
you're just
teeking of feminine beauty.

466
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,260
What's wrong?
Is something in your eye?

467
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,320
I'd love to stay,
but I'm an asthmatic...

468
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,180
..and it won't work out
if you keep blowing smoke rings.

469
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,630
Shrek!

470
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
No, Shrek!

471
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,839
-Wake up.
-What?!

472
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,110
Are you Princess Fiona?

473
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,920
lam.

474
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,010
Awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

475
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,190
That's nice. Let's go!

476
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,780
But wait, Sir Knight!

477
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,080
This be-ith our first meeting.

478
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,830
Should it not be a
wonderful, romantic moment?

479
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
Sorry, lady. There's no time.

480
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,490
What are you doing?

481
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,300
You should sweep me away...

482
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,620
..out yonder window and
onto your valiant steed!

483
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,570
You've had a lot of time
to plan this, huh?

484
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,219
We have to savor this moment.

485
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,100
You could recite an epic poem for me.

486
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,410
A ballad? A sonnet?

487
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,439
A limerick? Something!

488
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,080
I don't think so.

489
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,060
Can I at least
know the name of my champion?

490
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,040
Um...Shrek.

491
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,500
Sir Shrek...

492
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,690
..[ pray that you take this favor
as a token of my gratitude.

493
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,770
Thanks.

494
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,049
You didn't slay the dragon?!

495
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,870
It's on my to-do list. Come on!

496
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,150
But this isn't right. You should go...

497
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,790
.. sword drawn, banner flying.
That's what the other knights did.

498
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,350
Right before they burst into flame.

499
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,320
That's not the point.

500
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,400
Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

501
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,200
Il have to save my ass.

502
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,270
What kind of knight are you?

503
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,370
One of a kind.

504
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,950
Slow down, baby.

505
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,569
I believe it's healthy to get to
know someone over a long period of time.

506
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,080
Just call me old-fashioned.
I don't want to rush into...

507
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,180
..a physical relationship.
I'm not ready for a commitment of this...

508
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,580
.. magnitude, really,
is the word I'm looking for.

509
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,740
That is unwanted physical contact!

510
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,750
What are you doing?

511
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,319
Let's back up and
take this one step at a time.

512
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,870
We should get to know each other
as friends. Or pen pals.

513
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,960
I'm on the road a lot,
but I just love receiving cards.

514
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,090
I'd really love to stay, but...Hey!

515
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,430
Don't do that!
That's my personal tail!

516
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,990
You'll tear it off.
What are you going to do with that?

517
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,490
-Hi, Princess.
-It talks.

518
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,860
Yeah. It's getting him
to shut up that's the trick.

519
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,750
You two, head for the exit!

520
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,439
I'll take care of the dragon.

521
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,030
Run!

522
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,070
You did it!

523
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,210
You rescued me! You're amazing!
You're wonderful! You're...

524
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,270
.a little unorthodox, I'll admit, but...

525
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,270
.. thy deed is great and thine heart is pure.

526
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,430
lam eternally in your debt.

527
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,270
And where would a brave knight
be without his noble steed?

528
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,700
I hope you heard that. She called me
a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

529
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,140
The battle is won.

530
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,500
You may remove your helmet,
good Sir Knight.

531
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,890
Uhh, no.

532
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,150
Why not?

533
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,370
l have helmet hair.

534
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,459
Please...1 would't look upon
the face of my rescuer.

535
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,950
No, you wouldn't...tst.

536
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,530
But how will you kiss me?

537
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,680
What!?

538
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,080
That wasn't in the job description.

539
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,080
Maybe it's a perk.

540
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,630
No, it's destiny.
You must know how it goes.

541
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,160
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon...

542
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,020
.. is rescued by a brave knight...

543
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,530
..and then they share
true love's first kiss.

544
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,720
With Shrek? You think...?

545
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,670
Wait a sec. You think
Shrek is your true love?

546
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,919
Well...yes!

547
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,410
You think Shrek is your true love!

548
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,170
What is so funny?

549
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,930
Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?

550
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,200
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.

551
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,640
Now, remove your helmet.

552
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,259
This is really not a good idea.

553
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,069
-Take off the helmet.
-l won't.

554
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:23,950
-Do it.
-No!

555
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,279
Now!

556
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,450
Okay! Easy.

557
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,420
As you command, Your Highness.

558
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,680
You're an...an ogre.

559
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,790
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

560
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,190
Well, yes, actually.

561
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,029
Oh, no. This is all wrong.

562
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,130
You're not supposed to be an ogre.

563
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,150
Princess, l was sent to rescue you
by Lord Farquaad, okay?

564
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,439
It's he who wants to marry you.

565
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,660
Then why didn't he rescue me?

566
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,540
Good question.
Ask him that when we get there.

567
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,080
But I have to be rescued
by my true love...

568
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,930
.. not by some ogre and his pet.

569
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,420
So much for "noble steed".

570
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,819
You're not making my job any easier.

571
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,509
I'm sorry,
but your job is not my problem.

572
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,010
You can tell Lord Farquaad that
if he wants to rescue me properly...

573
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,680
. I'll be waiting for him right here.

574
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,020
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right?

575
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,920
I'm a delivery boy.

576
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,460
You wouldn't dare.

577
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,120
-Coming, Donkey?
-Right behind you.

578
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,040
Put me down,
or you will suffer the consequences!

579
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,630
This is not dignified! Put me down!

580
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,490
Here's another question.

581
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,520
This woman digs you,
but you don't like her that way.

582
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,140
How do you let her down real easy without
getting burned to a crisp and eaten?

583
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Just tell her she's not your true love.

584
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,530
Everyone knowest what happens
when you find your...

585
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,630
I can't wait to get to DuLoc.

586
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,500
You'll love it, Princess.
It's beautiful.

587
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,370
And what of my groom-to-be,
Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

588
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,870
Let me put it this way.

589
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,000
Men of Farquaad's stature...

590
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,890
..are in short supply.

591
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,260
I don't know, Shrek...
there are those who think little of him.

592
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,799
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

593
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,480
You're just jealous you could never measure
up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

594
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,580
Maybe you're right, Princess.

595
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,350
I'll let you do the measuring
when you see him tomorrow.

596
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,440
Tomorrow?

597
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,110
It'll take that long.

598
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,870
Shouldn't we make camp?

599
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,330
No. That'll take longer.

600
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,600
-We can keep going.
-But there are robbers in the woods.

601
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,060
Time out, Shrek.
Camping's starting to sound good.

602
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,820
Come on. I'm scarier than anything
we'll see in this forest.

603
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,490
I need somewhere to camp, now!

604
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,080
Hey, over here.

605
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,090
We can do better than that.

606
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,240
This isn't fit for a princess.

607
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,630
It's perfect.
It just needs some homey touches.

608
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,549
Homey touches? Like what?

609
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,870
A door?

610
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,330
Gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

611
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,779
Want me to read you a bedtime story?

612
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,490
l said good night!

613
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,310
What are you doing?

614
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,529
I just... You know.
Come on, I was just kidding.

615
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,520
And that one.

616
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,620
That's Throwback, the only ogre ever to
spit over three wheat fields.

617
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,220
Right. Yeah.

618
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,799
Can you tell my future from the stars?

619
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,240
The stars don't tell the future.
They tell stories.

620
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,109
Look. There's Bloodnut the Flatulent.

621
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,480
Guess what he was famous for?

622
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,360
Now I know you're making this up.

623
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,960
No. Look. There he is.

624
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,890
And there are the
hunters fleeing his stench.

625
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,380
They're just a bunch of little dots.

626
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,880
Donkey, sometimes things
are more than they appear.

627
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,060
Forget it.

628
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,680
Shrek, what will we do
when we get our swamp?

629
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:39,950
Our swamp?

630
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,330
When we're through
rescuing the Princess.

631
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,069
We? Donkey, there's no "we".
There's no "our". There's just...

632
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,510
..me and my swamp.

633
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,100
And the first thing I'll do is
build a wall around my land.

634
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,870
You cut me deep, Shrek.
You cut me real deep just now.

635
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,370
You know what? I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep someone out.

636
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,630
No. You think?

637
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,960
You hiding something?

638
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,250
Never mind, Donkey.

639
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,680
This is another one
of those onion things.

640
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,490
No, this is one of
those "drop it" things.

641
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,020
-Why don't you want to discuss it?
-Why do you want to?

642
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,860
-Why are you blocking?
-I'm not.

643
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,080
-Yes, you are.
-I'm warning you.

644
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,590
Who you trying to keep out?

645
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Everyone! Okay?

646
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,850
Now we're getting somewhere.

647
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,339
Oh, for the love of Pete!

648
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,530
What's your problem?
What you got against the world?

649
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,460
I'm not the one with the problem.
It's the world that has a problem with me.

650
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,600
People take one look at me and go,
"Aaagh! Help! Run!"

651
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,569
"A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"

652
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,069
They judge me before they even know me.

653
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,600
That's why I'm better off alone.

654
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,490
You know, when we met,

655
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,530
I didn't think you were
just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

656
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,529
Yeah, I know.

657
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,850
So, are there any donkeys up there?

658
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,930
Well, there's Gabby...

659
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,390
.. the Small and Annoying.

660
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,440
Okay, okay, I see it now.

661
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,790
The big, shiny one right there. Right?

662
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,040
-That's the moon.
-Oh. Okay.

663
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,919
Again. Show me again.

664
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,660
Mirror, mirror...show her to me.

665
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,330
Show me the Princess.

666
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,709
Perfect.

667
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,580
Yeah, you know I like it like that.

668
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,529
Baby, I'll give you a ride.

669
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,120
Donkey, wake up.

670
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,520
Wake up.

671
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,520
Morning.

672
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,280
How do you like your eggs?

673
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,470
Good morning, Princess!

674
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,920
What's this all about?

675
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,770
We got off to a bad start yesterday.

676
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,050
l wanted to make it up to you.

677
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,660
I mean, after all...you did rescue me.

678
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,040
Thanks.

679
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,120
Eat up. We have a big day ahead of us.

680
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,370
-Shrek!
-What? It's a compliment.

681
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,580
Better out than in, I always say.

682
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,070
It's no way to behave in front of a princess.

683
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:02,990
Thanks.

684
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,850
She's as nasty as you are.

685
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,920
You know,
you're not exactly what I expected.

686
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,990
Maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you know them.

687
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,420
La liberté!

688
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,110
Princess!

689
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,440
-What are you doing?
-Be still, cherie. 1 am your savior!

690
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,020
And lam rescuing you from this green...

691
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,190
. beast.

692
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,859
That's my princess! Go find your own!

693
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,600
Please, monster!
Can't you see I'm busy here?

694
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,300
Look, pal,
I don't know who you think you are..

695
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,560
Of course! How rude.
Please let me introduce myself.

696
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,569
Oh, Merry Men!

697
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,560
I steal from the rich,
give to the needy

698
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,660
-He takes a wee percentage
-But I'm not greedy

699
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,830
l rescue pretty damsels

700
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,660
Man, I'm good

701
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,610
What a guy!

702
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,850
Monsieur Hood!

703
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,740
Break it down.

704
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,190
I like an honest fight

705
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,290
And a saucy maid

706
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,200
-What he means is he likes to get...
-Paid!

707
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,270
When an ogre in the bush

708
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,640
Grabs a lady by the tush, that's bad!

709
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,460
That's bad!

710
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,490
When a beauty's with a beast

711
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,549
It makes me mad!

712
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,550
He's really, really mad!

713
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,610
l take my blade

714
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,860
To ram through your heart

715
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,880
Keep your eyes on me, boys

716
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,029
‘Cause I'm about to start

717
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,070
Man, that was annoying.

718
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,540
Oh, you little...!

719
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,600
Shall we?

720
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,920
Hold the phone.

721
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,110
Whoa, whoa...hold on.

722
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,710
Where did that come from?

723
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,840
That. Back there. That was amazing.

724
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,780
Where did you learn that?

725
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,080
When one lives alone,

726
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,620
one has to learn
these things in case there's...

727
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,230
There's an arrow in your butt!

728
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,760
Look at that.

729
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,759
This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

730
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,600
-What's wrong?
-Shrek's hurt.

731
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,270
Shrek's hurt?! No, Shrek's gonna die!

732
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,830
Donkey, I'm okay.

733
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,360
No. I'm too young for you to die.
Elevate your legs.

734
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,110
Turn your head and cough!
Do the Heimlich!

735
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,230
Donkey! Calm down.

736
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,399
If you want to help Shrek,
go find me a blue flower with red thorns.

737
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,210
Blue flower, red thorns...I'm on it.

738
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,930
Don't die, Shrek.

739
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,270
If you see a long tunnel,
don't go to the light!

740
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,650
Donkey!

741
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,230
Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

742
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,270
-What are the flowers for?
-For getting rid of Donkey.

743
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,250
Now hold still and I'll yank this out.

744
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,330
Easy with the yanking!

745
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,319
Sorry, but it has to come out. Now..

746
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,009
No, it's tender. Would you..

747
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,490
What you're doing is the opposite of help.

748
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,870
Time out.

749
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,600
Okay. What do you propose we do?

750
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,600
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

751
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,900
This would be so much easier
if l wasn't color blind!

752
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,020
Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!

753
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,259
Not good.

754
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,450
Okay, I can nearly see the head.
It's just about..

755
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,950
Nothing happened. We were just, uh....

756
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,930
If you wanted to be alone,
all you had to do was ask.

757
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,480
Come on.
That's the last thing on my mind.

758
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,600
The Princess was just..

759
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,870
Ow.

760
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,609
Hey, what's that? Eh...is that blood?

761
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,330
There it is, Princess.

762
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,950
Your future awaits you.

763
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,279
That's DuLoc?

764
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,290
Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something.

765
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,380
Which I think means he has a really..

766
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,190
Well, 1 guess we'd better move on.

767
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,680
Sure. But...Shrek?

768
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,230
I'm...I'm worried about Donkey.

769
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,940
I mean, look at him.
He doesn't look so good.

770
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,620
What do you mean? I'm fine.

771
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,370
That's what they all say...
tight before they're on their back.

772
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,840
Dead.

773
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,240
She's right. You look awful.
Do you want to sit down?

774
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,230
I'll make some tea.

775
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,900
Well, 1 do have this twinge in my neck.

776
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,320
When I turn my head like this...Ow! See?

777
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,350
-I'll find us dinner.
-I'll get the firewood.

778
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,780
Hey, where you going?

779
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,470
Oh, man...I can't feel my toes!

780
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,759
I don't have any toes!

781
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,660
I think I need a hug.

782
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,370
This is good. This is really good.

783
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,740
-What is this?
-Weedrat.

784
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,799
Rotisserie-style.

785
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,340
No kidding?

786
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,009
Well, this is delicious.

787
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,990
They're also great in stew.

788
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,440
I don't mean to brag,
but I make a mean weedrat stew.

789
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,530
I guess I'll be dining
a little differently tomorrow night.

790
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,420
Maybe you can come visit me
in the swamp sometime.

791
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,980
I'll cook lots of stuff for you.

792
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,120
Swamp toad soup,
fish eye tartare...you name it!

793
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,960
I'd like that.

794
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,200
Princess?

795
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,870
Yes...Shrek?

796
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,410
I, um...l was wondering.

797
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,690
Are you, uh....

798
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,189
Are you going to eat that?

799
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,939
Man, isn't this romantic?
Just look at that sunset.

800
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,240
Sunset?! Oh, no!

801
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,850
I mean, it's late. It's very late.

802
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,170
Wait a minute.
l see what's going on here.

803
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,620
You're afraid of the dark, huh?

804
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,570
Yes! That's it. I'm terrified.
I'd better go inside.

805
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,279
Don't feel bad.
l was afraid of the dark, too, until.

806
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,900
Hey, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

807
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,820
Good night.

808
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,799
Good night.

809
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,029
l see what's going on here.

810
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,660
What do you mean?

811
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,060
I'm an animal and I got instincts.

812
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,650
I know you two
were diggin’ on each other.

813
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,740
You're crazy.

814
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,670
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

815
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,480
Come on, Shrek.

816
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,149
Wake up and smell the pheromones.

817
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,520
Go tell her how you feel.

818
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,410
There's nothing to tell.

819
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,569
Besides, even if I did tell her...

820
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,430
..well, you know.

821
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,879
I'm not saying I do. 'Cause I don't.

822
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,440
She's a princess, and I'm....

823
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,960
An ogre?

824
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,520
Yeah. An ogre.

825
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,780
-Where are you going?
-To get...more firewood.

826
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,270
Princess?

827
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,690
Princess Fiona?

828
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,760
Princess? Where are you?

829
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,100
Princess?

830
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,340
It's spooky in here.
l ain't playing no games.

831
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,770
No! Help! Shrek!

832
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,529
No! It's okay.

833
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,850
Where's the Princess?!

834
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,730
Donkey! I'm the Princess.
It's me, in this body.

835
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,390
Oh, my God! You ate the Princess!

836
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,630
Can you hear me?

837
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,750
Keep breathing!
I'll get you out of there!

838
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,430
Shrek! Shrek!

839
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,140
This is me.

840
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,230
Princess?

841
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,990
What happened to you? You're...

842
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,600
..uh...duh...different.

843
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,610
I'm ugly, okay?

844
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,570
Was it something you ate?

845
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,230
I told Shrek not to serve rats.
You are what you eat.

846
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,750
No! I've been this way
as long as I can remember.

847
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,570
I never seen you like this before.

848
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,660
It only happens when the sun goes down.

849
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,490
"By night one way, by day, another...

850
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,650
"...this shall be the norm.

851
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,759
"Until you find true love's first kiss...

852
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,149
"and then take love's true form."

853
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,400
That's beautiful.
I didn't know you wrote poetry.

854
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,480
It's a spell!

855
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,470
When I was a little girl,
a witch cast a spell on me.

856
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,250
Every night, 1 become this.

857
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,779
This horrible, ugly beast!

858
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,380
l was placed in a tower to await the day
my true love would rescue me.

859
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,839
That's why I must marry Lord Farquaad
tomorrow before sunset, when he sees me...

860
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,870
. like this.

861
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,550
Okay, calm down.

862
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,480
It's not that bad.
You're not that ugly.

863
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,860
And...Well...
I ain't gonna lie...you are ugly.

864
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,419
But you're only this way at night.
Shrek's ugly 24(7.

865
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,470
But, Donkey, I'm a princess...

866
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,360
..and this is not
how a princess is meant to look!

867
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,970
What if you don't marry Farquaad?

868
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,200
l have to. Only my true love's kiss
can break the spell.

869
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,859
But, you know, you're kind of an ogre.

870
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,300
And Shrek....Well,
you've got a lot in common.

871
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,010
Shrek?

872
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,260
Princess, I....How’s it going,
first of all? Good?

873
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,580
Good for me, too. I'm okay.

874
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,990
I saw this flower and thought of you,

875
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,840
because it's pretty and...

876
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,150
..well, [ don't really like it,

877
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,770
but I thought
you might because you're pretty.

878
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,080
But I like you anyway. I'd..

879
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,970
I'm in trouble.

880
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,400
Okay, here we go.

881
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,710
I mean, really.

882
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,490
Who could ever love
a beast so hideous and ugly?

883
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,460
Princess and ugly don't go together.

884
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,720
That's why I can't stay with Shrek.

885
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:57,259
My only chance to live happily
ever after is to marry my true love.

886
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,780
Don't you see, Donkey?

887
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,900
That's just how it has to be.

888
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,030
The spell has to be broken.

889
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,830
At least tell Shrek the truth.

890
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,069
No! You can't tell.
No one must ever know.

891
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,550
What's the point of being able to talk
if you have to keep secrets?

892
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,020
Promise you won't tell. Promise.

893
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,820
All right, 1 won't tell him.
But you should.

894
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,560
Before this is over, I'm gonna need
a lot of serious therapy.

895
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,050
My eye is twitching.

896
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,850
I tell him. I tell him not.

897
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,339
I tell him. I tell him not.

898
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,880
I tell him.

899
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,730
Shrek!

900
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,450
Shrek? There's something I want..

901
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,310
Shrek!

902
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,870
-Are you all right?
-Perfect. Never been better.

903
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,590
I have to tell you something.

904
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,360
You don't have to tell me anything.

905
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,110
l heard enough last night.

906
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,610
-You heard what I said?
-Every word.

907
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,390
Well, I thought you'd understand.

908
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,950
I understand.

909
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,850
Like you said,
who could love a hideous, ugly beast?

910
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,660
I thought that wouldn't matter.

911
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,650
Well, it does.

912
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,990
Right on time.

913
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,120
Princess,
I've brought you a little something.

914
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,880
What did I miss?

915
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,060
Who said that? Not a donkey.

916
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,650
Princess Fiona.

917
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,390
As promised. Now hand it over.

918
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,130
Very well, ogre.

919
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,890
The deed to your swamp,
cleared out, as agreed.

920
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,260
Take it and go...

921
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,940
.. before 1 change my mind.

922
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,370
Forgive me, Princess, for startling you,

923
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,790
but you startled me.

924
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,350
Il have never seen
such a radiant beauty before.

925
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,400
lam Lord Farquaad.

926
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,520
Lord Farquaad?

927
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,569
Oh, no.

928
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,940
Forgive me, my Lord,
for l was just saying a short..

929
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,360
.. farewell.

930
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,490
How sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

931
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,450
It's not like it has feelings.

932
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,750
No, you're right. "It" doesn't.

933
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,800
Princess Fiona...
beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona...

934
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,460
..l ask your hand in marriage.

935
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,089
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

936
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,310
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make..

937
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,790
Excellent! I'll start the plans.
Tomorrow, we wed!

938
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,220
No!

939
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,930
I mean...why wait?

940
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,130
Let's get married today.

941
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,890
Before sunset.

942
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,020
Oh, anxious, are we?

943
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,100
Well, the sooner, the better.
There's much to do!

944
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,580
There's the caterer,
the cake, the band, the guests.

945
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,920
Captain, round up some guests!

946
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,650
Fare thee well, ogre.

947
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,660
Shrek, you're letting her get away!

948
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,080
So what?

949
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,650
You don't know about her.
We talked last night..

950
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,370
Yeah, I know you talked last night.

951
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,299
You're great pals, aren't you?

952
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,450
And since you are,
why don't you follow her home?

953
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,390
But I want to go with you.

954
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,210
I told you,
you're not coming home with me!

955
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:08,290
I live alone!
My swamp! Me! Nobody else!

956
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,590
Understand? Nobody!

957
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,780
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

958
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,450
But I thought..

959
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,910
Well, you know what?
You thought wrong!

960
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,810
Shrek.

961
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:39,859
Donkey?

962
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,810
What are you doing?

963
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,750
You of all people
should recognize a wall.

964
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:47,660
Well, yeah.

965
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,650
But the wall should go around my swamp,
not through it.

966
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,779
It is. Around your half. This is my half.

967
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,059
Oh, your half.

968
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,730
I helped rescue the Princess.

969
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,240
I did half the work.
I get half the booty.

970
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,710
Hand me that big rock...
the one that looks like your head.

971
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,590
-Back off.
-No, you back off!

972
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,880
-This is my swamp!
-Our swamp!

973
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,250
-Let go!
-You let go!

974
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,269
-Stubborn jackass!
-Smelly ogre!

975
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,550
Fine!

976
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,649
I'm not through with you yet!

977
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,899
I'm through with you!

978
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,899
With you, it's always "me, me, me!"

979
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,679
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn,
so you shut up and pay attention!

980
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,140
You are mean to me, you insult me,
you don't appreciate anything I do.

981
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,930
You either push me around
or push me away!

982
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:36,929
Well, if I treated you so bad,
why did you come back?

983
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,330
Because that's what friends do!
Forgive each other!

984
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,750
Yeah, you're right, Donkey.
I forgive you...

985
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,859
.. for stabbing me in the back!

986
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,300
You're so wrapped up in layers,
onion boy,

987
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,850
you're afraid of your own feelings!

988
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,950
Go away.

989
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,510
You're doing it like you did to Fiona.

990
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,840
All she did was like you.
Maybe love you.

991
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,510
Love me? She said I was ugly!

992
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,590
A hideous creature.
l heard you two talking.

993
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,230
She wasn't talking about you,

994
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,900
she was talking about...somebody else.

995
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,360
She wasn't talking about me?

996
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,510
Then who was she talking about?

997
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,210
I'm saying nothing.

998
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,910
You don't want to listen to me, right?

999
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,920
-Donkey.
-No.

1000
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,610
Okay, look...I'm sorry. All right?

1001
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,240
I'm sorry.

1002
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,790
I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

1003
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,849
Can you forgive me?

1004
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,889
That's what friends are for. Right?

1005
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,429
Right.

1006
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,740
-Friends?
-Friends.

1007
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,530
So, um...

1008
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,700
..what did Fiona say about me?

1009
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,519
Why are you asking me?
Just go ask her.

1010
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,690
The wedding!
We'll never make it on time!

1011
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,210
Never fear. Where there's a will,

1012
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,019
there's a way. And I have a way.

1013
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,470
Donkey?

1014
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,870
It's just my animal magnetism.

1015
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,340
-Come here, you.
-Don't slobber. No one likes a kiss ass.

1016
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,930
Hop on and...

1017
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,320
. hold on tight.

1018
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,280
I haven't installed seat belts yet.

1019
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,100
People of DuLoc...

1020
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,100
..we gather here today...

1021
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,429
..to bear witness to the union...

1022
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,880
Excuse me.

1023
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,400
Could we just skip to the "I do's"?

1024
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:12,830
Go on.

1025
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,120
Go have some fun.

1026
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,870
If we need you, I'll whistle.

1027
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,410
Wait! Don't you want to do this right?

1028
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,450
What do you mean?

1029
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,540
There's a line the priest will say.

1030
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,360
"Speak now or forever hold your peace.”

1031
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,800
Then you say, "I object!"

1032
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,380
I haven't time for this.

1033
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,270
Listen to me.
You love this woman, right?

1034
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,210
You want to hold her? Please her?

1035
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,830
Then you gotta,
gotta try a little tenderness!

1036
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,650
Chicks love romantic crap.

1037
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,830
Okay!
When does this guy say the line?

1038
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,519
Let's check.

1039
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,780
And so, by the power invested in me...

1040
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,790
-Well?
-The whole town's in there.

1041
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,590
...l now pronounce you....

1042
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,960
They're at the altar.

1043
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,309
Mother Fletcher, he said it.

1044
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,970
Oh, for the love of Pete!

1045
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,830
I object!

1046
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,500
Shrek?

1047
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,480
Oh, now what does he want?

1048
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,570
Hi, everyone. Having a good time?

1049
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,550
l love DuLoc. Very clean.

1050
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,470
Why are you here?

1051
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,830
Yes, it's rude enough being alive
when no one wants you.

1052
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,299
But coming uninvited to a wedding!

1053
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,420
Fiona, I need to talk to you.

1054
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,160
Oh, now you want to talk?

1055
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,790
Well, it's too late for that.

1056
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,480
-You can't marry him!
-Why not?

1057
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,290
He's just marrying you
so he can be king.

1058
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,870
Outrageous! Don't listen to him.

1059
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,400
He's not your true love.

1060
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,220
What would you know about that?

1061
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,010
I, uh...

1062
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,090
Oh, this is precious.

1063
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,349
The ogre has fallen in love
with the Princess!

1064
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,280
Oh, good Lord!

1065
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,889
An ogre and a princess!

1066
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,650
Shrek, is this true?

1067
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,350
Who cares?! It's preposterous!

1068
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,680
Fiona, my love,
we're but a kiss away from-

1069
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,930
-our happily ever after. Now kiss me!

1070
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,500
"By night, one way, by day, another."

1071
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,820
I wanted to show you before.

1072
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,080
That explains a lot.

1073
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,790
It's disgusting!

1074
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,670
Guards! Guards!

1075
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,700
Get that out of my sight!
Now! Get them!

1076
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,309
Get them both!

1077
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,580
All this hocus-pocus alters nothing!

1078
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,980
This marriage is binding,
which makes me king! See?!

1079
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,550
Let go of me!

1080
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,370
Don't just stand there!

1081
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,220
Get out of my way! Fiona!

1082
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,040
Insolent beast!

1083
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,000
I'll make you regret
the day we met!

1084
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,379
I'll see you drawn and quartered!

1085
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,230
You'll beg for death to save you!

1086
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,950
And as for you, my wife...

1087
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,910
.. you'll be locked back up
for the rest of your days!

1088
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,210
lam king!

1089
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,450
I will have order!

1090
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,170
I will have perfection! I will have..

1091
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,130
Nobody move! I got a dragon
and I'm not afraid to use it!

1092
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,330
I'm a donkey on the edge!

1093
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,660
Celebrity marriages...
they never last, do they?

1094
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,800
Go on, Shrek.

1095
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,190
Fiona?

1096
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,280
Yes, Shrek?

1097
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,690


1098
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,490
...[L love you.

1099
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,000
Really?

1100
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,980
Really, really.

1101
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,180
I love you, too.

1102
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,380
AHHH!

1103
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,700
Until you find true love's first kiss...

1104
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,260
..and then take love's true form.

1105
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,650
Fiona?

1106
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:19,290
Fiona. Are you all right?

1107
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,490
Well, yes.

1108
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:27,340
But I don't understand.
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1109
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,230
You are beautiful.

1110
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,880
l was hoping this had a happy ending.

1111
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,410
God bless us, every one!

1112
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,309
Come on, y'all!

1113
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,450
Oh, that's funny!

1114
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,770
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
