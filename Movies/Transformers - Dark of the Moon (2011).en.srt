1
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,823
We were once a peaceful race

2
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,319
of intelligent, mechanical beings.

3
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,431
But then came the war

4
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,989
between the Autobots,
who fought for freedom

5
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,576
and the Decepticons,
who dreamt of tyranny.

6
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,679
Overmatched and outnumbered,

7
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,378
our defeat was all but certain.

8
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,752
But in the war's final days,

9
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,584
one Autobot ship escaped the battle.

10
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,304
It was carrying a secret cargo,

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,186
which would have changed
our planet's fate.

12
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:44,994
A desperate mission.

13
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,658
Our final hope.

14
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,967
A hope that vanished.

15
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,602
One up there. One over there.

16
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,874
And one more down there.

17
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,222
What you got?

18
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,282
Impact detected.

19
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,601
We have impact confirmed.
Contact at 2250 GMT.

20
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,530
What?

21
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,073
Get me SecDef on the phone
right away.

22
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,614
Mr. McNamara,
the President is expecting you.

23
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,388
Get Bobby in here.

24
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,766
Mr. President, designation, top secret.

25
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,032
We believe a UFO has crashed
into the Moon.

26
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,298
We think the Russians are onto it
as well.

27
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,867
Well, then you tell NASA
to move heaven and earth.

28
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,289
We need to get to the moon.

29
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,307
We’re going to attempt
a manned mission.

30
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,275
NASA said it would take five years.

31
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,338
You get there before the Russians.

32
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,861
! believe that this nation
should commit itself

33
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,846
to achieving the goal

34
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,305
before this decade is out

35
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,311
of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the Earth.

36
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,695
Ignition sequence start.

37
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:45,884
Five, four, three, two, one.

38
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,000
All engines running.

39
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,348
Liftoff. We have a liftoff.

40
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,984
Thirty-two minutes past the hour.
Liftoff on Apollo 11.

41
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,182
Neil Armstrong reporting Apollo 11
on proper heading.

42
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,916
Apollo 11 is on the way, riding that

43
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,192
pillar of flame

44
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,453
from the Saturn V out there,
250,000 miles away,

45
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,758
where the moon is waiting

46
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,927
for man’s first arrival.

47
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,808
Houston, you're a go for landing. Over.

48
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,150
Forty feet, down two and a half.
Picking up some dust.

49
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,386
Thirty feet, two and a half down.
Faint shadow.

50
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,506
Capcom, flight.

51
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,426
Four forward. Drifting to the right a little.

52
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,897
Down a half.

53
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,458
Contact light.

54
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,933
Okay, engine stop.

55
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:40,916
Houston,

56
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,340
Tranquility Base here.

57
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,980
The Eagle has landed.

58
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,800
We copy you down, Eagle.

59
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,608
You got a bunch of guys
about fo turn blue.

60
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,010
We're breathing again.

61
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:57,154
Perhaps 400 million persons
are watching this broadcast today

62
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,481
of the greatest event in our time
and one of the great events

63
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,835
of all recorded history.

64
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,401
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

65
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,041
Okay, I'm gonna step off the LEM now.

66
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,682
That's one smail step for man,

67
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,512
one giant leap for mankind.

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
-Are we good?
-Yes, sir.

69
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,741
Unofficial time on the first step, 109...

70
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,748
Apollo 11? This is Houston, over.

71
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,311
Eagle, we're getting
a signal interference. Do you copy?

72
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,296
We now have had confirmation

73
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,541
of loss of signal

74
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,476
from the Apollo 11.

75
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,148
The Apollo 11 is, at the moment,
on the far side of the moon.

76
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,894
Neil, you are dark on the rock.

77
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,929
Mission is a go.

78
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,419
We have 21 minutes.

79
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,387
My God.

80
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,299
It’s some sort of giant metal face.

81
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,038
Jesus.

82
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,527
Control, we are inside the ship.

83
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,801
Extensive damage.

84
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,410
Way too big to check the entire ship.

85
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,609
Everything’s dead in here, Houston.

86
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,618
No signs of life anywhere.

87
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,582
These things are massive.

88
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,995
We copy. You've got seven minutes
on your oxygen.

89
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,595
We are not alone after all, are we?

90
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,431
No, sir. We're not alone.

91
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,761
Go ahead, Mr. President.

92
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,189
Hello, Neil and Buzz.
I'm talking to you by telephone

93
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,010
from the Oval Room
at the White House.

94
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,789
And this certainly has to be the most
historic telephone call ever made.

95
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,119
! just can't fell you
how proud we all are of you.

96
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,226
For every American, this has to be
the proudest day of our lives.

97
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,458
Because of what you have done...

98
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,183
We have splashdown.

99
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,762
...the heavens have become a part

100
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,520
of man's world.

101
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,854
For one priceless moment

102
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,890
in the whole history of man

103
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,787
all the people on this Earth
are truly one.

104
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,469
One in their pride
in what you have done.

105
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,111
It inspires us to redouble our efforts

106
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,636
to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.

107
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:51,550
1

108
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,848
My hero needs to wake up.

109
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,391
What is that?

110
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,423
This is your new lucky bunny.

111
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,057
It's a beautiful thought, Carly,

112
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,353
but I don't think
it's the whole bunny that's lucky.

113
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,290
You see, it's just this section here.

114
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,906
You see,
it's just the rabbit foot that's lucky.

115
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,780
Well, it's just a good luck charm.
To help you think positive?

116
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,984
Today's important.

117
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,384
Come on, get up.

118
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,529
-Hey, wear that nice tie.
-Yeah.

119
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,746
You need any money for lunch?

120
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,832
No, I don't need any money for lunch.
I have money from yesterday's lunch.

121
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,233
You love it, don't you?
I'm just your American boy toy.

122
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,980
A lover boy toy.

123
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,005
You know how demoralizing it is
to have saved the world twice

124
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,420
and still be groveling for a job?

125
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,605
People don't know
you saved the world, Sam.

126
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,556
I mean, I do. I believe you.

127
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,489
The government knows. I mean,
they could hook me up with a job

128
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:12,775
right here in D.C.

129
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,266
I mean, I should be working
with the Autobots, otherwise it's not fair.

130
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,382
Come on, they paid for your college.
The President gave you a hero medal.

131
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,898
Thank you, man. Great job.

132
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,586
That's the coolest thing
that ever happened to me.

133
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,917
All right, guys.

134
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,595
-What the fuck!
-Wow.

135
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,055
And, as I recall, that wasn't even
the highlight of your day.

136
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,093
Mr. Ambassador, here.

137
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,401
British Embassy, you're up next.

138
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,175
No, you don't wear it.
See, you've gotta... The box.

139
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,611
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

140
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,283
You're supposed to leave it
in the box, right?

141
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,488
You keep it in this.
What a gorgeous box.

142
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,024
Oh, yeah. My medal.
You know who gave that to me?

143
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,800
-Who?
-POTUS.

144
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,115
President of the United States.

145
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,790
Babe, it's hard for everybody
to get a job.

146
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,952
I don't have time. You see, my parents
are gonna be here in a week

147
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,124
on their road trip Partybus World Tour.

148
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,353
If my dad gets here
and I don't have a job,

149
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,106
he's gonna spank me.
You know, it's go time for me.

150
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,328
All right, tonight, I'll give you a job.

151
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:32,241
Romance me with a nice dinner
and maybe you can get that bonus.

152
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,973
-Get lucky.
-Get him out of here.

153
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,161
Wait. No, no, no, no.

154
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,495
-Oh, he's gross!
-She's good.

155
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,454
They're stranded here. Somebody's
got to watch out for them.

156
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,796
Yesterday, that one was
in my underwear drawer.

157
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,975
Did research. Looking real good, too.

158
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,734
No need to hit me.

159
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,592
-You are not a normal boyfriend.
-That's what you love about me.

160
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,891
-Crybaby.
-We're not at the love word yet.

161
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,804
Maybe a little bit closer when you're
covering your half of the rent.

162
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:02,950
Good-bye.

163
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,805
Frickin’ shorting my circuits out here!

164
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,216
It's inhumane, what it is!
Make us live in a box

165
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,632
on a balcony, right next to a beast!
Like a common animal!

166
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,036
Stop, okay?

167
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,410
You and your creepy sidekick
can't be in here without permission.

168
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,416
According to who?
Miss Blondie Blonde?

169
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,381
Giddyup, little doggie!

170
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,566
-Yo, Brains, wassup?
-Doing good.

171
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,204
Shit, 1 seen this one.
It's the one where Spock goes nuts.

172
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,272
You know, Sam, I don't know
about moving in with this chick.

173
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,332
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

174
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,524
She was mean. Didn't like her.

175
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,146
Us guys got to stick together.

176
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,728
We are family

177
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,529
No, we are not family.
You're a political refugee,

178
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,959
and I have finally found someone
who appreciates me for me.

179
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,145
Well, you tell her
that we're not your pets,

180
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,550
and we're not your toys!

181
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,528
All right? We're an advanced, genius
alien race just looking for a home.

182
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:55,127
1

183
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,631
-Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.
-Didn't have to stop.

184
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,319
Come on.
What're they going to do, tow it?

185
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,008
Where is he?

186
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,960
Sammy!

187
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,902
-Come on, that's funny!
-Sam.

188
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,218
I missed you guys so much.

189
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,107
Sure, you did. What do you think?

190
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,508
-Look at that.
-Cute.

191
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,024
-You look old.
-Stop it.

192
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,228
Feel like I can see the end.

193
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,276
I love your little tie.
Hey, where's my girl?

194
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,036
-Where's my beautiful Carly?
-She's at work, Ma.

195
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,327
She's got a new job. You guys said
you were gonna be here in a week.

196
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,846
The 21st, not the 11th, Dad, remember?

197
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,248
We just hauled ass in this thing.

198
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,999
-We stopped for gas.
-This thing. The love tub, it flies.

199
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,932
Are we keeping you from something?
Like, say, your job?

200
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,469
Well, it's about time.
You had us worried.

201
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,767
I have job interviews.

202
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,078
That's good.

203
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:44,613
-That sucks.
-Stop it.

204
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,560
You don't have to be so negative, Dad.
You know, you're in D.C.

205
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:47,976
You're here with your son
and your family.

206
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,930
-I mean, it's a good time.
-It sucks that you don't have a job.

207
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,726
Yeah, but there's good things
to do here, too, right?

208
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,555
Right? Museums
and monuments, okay?

209
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,209
-I'll see you tonight.
-I'm bagging the gift.

210
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,008
Sam, I think for an interview
you should wear real pants.

211
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,367
I think for life,
you should wear real pants.

212
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,793
What happened to Bumblebee?

213
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,049
He's off on his missions.
l had to get this for backup.

214
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,755
-Your car has a job, huh?
-Stop.

215
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,734
What does it change into?

216
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,833
It doesn't change into anything.
It's a collector's item, Ma.

217
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,887
I got it for a steal.
It just needs some work. Trust me.

218
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,593
No, I think it's darling.
It reminds me a lot of Bumblebee,

219
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,740
if Bumblebee were a sad piece of shit.

220
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,989
Come on, we'll give you a ride!

221
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,345
In the years since our arrival,
our new home, Earth,

222
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,746
has seen much change.

223
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,828
Energon detectors guard its cities now.

224
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,578
Long-range defense systems
watch the skies.

225
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,784
So now we assist our allies
in solving human conflicts,

226
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,282
to prevent mankind
from bringing harm to itself.

227
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,074
On the ground, per favore!
And stay there!

228
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,510
We work in secret teams
on various missions around the globe.

229
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,324
And ail the while

230
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,093
we search for signs
of our true enemies’ return.

231
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,936
J} am Voshkod, General Counsel
with Ukrainian Department of Energy.

232
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,157
My government will officially deny

233
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,242
that we're having this conversation.

234
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,604
At one of our decommissioned facilities,
a discovery was made,

235
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,141
which I fear may be alien in nature.

236
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,111
The facility's name is Chernobyl.

237
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,016
Mr. Voshkod.

238
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,844
So, uninhabited since '86.

239
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,307
l hear it won't be livable again
for another 20,000 years?

240
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,707
At least.
Ukraine was the most fertile land.

241
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,304
It's a tragedy.

242
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,829
This way.

243
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,167
Gear up!
We have 60 minutes on the ground.

244
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,360
Watch your radiation levels.

245
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,938
Mr. Voshkod,
where's your protective gear?

246
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,867
Where's your protective gear?

247
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,149
It would not matter.

248
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,794
For me, it's only a matter of time.

249
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,330
Through the school.

250
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,079
Yuri will take you below.
And one other thing, Colonel.

251
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,109
In private,
there were some energy experiments.

252
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:10,665
It can wait.

253
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,212
Keep moving. Stay tight.

254
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,316
Okay, right here. I think I found it.

255
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,651
Optimus, we got a visual.

256
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,418
Looks like the object's clamped
in some kind of a metal harness.

257
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,714
What's this? Guys!

258
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,353
Why does this thing have
Soviet space program markings on it?

259
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,070
Sputnik?

260
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,555
Energon readings, sir. It's strong.

261
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,123
Below us. It's coming fast.

262
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,008
Contact, contact!

263
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:14,113
1

264
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,950
Get topside now! Move, move, move!

265
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,735
-Let's go!
-Weapons up! Heavy weapons up!

266
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,735
Stay behind me!

267
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,290
Optimus!

268
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,057
Fall back!

269
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,502
It's circling around us!

270
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,321
It's taking our flank!

271
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:13,785
Get the heavy weapon!

272
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:17,942
Optimus!

273
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,543
What the hell was that thing?

274
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,019
That

275
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,104
is Shockwave.

276
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,494
Why was he after this?

277
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,966
It's impossible.

278
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:51,303
This is an engine part
from a long lost Autobot ship.

279
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,248
Pleasure working with you.

280
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,060
Interviews. This is so exciting.

281
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,083
Honey, do you want some gum?

282
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,761
Your breath gets really gnarly
when you're nervous.

283
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,491
-Mr. Witwicky?
-Yeah. Search is over.

284
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,578
I'm Mr. Whitley.

285
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,669
Mr...

286
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,104
-ls anybody else joining?
-No.

287
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,581
No? You want me to move right there?

288
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,790
-I'll move right there.
-I'd prefer not.

289
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,775
Ready? Begin.

290
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,191
Graduated this year. Majored
in geopolitics. Minor in tech studies.

291
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,813
Very interested in government
and technology,

292
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,255
how that's gonna intersect and co-exist.

293
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,539
Shape the future.

294
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,337
Why did we bother sending him
to an Ivy college for?

295
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,780
Three months out of school
and he can't find a job?

296
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,449
Mr. Masuhisu...

297
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,748
Matsumoto.

298
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,315
-Matsumoto.
-Moto.

299
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,177
-Martha, can I call you Martha?
-No, you may not.

300
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,169
Okay, Jack,
there's two types of people in this world.

301
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,521
There's thinkers, there's doers.

302
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,715
There's winners, there's dreamers,
and there's buddies.

303
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,874
What about some weaknesses?

304
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,870
I don't...

305
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,162
You have a very trustworthy face.

306
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,523
You remind me of
like an Asian Colonel Sanders.

307
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,229
A man I can trust.

308
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,333
He's a millennial.

309
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,721
That means they're the, you know,
like lost generation.

310
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,701
Why was the FBI looking for you?

311
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,822
The what?

312
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,258
Yeah, FBI. Good of you to flag that.

313
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,186
It was during all that alien craziness
when you were 14.

314
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,242
I mean, they were very kind to me,
found me in a jiffy.

315
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,391
And that's all been expunged.
Obama gave me a medal, actually.

316
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,038
I'm just saying.
It's always good to have a medal guy

317
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,607
in the office, with a medal.

318
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,335
-From Obama?
-Yeah.

319
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,917
In this office,
we're mostly Republicans, so...

320
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:49,791
I'm not feeling too good.

321
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:50,891
-No?
-No.

322
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,873
Why don't you get a little dipping tray
and dip the dog in Pepto?

323
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,205
That's a solution.

324
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,680
I got another one. We got to go.

325
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,911
-Come on.
-Really?

326
00:21:58,551 --> 00:21:59,420
Sit.

327
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,519
Got myself a Mr. Sam Witwicky,
recent college graduate.

328
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,263
Previous experience, next to zero,

329
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,094
yet he has a recommend letter
from our board?

330
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,667
WTF to that.

331
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,132
-Do I know somebody on your board?
-Here's the deal.

332
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,174
You know who we are.
Accuretta Systems,

333
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:21,406
global leader in telecom, aerospace,
17 billion in profit last year.

334
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,944
We contract for DARPA, NASA, JPL,
you name it.

335
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,880
You perform here,
doors open for you anywhere.

336
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,627
First job out of college is critical, kid.

337
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,513
You either take a step
down the correct career path

338
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,946
or you fall into a life-sucking abyss.

339
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:41,497
So it all depends on how you respond
to my next two words.

340
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,701
Impress me.

341
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,580
-Now?
-Impress me.

342
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:47,892
You catch me off guard.

343
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,246
-I don't know where to begin.
-Impress me.

344
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,615
I'm an open book.
Ask me any question you like.

345
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,573
-So you're a go-getter, ramrod...
-Yes, sir.

346
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,898
...take-charge kind of guy?

347
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,513
I'm a killer. A stone-cold killer.

348
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:57,906
So, take-charge guy?

349
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,347
Take-charge, Viking, barbarian,
of course, that's me.

350
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,039
Pow! I'm here.

351
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,889
We are not looking for that here.

352
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:14,399
No brown-nosing. No suck up.
No toolery. I...

353
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,654
Yes, Mr. Brazos.

354
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:24,245
Why is Shontel using
what appears to be a red cup

355
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,140
from the red floor

356
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,548
-when we are on the yellow floor?
-I'm on it.

357
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:33,043
It is a visual and, therefore,
a visceral betrayal.

358
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,263
Stop it!

359
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,368
Such a dumbass.

360
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,480
Disgusting!

361
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,876
Thank you!

362
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,181
It's total anarchy around here.

363
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:49,701
The e-mail I read
said administrative aide?

364
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,851
Nope. Mailroom.

365
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,882
I'm gonna go.

366
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,271
Do you have any idea how many
Ivy League Phi Beta Kappas

367
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,622
-would kill to...
-Mister, I saved your life twice. Okay?

368
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,222
I can't tell you how or when or why,

369
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,754
but I have done shit that matters

370
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,946
and I'd just kind of like a job
where I matter again.

371
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,483
So thank you, but no, thank you, okay?

372
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,601
You know what I think?
You want the job after this job.

373
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,805
But, son, this is the job
that's standing in your way.

374
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:22,195
And that's why you're gonna be
So very, very good at it.

375
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,868
‘Cause when I look at you,
Il see a younger me.

376
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:48,496
All arriving Autobots, in par,
training and debriefing in 15 minutes.

377
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,234
Dino, report to Bay 23.

378
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,667
Sideswipe, Bay 37
for weapons assessment.

379
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,340
Senator, I suggest you remember that

380
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,658
when the NSA wants funding,
they call me.

381
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,240
When the CIA
is gonna take out a target,

382
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,163
they ask first for my permission.

383
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,528
And when the President wants to know

384
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,619
which members of Congress
are politically vulnerable

385
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,322
in terms of, let's say,
undiscovered criminal conduct,

386
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,965
I'm the number he dials.

387
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,420
U.S. agencies say
they have been monitoring the blast.

388
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,133
But if, in fact,
this was a covert military strike,

389
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,636
-no nation has claimed responsibility.
-CIA is up my ass

390
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,285
about this mystery raid
in the Middle East.

391
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,406
So, it's time to come clean.
Was your unit involved?

392
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:31,889
I'm not sure, ma'am.

393
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:35,674
All right, guys. This is how you do
a Decepticon head kill shot.

394
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,906
As Director of National Intelligence,

395
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,848
I'm a really big fan
of intelligent answers.

396
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,226
I can't really tell you definitively.
These Autobots are like teenage kids.

397
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,267
They like to sneak out of the house
every once in a while.

398
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,632
Colonel Lennox, are you in command
or are you not?

399
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,053
Yes, ma'am, l am.

400
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,018
Stop with the "ma'am."
Enough with the "ma'am."

401
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,553
Do I look like a "ma'am"?

402
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,601
No, ma‘am. Yes, ma'am. Yes.

403
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,484
This gun
is my perfect invention, Ironhide.

404
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,740
Right.

405
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,421
Good, you're here!

406
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:01,723
Me name's Que.

407
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,394
I do hope you have answers for him.
I've never seen him so upset.

408
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,853
Optimus, you remember
Charlotte Mearing?

409
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,136
Our Director of National Intelligence?

410
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,665
He's in a bad mood.
He's not talking to anybody today.

411
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,409
What is this, the silent treatment?

412
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:19,122
-We've seen that and this is not that.
-Definitely not.

413
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,038
This is worse.

414
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,460
Prime! Make something of yourself!

415
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,940
He's pissed.

416
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,511
You lied to us.

417
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,422
Everything humans know of our planet
we were told had all been shared.

418
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,403
So why was this found
in human possession?

419
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,839
We were in the dark on this also.

420
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,814
It was Director Only clearance
at Sector 7 until now.

421
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,205
The bag.

422
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,745
-Which bag?
-Hermés. Birkin. Green ostrich!

423
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,471
Oh, my God.

424
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,673
This is a secret few men knew,
and fewer still remain alive.

425
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,608
Allow me to please introduce to you

426
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,139
two of NASA's
founding mission directors

427
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,458
and astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin,

428
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,937
one of the first two men
to step foot on the moon.

429
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,729
Sir? Optimus Prime.

430
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:16,168
From a fellow space traveler,
it's a true honor.

431
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:17,972
The honor is mine.

432
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,617
Our entire space race of the 1960s,
it appears, was in response to an event.

433
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,550
Our astronauts investigated
a crashed alien ship.

434
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,441
No survivors onboard.

435
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,509
We were sworn to secrecy
by our Commander in Chief.

436
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,309
This was a mission
you will never speak of.

437
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,756
l understand, sir.

438
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,684
A total of 35 people
knew the real plan at NASA.

439
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,878
Soviets managed to land
unmanned probes.

440
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,272
Somehow they must have picked up
that fuel rod.

441
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,818
We believe the Russians deduced

442
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:53,954
that the rod
was a fissionable fuel assembly,

443
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,969
believed they had it mastered,
and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.

444
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,523
We landed six missions in all.

445
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,162
We took hundreds of photos
and samples.

446
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,185
We locked them away forever,

447
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,070
and the moon program was shut down.

448
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,348
Well, did you search the crash vault?

449
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,987
The ship's name was the Ark.

450
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,949
l watched it escape Cybertron myself.

451
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:21,509
It was carrying an Autobot technology
which would have won us the war.

452
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,867
And its captain.

453
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,900
Who was its captain?

454
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,571
The great Sentinel Prime,
the technology's inventor.

455
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:33,425
He was commander of the Autobots
before me.

456
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,381
It's imperative that I find it

457
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,216
before the Decepticons learn
of its location.

458
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,124
Our Autobot spacecraft
has the ability to get there.

459
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,858
And you must pray it's in time.

460
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,665
Hi. I'm here to see Carly Spencer.

461
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,455
Carly!

462
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:14,448
-You got the job?
-This is crazy.

463
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,810
-You really got it?
-Yes.

464
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,988
See, what did I tell you? It's the bunny.

465
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,428
You are so welcome.

466
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,536
-Do you like me more?
-A little bit, yeah.

467
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:23,858
You said you were his assistant curator,

468
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,359
you didn't say
the guy owns Space Mountain.

469
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:29,354
I know. Isn't it beautiful in here?
And he's the coolest guy. Ever.

470
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:30,962
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

471
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,106
Sam.

472
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,389
Dylan Gould.

473
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,665
Hey. A pleasure to meet you.

474
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,691
Pleasure meeting you.
Carly's told me a lot about you.

475
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,200
Well, vice versa.
It's a beautiful building you got.

476
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,926
It's like the Starship Enterprise in here.

477
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,561
Thank you very much. It leaks.

478
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,466
Before Carly came
to help run the collection,

479
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,281
it was just a complete mess.

480
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,553
But now,
the restorations are back on track.

481
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,829
We're going to Pebble Beach this year,

482
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,823
and we're gonna get a trophy
for that stand right there.

483
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,655
You know why?
Because this woman right here

484
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,182
-is my secret weapon.
-Okay.

485
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,497
Mr. Gould, please, you exaggerate.
All I've done is get you organized.

486
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,228
You've done much more than that,
my Duchess.

487
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,971
Nicknames, that's fun.

488
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,010
Yeah. The Duchess.

489
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,282
She's adorable.

490
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,583
You know, when I stole her away
from the British Embassy,

491
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,288
I said, "It's easy to manage a country.

492
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,667
“Try managing
a priceless collection of art.”

493
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:25,156
Take a look
at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

494
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:26,757
Designed by a Frenchman.

495
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,719
Look at the curves.
Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.

496
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,627
Sensual.

497
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,882
Built to evoke the body
of the ideal woman.

498
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:38,753
Come on.

499
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:42,978
My dad had a $10 desk and a dream,
and he built it into an empire.

500
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,062
Wow.

501
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,274
We're the largest accounting firm
in the U.S.

502
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,159
I started up the venture side
after he passed. Invest in the future.

503
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,683
Try and bet on the winners.

504
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,456
See, collecting cars helps me
keep my sanity.

505
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,052
You guys look great.

506
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,537
That was a great day, Mr. Gould.

507
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,585
-I haven't seen that one.
-No. Me, neither.

508
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,280
Jeans are tight.

509
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:13,558
1

510
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,533
Here we go. Here we go. You see that?

511
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,366
Judgment. Judging a man by his car?

512
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,018
And you're gonna wave at him
while he's judging me?

513
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,126
What's with you? He's my boss.
This job pays for our food, our rent.

514
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,899
No, I totally understand.
I'm totally fine. I get it. I'm well fed.

515
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,782
And guess what?
I'm not your boy toy anymore.

516
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,581
I got my big boy pants on.
You see them?

517
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:31,942
In the car. Thank you, Duchess.

518
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,533
Oh, my God.
Are you threatened by him?

519
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,028
Threatened? What am I threatened by?
His money? His power? His good looks?

520
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,704
None of the above. Check!

521
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,732
God! Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

522
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,944
Get in the car, please.

523
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,919
Sam, he's hardly the first man
to ever smile at me.

524
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,490
-I think I can handle it.
-Hold on, hold on.

525
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,588
It's the smiling back part
that gets me. Okay?

526
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,574
No more smiles. Never again. I promise.

527
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,420
That works for me.

528
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,338
Easy! Easy!
You're not gonna get it started that way.

529
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,458
Well, I was just getting it ready.
I'm about 32% done with my restoration.

530
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,744
Some chrome work,
put a spoiler on the back. Done deal.

531
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,143
You know, Carly's been telling me
you've been struggling job-wise.

532
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:18,933
Just so you know,

533
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:22,043
I'm on the board for Accuretta Systems,
and I put in a call for you.

534
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:25,301
Let's keep it between us, okay?
She's so proud of you.

535
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,908
You're a lucky man.

536
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,076
Xanthium approaching Tranquility Base.

537
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,929
You're a go for landing.

538
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,655
Ratchet, let's roll.

539
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,225
We're entering the Ark.

540
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,559
His levels are faint.

541
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,057
He locked himself away
to guard the pillars.

542
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,248
Sentinel.

543
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,724
You're coming home, old friend.

544
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,793
All hail Megatron.

545
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,890
My master! Yes, my master! Yes!

546
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:44,998
Don't be greedy, my fragile ones.

547
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,687
My poor master.

548
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:54,516
How it pains me to see you so wounded,
so weak.

549
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,996
Spare me, you gaseous sycophant!

550
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,050
You know what you are told,
which is nothing.

551
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,550
Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.

552
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,443
And what news
from your little assassin?

553
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,917
Autobots have taken the bait!

554
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,415
They've discovered the Ark
and returned with its cargo.

555
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:26,267
You did me great honor
tracking that ship to the moon.

556
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:31,806
Your human collaborators
have served their purpose, Soundwave.

557
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,171
It's time to eliminate loose ends.

558
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,399
Laserbeak, kill them all.

559
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,252
With pleasure.

560
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:56,937
Is your daddy home?

561
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,863
-"Then Madeline said..."
-Madeline!

562
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,679
Hello, Mom.

563
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,842
Get out of the house!

564
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,564
-What are you doing in my house?
-Just visiting.

565
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,317
What is this hoochie-mama outfit?

566
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,101
No, this is the aerospace division!
We do not allow that here!

567
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,378
New guy! You see that?
That's a Latin meltdown, okay?

568
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,813
You ever show up in my office
with a hoochie-mama outfit, you're fired.

569
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,102
You got that?

570
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,207
Okay, you're gonna be on this cart
for two-and-a-half years, okay?

571
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,682
I want you to live it, love it and name it.

572
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,660
There's no ladder climbing in my office.
I run a tight ship. Okay?

573
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,184
-Yes, sir.
-Move!

574
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,970
I found that paper
I was telling you about.

575
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,924
-What are we looking at?
-Shut up!

576
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,546
You do that to me again,
and Ill kick your ass!

577
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:23,567
Hi.

578
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:24,805
Hi, angel.

579
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,216
-How are you?
-Good.

580
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:29,058
I had a meeting downtown.
Was it okay for me to stop by?

581
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,244
I don't know.
My 500-page employee conduct manual

582
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:32,546
isn't exactly a page turner.

583
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:33,687
This is great.

584
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:36,292
Yeah, Autobots are off saving the world,
and I have organized four binders.

585
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,955
I'm living the dream. Come on.

586
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,381
Visitor violation.

587
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,616
-You okay?
-Absolutely.

588
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:51,752
I'm next.

589
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,741
Listen. Saturday.
Dylan's throwing a party at his house.

590
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,615
It's a work thing,
but he's invited you, too.

591
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,793
Did he?

592
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,183
I want you to come
and laugh at my bad jokes.

593
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,769
It would really mean a lot to me, okay?

594
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,601
I'd love to go. How'd you get over here?

595
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,490
-Car.
-You don't have a car.

596
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,619
-Yes, I do.
-What, did you win it in a raffle?

597
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,229
He gave me one.

598
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,453
He gave you a car?

599
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,035
Yeah, I think it was a work perk.

600
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,320
A work perk.

601
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:20,514
-What kind of car did he give you?
-A Mercedes SLS AMG.

602
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,243
Really throaty engine.

603
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,366
Mercedes-Benz SLS

604
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,814
-combines breathtaking performance...
-You drove this here?

605
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,551
That's a $200,000 car.

606
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:33,627
I know.

607
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,428
You know how long it would take me
to afford a car like this?

608
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,518
-A long time?
-Yeah, like 53 years.

609
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:39,997
He said it was for both of us.

610
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,015
Then what we should do is,
we should sell it and buy a house.

611
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,053
You're frustrated, I know.

612
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,377
I've been there.

613
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,729
It's called paying your dues.
Good things will happen.

614
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,375
Ladies and gentlemen,

615
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,834
I need some lunch time filing done, stat.

616
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,956
Who would like
to score some Bruce Brazos points?

617
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,199
Bruce, you found your guy.

618
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,343
Witwicky!

619
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,087
The man who makes this company run.

620
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,518
Now, who have we here?

621
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,243
Is it a sister, Facebook friend,
Twitter tweeter?

622
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,616
-Carly, this is Bruce. Bruce.
-Hi.

623
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,038
I'm his girlfriend.
A pleasure to meet you. Sam was right.

624
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,884
You really do have
a smashing head of hair.

625
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,363
Well, thank you.

626
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:21,985
-Sam, I got to run.
-Yeah.

627
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:24,831
Here, your present.

628
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,300
Your favorite color.

629
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,756
-Nice to meet you, Mr. Brazos.
-And you.

630
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:34,778
See you, boys.

631
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,770
I'm still stewing about
that binder incident, Jerry.

632
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:46,000
May I finish my Shuhua milk, Donny?

633
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,297
I don't care about your exotic milk.
I care about respect!

634
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:10,444
I know who you are!

635
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,082
Witwicky! Witwicky!

636
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,561
-I'm talking to you!
-Excuse me. Thank you.

637
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,754
Slow down, tiger.

638
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,600
You showed up in the background
of six different photos,

639
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,322
two continents, with aliens.

640
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:26,464
That was you in Egypt, right?
Because you know the aliens.

641
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:28,512
See you!

642
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,768
Give me my jacket!

643
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:42,504
I'm Wang. Deep Wang. Deep Wang.

644
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,344
You're not getting it. Deep Throat.

645
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,563
Watergate? I'm talking code to you...

646
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:48,241
Damn it.

647
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,074
They watch and listen.

648
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,807
I can't go to the government,
but you can!

649
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,203
Because shit's going down, son!
It is Code Pink, as in Floyd!

650
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:01,003
Dark Side! Why do you think
no one's been up there since 1972?

651
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:04,473
I know you're speaking English,
it's just a very strange English.

652
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,866
That's why I'm not...

653
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:08,665
Don't. I'm gonna hit you.

654
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,430
I'm gonna hit you right back, son.

655
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,399
It's my manifesto.

656
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:13,807
They're whacking us out,

657
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,382
everyone who knows
what's on the dark...

658
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,064
Your alien friends are in danger,
you know, the good ones. It's up to you.

659
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:21,625
Calm down.

660
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:24,324
Easy, Sam!

661
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,428
What are you looking at?

662
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:36,993
Yo, dawg.

663
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:40,105
Are you up in my shit?
Who are you working for?

664
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,873
Staredown, you and me.

665
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,054
Guess I won.

666
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:51,625
Moon satellites.

667
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,871
The Russian space program.

668
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,100
Experts dead.

669
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:58,916
Space program ends.

670
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,651
Dark side... Dark side of the moon.

671
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,597
Look what I found outside the bathroom.
Is it yours?

672
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,753
-Deal with this.
-Yes, sir.

673
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,127
I did everything you want!

674
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,959
I really think we should talk,
‘cause some of the stuff...

675
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,787
Whoa! Knock first!

676
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,183
Can't you see I'm busy?

677
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,204
Who are you? Who are you?

678
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,664
You straddled me in the stall.

679
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,509
That's happened to me once in this life.
I wouldn't forget it.

680
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,375
From the bathroom stall.
You took your package out.

681
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,674
-You took your package out.
-Whoa! We are not boyfriends, okay?

682
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:32,208
One phone call from me
and Ill have you fired.

683
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:34,167
Yes, I will, Gaylord!

684
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:35,856
Are you okay?

685
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,711
Hemorrhoids!

686
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,546
Should I come back?
When should I come back?

687
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,352
Come back
when you learn some manners!

688
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,004
I don't know him!
I would never say anything!

689
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,621
Okay, okay!
I sabotaged the mapping satellite,

690
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:55,842
just like I promised,

691
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,567
I can put a blind spot in the program
as a bonus.

692
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,429
What more do you want from me?

693
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:03,087
Jerry, you are my favorite.

694
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,021
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

695
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,749
I know, but my superiors need me to...

696
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,180
-Please, you don't have to...
-...suicide you.

697
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,694
What did you say to Witwicky?

698
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,669
Shit!

699
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,469
Who wants some chicken dinner now,
bitch?

700
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,585
‘Cause somebody messed
with the wrong Wang today!

701
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:30,253
Come on! You want some of me?

702
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,049
I don't need any more didactic lectures
from Chuck.

703
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,493
Jesus!

704
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,466
Get legal.

705
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,640
That's Jerry!

706
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,894
Come on, people.
Yes, a workmate died,

707
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,173
but looking out the window
is not going to bring him back.

708
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,532
The man was depressed.

709
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:03,676
Don't take a picture!

710
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,870
You can keep watching him,
but he's not getting up.

711
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,417
You all read "Humpty Dumpty.” Okay?

712
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:10,887
Witwicky.

713
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,795
I'm spearheading the press.
You clean up.

714
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:16,508
Wang is everywhere. He is in the bistro.

715
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,044
He's in the bamboo.
He's on the balustrade.

716
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:22,024
You see the sidewalk down there? Man!

717
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,170
Box up his personals.
Get his name off his parking space.

718
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,090
Hey, when did we get a new copier?

719
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,241
Listen, I'm not gonna say anything
about what I saw.

720
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:32,974
Who you share a toilet stall with
is totally your business.

721
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,941
This is exceedingly Japanese.

722
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:40,693
They never make it easy, do they?

723
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:17,401
1

724
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,645
-What is with you?
-This is the real deal, Carly, okay?

725
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,922
I need you to stay composed.
It's real life. I'll explain it to you later.

726
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,695
We've got an emergency.
You gotta get Colonel Lennox out here.

727
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,401
I'm reporting a Decepticon.
The Decepticons are back.

728
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,629
You gotta open that gate right now.

729
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,067
Easy, sir.
This is Health and Human Services.

730
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,759
Right. Packing M4s?

731
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,238
What are you protecting,
colostomy bags?

732
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:39,586
-Bedpans? Throat lozenges?
-Babe...

733
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:41,187
Where'd you get that hat from,
nursing school?

734
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,932
So, you're nurses
and foot-powder protectors? Fantastic.

735
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:44,174
-Babe.
-Yes.

736
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:45,342
I don't think we're in the right place.

737
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,460
We are in the right place.

738
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,441
We're in the right place
and I'm gonna talk to Optimus right now.

739
00:45:48,813 --> 00:45:49,633
-You're gonna get Optimus out here.
-Sir.

740
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,700
Sir, you got the wrong building.

741
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:51,798
I don't know what you're talking about.

742
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,479
What part of "Decepticons are back"
do you not understand?

743
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:56,068
Yo! You being a smartass?

744
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,100
Do not hit my car! It's a collector's item!

745
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,657
I wouldn't do that.

746
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:01,945
You're crazy!

747
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:05,622
We got an Energon reading!

748
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,186
We've got aliens in the vehicle!

749
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:10,248
You move, you're dead! Out! Out!

750
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,348
Got aliens in the vehicle!

751
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,758
-Freeze! Get out!
-We're freezing!

752
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:17,517
Are you...

753
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:18,982
Are you kidding me?

754
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,587
Sam, they've got guns!

755
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,607
-I got him. Go!
-Bee! Is Bee in there?

756
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,551
Okay, all right!

757
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,056
This how you treat Autobots?
We're on the same team.

758
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,709
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-Eleven,
dickhead.

759
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,738
-That's right.
-A-hole.

760
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,553
How's your car now?

761
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,074
That's my car.

762
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,537
Come here.

763
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,691
Come here!

764
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,642
Come on. Sam.

765
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,000
What is your deal?

766
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,830
I know your black ops stuff
is important to you.

767
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,074
I'm not trying to diminish it
or guilt-trip you or anything,

768
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,743
I just never see you anymore.

769
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:03,072
You can't come to the garage
and just hang out one night?

770
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,297
Sam. That makes me feel bad.

771
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:07,013
I hope you feel bad.
You should feel bad.

772
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,665
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.
I feel bad every single day.

773
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,116
Yo, let's go, both of you.
Lennox wants to see you.

774
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,700
What, we not good enough
for you anymore?

775
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,928
I'm sorry, babe.
They were very rude, all right?

776
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:20,018
And you're fixing my car.
You don't think so?

777
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,475
Raise your hand if you had
a flying psycho-ninja copier

778
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,690
trying to kill you today!

779
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:24,810
Those are my brass knuckles.

780
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,743
That's my anklet.
Do I have to take that off, too?

781
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:27,961
And my toe rings?

782
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:29,841
All NEST officials clear the floor.

783
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,961
We have 10 minutes
until attempted contact.

784
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,360
We've taken possession
of the five devices

785
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:37,059
that were hidden in the ship
with Sentinel Prime.

786
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,801
They're some kind of
prototype Autobot technology.

787
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,275
They say Sentinel
was the Einstein of his civilization,

788
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:44,781
so we're gonna keep these locked up

789
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,692
until we know what we're dealing with.

790
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,871
Right now, no one gets access. No one.

791
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,171
This Wang guy recognized me.
He told me to warn you.

792
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,627
He was talking
about the dark side of the moon,

793
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:55,775
-then they killed him.
-Wait a minute.

794
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,790
-He mentioned the moon?
-Yeah, dark side of the moon.

795
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,395
But why would Decepticons
want to kill humans?

796
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,595
I thought their war was
with the Autobots.

797
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,820
And that is when he made his first
quick-look science report.

798
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,645
That's what we want...

799
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:07,944
Who's the chick? Okay.

800
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,889
Excuse me! Colonel Lennox?

801
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,334
Director Mearing,
this is Sam Witwicky...

802
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:15,477
I know his name, Colonel.
I wanna know who gave him clearance?

803
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,283
Who gave me clearance?
How about Optimus Prime,

804
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,055
when he touched down in suburbia
looking for my house?

805
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,407
This is the
National Intelligence Director.

806
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:22,819
In case you...

807
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,781
-Hi.
-Disrespecting a federal officer?

808
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:27,433
Maybe that'll get you somewhere.
Who's she?

809
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,727
She's my girlfriend.

810
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:30,386
What is this, like, a date?

811
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:33,015
She knows all about the Autobots, okay?
She knows Bumblebee.

812
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,521
And she comes from a military family.
I can vouch for her.

813
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,256
Hey, I have an idea. How about
we get back to the important topics,

814
00:48:38,716 --> 00:48:40,736
like the fact that almost had
my face cut off by a Decepticon?

815
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:43,372
As a taxpayer, I'd like to lodge
a complaint, as a matter of fact.

816
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:44,721
Okay, listen, all right?

817
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,739
One of the software engineers
at Sam's office was murdered today.

818
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,613
He was involved in NASA's
lunar mapping probe.

819
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,859
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.

820
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,902
We cannot entrust national security
to teenagers

821
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:58,448
unless I missed a policy paper.
Are we doing that now? No. Good.

822
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,533
I don't care who you are.

823
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:04,161
If you breathe a word of what you
see in here, you will do time for treason.

824
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:05,592
Do you understand me?

825
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,823
I'll take my orders from the Autobots.
I know them. I don't know you.

826
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,194
You will.

827
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:14,656
Sentinel Prime.

828
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:17,929
These things run on Energon,
and he's out of it. He's ina

829
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,672
sort of a sleep mode.

830
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:21,484
Let us begin.

831
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,107
That's the great Matrix of Leadership.

832
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:37,047
He holds the only thing in the universe
that can repower a Transformer's spark.

833
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:39,971
This is incredible.

834
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,321
Sentinel Prime,

835
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:45,758
we bid you return.

836
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:56,856
Hold your fire!

837
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,557
Stop! Sentinel!

838
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,444
It is ], Optimus Prime!

839
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,401
It is all right. You are safe.

840
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:08,604
There is nothing to fear.

841
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,740
We are here.

842
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:15,027
You are home, Sentinel.

843
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,047
The war... The war!

844
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,473
The war was lost.

845
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,772
Cybertron is now
but a barren wasteland.

846
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,079
We have taken refuge here,
on planet Earth.

847
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,759
Its human race is our ally.

848
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,801
My ship. We came under fire.

849
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:40,078
The pillars. Where are the pillars?

850
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,335
You saved five of them,
including the control pillar.

851
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:45,989
Only five?

852
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:48,451
We once had hundreds!

853
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:49,799
Excuse me, gentlemen.

854
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,509
May I ask, what is this technology
you're looking for?

855
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,413
It is the ability to reshape the universe.

856
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,136
Together the pillars
form a space bridge.

857
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,859
I designed, and I alone, can control it.

858
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,096
It defies your laws of physics

859
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,741
to transport matter
through time and space.

860
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,777
You're talking
about a teleportation device, aren't you?

861
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,696
Yes, for resources, for refugees.

862
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,540
Refugees, or troops of soldiers,
weapons, maybe bombs!

863
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:19,601
A means of an instant strike!
That's its military function, isn't it?

864
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,707
It is our technology
and it must be returned.

865
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:26,398
Yes. If humans say so.

866
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,277
You can't just bring weapons of
mass destruction into our atmosphere!

867
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:32,087
You kind of have to clear customs first!

868
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:35,379
A little formality called paperwork
kind of separates us from the animals.

869
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,962
I will overlook your condescending tone

870
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,776
if you heed the gravity of mine.

871
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:45,042
The Decepticons must never know
the space bridge is here.

872
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:46,566
For in their hands,

873
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,427
it would mean the end of your world.

874
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:53,292
“Total Nightmare" file.

875
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,031
So, the investigation is open.
We've sent agents to your office.

876
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,764
And, for the time being, we're gonna
send you home with Autobot protection.

877
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,191
Who do I need to speak to

878
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:05,036
to get you guys to understand
that I can help, that I can contribute?

879
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:06,602
Hey, we can all help.
Want to tell you what I know?

880
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,170
I could tell you about the solar system,
all the fun planets to hang out in.

881
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:10,477
Get off my desk, please.

882
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:13,038
You pulling out guns?
I can't help you out now. She angry.

883
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,397
Oh, my God.

884
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:16,102
What do you envision for me?
I go home now?

885
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,100
I go back to work? I make copies?
I mean...

886
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,399
This is a unit
for veteran intelligence officers

887
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,094
and Special Forces,

888
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:24,246
not for boys
who once owned special cars.

889
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:25,982
That's a bit harsh, isn't it, ma'am?

890
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,633
Don't call me ma'am. I'm not a ma‘'am.

891
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,205
Well, you're a woman, aren't you?

892
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,427
So, are those yours?

893
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,580
Yeah. CIA.

894
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,528
I only ask ‘cause I also have a medal,
from the President.

895
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,915
Yeah. Great.
So, it's not that complicated, right?

896
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,611
No one gets to work with the Autobots
unless I approve it.

897
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,231
You're breaking my chain of command.

898
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,111
Come on, let's go.
You've done what you came for.

899
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,117
With all due respect, young man,
l appreciate what you did.

900
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:54,564
But you're not a soldier.

901
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,328
You're a messenger.
You've always been a messenger.

902
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,245
He's a hero.

903
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,659
Bee, you take the freight elevator.
I'll see you up there.

904
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:15,006
This blows.
That lady officially kicked us out.

905
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,895
Yeah.
Witness Protection Program sucks.

906
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,022
Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer
with big yellow and his cannons.

907
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,082
That dog can't protect crap.

908
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:25,805
Bee?

909
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:33,329
You miss hanging out?

910
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:35,748
Yeah, me, too.

911
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:42,278
That woman,
she called me a messenger.

912
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,836
Can you believe that? After everything
I've done, I'm a messenger.

913
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:47,689
I believe it. I tell you, Sammy,
we feel the same way.

914
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,587
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

915
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,688
We should do something about it.

916
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:57,764
Bee, I need to know
why they're killing humans.

917
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,132
I say we call in the expert.

918
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:02,904
My next guest is a former
American intelligence operative

919
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,983
who has dared to speak out

920
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:08,532
regarding our alleged military alliance
with what many describe

921
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:11,863
as a group
of extraterrestrial mercenaries.

922
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:16,132
He is the author of the bestselling book,
Code-Name Hero.

923
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,667
Former special agent,
Seymour Simmons.

924
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,162
Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.

925
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,172
Now, Agent Simmons,
you would have us believe

926
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,049
that it is in our best interest

927
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:28,495
to formally take sides
in this so-called alien civil war?

928
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:31,236
Well, the other side wanted to
spank us for breakfast,

929
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,718
so I wouldn't exactly call it a toss-up.

930
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:35,658
These Decepticons are lethal.

931
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,406
But polis show
half the world would feel safer

932
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:40,336
with the Autobots completely gone.

933
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,017
Get them out of here!
We don't need them here!

934
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,290
! feel safer when I sleep
with a hand grenade.

935
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:46,852
Doesn't mean I'm always right.

936
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:49,491
Now, agent, here at The Factor
we have obtained documents

937
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,003
that show you were fired...

938
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,262
-Chaz, I'm doing an interview.
-Sorry, Mr. Simmons.

939
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,618
Downsized, Bill.

940
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:57,263
-Budget cuts. Chaz, out.
-Your psych evaluation reports

941
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,904
“severe delusional tendencies.”

942
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,354
This is ambush journalism.

943
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,272
You want the truth
about the alien alliance?

944
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,974
Buy my book! Buy my book,
before it's too late, people!

945
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:08,591
You want a piece of me, Bill?

946
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,042
-You want to get naked? I'm ready!
-Wow.

947
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,830
-Interview is over! You, out of my house.
-You're sounding like a pinhead, agent.

948
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,799
-And I've got a suggestion for you.
-It’s over. Understand?

949
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,165
-Damage control.
-Dutch!

950
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,086
You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons!

951
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,317
You have 23 seconds
to leave the property.

952
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:21,947
I have called the police!

953
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,392
You are peasant people
throwing rocks at a giant!

954
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:25,872
What's up next? What have we got?

955
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,270
Book signing, Midtown, noon.

956
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:29,338
Then we pitch your reality show
to the Discovery Channel.

957
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:32,537
And I have this Witwicky
who keeps calling me.

958
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:33,900
Five times today.

959
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,124
Kid? What does he want?

960
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:36,659
I called you
because the Decepticons are back.

961
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,107
I want to know why,
and I need your help.

962
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:40,332
They're back?

963
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:41,967
Well, that's good for business.

964
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,912
What if I told you
I know a 50-year-old alien secret

965
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,263
that nobody ever told you.

966
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:50,283
Do not tempt my addiction.
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

967
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:53,417
-Dutch, is this line secure?
-No.

968
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,930
Don't take the risk.
I'm rich, why should I?

969
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:01,473
Do not relapse. I won't.

970
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,529
Do not let the demons win.

971
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:05,862
Got it.

972
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:09,357
What kind of secret?

973
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:12,574
Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up.

974
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,846
Future tech. Assassinations.
That kind of stuff.

975
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,099
Apollo.

976
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:19,602
Dutch!

977
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:29,176
Tell Megatron, "Let's tango.”

978
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:33,076
1

979
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,254
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

980
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,984
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

981
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,814
I've wondered what might have been

982
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:53,644
if you had fought the final battle,
instead of me.

983
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,997
Never mourn the past, young warrior.

984
00:56:57,447 --> 00:57:00,907
Thanks to you, our race survives.

985
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:05,557
You were our leader, Sentinel.

986
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,449
It is your right to lead us again.

987
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,886
In a world I do not know,

988
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:15,605
lam no longer your teacher, Optimus.
You are mine.

989
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:22,127
You've got to break this case down.

990
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,216
What we have here
is an astronaut epidemic.

991
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,598
MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident.
Killed. DOA. Car death.

992
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:29,075
It's like these guys can't drive.

993
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:31,096
They can fly into outer space,
but they can't drive a car.

994
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:34,959
-Procured your information, Witwicky.
-Thank you, Bruce.

995
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:37,496
Now,

996
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,240
let me see one right now. One time.

997
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:42,959
-Quick.
-Very.

998
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,572
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

999
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,141
It says NASA launched it in 2009.

1000
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,846
See, forensics show
Wang may have messed with the code,

1001
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,549
preventing it from mapping
the far side of the moon,

1002
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:58,953
which is also the dark side.

1003
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,412
Fucking awesome.

1004
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:03,841
They infiltrate us, intimidate us,
coerce us to do their dirty work.

1005
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,994
And once they're done,

1006
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:08,861
a double-tap to the cerebellum.

1007
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:11,133
So humans are working
for the Decepticons.

1008
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:13,772
I don't think
this is about the Decepticons

1009
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,237
looking for something on the moon.

1010
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:20,383
I think it's about something
they wanted to hide.

1011
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,758
Come to Daddy.

1012
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:25,004
Come on, throw down.

1013
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:28,954
Did you eat a lot of paint chips
when you were a kid?

1014
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,690
He's a freak.

1015
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:32,972
-Like it?
-Get back!

1016
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,370
I'm ticklish!

1017
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:42,632
Sir! We are having a pretty high-level
alien intel confab here

1018
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:46,066
that I don't think you're cleared for,
errand boy.

1019
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:47,460
Yeah, you're right.

1020
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,804
-It's a bitching robot.
-I think it's time to go, Bruce.

1021
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,417
-Thank you so much for this. And...
-Got to go, Bruce.

1022
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:57,895
I'm smoking over here. Downloading
missing Russian cosmonauts.

1023
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,982
Turns out the Soviets canceled
a manned mission to the moon.

1024
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,031
The moon, in 1972.

1025
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,423
And two of their cosmonauts
went into hiding in America.

1026
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,272
And I just found them alive.

1027
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:08,631
You're a genius, Brains.

1028
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,864
That was smooth, Bumblebee.

1029
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,166
Missed it by that much.

1030
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:25,457
Hi.

1031
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,839
Would somebody care to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1032
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:29,978
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

1033
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,537
Who am I? Who is that?
Dutch! Frisk her!

1034
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,240
Certainly.

1035
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:36,254
No. Dutch.

1036
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,690
Don't touch me.

1037
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,284
-I'm not gonna touch her.
-Sam?

1038
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,187
Angel.

1039
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,509
I was working. I'm sorry about this.

1040
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,051
-Great. We're homeless.
-She lives here? Wow.

1041
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,438
You had your chance to frisk her.

1042
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,396
-l have a girlfriend.
-Really? What's her name?

1043
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:53,849
India.

1044
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:57,192
We're supposed to be
at Dylan's party, remember?

1045
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:58,791
I do remember,
but these are my friends.

1046
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,326
They need me.
I have to be here right now.

1047
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,500
So, what, the Autobots and the military,
they can't handle this on their own?

1048
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,964
You know what I liked
about your war stories, Sam?

1049
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,149
It's that they were stories,
they were in the past.

1050
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:09,998
Look, 1 know you're thinking
about your brother, okay?

1051
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,560
And you're thinking about your family.
And it's not that situation.

1052
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:13,859
-No?
-No.

1053
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,481
Why not? Why isn't it, Sam?

1054
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:19,497
You think we'd rather have his medals,
or we'd rather have him?

1055
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:24,351
I hear you. I get it.
Where are you taking my bunny? Stop!

1056
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,031
Just stop for a second.

1057
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:27,583
You think I could sleep last night?

1058
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:29,851
And then it hit me.
No, Sam wants to be in danger.

1059
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,450
-He doesn't know who he is without it.
-I just want to matter.

1060
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,366
You matter to me.

1061
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:42,922
I know you're worried.
I know you're worried.

1062
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,986
But I promise you, I can handle this.

1063
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,412
Can you? You can promise it?

1064
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:48,854
I promise.

1065
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,299
Sam, I don't want to lose you,
and I know where this leads.

1066
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,058
I'm not ready for this.

1067
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,219
Are you coming with me?

1068
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:02,761
I can't.

1069
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:05,294
Okay.

1070
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,097
Hey.

1071
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,875
Here's your foot.

1072
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,116
The warrior's path is a solitary one.

1073
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,292
How the hell did she afford that car?

1074
01:01:34,658 --> 01:01:36,708
-Her boss.
-Rich bastards!

1075
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:39,207
l used to hate them. Now, it's...

1076
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,274
Going to a gig on the hunt
for two Russian cosmonauts.

1077
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,611
Nothing like driving in a Maybach.

1078
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,676
Germans know how to make cars,
let me tell you.

1079
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,270
My Dutchman,
former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire,

1080
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:55,961
tracked them down here.

1081
01:01:57,781 --> 01:02:00,121
So, these cosmonauts
went into hiding. Why?

1082
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:01,754
Bingo. I got a match.

1083
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,660
You're a German Shepherd, Dutch.

1084
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,798
The thing about Russians is,
they never like to talk.

1085
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:10,665
It's gonna take a little
of the "international language.”

1086
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,180
That means "good-bye."

1087
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:33,685
Stay loose.

1088
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,513
Dutch, give me something tough.

1089
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:40,653
Baryshnikov.

1090
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,017
We do speak English.

1091
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,785
Dutch, you suck.

1092
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,761
It's a Cyrillic alphabet.

1093
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,773
It's like all the buttons
you never push on a calculator!

1094
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:52,361
I don't suck.

1095
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:55,326
Agent Seymour Simmons,
Sector Eight, formerly Seven.

1096
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:58,422
We know who you are, cosmonautchiks.

1097
01:02:58,908 --> 01:02:59,778
So what?

1098
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:02,593
You were supposed to travel
to the dark side of the moon,

1099
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:05,389
then it all got shut down.

1100
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,231
The question is, why?

1101
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,328
“Can my child smoke in here?”

1102
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,457
Okay, all right. Okay.

1103
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:28,787
Go ahead, shoot me.

1104
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:32,196
I'm willing to die for my country.
Are you?

1105
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:34,772
Really?

1106
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,444
You are beautiful. Has anyone ever
told you you're beautiful?

1107
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:38,774
She's a beautiful woman.

1108
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,709
Hey!

1109
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,828
Dutch! Back in the cage.

1110
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,901
Dutch! Hold, Dutch, hold!

1111
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:54,903
Control your boy, please.
Control your boy.

1112
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,191
Dutch, stop!

1113
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,901
I'm so sorry. That is the old me.

1114
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:05,796
Okay, let's everybody just calm down!

1115
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:09,131
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns.
Let's relax. World War Il is over.

1116
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,611
You are about to see
one of the biggest Soviet secrets.

1117
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,676
America first to send man to the moon.

1118
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:22,373
But USSR first to send camera.

1119
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:26,223
In 1959, our Luna 3

1120
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:29,540
take picture of the dark,
the shadow side.

1121
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,230
Sees nothing.

1122
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,643
But in 1963, Luna 4 sees...

1123
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,017
-Strange rocks.
-Yeah.

1124
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:42,039
Around the ship. Hundreds of them.

1125
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,005
Yeah, show picture.

1126
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,634
With some drag marks.

1127
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,831
I've seen these.
These aren't rocks, these are pillars.

1128
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,524
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

1129
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,856
We know about them
because the Autobots have five of these.

1130
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:02,832
The Decepticons must have raided
the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there,

1131
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,546
took the pillars, and hid them.

1132
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:06,839
It doesn't make sense.

1133
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,833
The Decepticons have the ship.
They have all those pillars.

1134
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:10,105
Why would they leave Sentinel

1135
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,923
when he's the only one
who can use them?

1136
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,852
Unless...

1137
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:16,114
He's the one thing they still need.

1138
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,310
We've got to meet up with Sentinel,
rendezvous with him and keep him safe.

1139
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,096
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel.
Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

1140
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,419
We're coming to NEST now.

1141
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,611
Mr. Witwicky,
I thought I made it clear to you

1142
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,247
that I did not want you
calling this phone.

1143
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:31,869
Listen, the whole thing has been
a setup since the beginning.

1144
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,168
The Decepticons wanted Optimus
to find Sentinel

1145
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:35,993
because only Optimus could revive him.

1146
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:37,821
But we have the space bridge.

1147
01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:41,008
Mearing, you have five pillars.
I just learned that they have hundreds.

1148
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:42,618
You're doing exactly
what they wanted you to do.

1149
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:43,895
What do you need me to say to you?

1150
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:46,314
The Decepticons are coming
for Sentinel Prime!

1151
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:47,743
We're going to NEST.

1152
01:05:52,816 --> 01:05:54,015
We have an Energon alert.

1153
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,367
Energon readings detected
on the D.C. parkway.

1154
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,327
Currently tracking
three black Suburbans.

1155
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:17,327
1

1156
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:37,104
Bee, you got to get Sentinel
out of here! You got to guard him!

1157
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,416
Oh, mein Gott! I'm fired!

1158
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,303
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

1159
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:12,911
Got you!

1160
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:15,937
Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bee!

1161
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,431
Bee, you've got to move faster!
Faster, Bee! Go!

1162
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,360
Bee!

1163
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:14,586
All right, back to NEST!

1164
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:23,520
Dino, I got him!

1165
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:33,605
Ironhide!

1166
01:08:58,334 --> 01:08:59,884
Is there a problem?

1167
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:03,381
A little Mexican standoff we got here.

1168
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:05,402
Weapons down.

1169
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:08,372
And we'll let you escape
with your dignity.

1170
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:14,132
Drop them.

1171
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:17,422
That's good.

1172
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:23,081
Ironhide, watch out!

1173
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:30,335
Ironhide, catch!

1174
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,408
Behind you!

1175
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:42,714
Decepticon punk!

1176
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:52,494
Class dismissed.

1177
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,998
-Get inside! Let's go!
-Move! Keep moving!

1178
01:10:02,165 --> 01:10:03,475
-Lennox!
-Go, go, go!

1179
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,730
We got Decepticons everywhere.

1180
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,751
I've got my whole team deployed
looking for them. Ironhide!

1181
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,457
Protect Sentinel!
Get him locked up inside!

1182
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:10,856
Consider it done!

1183
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,100
Hey, you've got to guard him,
‘cause he's the key to the whole thing.

1184
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:17,639
Indeed, ! am. What you must realize,
my Autobot brothers,

1185
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,597
is we were never going to win the war.

1186
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:25,327
For the sake of our planet's survival,
a deal had to be made

1187
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:28,183
with Megatron.

1188
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,751
-Get back!
-What have you done?

1189
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,085
I hereby discharge you from duty.

1190
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:49,571
-Bee!
-Get back!

1191
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:07,211
Rally all NEST forces back to the base!
Come on!

1192
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,513
No...

1193
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:18,306
Get a medic down here!

1194
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,594
We don't have enough men!
Do not engage Sentinel!

1195
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,495
Just go to the back gate.

1196
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:30,292
Take cover!

1197
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,110
Watch left! Watch left!

1198
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,238
Let's go! Follow me!

1199
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:48,643
-Director, don't go there!
-Stand down!

1200
01:11:49,005 --> 01:11:49,905
Hey, Sentinel!

1201
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,638
-Director!
-What is going on?

1202
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,054
What do you think you are doing?

1203
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:58,276
lam a Prime!

1204
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,668
I do not take orders from you.

1205
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,250
Director Mearing, come on.

1206
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,069
We can't fight him. Let's go.
We have to go.

1207
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:08,381
Now return what belongs to me!

1208
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,106
Oh, my God!

1209
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,465
-You guys okay?
-ls everybody out?

1210
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:30,875
Everybody, stay calm.
You're gonna be fine.

1211
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:43,500
Yeah, take a look, Optimus!
This is all on you!

1212
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,726
Sentinel hit the vault! Took the pillars.

1213
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:50,850
Come on, let's go.
All right, notify the 101st Airborne!

1214
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:53,424
We need to hunt this thing down!

1215
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:00,936
Carly!

1216
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:05,827
Hot from our little campfire.

1217
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:07,969
S'mores. Isn't that great?

1218
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:09,911
We're really living off the land.

1219
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,753
Mom, Dad, have you guys seen
Carly come home yet?

1220
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:14,989
Excuse me. Can you knock, please?
This is our bedroom.

1221
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:16,344
Why wouldn't she be at home?

1222
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:19,212
We had a fight
and we might have broken up,

1223
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:20,594
or be on a break. I don't really know.

1224
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,763
-What? No.
-Look, I can’t talk about it right now.

1225
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:25,065
I can't go into details, Mom.
I have to find her.

1226
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:28,018
Sit down. We're having
a family meeting. Family meeting!

1227
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:29,534
You may not know this,

1228
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,915
but your father and I
were not always this perfectly happy.

1229
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:33,541
You know, there was a time
- -
In our marriage

1230
01:13:33,843 --> 01:13:35,213
when I thought
this was not gonna work out.

1231
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,265
-Can we please not?
-She's damaging him.

1232
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,857
You break up with
one world-class hottie...

1233
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:41,573
No. Stop. Stop, okay? She dumped me,

1234
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,584
I moved on to something better.
That's it. I'm a happier person.

1235
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:44,803
The second beautiful girl,
and you lose her.

1236
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:45,874
Why don't you help me?

1237
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,165
-They had an argument.
-One fight.

1238
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:51,017
You're not gonna get a third one,
I mean, unless you have like a big...

1239
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:52,544
What the... Ma!

1240
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,908
Maybe you just don't know
what you're doing.

1241
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:57,111
-I don't want to talk about this anymore.
-You need the book.

1242
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,250
-Tell him about the book.
-You're always wrong. Get used to it.

1243
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,155
Okay. You've gotta read this.
She Comes First.

1244
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:03,254
-There's some killer shit in here.
-No. No.

1245
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,749
-That's it, I'm going.
-No! No!

1246
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,425
Sit down, sit down! Back me up!

1247
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,248
-Happy wife, happy life.
-Heck yeah.

1248
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:14,637
Unhappy wife, stone-cold misery
for the rest of your...

1249
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,234
-Stop.
-It's true.

1250
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,402
All I'm saying is, do you love this girl?

1251
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,058
-She's the one.
-Then you gotta go get her.

1252
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,430
I mean, your dad and I,
when we had troubles,

1253
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,136
he moved heaven and earth to find me.

1254
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:28,815
Say what you said. Say it.

1255
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:31,485
“I will follow you to the end of time.”

1256
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:33,300
Does that suck or what?

1257
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,179
-It's like a bad sci-fi film.
-No. It is so sweet.

1258
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:38,552
I want you to get out of the city. You get
as far away from here as you can.

1259
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:40,094
You understand?

1260
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:41,429
I love you.

1261
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:04,761
My master! Such a brilliant scheme!

1262
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:08,901
So when Sentinel left Cybertron,
it was to defect?

1263
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:12,779
He was meant to rendezvous
with me here on Earth

1264
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,272
before fate waylaid us both.

1265
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:18,098
The only way to revive him,

1266
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:21,007
we needed Prime and his Matrix.

1267
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,317
Excellent strategy.

1268
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,375
Mine, mine!

1269
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,205
So he is now your partner, master?

1270
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:41,824
He is my greatest triumph.

1271
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,451
So impressive.

1272
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,906
Commencing transport.

1273
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,775
Stop! No! No, Sentinel!

1274
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:50,474
Forgive me.

1275
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,387
Here we are.

1276
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:58,332
Fight us now.

1277
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:38,513
Contact!

1278
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,491
Watch out! Move it! Move it!

1279
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:45,843
Autobots, retreat!

1280
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,619
Why, Sentinel, why?

1281
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:17,611
For Cybertron! For our home!

1282
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,977
What war destroyed, we can rebuild!
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

1283
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:28,129
No, it's not the only way. This is our
home! We must defend the humans!

1284
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:30,928
So lost you are, Optimus.

1285
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:33,097
On Cybertron, we were gods.

1286
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,502
And here, they call us machines.

1287
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:40,272
Let the humans serve us, or perish.

1288
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,429
You're lucky I didn't kill you.
In time you'll see.

1289
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:50,931
It's not over.

1290
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:57,503
Now, if l were him, I wouldn't let you
out of my sight for one second.

1291
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:01,999
It's funny. I was just thinking
on the way over here,

1292
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,094
I could really use some advice
from Dylan, and there he is.

1293
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,769
-Can I speak to you, Carly?
-Welcome. Please, sit down.

1294
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,011
Have a drink.

1295
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:10,163
You know what, I don't need a drink.
Or a car, or a job.

1296
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:11,853
I just need to speak
to my girlfriend alone.

1297
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,234
Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

1298
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:16,708
Excuse me.

1299
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:21,652
-What's going on?
-I'll tell you outside.

1300
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:24,028
I really think I can help you, Sam.

1301
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,586
l remember a talk I had
with my dad once about tough choices.

1302
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,586
Yeah, now's not the time.
We'll set something up, though.

1303
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:30,868
Of course, it was way back,
when my dad's firm was in charge

1304
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,613
of budget review
and accounting for NASA.

1305
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:36,467
You see,
the thing that he taught me was,

1306
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:39,529
when it's not your war,
you join the side that's going to win.

1307
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:42,767
Move.

1308
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,248
Too direct? Or is it just me?

1309
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:45,403
Certainly not you, sir.

1310
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:49,378
1

1311
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:00,485
You're mine!

1312
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:02,307
No!

1313
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,158
-Get help!
-Sam, I can't get out!

1314
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:08,897
-Someone get help!
-Good night!

1315
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:09,964
Good night, Mr. Dylan.

1316
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,012
Get me out of here!

1317
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,604
Help! Get help!

1318
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,600
-He's young. He will learn. Good night.
-Get me out!

1319
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:22,143
It was a fun night.

1320
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:26,578
You really think you're the first man ever
asked to join the noble alien cause?

1321
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:28,339
Who are you?

1322
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:31,291
Do you know why we've not been back
to the moon since 1972?

1323
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,389
Because these two,

1324
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:36,366
they came to my dad and they told him
to do some creative accounting.

1325
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,092
Make it way too expensive
to ever go back. So, he and the others

1326
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,531
shut down the American
and Russian space programs.

1327
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:43,644
And they've been our clients ever since.

1328
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:46,323
-You helped them kill people?
-You think they'd give you a choice?

1329
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:48,214
Besides, it's not
like 1 personally participated.

1330
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:50,324
lam a liaison. I liaise.

1331
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:55,333
It's hostile takeover time, Sam.

1332
01:19:58,127 --> 01:19:59,147
Sam!

1333
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:04,111
-Sam!
-Let her go!

1334
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,473
Sam!

1335
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:11,438
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.

1336
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:13,574
You're the one spy
I've never been able to provide

1337
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,172
as someone close to the Autobots.

1338
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:20,754
Sam! Don't do what he wants!

1339
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,519
Yes, he will.

1340
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:23,721
They all do.

1341
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,144
They will slaughter her,
you understand me?

1342
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,559
In the time it takes you to blink,
they'll do it to her and they'll do it to me.

1343
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:33,647
So you show a little respect

1344
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,896
when someone offers you a job!

1345
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:38,649
Wrist.

1346
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:40,875
You are to track down Optimus Prime,

1347
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:42,783
because you're the one human
he trusts,

1348
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,482
and you will ask one question.

1349
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:48,286
How does he intend to fight back?
Strategies, tactics, everything!

1350
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,639
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it?
It's very high-tech.

1351
01:20:57,086 --> 01:20:59,276
It lets us see what you see,
hear what you hear

1352
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:00,862
and it taps your nervous system.

1353
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:03,176
So, if you so much as try and signal...

1354
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,201
I don't know what to tell you, Sam.

1355
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,159
Relationships have consequences.
lam here because of my father.

1356
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:11,836
She is here because of you.

1357
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,623
Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!

1358
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:18,623
Soundwave, would you please?

1359
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,762
Sam, do your job.

1360
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:27,587
She'll be safe. I give you my word.

1361
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:32,936
I'll kill you. You have my word.

1362
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:38,878
Combatant Commands
are now at DEFCON 1.

1363
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:41,765
Approximately 200 Decepticons
are now in hiding.

1364
01:21:42,598 --> 01:21:43,888
Energon detectors have been triggered

1365
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:46,039
as far away
as South America and China.

1366
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,105
The U.N. just received
an encrypted audio file.

1367
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,941
They say it's from the leader
of the Autobots.

1368
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:53,748
Defenders of Earth.

1369
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,386
We have come
for your natural resources

1370
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:58,625
to rebuild our damaged planet.

1371
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,695
When we have transported all we need,

1372
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,714
we will leave your world in peace.

1373
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,860
For such peace to exist,

1374
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:11,322
you must immediately exile
the Autobot rebels you have harbored.

1375
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:14,118
Nonnegotiable.

1376
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,120
Renounce the rebels.

1377
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:18,949
We await your reply.

1378
01:22:20,002 --> 01:22:21,342
We'll debrief you in transit.

1379
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,900
Yeah, I really don't see
how I can be of any help.

1380
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:24,075
I mean, you guys seem pretty busy.

1381
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:25,889
We could just do this another time,
I think.

1382
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:31,518
I have underestimated you at every turn.

1383
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:32,997
What?

1384
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:34,832
You warned us
that they were using humans.

1385
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:36,614
And you knew that Sentinel was the key.

1386
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:37,942
Director!

1387
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:41,471
Who am I? Hey, you're the expert.
I'm just a walking security risk.

1388
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,056
Are you all right?

1389
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:52,133
Yes.

1390
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,474
-No, you're not. You're sweating.
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

1391
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:55,830
I'm sweating because I'm nervous.

1392
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:57,884
I'm nervous because you got me
in here with this information.

1393
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,353
Okay, I'm a Twitter junkie.
I blog everything.

1394
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,130
-l can't keep a secret to save my life.
-You wouldn't dare.

1395
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,847
-That's the truth. I'm telling you.
-Director, the Pentagon's calling in 15.

1396
01:23:06,048 --> 01:23:07,338
-What are you doing?
-Nothing. What are you doing?

1397
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:10,107
Get away from me.

1398
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,845
It’s been a remarkable series of events
today at the Capitol.

1399
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,072
Just moments ago,
legislation was passed

1400
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:16,687
to exile the Autobots

1401
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,132
from American shores.

1402
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:21,267
The U.S. military alliance with them
is officially over.

1403
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:23,286
In the words
of the House Majority Leader,

1404
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:25,121
the sponsor of today’s resolution,

1405
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:26,427
-"We cannot in good conscience...”
-Okay.

1406
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,162
What? They can't do this.

1407
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:31,054
-You gotta tell them. They can't do that.
-Okay. It's official. It's a go, people.

1408
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,500
These are our allies. The Autobots
fought for us. They fought with us.

1409
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:34,779
And where are we now?

1410
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,333
Facing an enemy invasion

1411
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,958
with an enemy that has the means
to deploy countless more.

1412
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:44,145
If there is any more you know,

1413
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:46,563
anything at all
about the enemy's intentions,

1414
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:49,373
now is the time to tell.

1415
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,479
Autobots have no way
of leaving this planet.

1416
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:54,525
And that is where you're wrong.

1417
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,531
Its name is the Xanthium.

1418
01:23:58,433 --> 01:23:59,663
It brought the second wave of Autobots

1419
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:02,077
and it’s been under NASA's care
and study ever since.

1420
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:04,765
We linked it
with a decommissioned shuttle

1421
01:24:05,107 --> 01:24:07,417
to maintain military control
until they're gone.

1422
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:11,446
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque
on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not 19!

1423
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,130
You're gonna risk the lives
of all me mates! I'll ball you!

1424
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:17,690
These guys are the Wreckers.
They take care of the Xanthium.

1425
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:19,903
We don't let them off the base much,
‘cause they're assholes.

1426
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:22,039
You gotta pull that, ya nancy wanker!

1427
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:23,654
It's time to kill him!

1428
01:24:23,959 --> 01:24:25,599
I'm just trying to help, you know.
Just doing my job.

1429
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:28,101
Just calm down. Leave him alone.
This is a human being.

1430
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,309
-Epps!
-You are ridiculous!

1431
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:31,749
-ls that you?
-What up, man?

1432
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:33,554
What are you doing here?

1433
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,212
I retired from the Air Force.

1434
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,114
Can you let my hand go?

1435
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,650
What the hell was that?

1436
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:41,925
Now I just consult
to run interference for them.

1437
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:43,391
Well, you're not helping!

1438
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,519
No more combat and aliens shooting
at my ass. I got a dream job.

1439
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,689
Time to get off this planet.

1440
01:24:49,051 --> 01:24:51,951
Kicking the Autobots out.
Can you believe this is happening?

1441
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:55,628
-Where do you think it's taking them?
-Any planet but here.

1442
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:01,241
I wanna talk
to whoever's in charge here!

1443
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:05,807
Well, well, well. Charlotte Mearing.

1444
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:08,748
Agent Simmons.
Former Agent Simmons.

1445
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:11,131
So I see you survived Washington.

1446
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:14,940
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.
I survive. I will survive.

1447
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:19,374
They're bringing everybody in, kid.
Putting all the intel on the table.

1448
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:24,575
And if you think deporting nine Autobots
is gonna solve a damn thing...

1449
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,370
It's out of my hands.

1450
01:25:27,389 --> 01:25:28,849
Moving up in the world?

1451
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,812
Your booty looks excellent.

1452
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:37,861
If you ever say a word to anyone

1453
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:39,456
about what happened
that night in Quantico,

1454
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:41,385
I'll cut your heart out.

1455
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:43,507
You already did.

1456
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:47,049
Sammy, listen to me.
Don't let them exile us.

1457
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:49,882
-Don't let them take us, Sam.
-It's a Decepticon trap.

1458
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,675
Check the nitrogen levels.
We're booking out of here.

1459
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:33,604
Optimus?

1460
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:37,855
What your leaders say is true.
This was all my fault.

1461
01:26:38,994 --> 01:26:42,594
I told them whom to trust.
Il was so wrong.

1462
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,415
That doesn't make it your fault.
It just makes you human for a change.

1463
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:47,443
Remember this.

1464
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,269
You may lose your faith in us,

1465
01:26:51,273 --> 01:26:53,853
but never in yourselves.

1466
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:02,893
I need to know
how you're gonna fight back.

1467
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,136
I know this is strategy,
I know you're coming back

1468
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:09,229
with reinforcements, something.
I know there's a plan.

1469
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:15,818
You can tell me.
No other human will ever know.

1470
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,069
There is no plan.

1471
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,079
If we just do what they want,
how are we gonna live with ourselves?

1472
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,169
You are my friend, Sam.

1473
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:29,740
You always will be.

1474
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:32,642
But your leaders have spoken.

1475
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:36,013
From here,

1476
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:39,135
the fight will be your own.

1477
01:27:53,135 --> 01:27:54,125
Make it short.

1478
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,360
We're loading up.

1479
01:27:57,472 --> 01:28:00,692
All right, hustle up!
We're launching at dawn.

1480
01:28:04,513 --> 01:28:07,733
We're gonna do whatever we can.
Make it like it was.

1481
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,126
You will always be my friend, Sam.

1482
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,730
I gotta be going on.

1483
01:28:28,737 --> 01:28:30,317
Years from now, they're gonna ask us,

1484
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,750
"Where were you
when they took over the planet?”

1485
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,451
We're gonna say,

1486
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:40,941
"We just stood by and watched.”

1487
01:28:55,197 --> 01:28:57,247
You should really look at this
as a partnership.

1488
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,900
You have to stand
on the side of progress

1489
01:29:00,235 --> 01:29:01,464
if you wanna be a part of history.

1490
01:29:14,783 --> 01:29:17,123
Seven, six, five,

1491
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:20,026
four, three, two,

1492
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:22,179
one, zero.

1493
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:32,109
Go ahead and throttle up.

1494
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,495
You wanted an answer. You got one.

1495
01:29:52,187 --> 01:29:54,907
! always get what ! want, Sam.
We just needed to be sure.

1496
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:56,956
Sure of what?

1497
01:29:57,259 --> 01:29:58,279
That they would go without a fight.

1498
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:10,690
-Say again.
-Tracking an incoming object.

1499
01:31:03,692 --> 01:31:04,862
We all work for the Decepticons now.

1500
01:31:10,999 --> 01:31:12,869
I need your help to track a phone call.
There's a man on this phone.

1501
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:14,998
He's the head of their human operations
and he has Carly hostage.

1502
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:16,950
I want you to sit down. Don't move.

1503
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:20,434
Follow me.

1504
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:22,866
I'm watching him drive up right now.

1505
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:28,193
The call was placed en route.

1506
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:30,450
I'm hacking into
the phone's camera now.

1507
01:31:31,186 --> 01:31:32,936
There, that's it.
That's a live stream from the camera.

1508
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,311
Someplace... Hold on.
I can triangulate this.

1509
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:38,731
Okay, it's Chicago cell sites.
There, I've got it.

1510
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:41,474
Trump Tower, Chicago.
Lower penthouse.

1511
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,107
We're on.

1512
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,157
-I'm going.
-You sure?

1513
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,842
She's done nothing but try to help me,
and I can be there in 15 hours.

1514
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:52,235
You're not going alone.

1515
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:57,186
I still got my NEST friends out there.

1516
01:31:57,612 --> 01:31:59,252
I'll round them up,
we'll find your girlfriend,

1517
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:00,723
we're gonna bring this guy in.

1518
01:32:01,216 --> 01:32:02,386
Why are you helping me?

1519
01:32:03,284 --> 01:32:05,563
‘Cause that asshole
killed my friends, too.

1520
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:24,973
They said they were here for
our resources, to rebuild their planet.

1521
01:32:25,507 --> 01:32:28,317
Yes, but really
one resource in particular.

1522
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,543
One unique to our planet.

1523
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:33,626
Us?

1524
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:37,113
You're very smart.

1525
01:32:37,452 --> 01:32:39,352
You see, they can't rebuild
without a slave labor force.

1526
01:32:40,255 --> 01:32:43,065
How many rocks up there in
the universe offer six billion workers?

1527
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:46,341
What are you talking about?
We can't transport people.

1528
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:49,899
They're not shipping people.
They're shipping their planet here.

1529
01:32:56,271 --> 01:32:57,471
Oh, my God.

1530
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,139
What's Sentinel doing here?

1531
01:33:00,475 --> 01:33:03,725
Watch. They're spreading hundreds of
pillars around the globe right now.

1532
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:06,501
In just a few hours,
they're gonna launch them into orbit

1533
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:09,760
and bring Cybertron
into our atmosphere.

1534
01:33:10,285 --> 01:33:12,125
The red one there controls the rest.

1535
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,250
He triggers that,
it starts the whole thing.

1536
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:17,992
Be gone, insect operative.
Your work is done.

1537
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:20,633
Your Excellency. He's such a dick.

1538
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:28,376
-You want this to happen?
-Il want to survive. I want 40 more years.

1539
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:31,150
You think I asked for this?
l inherited a client.

1540
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,856
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here
and we're all their slaves,

1541
01:33:34,309 --> 01:33:35,709
I guess they'll still need a human leader.

1542
01:33:36,044 --> 01:33:38,034
Don't jinx me.
You want to survive, you listen to me.

1543
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:59,623
It is time for the slaves of Earth
to recognize their masters.

1544
01:34:00,335 --> 01:34:01,705
Seal off the city.

1545
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:59,424
Get the dogs outta here now!
Get them in the back!

1546
01:35:01,229 --> 01:35:03,099
I guess they didn't tell you about
this part, did they?

1547
01:35:03,498 --> 01:35:05,487
You think I'm at every meeting?

1548
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,830
Look, I'm safe.

1549
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:09,376
They said I was safe.

1550
01:35:21,316 --> 01:35:22,166
Let's roll!

1551
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:30,350
We had a signal earlier.

1552
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:32,302
It's not working.

1553
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:40,879
This is a national emergency broadcast.

1554
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:49,134
Chicago has suffered a massive attack.

1555
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:01,197
Wrong way!

1556
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:04,624
Get out of here! Go back!

1557
01:36:15,837 --> 01:36:18,117
There is a ring of alien ships
around Chicago.

1558
01:36:18,573 --> 01:36:21,673
Our high-range bombers
were just knocked out of the sky.

1559
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:25,673
They can't get through
enemy air defenses over the city.

1560
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:27,541
Our satellites have been jammed.

1561
01:36:27,849 --> 01:36:29,719
We have no way to monitor
the enemy's movement.

1562
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:32,608
Our old NEST teams are on stand-down
holding at Grissom Air Force Base.

1563
01:36:33,087 --> 01:36:34,457
We're about 10 minutes from
the battle zone.

1564
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:37,092
We have Special Forces
trying to gain access to the city,

1565
01:36:37,659 --> 01:36:39,148
and infantry is staging at the perimeter.

1566
01:36:39,494 --> 01:36:41,804
Excuse me, excuse me,
it just doesn't make sense!

1567
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:44,403
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

1568
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:46,382
They keep shooting down our drones.

1569
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:47,844
They want us blind.

1570
01:36:48,436 --> 01:36:50,835
But we do have
a couple of mini-drones we’re gonna try.

1571
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,266
Well, whoever's manning
these UAV drones,

1572
01:36:53,675 --> 01:36:55,375
can we try to redirect them
toward Trump Tower?

1573
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:57,763
The kid, Witwickety,
was on his way to Chicago.

1574
01:36:58,413 --> 01:37:01,753
Said some point-man human op is there
for the Decepticons!

1575
01:37:03,051 --> 01:37:04,221
Listen, if I know anything, I know this,

1576
01:37:04,519 --> 01:37:07,209
that kid is an alien-bad-news magnet.

1577
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:50,070
My God.

1578
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:53,545
We came here to find her
in the middle of all that?

1579
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:56,081
Are we really going out there, Epps?

1580
01:37:56,504 --> 01:37:57,614
I'm not going in there.

1581
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:00,016
No one's going in.

1582
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:07,974
lam.

1583
01:38:09,684 --> 01:38:10,884
With or without you, I'll find her.

1584
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,900
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.
Is that what you want?

1585
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:16,763
Is that what you want?

1586
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:19,758
You came all the way out here
to get yourself killed? Huh?

1587
01:38:20,228 --> 01:38:21,098
Listen to what I'm saying.

1588
01:38:21,362 --> 01:38:22,852
She's here because of me.
Do you understand?

1589
01:38:23,197 --> 01:38:26,447
Listen, if you go in this building,
that's if she’s even still alive,

1590
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:28,204
there's no way
you're gonna be able to reach her!

1591
01:38:28,503 --> 01:38:30,053
What do you suggest I do?

1592
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:32,581
It's over.

1593
01:38:34,876 --> 01:38:36,276
I'm sorry, but it's over.

1594
01:38:37,178 --> 01:38:38,077
No.

1595
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:39,919
Incoming!

1596
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:29,535
We will kill them all.

1597
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:36,375
Wreckers, kill him!

1598
01:39:38,873 --> 01:39:40,183
This is going to hurt!

1599
01:39:40,775 --> 01:39:42,295
A lot!

1600
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:50,445
Your leaders will now understand.

1601
01:39:50,918 --> 01:39:53,728
Decepticons will never leave
your planet alone.

1602
01:39:54,956 --> 01:39:57,676
And we needed them to believe
we had gone.

1603
01:39:58,459 --> 01:40:01,209
For today, in the name of freedom,

1604
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:03,719
we take the battle to them!

1605
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:28,901
-I saw your ship blow up!
-The ship?

1606
01:40:29,357 --> 01:40:33,277
We were never in the ship!
We designed the damn thing, didn't we?

1607
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:36,571
We were hidden
in the first booster rocket to separate.

1608
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:40,224
Splashed down back in the Atlantic,
just as planned.

1609
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:42,171
We ain't going nowhere.

1610
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:45,027
Yeah, no one's exiling us.

1611
01:40:47,475 --> 01:40:50,985
The Autobots are staying right here.
We're gonna help you win this war.

1612
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:54,362
They're surrounding the city
to make a fortress

1613
01:40:54,849 --> 01:40:57,659
so that no one can see
what they're up to inside.

1614
01:40:58,185 --> 01:41:01,225
Our only chance
is the element of surprise.

1615
01:41:01,822 --> 01:41:03,222
I think I know where to look!

1616
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:07,923
Mini-drone is on approach
to Trump Tower.

1617
01:41:11,766 --> 01:41:13,606
You're telling me
Sam's headed into that?

1618
01:41:14,635 --> 01:41:15,505
Poor kid.

1619
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:18,884
Probably never got close.

1620
01:41:19,707 --> 01:41:20,847
So, you can fly this thing, right?

1621
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:24,509
What is that... What is that?
What is that? So-so?

1622
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:27,925
So you so-so can fly this.
That feels terrible.

1623
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:31,661
We're right behind you.

1624
01:41:38,726 --> 01:41:39,835
All right, we're going in!

1625
01:42:05,386 --> 01:42:07,556
The city is secure.

1626
01:42:07,989 --> 01:42:10,568
The humans cannot stop us.

1627
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:13,048
As the afternoon falls,

1628
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:16,331
the rest of the pillars
will reach their launch position.

1629
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:21,023
This is the victory I promised you
so many years ago,

1630
01:42:21,869 --> 01:42:26,058
where we rebuild Cybertron together!

1631
01:42:27,074 --> 01:42:29,504
I have deigned to work with you

1632
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:33,081
that our planet may survive!

1633
01:42:33,514 --> 01:42:36,384
I will never work for you!

1634
01:42:37,184 --> 01:42:39,964
You would be wise
to remember the difference.

1635
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:42,810
1

1636
01:43:01,876 --> 01:43:04,456
I'm so sick of this.
I'm just sick of waiting.

1637
01:43:08,282 --> 01:43:09,212
Where is she?

1638
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:10,820
Where is she?

1639
01:43:12,787 --> 01:43:13,717
You've got some balls.

1640
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:27,180
No, Sam!

1641
01:43:29,336 --> 01:43:32,676
No! No, no!

1642
01:43:37,111 --> 01:43:38,131
Carly!

1643
01:43:39,847 --> 01:43:40,697
Carly!

1644
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:44,691
Jump!

1645
01:44:18,886 --> 01:44:20,586
Bee, fire!

1646
01:44:21,222 --> 01:44:22,362
Bee!

1647
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,070
Autobots! They're alive!

1648
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:51,930
Decepticons, defend the pillar!

1649
01:44:53,854 --> 01:44:57,604
Raise the bridges! Find them!

1650
01:45:13,174 --> 01:45:14,044
Sam.

1651
01:45:16,177 --> 01:45:17,137
You found me.

1652
01:45:17,411 --> 01:45:18,521
I'd follow you anywhere.

1653
01:45:31,425 --> 01:45:33,505
Form a perimeter! Let's go, let's go!

1654
01:45:33,961 --> 01:45:35,071
Well, you're crazy.

1655
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:38,314
What is that? Is that us?

1656
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:42,056
This thing's a military UAV.
Stone, check and see if it's still working.

1657
01:45:42,703 --> 01:45:43,813
Yeah, it's still got power.

1658
01:45:44,104 --> 01:45:45,244
Flight Control, do you copy?

1659
01:45:45,873 --> 01:45:47,833
Can... Can you rotate?
Can you do something?

1660
01:45:48,576 --> 01:45:49,686
I think we got something.

1661
01:45:49,977 --> 01:45:51,467
Epps! We got Epps!

1662
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,300
Come on, work! Work!

1663
01:45:54,648 --> 01:45:55,728
All right, turn the volume up on that!

1664
01:45:56,217 --> 01:45:57,177
The kid!

1665
01:45:57,451 --> 01:45:59,261
Can you rotate or something?

1666
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:03,118
Yes, yes! Okay, okay, okay.
They can see us.

1667
01:46:03,591 --> 01:46:05,081
Chicago is ground zero,
do you understand?

1668
01:46:05,426 --> 01:46:07,476
-Can you hear us? You understand?
-Witwicky.

1669
01:46:07,895 --> 01:46:09,065
Please listen. Sentinel Prime is here

1670
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:10,623
and he has the pillars
to his space bridge.

1671
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:12,191
They're on top of a building
on Chicago River.

1672
01:46:12,499 --> 01:46:13,699
It's owned by
Hotchkiss Gould Investments.

1673
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:16,401
Now, the pillar that controls everything
is in the southeast cupola.

1674
01:46:17,071 --> 01:46:18,971
You've got to destroy the pillar.
You have to shoot down the pillar

1675
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,272
or they're going to transport
Cybertron here, do you understand?

1676
01:46:21,909 --> 01:46:23,018
-Do you understand?
-What?

1677
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:26,500
Give me a GPS on the building
and on that drone! Let's go!

1678
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:28,751
Mensurate those coordinates.
Shorten the kill chain.

1679
01:46:29,316 --> 01:46:30,656
Guys on the tarmac, five minutes.

1680
01:46:30,985 --> 01:46:31,835
The southeast cupola.

1681
01:46:32,086 --> 01:46:33,166
All right!

1682
01:46:34,421 --> 01:46:36,591
We need to move
before the fighters spot us.

1683
01:46:37,024 --> 01:46:38,924
Wait here until we scout a route ahead.

1684
01:46:39,593 --> 01:46:41,143
-Let's roll.
-Ratchet, cover high.

1685
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:44,940
Hey, think we could use that rocket
to shoot down the pillar?

1686
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:47,679
We're eight blocks away.
We got to get closer to take a shot.

1687
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:50,844
Not closer. Higher.
We need a clear line of sight.

1688
01:46:51,438 --> 01:46:54,018
And it's across the river. Gonna have
a hell of a time trying to sneak up.

1689
01:46:54,842 --> 01:46:55,982
We only got one shot.

1690
01:46:57,278 --> 01:46:58,678
One shot's all we need.

1691
01:46:59,847 --> 01:47:02,017
We got to be able to see
around that building from the ground.

1692
01:47:02,449 --> 01:47:04,909
Get NSA to send service specs for
any cameras in that area.

1693
01:47:05,386 --> 01:47:06,236
Maybe some are working.

1694
01:47:06,854 --> 01:47:09,254
Traffic lights. ATMs. Anything.

1695
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:12,481
Listen up. You want to hit back?

1696
01:47:13,294 --> 01:47:16,664
We're gonna have to wingsuit in.
It's the only way to get close.

1697
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:20,451
I can't promise anyone a ride home,
but if you're with me,

1698
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:22,998
the world needs you now.

1699
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:25,958
I'll find my own ride home, sir.

1700
01:47:29,143 --> 01:47:30,073
Who else?

1701
01:47:33,547 --> 01:47:34,477
General Morshower,

1702
01:47:34,748 --> 01:47:36,918
requesting diversionary action
to the south of the city.

1703
01:47:37,351 --> 01:47:39,311
We're coming north and low.
You guys drive them to the east.

1704
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,570
Autobot victory! Autobot victory!

1705
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:33,798
That is one scary-ass Decepticon!

1706
01:48:34,274 --> 01:48:37,734
They got my trailer.
I need that flight tech.

1707
01:48:38,746 --> 01:48:42,316
Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once.
Wreckers,

1708
01:48:43,617 --> 01:48:45,047
we need a diversion.

1709
01:48:45,386 --> 01:48:47,666
-Let's get some!
-You got that right.

1710
01:48:48,455 --> 01:48:50,945
Listen, we're gonna circle around
to that glass building.

1711
01:48:51,425 --> 01:48:53,065
And we'll get high enough
to make the rocket shot

1712
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:54,769
while you guys draw his fire.

1713
01:48:55,062 --> 01:48:56,352
-Let's move!
-Wait a minute!

1714
01:48:56,663 --> 01:48:59,562
I'm not letting you go out there
without my urban combat prototypes.

1715
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,500
-We got to go, Que!
-Come on.

1716
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:03,568
They're great inventions for kicking ass!

1717
01:49:03,937 --> 01:49:04,807
What are these?

1718
01:49:05,072 --> 01:49:08,352
Those are boom-sticks.
Armed in 30 seconds.

1719
01:49:08,942 --> 01:49:10,552
Grapple gloves, for climbing.

1720
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:12,835
Go, go! Move your ass! Move, move!

1721
01:49:13,147 --> 01:49:15,337
Move, move! Go, go, go!

1722
01:49:20,988 --> 01:49:22,508
-Move, move!
-Let's go!

1723
01:49:34,735 --> 01:49:35,995
Let's go! Run!

1724
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:44,777
-Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
-No, no, no!

1725
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:47,249
-Where you going?
-Stop, stop, stop! Don't leave!

1726
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:50,991
You never leave a ‘bot behind!
Shockwave's coming!

1727
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:57,186
Go for the stairs!

1728
01:49:57,458 --> 01:49:58,827
Epps, this way!

1729
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:02,017
Breaking right.

1730
01:50:02,362 --> 01:50:03,472
Bead. Rolling in.

1731
01:50:08,836 --> 01:50:09,766
We got another one coming around.

1732
01:50:10,037 --> 01:50:11,817
Coming around on the left side,
coming around on the right side.

1733
01:50:12,206 --> 01:50:14,226
We're going to use Willis Tower
for cover!

1734
01:50:14,641 --> 01:50:16,250
Once we make altitude, we jump!

1735
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:19,130
-A lot of airplanes out here!
-Contact off the nose.

1736
01:50:21,882 --> 01:50:23,081
Mayday! I don’t think
he’s gonna make it.

1737
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:25,603
-Mayday, mayday! Six-one going down.
-Heads up! Heads up!

1738
01:50:30,557 --> 01:50:31,757
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1739
01:50:41,235 --> 01:50:43,315
-Tally on the left.
-Got him.

1740
01:50:43,737 --> 01:50:45,407
Time on target: 20 seconds.

1741
01:50:45,772 --> 01:50:47,612
Here we go! Here we go!

1742
01:50:48,242 --> 01:50:49,442
Keep it tight!

1743
01:50:49,743 --> 01:50:50,643
Coming around.

1744
01:50:51,078 --> 01:50:52,778
All right, focus, focus, focus.

1745
01:50:58,085 --> 01:50:59,575
Threat above tower, six o'clock!

1746
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,000
Locusts!

1747
01:51:01,288 --> 01:51:02,687
Look out! Breaking right! Breaking right!

1748
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:07,909
-Watch out, watch out!
-Holy shit!

1749
01:51:10,364 --> 01:51:11,593
Look out, look out, look out!

1750
01:51:11,899 --> 01:51:12,859
Get them out, get them out,
get them out!

1751
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:15,032
-Everybody out, out, out!
-Jump, jump, jump!

1752
01:51:21,975 --> 01:51:23,435
Get out, get out!

1753
01:51:23,777 --> 01:51:24,627
I'm stuck!

1754
01:51:25,345 --> 01:51:26,605
Now. Get them out now!
Get them out now!

1755
01:51:27,748 --> 01:51:29,008
Help!

1756
01:51:49,102 --> 01:51:51,062
Get separation.
Track away, track away!

1757
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:51,558
1

1758
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,168
Hard left! Hard left!

1759
01:52:14,695 --> 01:52:16,365
Six hundred feet.

1760
01:52:31,712 --> 01:52:33,442
Check your six! Check your six!

1761
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:36,750
He's on our ass! Watch out, watch out!

1762
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:42,171
Sharp right!

1763
01:52:47,995 --> 01:52:48,925
Building dead ahead!

1764
01:52:49,429 --> 01:52:50,539
Thread the needle!

1765
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,740
Pull, pull!

1766
01:53:05,012 --> 01:53:06,712
-Come on, we're high enough!
-This is a mother getting up here!

1767
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,600
-Get your fat ass over here!
-I'm coming.

1768
01:53:14,921 --> 01:53:16,321
Set up the rocket!

1769
01:53:17,524 --> 01:53:19,194
-They're coming.
-Weapons status?

1770
01:53:19,593 --> 01:53:21,373
29 Bot-busters, 20 piercing D-Bot.

1771
01:53:24,031 --> 01:53:26,811
There, the building with the dome.

1772
01:53:27,434 --> 01:53:30,454
For our brothers,
let's make this trip worth it.

1773
01:53:34,074 --> 01:53:34,924
Oh, God.

1774
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:39,238
The building!

1775
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:45,100
They're shooting at the building!

1776
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:49,554
This is not a good idea.

1777
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:51,193
-What?
-This is not a good idea.

1778
01:53:51,525 --> 01:53:52,785
-This building is unstable.
-Listen, stop for a second.

1779
01:53:53,093 --> 01:53:54,822
If we don't do what we came to do,
it doesn't matter, we all die.

1780
01:53:55,262 --> 01:53:56,962
Right? That's your target.
Come on, man!

1781
01:53:57,397 --> 01:53:58,887
I don't even care
if the building collapses.

1782
01:53:59,232 --> 01:54:00,492
I'm having a heart attack anyway.

1783
01:54:02,336 --> 01:54:03,736
The building is going over!

1784
01:54:04,071 --> 01:54:05,151
-Hang on!
-Take cover!

1785
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:11,452
Keep your hands up!

1786
01:54:23,423 --> 01:54:24,383
It's okay! It stopped!

1787
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:26,285
Guys, look!

1788
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:28,873
-Incoming, incoming!
-Everybody hide!

1789
01:54:57,391 --> 01:54:59,351
Don't move.

1790
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:05,888
Go, go.

1791
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:13,990
Run!

1792
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:15,531
Cover fire!

1793
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:21,041
Shoot the glass! Jump out the window!

1794
01:55:27,988 --> 01:55:28,858
Jump!

1795
01:55:44,971 --> 01:55:47,991
We're gonna die!

1796
01:55:50,043 --> 01:55:51,623
Sam, I can't stop!

1797
01:55:52,312 --> 01:55:53,922
Shoot the glass!

1798
01:56:19,873 --> 01:56:20,742
Sam!

1799
01:56:46,433 --> 01:56:48,423
Is everybody okay?

1800
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:49,705
You okay?

1801
01:56:49,970 --> 01:56:51,080
What the hell was that?

1802
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:54,091
Driller-bot is thirsty.

1803
01:56:57,911 --> 01:56:59,611
-This evil thing's looking at me!
-What?

1804
01:57:12,926 --> 01:57:14,796
It's even got an uglier
Decepticon with it!

1805
01:57:15,195 --> 01:57:16,245
We have to evac!

1806
01:57:35,048 --> 01:57:38,268
-Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked!
-We're trapped!

1807
01:57:39,286 --> 01:57:41,156
Okay. How do we get out of here?
Hey! Come on!

1808
01:57:41,555 --> 01:57:43,515
Oh, Lord Jesus,
let me just get out of this alive.

1809
01:57:54,668 --> 01:57:56,098
Move! We got to move!

1810
01:57:56,436 --> 01:57:58,276
Why do the Decepticons
always get the good shit?

1811
01:57:58,672 --> 01:58:00,222
-Move!
-We're about to be eaten, people!

1812
01:58:23,029 --> 01:58:24,519
We're gonna die!

1813
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:42,570
-Hold on!
-Give me your hand!

1814
01:58:43,083 --> 01:58:44,373
-I'm swinging that way!
-Got her!

1815
01:58:44,684 --> 01:58:45,974
Oh, my God!

1816
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:48,336
I'm dropping you on the fire escape!

1817
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:05,659
1

1818
01:59:06,072 --> 01:59:06,922
Sam!

1819
01:59:08,375 --> 01:59:09,955
We gotta move!

1820
01:59:23,456 --> 01:59:25,856
I'm coming for you!

1821
02:00:21,181 --> 02:00:22,290
Optimus!

1822
02:00:22,582 --> 02:00:24,862
-Wreckers!
-We're coming!

1823
02:00:26,453 --> 02:00:28,913
Decepticons around the world,

1824
02:00:29,389 --> 02:00:31,059
launch the pillars.

1825
02:01:02,322 --> 02:01:04,372
We are so lost!

1826
02:01:04,791 --> 02:01:05,901
Always left out.

1827
02:01:07,293 --> 02:01:08,782
Ka-ching!

1828
02:01:11,231 --> 02:01:12,721
It's time to lay down the law.

1829
02:01:13,066 --> 02:01:14,356
About to bring some hurt now.

1830
02:01:22,575 --> 02:01:24,625
It's starting! You see it?

1831
02:01:28,214 --> 02:01:29,614
Look out!

1832
02:01:37,924 --> 02:01:39,474
Where are Sam and Carly?

1833
02:01:41,861 --> 02:01:43,291
We'll go this way.

1834
02:01:50,603 --> 02:01:51,803
I give you one thing to do,

1835
02:01:52,105 --> 02:01:53,775
one thing to do,
and you drop the ball on that?

1836
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:55,510
I ain't signed up for all this!

1837
02:01:55,842 --> 02:01:57,741
Got aliens blasting at me,
running around, chasing me!

1838
02:01:58,144 --> 02:02:00,074
I'm ducking through churches and
buildings and all that kind of crap!

1839
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:03,059
This is bullshit!
I ain't signed up for this, Epps.

1840
02:02:03,550 --> 02:02:04,510
I'm trying to keep it together.

1841
02:02:08,922 --> 02:02:11,991
-What a treat! You and me, alone!
-Carly!

1842
02:02:17,897 --> 02:02:19,157
Come on, come on! Run!

1843
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:24,201
Okay. He's after me, not you.

1844
02:02:25,238 --> 02:02:26,348
Run!

1845
02:02:28,041 --> 02:02:30,121
You can't hide, boy!

1846
02:02:33,413 --> 02:02:37,072
I just love it when
your little insect feet try to run!

1847
02:02:37,717 --> 02:02:38,946
-Sam!
-Run!

1848
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:46,389
I thought you were working for us, boy?

1849
02:02:50,763 --> 02:02:52,933
No! Sam!

1850
02:03:02,742 --> 02:03:04,112
My eye!

1851
02:03:16,689 --> 02:03:17,979
My eye!

1852
02:03:20,793 --> 02:03:23,013
Target the Decepticon!

1853
02:03:30,436 --> 02:03:31,456
Sam!

1854
02:03:36,643 --> 02:03:37,783
Please, you've got to save Sam!

1855
02:03:38,077 --> 02:03:39,277
-You've got to save him!
-What the hell is he doing?

1856
02:03:43,049 --> 02:03:44,389
This better work.

1857
02:03:44,751 --> 02:03:46,531
D-Bots! D-Bots!

1858
02:03:59,866 --> 02:04:02,006
I can't see! I can't see!

1859
02:04:02,502 --> 02:04:03,352
Sam!

1860
02:04:03,603 --> 02:04:05,213
It's on my hand! Grab the knife! Knife!

1861
02:04:05,571 --> 02:04:06,651
-I'm trying!
-Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife!

1862
02:04:07,373 --> 02:04:10,562
The bomb's gonna blow!
The bomb's gonna...

1863
02:04:11,177 --> 02:04:12,847
You human scum!

1864
02:04:13,212 --> 02:04:14,822
-We got 20 seconds on that bomb!
-What bomb?

1865
02:04:15,214 --> 02:04:16,064
You see that bomb?

1866
02:04:16,582 --> 02:04:18,422
-Cut it, cut it, cut it!
-I got it!

1867
02:04:18,885 --> 02:04:20,435
How long do we have?

1868
02:04:21,521 --> 02:04:23,891
I'm gonna kick you!

1869
02:04:32,865 --> 02:04:34,035
Cut, cut, cut!

1870
02:04:35,735 --> 02:04:37,545
I'm gonna kill...

1871
02:04:54,721 --> 02:04:56,361
Well, he's dead.

1872
02:04:58,858 --> 02:05:00,878
Hey, Bee's going to run with
the rest of the Autobots

1873
02:05:01,294 --> 02:05:02,374
-and meet us at the edge of the river.
-All right.

1874
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:33,799
It sucked me in!
There was nothing I could do!

1875
02:05:35,962 --> 02:05:37,302
This is a total cluster...

1876
02:05:38,264 --> 02:05:40,404
We got to get across the river.

1877
02:05:40,833 --> 02:05:42,263
You see that? She said the control pillar

1878
02:05:42,602 --> 02:05:43,622
-was in that first cupola.
-All right.

1879
02:05:44,337 --> 02:05:46,527
Let's go! Move! Let's move!

1880
02:05:47,473 --> 02:05:49,202
Tomahawks are inbound.

1881
02:05:50,777 --> 02:05:51,977
ETA: 20 minutes.

1882
02:05:52,278 --> 02:05:53,648
I'm in the traffic cameras.

1883
02:05:54,747 --> 02:05:56,497
Four Autobots are captured.

1884
02:05:57,016 --> 02:05:58,656
Oh, my God. We're helpless.

1885
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:01,428
Whatever's set to happen,
with those pulses getting faster,

1886
02:06:01,888 --> 02:06:02,878
it's gonna happen soon.

1887
02:06:03,790 --> 02:06:05,130
No sign of Optimus.

1888
02:06:06,292 --> 02:06:08,342
How do we get these bridges down?

1889
02:06:09,495 --> 02:06:11,394
Spread out. Check in there.

1890
02:06:13,533 --> 02:06:14,403
Epps!

1891
02:06:14,667 --> 02:06:16,417
Epps, I've been looking for your ass.
How you doing?

1892
02:06:16,803 --> 02:06:18,992
Retirement is wack. Even worse,

1893
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:20,959
we can't get across the river
to that building,

1894
02:06:21,307 --> 02:06:22,916
and the Autobots
are upstairs, surrounded.

1895
02:06:29,515 --> 02:06:30,685
Just pan the camera around, all right?

1896
02:06:30,983 --> 02:06:32,593
All right. Pan... Pan right. That's you.

1897
02:06:33,953 --> 02:06:35,763
Try getting into the bridge control room.

1898
02:06:38,124 --> 02:06:39,994
What are they doing?
They're just standing there.

1899
02:06:40,393 --> 02:06:43,793
Hang on. Dutch, see if you can
hack into the bridge.

1900
02:06:44,730 --> 02:06:44,750
1

1901
02:06:45,198 --> 02:06:46,978
Sir, SEALs are here.

1902
02:06:47,366 --> 02:06:48,916
It's a good day, boys! What do you got?

1903
02:06:49,268 --> 02:06:51,108
Got a 10-man SEAL unit, sir,
tasked with vectoring Tomahawks.

1904
02:06:51,504 --> 02:06:52,324
-How long?
-Fifteen.

1905
02:06:52,705 --> 02:06:55,865
-You're my prisoners!
-Take it easy. We surrender.

1906
02:06:57,143 --> 02:06:58,253
Get off me.

1907
02:06:59,145 --> 02:07:00,545
Get off me!

1908
02:07:01,314 --> 02:07:03,744
All right, you're gonna need your
40 Mike-Mikes and frags. Go full auto.

1909
02:07:04,217 --> 02:07:07,557
The vibrations jack up their circuits.
Snipers, shoot for the eyes.

1910
02:07:08,154 --> 02:07:10,434
All right, your target is up
on top of that building, that cupola.

1911
02:07:11,190 --> 02:07:13,530
How doomed you are, Autobots.

1912
02:07:13,993 --> 02:07:16,103
You simply fail to understand

1913
02:07:16,529 --> 02:07:20,279
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

1914
02:07:21,134 --> 02:07:23,324
Activating the bridge.

1915
02:07:35,214 --> 02:07:36,764
They happy about something.

1916
02:07:37,416 --> 02:07:38,996
We're in the heart of their ship.

1917
02:07:39,352 --> 02:07:41,052
Let's give ‘em a little ride.

1918
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:43,410
We gonna screw this ship up.

1919
02:07:44,123 --> 02:07:46,202
It's a 128K binary encryption code.

1920
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:49,259
It's difficult.

1921
02:07:50,129 --> 02:07:52,709
But not for me. I'm in. Bridge down.

1922
02:07:54,634 --> 02:07:56,684
The bridge is coming down!
Someone's watching over us!

1923
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:58,980
Come on! Let's go!

1924
02:07:59,438 --> 02:08:01,578
“Pleasure working with you, Seymour.”

1925
02:08:02,008 --> 02:08:03,438
I believe you're supposed to say.

1926
02:08:04,544 --> 02:08:05,804
Good job, Dutch.

1927
02:08:12,885 --> 02:08:14,225
Get off me!

1928
02:08:39,312 --> 02:08:41,501
Hurry! They're triggering the pillars!

1929
02:08:43,149 --> 02:08:44,989
Prisoners? You're keeping prisoners?

1930
02:08:45,651 --> 02:08:47,291
Yes.

1931
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:49,160
You need to teach them about respect.

1932
02:08:49,755 --> 02:08:51,685
This was all business, but now
it's personal, do you understand me?

1933
02:08:53,626 --> 02:08:57,966
l understand.
No prisoners, only trophies.

1934
02:08:59,465 --> 02:09:02,565
Bee, I think they're going to kill us.

1935
02:09:04,103 --> 02:09:06,913
-You, your time is up.
-Wait, wait, wait!

1936
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,429
We surrendered! We're your prisoners.

1937
02:09:09,842 --> 02:09:11,712
-Move it!
-Can't we talk this out?

1938
02:09:12,111 --> 02:09:15,241
We're all a bunch of good chaps!
I mean you no...

1939
02:09:18,451 --> 02:09:20,201
Why did you...

1940
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:29,293
Good-bye, my old friend.

1941
02:09:30,830 --> 02:09:32,350
You're mine now.

1942
02:09:46,145 --> 02:09:47,255
Get off me!

1943
02:09:48,147 --> 02:09:49,376
-I got to help him.
-What?

1944
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:51,678
What are you doing?

1945
02:09:51,984 --> 02:09:54,124
-I got to help him.
-Sam, you can't help him.

1946
02:10:02,495 --> 02:10:04,425
Turn around.

1947
02:10:13,706 --> 02:10:15,896
We... We gave ‘em a hell of a run.

1948
02:10:32,224 --> 02:10:33,594
We did it, Brains! We did it!

1949
02:10:33,926 --> 02:10:35,216
Rip this ship apart!

1950
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:16,320
-We had a nice run, Brains, you and me.
-Yeah, we gonna die.

1951
02:11:33,386 --> 02:11:35,696
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, baby!
You all come with us!

1952
02:11:36,756 --> 02:11:39,096
Go! You guys,
follow that ground team! Go!

1953
02:11:39,558 --> 02:11:42,368
-Move, move, move!
-Epps, third floor! We're going to 45!

1954
02:11:48,467 --> 02:11:49,807
All right. Two snipers, right here!

1955
02:11:52,104 --> 02:11:52,954
All right, dock up!

1956
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:56,320
We jump in three minutes!

1957
02:11:59,712 --> 02:12:01,322
Set up shop right here.

1958
02:12:06,218 --> 02:12:07,148
Set up.

1959
02:12:09,255 --> 02:12:10,425
I'm downstairs.

1960
02:12:10,723 --> 02:12:12,943
We got five targets
and Shockwave right below us.

1961
02:12:13,559 --> 02:12:15,049
Stand by to jump!

1962
02:12:15,394 --> 02:12:17,384
All right, let's go! Get ready, get ready.

1963
02:12:31,043 --> 02:12:32,413
Go!

1964
02:12:42,521 --> 02:12:43,981
Snipers, take out their eyes.

1965
02:12:48,027 --> 02:12:49,257
All right, demo team, let's crank steel.

1966
02:12:57,736 --> 02:12:59,465
Turning steel!

1967
02:13:35,875 --> 02:13:37,075
Don't fire till I tell you!

1968
02:13:48,153 --> 02:13:49,323
Go!

1969
02:13:51,457 --> 02:13:52,767
Good job, kid!

1970
02:13:53,092 --> 02:13:53,942
Fire!

1971
02:14:06,372 --> 02:14:07,682
-We got him!
-Yeah!

1972
02:14:09,074 --> 02:14:10,443
He's on the run!

1973
02:14:13,045 --> 02:14:14,825
Autobots, attack!

1974
02:14:20,419 --> 02:14:22,089
Mortar that bridge!

1975
02:14:26,058 --> 02:14:28,048
It's our world now!

1976
02:14:29,295 --> 02:14:30,995
Commence transport!

1977
02:14:43,309 --> 02:14:45,529
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1978
02:14:46,879 --> 02:14:46,899
1

1979
02:15:00,559 --> 02:15:01,669
Optimus!

1980
02:15:36,862 --> 02:15:38,562
You die!

1981
02:15:46,872 --> 02:15:47,922
No!

1982
02:15:58,751 --> 02:16:00,711
Get down here, Sentinel!

1983
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:02,900
Optimus,

1984
02:16:03,288 --> 02:16:04,897
you forget your place!

1985
02:16:12,064 --> 02:16:15,224
I bring you Cybertron, your home,

1986
02:16:16,568 --> 02:16:19,288
and still you choose humanity.

1987
02:16:19,805 --> 02:16:23,205
You were the one who taught me
freedom is everyone's right.

1988
02:16:27,246 --> 02:16:29,176
I will retrigger that pillar!

1989
02:16:29,581 --> 02:16:32,210
Then you'll have to go through me!

1990
02:16:36,655 --> 02:16:37,915
Okay, I've got to try and help.

1991
02:16:38,223 --> 02:16:39,862
-I have to. You stay here.
-Don't you go. Don't go.

1992
02:16:40,225 --> 02:16:43,155
You'll be fine, okay? I promise.
I got to get to that pillar.

1993
02:16:45,864 --> 02:16:47,443
Charge the pillar!

1994
02:16:47,799 --> 02:16:48,910
We got Autobots!

1995
02:17:06,451 --> 02:17:08,121
Reinforcements!

1996
02:17:08,486 --> 02:17:10,916
Decepticon ships, fire at Optimus!

1997
02:17:15,861 --> 02:17:18,141
We're taking fire!
I need those Tomahawks now!

1998
02:17:18,797 --> 02:17:20,137
First wave inbound.

1999
02:17:26,538 --> 02:17:28,788
We've got to cover for Optimus!

2000
02:17:43,322 --> 02:17:46,041
Decepticons, trigger the pillar!

2001
02:17:47,191 --> 02:17:48,892
Restart that pillar!

2002
02:17:49,661 --> 02:17:50,831
Trigger the pillars.

2003
02:17:51,930 --> 02:17:55,620
I can't hold them!
The ships have us pinned!

2004
02:17:56,902 --> 02:17:58,102
No!

2005
02:17:58,670 --> 02:18:00,840
Inbound, 10 seconds! Danger close!

2006
02:18:01,272 --> 02:18:03,232
Mark-Lima-Echo-Echo, 14250!

2007
02:18:03,642 --> 02:18:04,691
Positive surface contact.

2008
02:18:04,977 --> 02:18:06,267
-Target LD.
-Target acquired.

2009
02:18:35,073 --> 02:18:37,263
-Dylan! Wait!
-No!

2010
02:18:40,646 --> 02:18:41,496
Dylan!

2011
02:18:42,781 --> 02:18:43,981
Stop! Stop!

2012
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:45,570
No!

2013
02:18:46,385 --> 02:18:47,995
You can't do this, okay?

2014
02:18:48,921 --> 02:18:50,591
There's only one future for me.

2015
02:19:14,813 --> 02:19:20,323
Cybertron, you are saved, at last.

2016
02:19:30,162 --> 02:19:32,852
Have you come to surrender?

2017
02:19:33,699 --> 02:19:35,779
-Was it all worth it?
-Obviously.

2018
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:39,710
All your work to bring Sentinel back
and now clearly he has all the power.

2019
02:19:40,638 --> 02:19:42,159
It's actually almost tragic.

2020
02:19:42,507 --> 02:19:45,197
You dare lecture me, slave?

2021
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:47,930
Your Decepticons
finally conquering this planet,

2022
02:19:48,379 --> 02:19:49,490
and yet, their leader won't be you!

2023
02:19:49,815 --> 02:19:53,565
It will be me! It will always be me.

2024
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:57,000
In any minute now,

2025
02:19:57,389 --> 02:20:00,698
you'll be nothing but Sentinel's bitch.

2026
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,800
Rocket!

2027
02:20:11,536 --> 02:20:12,526
Die!

2028
02:20:25,284 --> 02:20:26,424
You chose sides?

2029
02:20:27,753 --> 02:20:28,603
You chose wrong.

2030
02:20:34,993 --> 02:20:37,423
Always the bravest of us!

2031
02:20:40,799 --> 02:20:42,989
But you could never make
the hard decisions!

2032
02:20:46,405 --> 02:20:49,015
Our planet will survive!

2033
02:20:50,409 --> 02:20:51,399
No!

2034
02:21:01,486 --> 02:21:04,116
We were gods once. All of us.

2035
02:21:04,656 --> 02:21:06,676
-But here...
-Please!

2036
02:21:07,092 --> 02:21:09,172
... there will only be one!

2037
02:21:20,439 --> 02:21:23,629
This is my planet!

2038
02:21:34,853 --> 02:21:36,523
I just saved a whole other world.

2039
02:21:37,055 --> 02:21:39,455
You think you're a hero, huh?
You think you're a hero?

2040
02:21:39,958 --> 02:21:39,978
1

2041
02:21:40,225 --> 02:21:42,305
No. I'm just a messenger.

2042
02:21:50,035 --> 02:21:51,494
The pillar's still connected!

2043
02:21:53,672 --> 02:21:54,872
Bring it up!

2044
02:21:55,374 --> 02:21:57,274
-Bee! Let's do this!
-Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

2045
02:21:57,676 --> 02:21:59,046
Pillar's still connected!

2046
02:21:59,378 --> 02:22:01,308
Rip that pillar down!

2047
02:22:24,903 --> 02:22:28,153
Now, we need a truce.

2048
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:31,699
All l want is to be back in charge.

2049
02:22:32,244 --> 02:22:34,024
Besides,

2050
02:22:34,413 --> 02:22:37,723
who would you be without me, Prime?

2051
02:22:38,316 --> 02:22:40,366
Time to find out.

2052
02:23:03,241 --> 02:23:05,931
Optimus, all l ever wanted

2053
02:23:06,445 --> 02:23:08,585
was the survival of our race.

2054
02:23:09,381 --> 02:23:13,161
You must see why I had to betray you.

2055
02:23:13,819 --> 02:23:15,809
You didn't betray me.

2056
02:23:16,655 --> 02:23:18,645
You betrayed yourself.

2057
02:23:19,324 --> 02:23:20,614
No, Optimus!

2058
02:24:17,015 --> 02:24:18,355
Sam.

2059
02:24:57,923 --> 02:24:59,353
I love you.

2060
02:24:59,691 --> 02:25:00,561
I love you.

2061
02:25:02,127 --> 02:25:03,177
You're the only thing
I need in this world,

2062
02:25:03,461 --> 02:25:05,711
and III do anything to make it up to you,
I promise.

2063
02:25:06,698 --> 02:25:08,978
I'm going to hold you to that.

2064
02:25:09,434 --> 02:25:10,694
Just never let me go.

2065
02:25:11,836 --> 02:25:13,206
I promise.

2066
02:25:18,777 --> 02:25:19,977
Rings.

2067
02:25:28,019 --> 02:25:29,359
I love this car.

2068
02:25:29,888 --> 02:25:33,168
Bee, you've got to slow it down.
You got to slow way down, okay?

2069
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:35,788
I'm just trying to help out.

2070
02:25:37,929 --> 02:25:39,329
In any war

2071
02:25:39,731 --> 02:25:42,311
there are calms between storms.

2072
02:25:43,435 --> 02:25:44,455
You fought bravely.

2073
02:25:44,736 --> 02:25:47,016
There will be days when we lose faith.

2074
02:25:47,472 --> 02:25:49,902
Days when our allies turn against us.

2075
02:25:50,942 --> 02:25:54,782
But the day will never come
that we forsake this planet

2076
02:25:55,614 --> 02:25:57,784
and its people.

2077
02:25:58,416 --> 02:25:58,436
1

2078
02:26:19,437 --> 02:26:23,097
That's what I call
the start of a beautiful future.

2079
02:26:24,809 --> 02:26:26,479
Arrest him.

2080
02:26:26,945 --> 02:26:27,795
It was worth it!

2081
02:26:28,079 --> 02:26:29,859
-Get him out of here!
-I'd go to jail for love! I don't care!

2082
02:26:30,382 --> 02:26:32,872
Go ahead, take me in! I want to go in!
Let's go in.

2083
02:26:33,351 --> 02:26:34,901
Come on, Charlotte,
take me in right now!

2084
02:34:14,545 --> 02:34:14,565
