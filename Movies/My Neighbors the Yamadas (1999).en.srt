00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,850
Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli, NTV,
Hakuhodo & Buena Vista Japan present:

3
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:19,506
This is the sun, this is the moon,

4
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:23,043
this mountain is really the earth,

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,650
and this is grandma.

6
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,638
My how splendid...

7
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,025
Hello, Mrs. Yamada.

8
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,968
I've never seen
such a magnificent...

9
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,138
Yup, they're my little babies.

10
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,908
What species?

11
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,689
This is a Mino Chrysanthemum,
this is...

12
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,976
No, [ mean the caterpillar.

13
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,519
No idea.

14
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,918
Grow into a butterfly
just as gaudy as that flower.

15
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,622
Mother!

16
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:30,028
That's our grandma.

17
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,780
And my mother
and me. Nonoko.

18
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,029
What am! going to make
for dinner tonight...

19
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,998
I know, I'll go for it!
Something really special!

20
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,689
What are we having?

21
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,404
We had curry last week.
Curry two days ago.

22
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,842
Tonight...
Curry!

23
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,152
What...

24
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,675
And this is my father
and my older brother.

25
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,338
What's the use of
all this studying, Dad?

26
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,310
Listen, Noboru.

27
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,756
Studying is not about
what's useful or not.

28
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,478
The studying that seems useless
may turn out to be useful.

29
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,190
On the other hand.
a
it might be that

30
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,956
studying that doesn't seem
not useful may not be,

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,540
but then studying that seems
useless may then be useful.

32
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,636
But when you really need it,
it's not about useful or useless...

33
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,967
What are you going on about?

34
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,383
So I still have to study.

35
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:13,286
MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS

36
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,399
I get it...

37
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,692
If my father had been
smart and really cool,

38
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,715
and my mother had been
gorgeous and a great cook,

39
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:41,716
and our family had been rich, my
whole life would've been different.

40
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,279
If at least one of them...

41
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,775
Don't be ridiculous.

42
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,810
If we hadn't married, there'd be
no you, and no Nonoko.

43
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,319
Without the two of us,
you wouldn't be here.

44
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,986
No, that’s wrong.

45
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:05,195
If l had cooler parents,
I'd just be their kid.

46
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,042
How stupid.

47
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,654
Don’t you know about
stamens and pistils?

48
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,088
You tell him.

49
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,809
You can't choose your parents.

50
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:18,071
No, l can't accept that.
Something's not right.

51
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,389
Because I'm me, Dad's Dad
and Mom's Mom.

52
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,716
What is that supposed to mean?

53
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,073
Who am I?

54
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,070
Where did l come from?

55
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,703
Where am I?

56
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,179
Who am I?

57
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,389
I get it...

58
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,971
So, there was a time when
Dad and Mom weren't married.

59
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,832
Takashi and Matsuko are off
to a great start in their new life.

60
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,824
Let's give them a warm send-off.

61
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:22,743
Congratulations,
Takashi and Matsuko.

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,740
l also offer warm wishes
to their parents and relatives.

63
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,141
Now, your prospects are boundless,

64
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:45,054
and you're embarking for the wide
open world, under billowing sails.

65
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,223
Life, as they say,
has its ups and downs.

66
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:07,296
At times, the waves may taunt you,
tossing you in their swells.

67
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,178
But take heart.

68
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,580
It's hard to stick with it
and make it on your own,

69
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:20,432
but even a couple of losers can
survive most things if they're together.

70
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:29,704
So listen, take my advice and have
children as soon as you can.

71
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:36,204
Children are the best reason
for riding out life's storms.

72
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:50,843
Nowadays people say child-rearing
is challenging and difficult,

73
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,908
but we've done it
from time immemorial.

74
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,364
Children grow even without parents.

75
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:03,901
So hold them close to your heart
as they crawl, then walk. They'll be fine.

76
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,212
Children make you
appreciate your own parents.

77
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,026
Parents may seem to do nothing
but order you around,

78
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,132
but they'll baby-sit your kids and
sometimes give them toys.

79
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,456
Nowadays young people

80
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:34,769
turn that saying about appreciating
parents to their own advantage.

81
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,462
But I guess that’s part of it too.

82
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:44,162
If things work out,
you even get the real estate.

83
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,959
So Matsuko and Takashi,

84
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,150
start looking after your folks!

85
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,673
l hope you know
the land is in my name.

86
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,160
Excuse me, mother,
but I built this house.

87
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,783
Without land, there's no house.

88
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,806
And we are grateful to you,

89
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,329
but I've worked hard, too.

90
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,085
Your room gets the best light.

91
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,918
Thanks for nothing.

92
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,759
Of course it does.
It's on my land.

93
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:21,117
Besides, why do you always
insist you built it by yourself.

94
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,627
l hate to contradict you,
but I definitely built...

95
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,091
That's enough!

96
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,757
Both of you.

97
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,255
That's right! What's the point
of all this bickering!

98
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,146
Listen to Noboru.

99
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,281
In the end, it'll all be mine.

100
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,337
And what should you fear most
on this lifelong voyage?

101
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,476
Wild storms and rip tides?

102
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,633
No. Beware the calm waters, when
there's hardly a ripple in sight.

103
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,531
As long as a family holds each
other tight, they can somehow

104
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,159
weather the wildest seas.

105
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,468
But calm waters are another story.

106
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:36,510
The wind dies down, you sigh
and relax, loosening your clasp.

107
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,431
But take care, Matsuko and Takashi!

108
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:47,848
If in the calm you selfishly please
only yourselves, you may lose each other.

109
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,505
You'll never see the sharks
gathering around you.

110
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,292
And how will you guide your ship?

111
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,706
Without a wind,
or even a course?

112
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,333
If you row blindly,
right, no, left,

113
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,090
no, right after all,
you'll never agree.

114
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:23,048
You may even wonder why you're
stuck on the same boat at all.

115
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,640
Your family's
about to fall apart.

116
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:28,747
Turn right there!

117
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:29,808
You sure?

118
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,010
Turn left!

119
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,034
Right, right! No, left, left!

120
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,263
Which way!

121
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,871
Oh dear, maybe right.

122
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,502
Which is it!??

123
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,139
We came so close...

124
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,434
Our turn!

125
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,726
A Family Crisis

126
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,188
Oh, no, this isn't the way.

127
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,911
You should've turned!

128
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,419
No, no. go straight!

129
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,711
No, it's that way, are you crazy?

130
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,522
It's this way, Dad!

131
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,978
Quiet! All of you.

132
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,442
Nonoko’s the only one who's quiet.

133
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,538
Hm...she’s not here.

134
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,799
What?

135
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,671
Where is she?

136
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,642
Stop the car.

137
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,602
Where did we lose her?

138
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,985
Noboru, weren't you with her?

139
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,612
Yeah, while Dad and I
were waiting for you.

140
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,759
Maybe she got bored
and wandered off.

141
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,385
No, l remember her on the bench.

142
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,573
I'm so sorry.

143
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,444
What took you so long?

144
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,299
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

145
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,795
I could have done some shopping, too.

146
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,701
l wanted to look at
baseball bats.

147
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,214
I'm sure she’s still there.

148
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,869
It's all because you kept yelling
about how late we were.

149
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,276
Don't blame me.
You're the ones who were late.

150
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:31,523
You all got so excited, you just
left poor Nonoko behind.

151
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,178
Like you weren't
there yourself, grandma.

152
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,432
We were looking for
your flannel underwear!

153
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,578
The store'll close.
I'll never make it.

154
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,135
Stop thinking about yourself.

155
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,244
What if something terrible
happens to Nonoko?

156
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,503
Something terrible?

157
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,853
You don't mean...kidnapped!

158
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,808
She's so adorable, just like me.

159
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,023
This is no time for jokes!

160
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,246
If only that would work now.

161
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,889
What do you mean, that?

162
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,667
The PTA mantra.

163
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,853
‘Don't talk to strangers.’

164
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,050
That's what you teach children?

165
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,560
It's like saying
all strangers are thieves.

166
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,264
Nonoko's fine.
Those teeth!

167
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,063
Hey, cake! Gimmee some!

168
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,460
Just one bite.

169
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:30,766
Ok!

170
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,175
One chomp of those teeth!

171
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,404
Enough!

172
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,305
Please move, our daughter
may have been kidnapped!

173
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:48,954
We can't even call.

174
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,562
We should've called before.

175
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,361
l told you to buy a cell phone.

176
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,209
You keep quiet!

177
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,043
Oh, Nonoko!

178
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,195
Are you lost?

179
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,802
Huh, so you're
waiting for someone?

180
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,640
Who are you waiting for?

181
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,164
Can't you talk?

182
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,270
Then why don't
you say anything?

183
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,549
I'm not s'pposed to
people I don't know.

184
00:15:55,488 --> 00:16:00,648
I know, 'Don't talk
to strangers.’

185
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:08,065
You're very grown-up, because
you're careful. You can talk now.

186
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,945
You should hear my story.

187
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,766
My father and mother and
grandma and brother all got lost.

188
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,415
Did you lose someone?

189
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,496
My mommy.

190
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,111
Your mommy?

191
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,909
My mommy went away...

192
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:31,197
I know...there've been a lot
of missing parents lately...

193
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,481
But it’s only your mom,
you'll find her.

194
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,329
Excuse me, this is
Toshio Kimura.

195
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,677
Can you please call his mom?

196
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:47,936
Oh, he's lost?

197
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,250
No he's not, they were separated.

198
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,640
Right.

199
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,960
And your first name, Mr. Kimura?

200
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,412
- Toshio.
- Toshio.

201
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,948
Toshio, then.

202
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,090
Wait here a minute. OK?

203
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,234
And you? Are you his sister?

204
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,238
No, no relation.

205
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,190
My whole family’s lost.

206
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:31,549
Poor little, poor litile,
fost pussy cat...

207
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,606
Stop crying. we're here.

208
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,484
What! She went with her mother!?!

209
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,698
I'm her mother!

210
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,492
Oh, is that so?

211
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,487
How dare you give
her to a stranger!

212
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,173
It may not have been her mother,
but she was no stranger.

213
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,887
No stranger? Who could it be?

214
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,642
I don't know anyone...

215
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,056
Someone pretending
to be friendly...

216
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,053
No, she recognized Nonoko.

217
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,517
That wasn't her mother!

218
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,681
Calm down! And then?

219
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,895
I'm terribly sorry.

220
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,640
Nonoko went off happily with
someone who seemed like her mother.

221
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,350
Oh no...
Who can it be...

222
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,900
Will you please page Nonoko?

223
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,371
Actually...they went out
that exit together.

224
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,635
Not here.

225
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,600
Come on!

226
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,206
That's some family...

227
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,847
Dad, where are you racing off to?

228
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,317
We're chasing it!

229
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,170
What?

230
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,472
The car Nonoko's in!

231
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,035
What kind of car?

232
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,032
We don't even know
which way it went!

233
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,063
She'll be fine. Nonoko
knew the lady, right?

234
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,326
I bet she took her home.

235
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,209
I'm sure Noboru's right.

236
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,891
Sure, that must be it.

237
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,130
Don't be so sure. You can't
trust anyone these days.

238
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,705
Mother!

239
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,949
Don't you think you
should notify the police?

240
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,393
The police!

241
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,241
How would we explain?

242
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,673
Make a full confession.

243
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:03,829
Confession!

244
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,486
That four grown people neglected
and abandoned a young girl.

245
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,399
Say. does Nonoko have a key?

246
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:14,909
Let’s go home!

247
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:47,776
Nonoko!

248
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:52,428
Nonoko!

249
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,245
Nonoko!

250
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,124
Nonoko!

251
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,765
Not here.

252
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,533
Of course not, it was locked.

253
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,960
Hello.

254
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,187
Oh, thank goodness!

255
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,545
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

256
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:25,598
Thank you! We were
looking everywhere for her.

257
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,428
I'm so sorry for all this...

258
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:33,744
Yes, we'll be right over.

259
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,567
You even made her dinner...

260
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:43,407
You're so very kind, how can
we possibly thank you...

261
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,728
They finally got home.

262
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,494
They're coming right over.

263
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,283
I'm sorry, auntie.

264
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,656
Oh, it's nothing.

265
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,293
I can't wait to hear
their side of the story.

266
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:20,878
Joyful laughter Breaks the silence
Of an autumn eve - Basho (1644 - 1694)

267
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,551
Look up and see,
the blue skies,

268
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:30,493
the white clouds

269
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:36,363
One of these days,
it'll all work out

270
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,791
- Next stop Luncheon Court.

271
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,195
What did you call this stop?

272
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,001
Can you stand back, ma'am?

273
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,164
Home Economics Wizard

274
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:27,087
Oh, dear, it started raining.

275
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,586
The laundry!

276
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:41,916
Huh?

277
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,460
What's the fuss?

278
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,197
That's right!
I'd already brought it in.

279
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,379
You never even hung it up!

280
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,179
I'm going out.
Can get you anything?

281
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,990
Oh! There was something...

282
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,860
What was it... Um...um...

283
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,956
OK, then, I'm going.

284
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,014
It's just that, oh, what was it...

285
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,573
Wait, wait, wait. wait...

286
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,364
What is it!

287
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,025
Um, that is, um...

288
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,746
Why don't you just give up!

289
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,503
Oh, bread!

290
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,022
Get it yourself!

291
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,391
Mom!

292
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,400
Money, money.

293
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,241
I'm home.

294
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,347
I guess Mom's not here.

295
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,068
Wow, noodles.

296
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,387
And the water's boiling.

297
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,592
Great, I'll go ahead and eat ‘em.

298
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,225
Oh, you're home.

299
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,064
You were hiding!

300
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,031
Say.

301
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,410
The bulb’s out.

302
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,462
That's no good.
Better change it.

303
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,873
Oh, darn...no spares.

304
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,146
Just switch it with
one you don't use.

305
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,818
Up we go.

306
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,863
I'm just borrowing it...

307
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,715
Ouch, it's hot.

308
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,077
Tea.

309
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,298
Me. too.

310
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,389
Me. too.

311
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,184
I'm busy washing the dishes.
Get in here one of you!

312
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,221
paper scissors rock

313
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,466
Get your cup out.

314
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,033
The dishes are all yours.

315
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:39,744
What!

316
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,000
Mr. Tanaka says he’s coming over.

317
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,268
What! Oh, no.

318
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,671
Better tidy up a little.

319
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,171
Ouch.

320
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:11,264
Hey, what are you doing?

321
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,583
I'll say we're spring cleaning!

322
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,736
Marriage Yamada Style

323
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,708
It's on the kitchen table.

324
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,309
No, it’s not.

325
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,911
Are you sure? I know I left it.

326
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,837
it isn't here.

327
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,143
Where did you look?

328
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,208
It's a manila envelope
that says OKK in red.

329
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,521
Is this it, sir?

330
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,035
Oh, uh...OK. Well.

331
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,866
if it’s gone, it’s gone.

332
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,296
Hey.

333
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,557
Here.

334
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,965
That's 20 years of marriage for you.

335
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:00,538
Gimme the paper.

336
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,269
When I'm done.

337
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,756
Impressive.

338
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,936
Can you pick up a few things?

339
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,055
Sure.

340
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,649
Lettuce, cucumber, ham,
light bulbs and garbage bags.

341
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:23,771
I'll make a list.

342
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,176
No, I've got it.

343
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,945
Lettuce, cucumber, ham,

344
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,714
light bulbs and garbage bags, right?

345
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,274
l told you.

346
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,795
It's not exactly like I forgot.

347
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,703
Lettuce..cucumber...

348
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,444
Let's see...

349
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,819
Make up your mind.

350
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,409
Have you decided?

351
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,733
Just hurry up.

352
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,108
I'll take the Shanghai Special.

353
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,530
Me too.

354
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:08,886
Two Shanghai Specials.

355
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,062
Oh, you're still here?

356
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:18,856
What do you mean, 'still'?

357
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,587
Can't l rest on my day off?

358
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,590
Usually, you're off at Pachinko.

359
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,324
Nope, I'm giving it a rest.
How about some tea?

360
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,561
And noodles for lunch.

361
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,167
Yes, dear.

362
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,053
Actually, make
that coffee, not tea!
a

363
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,301
And the bathroom’s a wreck.

364
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,414
Clean it up.

365
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,086
And when you go shopping
l need cigarettes.

366
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,173
What a pain in the neck!

367
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,466
Honey, honey...

368
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,784
Where's your mother?

369
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,630
Out playing Pachinko.

370
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,654
It's just about to start.

371
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:45,927
It's not over.

372
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,334
But l was looking forward to it.

373
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:49,736
No.

374
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,291
It's a movie!

375
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,383
Now nobody can watch.

376
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,662
This is much more fun.

377
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,270
( win!

378
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:44,812
Hey, Noboru.

379
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,104
Wanna play catch?

380
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,160
Yeah.

381
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,597
Male Bonding

382
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,178
No Trespassing

383
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,388
Wait, the dad's supposed
to be the catcher.

384
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,556
Give me a break.

385
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:09,114
OK, this signal for a curve ball,
this for a fastball,

386
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,405
and this for a slider.

387
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,500
Give me a break.

388
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,515
Two outs, bases loaded,
you're the relief pitcher.

389
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,392
I'm the starting pitcher type.

390
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,261
Give me a break!

391
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,063
Are you nuts?

392
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,558
The team never even lets you pitch.

393
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,491
That's why I want to
start now.

394
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,841
l see. OK, let's see this
starting pitcher pitch.

395
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,709
It's still two outs, bases loaded.

396
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,108
What!

397
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,142
OK, pitch.

398
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,870
God damn it!

399
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,695
What are you listening to?

400
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,525
Listening over and over
will improve my English.

401
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,140
It's not that easy.

402
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:21,982
In my experience...

403
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,194
Study!

404
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,101
Study!

405
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:28,337
Study!

406
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,293
It just doesn’t work for me.

407
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:52,703
I'm not you.

408
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,629
How ‘bout a drop of sake?

409
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:01,546
Sure.

410
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,073
But, dear.

411
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,950
Pretty awful, huh?

412
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:16,884
A little dry.

413
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,153
What did you say!

414
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,177
Have you been...

415
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:25,576
Noboru!

416
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,080
Noboru!

417
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,790
Hey, Noboru, let's play catch.

418
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:41,799
Why?

419
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,824
Why...? It's a form of
parent-child bonding.

420
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,473
Then it doesn't have to be catch.

421
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,011
I get your point, but...

422
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,455
It's a matter of setting
the right stage.

423
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,470
Forget it. Can't be bothered.

424
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,203
Kids these days...

425
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,185
A serious generation gap...

426
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,253
Paternal Supremacy Restored

427
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,770
Don't mix your rice into the soup.

428
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,500
Listen to your father.

429
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,379
Pour the soup over the rice.

430
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,041
Excuse me, father...

431
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,831
What? Got a problem with that?

432
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,173
Oh, suit yourself.

433
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,760
See, the water after
the cement.

434
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,300
Um...

435
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:07,203
Hmmm...

436
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,448
Control those chopsticks.
It's rude.

437
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,342
Use your chopsticks
with purpose.

438
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,916
That's my plate.

439
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,505
Excuse me.

440
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,647
You bit it, it's yours.

441
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,222
Help me think of an
independent study topic.

442
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,995
Think for yourself.

443
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:34,707
It's independent,
free choice.

444
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,343
I know, but I'm coming up blank.

445
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,754
You're free to do anything?

446
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,387
Right, free.

447
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,711
But...

448
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:50,137
Total freedom
makes it tough, doesn't it?

449
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,385
Exactly.

450
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,749
Freedom, huh...

451
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,987
Absolute freedom of choice...

452
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:18,833
Glorious freedom...
I dream of freedom...

453
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,541
But when it comes
on a silver platter...

454
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,789
I haven't got a clue what to do...

455
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,417
Now he's a philosopher.

456
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,792
He's probably worrying
about his own retirement.

457
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,970
Father as Role Model

458
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,337
The first snow!

459
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,912
Let's take a picture in it!

460
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,288
Why?

461
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,167
You're hardly children anymore.

462
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,238
Shut the door. It's cold.

463
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:47,821
Where's the camera?

464
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,069
In the top drawer.

465
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:58,712
Is not!

466
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,438
You should know where it is.

467
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,589
This is the best part...

468
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,959
A lone figure
Back turned

469
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,749
Receding into the mist
- Santoka (1882 - 1940)

470
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,241
Yamada Family Chronictes

471
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,073
Happy New Year

472
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,220
New Year's Cards

473
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,694
Ready!

474
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:36,657
Go!

475
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:37,500
Mine, mine,

476
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,625
Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's...

477
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,759
31 seconds! A new record.

478
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,730
Not bad.

479
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,539
The Thick of Winter

480
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:13,907
Time to get up.

481
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:15,475
Dad, can you get me some cake?

482
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:16,616
Coke for me.

483
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:17,594
The tangerines, too.

484
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,852
And the stove needs kerosene.

485
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,950
Thank you!

486
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,097
Spring Showers

487
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,407
Can you bring my umbrella?

488
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,659
Your father needs his
umbrella at the station.

489
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,959
Why me? I'm studying.

490
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:51,473
You should go.
Walk in the rain with your man.

491
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,173
i just don't have
the energy today.

492
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,362
But...

493
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,473
NoboriA You go, please.

494
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,146
Make Nonoko go.

495
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,431
Forget it! I'll Buy one.

496
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,743
Pick up some pork, too?

497
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,139
No Way!

498
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:29,281
A spring shower Dressed for rain
Talking as they go - Buson (1716 - 1784)

499
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:39,417
Strange...
Where's Noboru's sock...

500
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,781
Noncko's pajamas and
Dad's towel?

501
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,243
Pajamas? Socks?

502
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,950
And his towel.

503
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:52,262
Hey, wait...

504
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,837
This means...

505
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,426
I knew it!

506
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,505
The Black Hole!

507
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,055
The Perfect Combo

508
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,321
Maybe we'll order
sushi in for dinner...

509
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,119
Oh, what a waste of money!
I'll make the sushi.

510
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,661
Just as I hoped...

511
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,359
Say, mother...

512
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,156
Sushi's not interesting.
I thought ld go gourmet.

513
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:36,884
l see..So what is it?

514
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,991
Beef Stroganoga...

515
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,338
Don't cook what you can't spell.

516
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:43,937
Well, excuse me!

517
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,650
It's Beef Stroganoff, right?

518
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:50,863
You knew all along.

519
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:52,906
I know very well.

520
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:57,461
Beef Stroganoga is just
the Strogaffgaff of beef.

521
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,292
Whatever, just make it.

522
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,792
Darn. I was really
counting on sushi.

523
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:23,520
No good. 1 screwed it up.
Order the sushi.

524
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,298
Breakfast of Champions

525
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,707
Wow, miso soup, fried
egg and seaweed.

526
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,241
A real Japanese breakfast.

527
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,437
Well, actually...

528
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:42,622
Nonoko's leftovers?

529
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:45,802
Yesterday's soup?

530
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:48,705
Extra seaweed from lunch?

531
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:51,534
Precisely!

532
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,930
Today's your lucky day.

533
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,453
Hardly!

534
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,573
Take care.

535
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,357
Matsuko...

536
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:16,067
When's lunch, Matsuko?

537
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:22,372
What are you talking
about? We just ate.

538
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,397
You're too young to be senile.

539
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,250
You sure...?

540
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,991
The noodles, a few... Oops!

541
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:36,622
late them all myself...

542
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:37,837
Hey!

543
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,893
What's for dinner?

544
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:48,578
Shabu shabu.

545
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,018
We have it all the time.

546
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:55,654
Shabu shabu's perfect for winter.

547
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,684
OK, help yourselves.

548
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:05,116
This way, she
doesn't have to cook.

549
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,507
Cold noodles for lunch again?

550
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,469
That's what we had yesterday!

551
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,808
And the day before.

552
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,590
That doesn't make sense!

553
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,116
And again tomorrow!?

554
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,602
Noodles! What else?

555
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,513
Lots of free ginger
in the garden to go with it.

556
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,054
Ginger Morning

557
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,296
The ginger’s good in miso soup.

558
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:38,935
Yes, though they do say
it makes you forgetful.

559
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,504
Oh dear. He left his bag.

560
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,434
He's bound to notice.
He can't be that dumb.

561
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,121
Right.

562
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,694
Oh. no, ! forgot...

563
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,513
..to take off my pajamas!

564
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,204
I'm off.

565
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:08,341
OK.

566
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,171
Have a nice day.

567
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,164
I'm off.

568
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:22,572
My shoes!

569
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,330
Mom, look!

570
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:30,767
Dad!

571
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:32,725
What's all the fuss!

572
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:34,281
My train!

573
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:35,552
'll be late!

574
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,930
Be careful.

575
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,255
I'm off to school.

576
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,644
Off you go...

577
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:50,464
Can't even close
the door behind them.

578
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,668
What's this?

579
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,361
Oh. Nonoko forgot her lunch.

580
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:06,142
She needs it by noon?

581
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:07,957
Sure, but...

582
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,696
Fine, I'll take it to her when
l go shopping.

583
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,366
That'll really be a help.

584
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,720
I'm off.

585
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:23,125
OK. Thank you.

586
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,046
What's this?

587
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:36,233
Oh, no, she's forgotten her
purse and everything.

588
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:41,531
She'll be back.

589
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,320
Watch the house, OK?

590
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:55,867
Oh no! I left
the kettle on.

591
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:03,535
Mrs. Yamada, delivery!

592
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,236
Are they out?

593
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,826
No, they're in.

594
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,440
Oh, Mrs. Yamada.

595
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,586
Ob, I did turn it off.

596
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,390
Were you robbed?

597
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,099
Here's your package.

598
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,432
Oh. thank you.

599
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:42,228
Your seal...?

600
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,723
Oh, sorry.

601
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,731
Let’s see...
Where do ! keep it?

602
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,435
It's in the back
of the second drawer.

603
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,586
Oh, goodness...

604
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,086
Always a pleasure.

605
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:58,461
Thank you.

606
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,455
I delivered Nonoko's lunch.

607
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:08,769
Why mother, I thought
you were going shopping.

608
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,960
Oops. I forgot.

609
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,595
Too much ginger...!

610
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,080
Regret

611
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:37,636
Say...

612
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,302
s it Mahler...

613
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:49,776
I didn’t know she was
a classical music fan...

614
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:12,323
Artis Brief Life is Long

615
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,998
They're in full bloom.

616
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:28,525
I wonder how many more times
l'Il see the cherry blossoms.

617
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,070
Don't be silly, mother.
You're only 70.

618
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,822
Maybe 30 more...

619
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:52,864
Mom, will you go pay the taxes?

620
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:54,377
Leave it to me.

621
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,800
You hand it to the
clerk, got that?

622
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,888
I know. Don't treat
me like a child.

623
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,617
Oh, dear, what a terrible calamity...

624
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,209
I'm really going senile.

625
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,785
Nice to see you.

626
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,074
Take care, bye.

627
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,747
[put it in the mail box!

628
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:36,646
Why, Shige...
Thanks for coming to visit.

629
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:40,494
Well. l heard you were
suddenly hospitalized.

630
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,801
You'll never believe it...

631
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:46,127
Have a seat.

632
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,525
You see...

633
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:56,659
Yes.

634
00:54:58,362 --> 00:54:59,292
Look.

635
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:03,174
See the guy visiting
that patient over there?

636
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:07,041
I'm sure they're having an affair.

637
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:08,770
What!

638
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,372
Are you...?

639
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:18,064
They definitely look
suspicious to me!

640
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,959
Suspicious, right?

641
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:30,546
This is a special room.

642
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:34,810
That notorious city councilman
accused of corruption is in there now.

643
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:43,016
l occasionally come up here
for a breath of fresh air.

644
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,267
These noodles are
pretty good, right?

645
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:55,635
They are.

646
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:04,600
But the coffee's really
lousy here.

647
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:10,616
By the way, why are
you in the hospital?

648
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,511
Oh, Shige...!

649
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:30,513
No sign of death's approach
in the ciccada’s voices - Basho

650
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,570
Why, mother.

651
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,631
Turn on the light.

652
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,009
Oh, I hadn't
noticed it getting dark.

653
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,848
Noberut!
Turn off your light.

654
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:03,556
I'm not asleep!

655
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,533
Age Comes More
Easily Than Wisdom

656
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,237
Five problems left.
I'm so sleepy.

657
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,563
A hot bath will wake you up.

658
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,002
In you go.

659
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,580
Feel better?

660
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,611
Yup! I'm wide awake.

661
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,919
OK. here goes!

662
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,877
Here goes, here goes...

663
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,671
Here...goes...

664
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:13,246
You're as limp as a noodle.

665
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,147
Don't give up.

666
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:21,874
In a fire, the first 5 minutes count.
In a test, it's the last 5 minutes.

667
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,240
Time's up. Turn in your papers.

668
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:38,864
Ma'm!

669
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:42,473
Tanaka felt sick and had to
go to the nurse's office!

670
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,280
Yes...

671
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,521
We deserve make-up time!

672
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:48,781
Forget it.

673
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,638
Put them in
the upstairs closet?

674
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:57,794
Sure.

675
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:28,573
Noboru's studying
like a demon.

676
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,760
But the exams are over.

677
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,820
He did miserably.

678
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:49,337
About Noboru'’s tutor.

679
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:51,497
He really needs one?

680
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,821
He's my son, after all.

681
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,387
You've got a point.

682
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:02,035
But isn't it expensive?

683
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:06,239
$300 for 2 sessions
with a university student.

684
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,093
What!

685
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,096
For $300, I'll teach him.

686
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:13,845
I'l teach him for $200.

687
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,785
Pay me $100 and
I'll work harder!

688
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:24,151
This is getting us nowhere...

689
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:36,737
Fleeting dreams An octopus making
its home in a trap A summer moon- Basho

690
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:45,930
I'm homet

691
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,553
Look, chocolates!

692
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,490
Mommy!
Noboru bought chocolates!

693
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:04,669
They were a Valentine's Day present!

694
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,979
Adolescence

695
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:09,625
Gone!

696
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,700
Gone, gone, gone!

697
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,082
I'm homet

698
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,607
Where are those
cookies. Nonoko!

699
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:17,970
late them.

700
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:21,238
What! got them for a girl!

701
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:22,795
But...

702
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,386
No ifs ands or buts!

703
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,401
Mommy already ate half.

704
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,161
Mother...?

705
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,509
Damn... forgot my umbrella.

706
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,366
Hey, Yamada!

707
01:01:45,502 --> 01:01:46,812
Use my umbrella.

708
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,390
How ‘bout you?

709
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:49,718
'Il be fine.

710
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:54,495
Say, Tanaka,
1 forgot my umbrella!

711
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:57,849
Too bad. Don't catch cold.

712
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:08,247
Rejected.

713
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,950
No!

714
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:13,963
Give it back!

715
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:15,127
Not after that.

716
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:16,354
But it's mine.

717
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,470
Thanks for the favor.

718
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:18,691
Give it back!

719
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:20,926
Guess it's a rain date.

720
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,312
Hey, Nakamura.

721
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:29,321
Back to sock the teacher?

722
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:33,093
Don't be stupid. came to tell
him I got into college.

723
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,757
Wow, you made it!

724
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:42,892
Sir...?

725
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,176
No need to run...

726
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:45,683
from Nakamura.

727
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,359
Idiot! Don't believe the rumors.

728
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:52,214
Hey, Yamada. Yamashita,

729
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,713
let's buy some dirty books.

730
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:08,804
Hey!

731
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:10,549
Shoot!

732
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:13,832
What a coincidence.

733
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:21,598
Tragedy in Bosnia...!
You've got serious taste.

734
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:25,038
Well, Japan's part
of a bigger world.

735
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:29,104
Can I borrow it later?

736
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,662
A real tragedy...

737
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,200
I'm home.

738
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:41,767
Noboru,

739
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:44,586
the textbook?

740
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:45,644
This?

741
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:48,058
I gave you $10 for it.

742
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:49,790
] want to see it.

743
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:09,117
*F-1 Racing for Students’

744
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:10,812
What is this!

745
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,615
‘Formula-1 Racing for Students’?

746
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:17,981
It'll help my
English and my geography.

747
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,076
You idiot!

748
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:23,475
You're the one who gave me

749
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,983
‘The Power Ranger's ABC'
when I was 3!

750
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,101
Noboru, there's a
girl on the phone.

751
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,681
What!

752
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:40,469
Oh, hello...

753
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:42,904
Oh, yeah, it's me...

754
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:55,784
Go away!

755
01:04:58,962 --> 01:05:01,332
Oh, no, nothing.

756
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,620
Yeah, yeah, OK.

757
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,253
A girlfriend...with his looks?

758
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:13,659
A real girlfriend?

759
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,080
His face is red.

760
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:17,239
Yeah, OK.

761
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,424
Bye, then.

762
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:33,405
It's pounding away!

763
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,780
An irregular heartbeat?

764
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:36,111
Let's see.

765
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:48,787
Do you think he's upset?

766
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:51,538
You insulted him, mother.

767
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,911
This, from the paragon
of motherhood?

768
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:49,194
The scent of plums On a mountain path
Suddenly dawn - Basho

769
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,936
Yamada Family Chronictes

770
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:55,871
I'm home...

771
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,609
Welcome back.

772
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,860
An Autumn Night

773
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:09,871
I'm hungry.

774
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,245
Anything to eat?

775
01:07:13,997 --> 01:07:15,017
Coming right up.

776
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:24,716
Red bean cake or banana.

777
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:32,288
Who the hell would want
to come home to bean cakes

778
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,403
after working hard all day!

779
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:38,656
OK, a banana.

780
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:42,729
What a jerk!
Who wants a banana!

781
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:38,759
Turn towards me i'm fonely too
The autumn dusk - Basho

782
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:44,991
Mom's down with a cold.
We'll get take-out tonight.

783
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:46,127
Seaweed-rice special.

784
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:47,274
Me too!

785
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,596
I'l have the salmon-rice.

786
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:50,895
How ‘bout you, mother?

787
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:52,794
The combination special.

788
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,004
I'll go get it!

789
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:57,719
Not so fast!

790
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:03,874
Tempura-rice for me!

791
01:10:04,267 --> 01:10:05,937
Going My Way

792
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,911
Croquet Tournament

793
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,032
That's good.

794
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:15,226
Hey, hey, lady...

795
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:18,576
You can't do that!

796
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,485
What? But this is...

797
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:26,192
It's empty now, but someone may
put a poster up. There's an election.

798
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,659
But, mister...

799
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,611
This was the only thing underneath.

800
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:44,074
If it isn’t old Saburo...

801
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:48,582
This is my territory.

802
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:51,452
Oh, it's you, Shige.

803
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:54,768
We might as well work together,
we're volunteers.

804
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:03,076
You're on that side, I'm on this.

805
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:06,294
Don't cross over.

806
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:10,543
Oh, boy, she hasn't changed
a bit in 60 years.

807
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,529
Oh, no, l forgot to
take out the garbage...

808
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,819
Oh. well, I'll have to sort it!

809
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:25,278
Why sort burnables?

810
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:28,526
Trash can at the station,

811
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:31,510
Nonoko does the park,
Noboru does the store.

812
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:33,708
You can't do that!

813
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,146
Why not? It's a great plan.

814
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:37,373
Off we go.

815
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,900
See you later.

816
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:41,897
Ouch!

817
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:46,101
Here I volunteer cleaning up
the park and you dump trash there!

818
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:49,576
I'm not dumping, just
using the public trash cans.

819
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:51,703
That's the problem!

820
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:53,758
Mom...

821
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:10,508
The Fight for Justice

822
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:12,374
Excuse us!

823
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:17,144
Our ball fell in..

824
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:25,924
This new one
or this rubber ball?

825
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:29,854
The rubber ball!

826
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:43,413
Honesty's the best policy.
Don't ever lie.

827
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:45,444
OK.

828
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:47,692
Take this one too.

829
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:50,205
Wow! Thanks!

830
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:01,111
Excuse me...
Our ball fell in yesterday...

831
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:02,811
But you weren't here.

832
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:05,249
Didn't see any.

833
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,689
I see...

834
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,641
I'm sure this was the house.

835
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:21,633
l beg you, please tell those boys
to give him his new ball back.

836
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,771
Oh, poor things.

837
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,510
You're right,
they're all wilted.

838
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,068
Not the flowers! The accident!

839
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:39,878
Oh. I see.

840
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,526
It was a motor cycle gang.

841
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,636
The poor guard rail.

842
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,019
Mother!

843
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,887
It was the poor child's
parents who suffered...

844
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:28,871
They're so loud, has to be
a motorcycle gang.

845
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:30,968
They're by the park.

846
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:34,124
They're the litterbugs!

847
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:35,769
Il go scold them.

848
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:37,617
That's dangerous, mother!

849
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,309
Someone was recently
murdered for that.

850
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:42,493
Senior Citizen Murdered

851
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:44,989
Hmm, l know.

852
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,510
That's worse!

853
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:06,683
Mm...mother!
Why the get up?

854
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,766
Says she's scolding
the motorcycle gang.

855
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:12,166
Won't you stop her. please.

856
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:18,229
You can't wear that hard-hat. It's a
momento from when we built the house.

857
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:22,075
Oh. Well that’s too bad.

858
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,231
I'm sorry, but you can't.

859
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,008
In that case,

860
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,366
you wear it and go.

861
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:31,135
l gol?

862
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:36,258
They're not vicious.
They'll go home eventually.

863
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,463
Then you have nothing to fear.

864
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:43,032
Give them a manly scolding.
You're older.

865
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:44,876
Manly...?

866
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,657
But mother...

867
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:49,056
I know, let's report them to 911.

868
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:53,315
The poor kids. They don't deserve
a criminal record for making noise.

869
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,230
A record!

870
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,634
See, they're gone.

871
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,104
You think?

872
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:27,625
What did I tell you?

873
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:32,523
We're relying on you.

874
01:16:36,492 --> 01:16:38,452
All right, I'll just go look.

875
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:43,307
Be careful, dear!

876
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,520
Um, excuse me...

877
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,446
What do you want?

878
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:38,148
It's awfully late.

879
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:39,991
Yeah? So what?

880
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:44,855
Got a problem?

881
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,471
N, no, we can work this out.
I don’t have a problem...

882
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:53,715
I don't have a problem,
but I do have a request.

883
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:55,440
Spit it out.

884
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:58,952
Ask away, old man.

885
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,474
Would you mind
turning off your headlight.

886
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,475
So that's your request. then?

887
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:07,672
Um, n, no.

888
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,633
Whaddya want then?

889
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:19,687
Come, come fireflies, this water's
bitter, this water's sweet

890
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:21,542
What is that!

891
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:34,735
That old bag's nuts.

892
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:37,001
Mother. are you all right!?

893
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,349
An old bag, huh’?

894
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:46,415
At least turn down that putt-putt.
You're a neighborhood nuisance.

895
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:49,202
M, mother, you can’t
talk to these low-lifes.

896
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,142
Who you calling low-life!

897
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,650
How exciting!

898
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:56,373
What a great voice, you have.

899
01:18:56,799 --> 01:18:58,059
Mother!

900
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,620
And a fine face and
physique to go with it.

901
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:04,951
I bet people shut up
when you talk.

902
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:06,604
Get to the point!

903
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:11,066
Really scary. You sure shut
this guy up in a hurry.

904
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,470
A cinch.

905
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:17,370
When you yell at people, it reminds me
of a snake staring down a frog.

906
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:25,119
It sure must be fun shutting people
up and ordering them around.

907
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:26,668
It's OK.

908
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:31,842
I know, why don't you employ
your venom in the cause of justice?

909
01:19:33,035 --> 01:19:33,905
What?

910
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:37,796
Don't you like fighting
for justice, that Masked Rider stuff?

911
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:41,332
Way old, granny.

912
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,299
Of course, it’s not exactly
cool, is it? Nowadays,

913
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:49,170
we turn a blind eye to
every kind of misdeed.

914
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:53,148
But ! know you could do it.
Because you're fearless.

915
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:58,884
Someone tosses a cigarette butt
or can from their car,

916
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,711
you use that voice of yours,
make ‘em pick it up.

917
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:07,335
You see a kid causing trouble
on the subway,

918
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:10,360
you gently tap him
on the shoulder.

919
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:14,407
I'm sure anyone will do
whatever you Say.

920
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:19,333
We'll all be so happy.
we'll cheer you on.

921
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:26,361
It's nice to be appreciated.

922
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:29,446
While you're at it, scare off thugs,

923
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:33,288
and take the bad guys’ money.

924
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:39,480
What do you say, will you heed an
old bag's plea and fight for justice?

925
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:44,365
It'll be a whole lot better than
listening to me rant and rave.

926
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:49,362
I think this old lady's nuts.

927
01:20:50,646 --> 01:20:52,166
No go?

928
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:56,773
What a shame,
with your godly attributes.

929
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:01,326
Outta here!

930
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:11,288
Think about fighting for justice!

931
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:18,539
Hey, you forgot this.

932
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:31,989
Did he get it?

933
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:33,834
Mother!

934
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,900
Noboru! Nonoko!

935
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,123
Mother!

936
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,879
It's the Masked Rider!

937
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:32,212
The Masked Rider!

938
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,117
Help...

939
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:29,396
Mother!

940
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:31,428
Noboru!

941
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,751
Nonoko...

942
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,982
Thank you, Masked Rider!

How crue! A grasshopper trapped
Under a warrior’s helmet - Basho

944
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:53,908
I'm home.

945
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:56,209
Did you bring your
umbrella home?

946
01:25:57,386 --> 01:26:00,786
Your husband's home
from work, exhausted, and

947
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:05,076
all you can ask is ‘did you
bring your umbrella home!"

948
01:26:05,694 --> 01:26:08,124
OK. OK. Welcome home.
a
Have a hard day?

949
01:26:09,031 --> 01:26:10,321
Where's your umbrella?

950
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,599
forgot it.

951
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:19,563
Welcome home.

952
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:24,058
Look, l remembered to
bring it home, so there, ha!

953
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,360
What? Got a problem?

954
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:36,201
But you didn't take
an umbrella today.

955
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,550
See?

956
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,546
Section Chief Yamada

957
01:26:43,065 --> 01:26:44,235
I bought a cake.

958
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:45,369
Really?

959
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:49,108
Once in a blue moon...

960
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,375
Guilty conscience?

961
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:53,414
What was that!

962
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:57,268
That's going too far.
Here Takashi’s thoughtfully gone and...

963
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,279
leven bought custard.

964
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,303
Now that’s suspicious.

965
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:12,035
Nonoko! Noboru!
Your father got cake!

966
01:27:19,668 --> 01:27:20,748
Where's Dad?

967
01:27:21,103 --> 01:27:22,773
On a business trip.

968
01:27:23,672 --> 01:27:24,932
But his briefcase...

969
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:29,117
Oh no, he must've forgotten it.

970
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,101
And his scarf and train pass.

971
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:33,941
What? Oh, no!

972
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:37,226
He was supposed to leave early.

973
01:27:37,686 --> 01:27:38,946
Father!

974
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:41,729
Dear!

975
01:27:47,963 --> 01:27:48,813
Section Chief Yamada

976
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:50,928
Mom must've overslept.

977
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:55,944
She woke up late and
thought Dad had already left.

978
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:57,911
Oh. I see.

979
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,741
B...b...briefcase!

980
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,880
H...h...here!

981
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:11,606
I'm off!

982
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:13,717
Have a nice trip!

983
01:28:17,926 --> 01:28:19,706
Be careful!

984
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,289
(can still make it.

985
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:54,765
Are you OK?

986
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:08,295
Phone, phone...

987
01:29:19,421 --> 01:29:21,501
] suddenly feel terrible...

988
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:27,353
l can hardly breathe...

989
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:30,559
Yes, yes. I'll get there.

990
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,599
ll crawl there if l have to...

991
01:29:34,336 --> 01:29:35,826
Please tell the client...

992
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:39,458
Yes, yes, I'm terribly sorry...

993
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:46,116
A slight fever.

994
01:29:47,349 --> 01:29:48,489
You should stay home.

995
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,665
Before it gets worse.

996
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,480
The company won't take care of you.

997
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:59,932
You know, maybe I will.
Make a long weekend of it.

998
01:30:00,462 --> 01:30:02,392
You should, you should.

999
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:05,864
It's good to relax and
enjoy some time at home.

1000
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,257
..What is it?

1001
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:30,071
I started feeling better,
the minute I decided to stay home.

1002
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:33,276
I guess I'll go in after all.

1003
01:30:47,676 --> 01:30:49,136
Take care, dear.

1004
01:31:57,078 --> 01:32:00,148
Next, Mr. Yamada will
offer his congratulations.

1005
01:32:01,149 --> 01:32:03,319
Your notes, dear.

1006
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:11,824
He's wound tight as a spring!

1007
01:32:19,801 --> 01:32:24,401
Um...
This is a fine, auspicious day...

1008
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:32,547
Cucumber, garbage bags, light bulbs

1009
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:48,501
Life is full of surprises...

1010
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:57,039
Now...that is, up until now...

1011
01:32:58,106 --> 01:33:00,566
things seemed to be just fine...

1012
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:05,032
then suddenly,
you're shoved off a cliff!

1013
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,240
By...your trusted spouse,

1014
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,547
of all people!

1015
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:14,247
He means you.

1016
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:19,221
But Ichiro and Kazuko...

1017
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:23,804
You have to accept life
as it comes.

1018
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:30,038
Acceptance is the key to surviving

1019
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:35,522
the worst situations, without
losing heart or breaking up.

1020
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,251
Breaking up?!

1021
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:42,327
Even the worst behavior...

1022
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:47,478
can be accepted and forgiven
if there is no malice.

1023
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:50,849
In fact, must be forgiven
so one can go on with life!

1024
01:33:51,693 --> 01:33:53,473
Gutsy speech!

1025
01:33:54,162 --> 01:33:58,822
It's not necessarily bad to
resign yourself to a situation.

1026
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,687
In fact, it’s essential.

1027
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,733
A must for a happy family.

1028
01:34:05,173 --> 01:34:07,983
A must for facing life and
getting on with it.

1029
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:13,395
Though it may sound negative.

1030
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:17,102
‘acceptance’

1031
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:21,815
is the only way out of totally
unacceptable situations.

1032
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:29,259
I didn't know he had it in him...
What a man.

1033
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:41,025
Um, well, that is, l mean.

1034
01:34:45,547 --> 01:34:48,267
So, my dear Ichiro and Kazuko,

1035
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:51,613
congratulations on your wedding.

1036
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:58,760
May you be a tough,
harmonious couple.

1037
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:17,205
When f grew up and fell in love
l asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead?

1038
01:35:19,514 --> 01:35:25,464
Will we have rainbows day after day?
Here's what my sweetheart said

1039
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:32,737
Que sera sera,
whatever will be, wilf be

1040
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:43,622
the future's not ours to see
que séra sera, Que sera sera

1041
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:50,282
A skinhead cut would
disguise your baldness.

1042
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,010
Who asked you!

1043
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:55,868
Don't you need dentures, mother?

1044
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:56,981
Who asked you!

1045
01:35:57,185 --> 01:35:59,145
Cut it out! Both of you!

1046
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,540
You're starting to look
like a sumo wrestler.

1047
01:36:03,057 --> 01:36:03,637
You tell her!

1048
01:36:03,825 --> 01:36:04,785
How dare you!

1049
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:10,968
You're setting a terrible example!
In front of the children.

1050
01:36:11,633 --> 01:36:14,003
I can't hear the TV!

1051
01:36:17,972 --> 01:36:20,142
I know why we're so peaceful.

1052
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:24,469
Because all three of you are nuts.

1053
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:25,753
How dare you!

1054
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,280
How dare you!

1055
01:36:28,316 --> 01:36:30,686
If even one of you were normal,

1056
01:36:31,686 --> 01:36:33,385
it'd throw off the balance.

1057
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,120
What's your motto?

1058
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:55,465
Getting married?

1059
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:56,790
Change jobs?

1060
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:00,009
Be quiet...

1061
01:37:06,754 --> 01:37:07,834
This.

1062
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:13,554
DON'T OVERDO IT

1063
01:38:27,702 --> 01:38:29,982
Hey, everybody’s in the picture!

1064
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:31,514
Let's see.

1065
01:38:31,773 --> 01:38:32,883
Everyone’s so tiny.

1066
01:38:33,141 --> 01:38:34,431
It's a stick-on picture.

1067
01:38:37,512 --> 01:38:39,352
Time to get some dinner...

1068
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:40,644
