00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,494
Pirates!

3
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,239
It's a raid!

4
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,549
Hold them off!
Get down on the floor.

5
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,309
It's tear gas!

6
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,252
What are you waiting for!
Break it down!

7
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,757
Where'd she go?

8
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,263
She's hera!

9
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,569
She's hiding out here.

10
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,622
Well, get her!

11
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,952
Mama, I'm falling!

12
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,915
There's the stone.
Quick, go next door!

13
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,455
The crystal.

14
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,956
There goes the crystal.

21
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,732
Two meatballs, please.

22
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,804
Working late?

23
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,169
We're finally busy again.

24
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,308
Still working?

25
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,838
What's that?

26
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:51,947
A person!

27
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,036
Pazu!

28
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,654
What are you up to?
Where's my dinner?

29
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,041
Boss!

30
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,839
A girl fell from the sky.

31
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,741
Boss, she fell from the sky.

32
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,900
Darn old clunker.

33
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,376
Boss! A girl...

34
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,484
Close the second valve!

35
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,468
Ouch!
Pazu, toss me a wrench.

36
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,210
l can't let go. You do it.

37
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,762
Don't make them wait.

38
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,680
Keep a steady hand.

39
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,516
Brake!

40
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,000
Any luck?

41
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,341
No silver, no tin even.

42
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,781
All that wasted work.

43
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,353
Should try the east vein.

44
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,123
That's riddled with old holes.

45
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,208
Have to start over.

46
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,354
Time to go home...

47
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,072
Shut down the boiler.
Call it a day.

48
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,165
I'll go under at this rate.

49
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,688
Oil the clunker, Pazu.

50
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,407
Mama, I can't see a thing.
It's too dark.

51
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,641
l hope you really looked!

52
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,967
All right. We'll wait for daylight.

53
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,090
Hi. How are you feeling?
Hold on there...

54
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,321
I'm Pazu. I live by myself.

55
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,138
They eat after I play.

56
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,140
So you are human after all.

57
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,343
l was afraid you were an angel.

58
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,723
Thanks for helping me.
I'm Sheeta.

59
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,451
Sheeta. nice name. You fell
from the sky. A bit scary.

60
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,826
That's right. Why am I still alive?

61
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,640
I fell from the airship...

62
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,313
Don't you remember?

63
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,688
Say, can see that?

64
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:11,887
This?

65
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,062
It's been in my family forever.

66
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,896
It's beautiful...
Wait...

67
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:34,876
Watch this!

68
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,777
So it wasn't the stone after all.

69
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:23,959
Oh, no! Pazu!

70
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,629
Are you OK?

71
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,880
Yeah. Are you?

72
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,968
I'm fine. Sorry, did it hurt?

73
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,320
No, my head's harder
than my boss's fists.

74
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,843
The pot's still boiling.

75
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,726
Hungry? Let's eat.

76
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,604
Wash up over there.

77
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,642
There's a towel.

78
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,813
Thank you.

79
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,733
Laputa...

80
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,585
Sheeta!
Where are you?

81
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,541
My father took that picture.

82
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,603
Laputa, an island in the sky.

83
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,834
An island in the sky...?

84
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,878
They say it's only a myth...

85
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,714
But my father saw it...

86
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,680
That's when he took it.

87
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,987
There's a Laputa in Gulliver's
Travels. but Swift made it up.

88
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,146
Dad drew this.

89
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,081
He said the abandoned palace
was full of treasure.

90
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,696
But nobody believed him.

91
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,601
Until he died, they called him a liar.

92
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,453
But my father never lied.

93
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:54,263
I'm building a real plane.
I'm going to find Laputa...

94
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,931
A real automobile...

95
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,781
They're pirates!

96
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,703
They attacked the airship.

97
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,293
Are they after you?

98
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:16,965
Quick !

99
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,406
Morning!

100
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,810
Hey, wait!

101
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,169
We're in a rush.

102
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,574
Have you seen a girl?

103
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,414
Sure. yesterday...
The boss's kid, Madge...

104
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:36,895
Go away!

105
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,116
They're looking for you.

106
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,052
Louis, a girl's dress!

107
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,494
What! She was disguised!
Tell mama!

108
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,802
No, I haven't.

109
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,060
A cute little girl
...brown hair, braids...

110
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,242
Boss!

111
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,782
About that age.

112
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,692
That's her!

113
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,964
They're pirates, chasing her!

114
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,690
Pirates! Lemme see!

115
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,304
Not one step closer.

116
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,094
Hand her over.

117
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,036
Dola's clan.

118
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,643
Go home. Just poor folk here.

119
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:39,915
Ma'am?

120
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,106
Scoot out the back.

121
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,367
] want to fight.

122
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,595
They've got weapons!

123
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,149
What a nice girl. Protect her.

124
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,618
You refuse to step aside?

125
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,566
Use your fists.

126
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,235
Could be interesting.

127
00:19:58,831 --> 00:19:59,971
Get him, brother.

128
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,364
Show your stuff.

129
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,259
Wow...

130
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,823
Who's going to mend that shirt?

131
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,940
You can beat him!

132
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,852
Go! Go!

133
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,393
Think you can fool me?
After them!

134
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,197
Climb on!

135
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,770
There you go.

136
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,736
Playing hooky for a date?

137
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,505
Bad guys after us...

138
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,179
The Dola clan.

139
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,781
Pirates?

140
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,688
Take us to the next town.
The police!

141
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,005
You're on. Stoke the fire.

142
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,026
Mama!

143
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,158
You idiots! Hurry up and get on!

144
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,711
What? But the girl's...

145
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,843
She slipped out the back door.

146
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,159
Get moving!

147
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:19,968
Brother!

148
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:21,946
Wait!

149
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,417
They're catching up, more steam!

150
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,644
Can't you go any faster?

151
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,926
She's an old-timer.

152
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,508
Move over!

153
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,835
Mama, I'm falling!

154
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,262
More steam!

155
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,451
Here we go!

156
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,463
Sheeta, over here.

157
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,860
Stoke the fire.

158
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,812
Don't give up!

159
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,217
Push! Push, ! tell you!

160
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,391
Not so fast!

161
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:23,015
Don't let them escape!
Dump this over the side!

162
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,146
Go, go, go!

163
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,270
I'll do it.

164
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,701
No, let me.

165
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,146
Wait!

166
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,545
It's them... what'll we do?

167
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,020
l refuse to give up. Move!

168
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,167
This is a surprise. If it isn't the army.

169
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:16,040
These kids need help!
They've got pirates after them.

170
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:28,362
Sheeta?

171
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,325
Good bye.

172
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:31,832
Wait!

173
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,010
Sheeta!

174
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,245
Halt or I'll shoot.

175
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,370
An armored train.

176
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,041
Who cares! Smash it!

177
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,495
What is it, Sheeta!

178
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,311
Stay away!

179
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:35,787
They're gonna fall!

180
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,218
Quiet. Watch closely.

181
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,352
We're floating!

182
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,886
Look! It's that crystal!

183
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,407
It was the stone after all!
Amazing!

184
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,230
We'll float all the way down.

185
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,003
Amazing! 1 want it!

186
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,505
Shoot!

187
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,701
lI have to get that amazing stone!

188
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,430
It's fading...

189
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,744
Hey, wait!

190
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,804
Just like when you landed.

191
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,379
The opening looks so tiny.

192
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,679
I hope the Boss and the engineer
aren't in any trouble.

193
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,066
Aw, don’t worry.
Miners aren't exactly wimps.

194
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,399
Let's find the way out.

195
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,254
These mines are ancient.
Tunnels everywhere.

196
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,286
I'm so happy. I was starving.

197
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,796
I've still got an apple and some candy.

198
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:22,464
It's like you have a magical bag
that holds everything.

199
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,932
Gondoa? That's so far north.

200
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,252
Yes. Both my parents died,
but they left me

201
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:47,349
the house and the fields.
sol was getting by alone...

202
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,529
The guys with dark glasses
kidnapped you.

203
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,908
That guy was one of them?

204
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,925
Who can they be,
calling in the army?

205
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,316
The Dolas and the other guys.
all want the stone,

206
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,739
But I had no idea it
had mysterious powers.

207
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:34,258
It was always in our family.
Mother left it to me when she died.

208
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:38,217
She warned me never to show it
or give it to anyone.

209
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,930
We're both orphans, aren't we?

210
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,439
I'm sorry I dragged
you into all of this.

211
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,139
When you fell from the sky
my heart was racing.

212
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,890
I knew something
wonderful had begun.

213
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,950
Little demons... little demons.

214
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,939
Uncle Pom! He's really great.

215
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,243
Uncle Pom.

216
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,065
We've lost our way.

217
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,573
Now that little demon
sure looks like Pazu...

218
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,291
with a little girl demon beside him.

219
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,632
Pirates are after us.

220
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,215
And the army,

221
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,728
How very extraordinary...

222
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,475
Drink up.

223
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:49,677
Thank you.

224
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,156
Have you always lived underground?

225
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,710
Why no, no. The rocks have
been astir...

226
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,198
That's when I like to be down here.

227
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,825
The rocks astir...?

228
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,945
Rocks speak very softly...

229
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,225
Wonderful...

230
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,633
Look up.

231
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,847
They were ordinary rocks until...

232
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:12,523
How pretty...

233
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,217
Here, let me show you...

234
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,283
It's gone.

235
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,729
These rocks contain Volucite.

236
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,356
Volucite?

237
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,143
As soon as it's exposed to the air,
it becomes ordinary stone.

238
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,477
It's glowing...

239
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:51,836
Oh. my gracious!
That's a Volucite crystal, my dear.

240
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,618
I've never seen one before.

241
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,883
That's why the rocks were stirring.

242
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,659
This stone has mysterious powers.

243
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:10,077
] thought only Laputans knew
how to make Volucite crystals.

244
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,381
Laputans...

245
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:16,154
They used Volucite to send
a magnificent island aloft...

246
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,458
Laputa did exist, Sheeta!
It really did!

247
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,056
Does the island still exist?

248
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,291
Uncle Pom?

249
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:32,326
Dear. would you mind covering the
stone? Its power overwhelms me.

250
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,034
What's wrong...

251
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,542
My grandfather told me...

252
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:55,402
the rocks shift when
Laputa floats overhead.

253
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:59,317
If you went up to the sky then,
you'd find Laputa!

254
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,185
My father was telling the truth!

255
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,538
Young lady...

256
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,808
Your stone is most powerful...

257
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:17,448
know it as one who has
spoken to rocks all my life.

258
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:24,417
A stone so powerful brings happiness,
but it can also bring misery.

259
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,158
What's more,
your stone is the work of men.

260
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,186
I just thought I should...

261
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,026
It's not true!

262
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,114
That stone's already
saved Sheeta twice!

263
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,905
Amazing! Laputa really does exist!

264
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,439
It's gone.

265
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,415
Let's go back to the ship.

266
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:59,247
When it’s this quiet,
it's best to stay put.

267
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,063
I'm hungry...

268
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,710
It's all clear, Let's go.

269
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,069
Thank you, grandpa.

270
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,797
Look after yourselves.

271
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,712
Look at those clouds!

272
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:52,553
Beyond those clouds is an island
we've only dreamed of.

273
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,300
Here I come! I know
I'm going to find Laputa!

274
00:36:58,817 --> 00:36:59,687
Pazu...

275
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,551
I haven't told you everything.

276
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,536
My family had a mysterious
ancient name which came

277
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,007
with this stone.

278
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:16,651
My name is Lucita.
Lucita Toelle Ur....

279
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:18,669
Laputa...

280
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:19,839
Laputa...

281
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:21,932
So you mean...

282
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,163
It's the army! Run!

283
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,787
Underground!

284
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:37,508
Don't move!

285
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,086
How dare you!

286
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,922
Pazu!
Let me go!

287
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,793
Pazu! Pazu!

288
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:51,415
We've apprehended them.

289
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,640
So much trouble.

290
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,262
Open up, open up!

291
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,848
Sheeta...

292
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,795
Company, fall in!

293
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,388
Shape up!

294
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:18,033
Squeeze the brat!
... she'll talk!

295
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,797
Spoken like a man in uniform.

296
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,959
In your haste,
you risk everything.

297
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:29,395
If we'd mobilized the army sooner,
Dola wouldn't have had a chance.

298
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,499
She managed to decipher
your third-rate code.

299
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,008
How dare you!

300
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,350
My organization will handle this.

301
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,170
You concentrate on mobilizing
the troops when the time is ripe.

302
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,929
Muska! Remember, I command
the search for Laputa!

303
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:53,297
Of course. But ! have my
orders from the government.

304
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,501
That pencil-pushing upstart!

305
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:18,272
Have a nice rest?

306
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,193
Where's Pazu? Let me see him!

307
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,046
No interest in pretty clothes?

308
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:27,904
Don't fret about Pazu. His
stubborn head is harder than mine.

309
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:31,657
Come, I have something
to show you.

310
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:47,845
Enter.

311
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:07,901
What is it...

312
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,656
A mechanical soldier with vast
destructive power.

313
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:16,413
Had he not fallen from the sky.
no one would have believed in Laputa.

314
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,435
He's not of this earth.

315
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,628
Our science can't even identify

316
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,825
what material he's made of.

317
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,595
Look...
Don't be afraid.

318
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,781
He's long dead.

319
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,850
Look at that.

320
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,891
This insignia was carved on
your fireplace.

321
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,381
It's on this stone, too.

322
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,354
The stone works
only in your hands.

323
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,790
It will protect you and
guide you back to Laputa.

324
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,023
I know nothing of this!

325
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:28,716
Take it if you like.
Just leave us alone...

326
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:37,533
You imagine Laputa’s
like Treasure Island...

327
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,999
Fearsome powers
thrust Laputa into orbit.

328
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,340
Their dreaded empire
once ruled the earth!

329
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,799
Even you can appreciate
that when such an entity

330
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,659
roams the skies.
it threatens Peace.

331
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,517
l need your cooperation.

332
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,962
You must know how to make
the stone guide us to Laputa.

333
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,468
l really don't know!
Please let me see Pazu!

334
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:14,205
l intend no harm,
but his fate rests with you.

335
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:22,608
The boy goes free
if you assist us, Lucita...

336
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,508
... Toella Ur Laputa.

337
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:28,425
But how...

338
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,863
Ur means ruler in Laputan,
Toelle means True,

339
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,117
Queen Lucita. rightful heir
to the Laputan throne.

340
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:57,471
Out!

341
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,641
Sheeta.

342
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:03,462
Pazu, are you hurt?

343
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,371
I'm fine. You? Did they
do anything horrible?

344
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,688
My dear Pazu. we misjudged you.
Accept our apologies.

345
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,815
We didn't know how gallantly

346
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,788
you protected her from the pirates.

347
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:17,424
Sheeta, what did you...

348
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:21,136
Pazu, I beg you,
forget about Laputa.

349
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:23,763
What!

350
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:28,668
Sheeta will aid us in our
search for Laputa.

351
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,419
l understand how you feel,
but forget about her.

352
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,593
Is this true, Sheeta? But we...

353
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,239
I'm sorry for all the trouble...

354
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,392
I'll never forget you.

355
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:41,477
l can't believe it...

356
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:43,713
Sheeta, we swore!

357
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,218
Good bye.

358
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,239
Sheeta!

359
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:47,934
Wait. Sheeta!

360
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,086
Be reasonable. Act like a man.

361
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:52,842
Sheeta!

362
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:04,612
Here's a token of our gratitude.
It's yours.

363
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:45,947
Only you can recall the words
that will waken this stone...

364
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:50,242
If you keep your promise.
you, too, shall be free...

365
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:57,781
Pazu...

366
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,452
Mama. it's Pazu! He's back!

367
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:24,917
Pazu.

368
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,967
We were so worried.
You just disappeared.

369
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,339
And the girl?

370
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,580
Forget it.

371
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,930
Pazu!

372
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,015
Let me go!
What are you doing!

373
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,718
Put a lid on it!

374
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:18,197
Nice place you got, kid.

375
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:19,729
Get out!

376
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,052
This is my house!

377
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:26,342
Oh, come off it.

378
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:29,144
Can't even protect a little girl...

379
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,324
He's got gold!

380
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,489
Sold her for money, huh.

381
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:36,589
No! I wouldn't do that!

382
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,821
You let them pay you off...

383
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,805
Sheeta told me to...

384
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,065
So...

385
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:48,914
So you gave in and crawled home.

386
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,477
You call yourself a man!

387
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,553
You talk big.
but you're after Sheeta too.

388
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,350
But of course. we're pirates.
Pirates hunt for treasure.

389
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:05,416
They're the strange ones.
What's the girl to them?

390
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:13,494
You think she'll get out alive?

391
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,079
Sheeta told you to leave?

392
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:24,519
They threatened her.
so she tried to save you.

393
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,902
How do you know, mama?

394
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:29,915
50 years of being a woman.

395
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:33,801
She steels her heart
to save her man. How touching...

396
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,308
Reminds me of my youth...

397
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,381
You boys want to marry,
look for one like her.

398
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,665
So... that girl...
will grow up to be mama?

399
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,973
Don't even bother switching codes...

400
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,614
Calling the battle cruiser...?

401
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:14,435
They'll pack her up and take off.
Time is short.

402
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,089
Dinner's over. Move out.

403
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,711
Yes, mama.

404
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,765
Going after Sheeta?

405
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,177
l want the crystal, not the girl.

406
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:28,696
The stone's no good
without her.

407
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,850
Can't I go with you, Ma'am?

408
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:33,966
l have to help Sheeta!

409
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:37,702
Not so fast. Do it on
your own nickel.

410
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:42,036
You're right. if ! was clever
and strong, ! could’ ve defended her.

411
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,560
Please, ] don't care about treasure.

412
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:46,653
Listen to him...

413
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:47,754
Shut up!

414
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:58,443
But you could probably
help us with her.

415
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:02,234
Leave all this behind?

416
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:03,403
I know,

417
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:04,834
You sure?

418
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:05,971
Yup!

419
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:09,165
You've got 40 seconds.

420
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:19,826
Be well.

421
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,392
Tie this to your belt.
You boys wait on the ship.

422
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,754
A magnificent vessel.
Has the girl come through?

423
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:09,535
I need a littla more time.

424
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:13,194
Forget it! We'll squeeze
it out of her up there.

425
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,357
We depart at dawn, with the girl.

426
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:39,104
Hurry up, it's almost dawn!

427
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:46,306
Sheeta!

428
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,991
Whatever shall we do...

429
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,495
Sheeta. listen. I'm going
to teach you

430
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,524
a magic spell for trouble.

431
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:23,776
A magic spell?

432
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:26,997
Yes. These are old, old. old.
secret words.

433
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:41,458
They mean
help me rekindle the light.

434
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,409
Perfect.

435
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:31,270
Just as the ancient books described.
This is the sacred light.

436
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:32,779
Sacred light...?

437
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,606
What are the magic words?
Tell me.

438
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:04,814
It's moving!

439
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,707
The robot. it's alive!

440
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:13,712
Hello!

441
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:28,608
Help!

442
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,374
It's alive!
It's the robot!

443
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:45,218
The robot?

444
00:54:58,162 --> 00:54:59,031
It's coming this way.

445
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,304
Run!

446
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:14,823
Retreat! Retreat!

447
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:17,984
Incredible!

448
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:27,436
I see!

449
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,630
It's the light!

450
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,921
The sacred light broke his seal!

451
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:36,912
This is the way to Laputa! Come!

452
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,136
No!

453
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,192
He's going to fly!

454
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:54,303
It's pointing to the sky...

455
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:01,673
It's showing the way to Laputa.

456
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,116
Hurry!

457
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:07,718
Use explosives!
But don't blow up the ship!

458
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,100
Hello, hello, hello! What is this!

459
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,066
Good.

460
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:15,227
We're connected.

461
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,219
This is Colonel Muska.
The robot's cut our lines.

462
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:22,797
I've assumed emergency command.

463
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:25,587
It's after the girl on the tower.

464
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,942
Take it down on sight.

465
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:31,002
Prepare to fire.

466
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,830
Hurry!
Hurry up!

467
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,680
Fire!

468
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,819
Hurry!

469
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:24,436
We did it.

470
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,308
Get the girl.

471
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:31,743
Is she dead?

472
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:33,102
Get up!

473
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:37,116
She just fainted.

474
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:38,250
Stand!

475
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:40,676
It moved...

476
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,450
What's that! Must be a battle.

477
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:33,673
Let's go, Ma'am!

478
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,304
Captain, to you!

479
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,357
Lower, Charles.

480
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,362
Stop! Stop it!

481
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:05,855
Please!

482
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,358
Mama, Goliath's moving.

483
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:27,718
We're going directly into
the crossfire. Regroup!

484
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:29,687
Look, there's Sheeta!

485
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:33,456
Where?

486
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:36,507
Straight ahead. she's
on top of that tower!

487
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:48,312
This is a job for a woman!
Cover me.

488
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,417
Sheeta!

489
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,270
I'm coming, Sheeta!

490
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:07,942
Pazu!

491
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,656
Fly closer, lady!

492
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:16,739
Pazu!

493
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,665
Let me go!

494
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,690
Sheeta!

495
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:45,528
Ma'am!

496
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,010
Pazu.

497
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:03,796
Pazu!

498
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,381
Climb !

499
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:34,465
Last chance! Grab her on the fly!

500
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,589
Pazu!

501
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:38,991
Here goes!

502
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:42,711
Move!

503
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:43,716
Darn!

504
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:44,777
Sheeta!

505
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:52,968
What's Goliath up to!

506
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,609
A smoke screen...

507
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:16,408
Where's the robot!

508
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,700
Destroyed. The girl went that way.

509
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:19,899
What!

510
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,732
Put out the fire!
Organize a search party!

511
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,630
We haven't lost the sacred stone.

512
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,341
Its light points to Laputa..,.

513
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:55,225
Inform the General, we'll depart
for Laputa as planned.

514
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:34,823
How nice...

515
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:38,978
can't believe she'll
grow up to be just like mama...

516
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:47,574
There's your valley...
Back where we started.

517
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,073
Lady, please take us aboard.

518
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:56,972
Call me Captain! What use
are you without the crystal?

519
01:04:58,294 --> 01:04:59,223
We'll work.

520
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:02,156
I want to see Laputa
for myself.

521
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:13,029
Don't want any treasure, just
to see Laputa? Suspect motives

522
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,050
for boarding a pirate ship.

523
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:18,483
Are they coming with us, mama?

524
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,288
One false move and
you're shark bait!

525
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:25,322
Excellent! No more laundry
or cleaning duty!

526
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:27,252
Or dish washing!

527
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:28,986
Or potato peeling!

528
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:36,381
Can you make pudding?

529
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:37,569
Yas...

530
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:39,500
l like mincemeat pie.

531
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:43,323
leat, um, um... anything!

532
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,960
Enough out of you!
When will you boys ever grow up!

533
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:36,127
Get off!

534
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,333
Canvas. It's made of cloth.

535
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:43,899
And don't tear it.

536
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,341
Hurry up, it's crowded in here!

537
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:55,523
Hurry, this way!

538
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:57,889
l hate dawdlers.

539
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,187
You're with me!

540
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,319
Pazu!

541
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,061
I don't bite. Come.

542
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:06,067
You're not here for fun.

543
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:12,694
What an engine.

544
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,799
Now where'd he go?
Pops! Pops!

545
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:21,348
Got you an assistant.

546
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,792
Don't holler. 1 hear you.

547
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:31,959
He's tougher than mama. Be careful.

548
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:39,417
My hand doesn't fit.

549
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:42,641
This gasket?

550
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:43,589
Name?

551
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:44,523
Pazu.

552
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,220
The crystal pointed
nearly due east...

553
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:52,594
You sure about that?

554
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:57,816
l could see the sunrise from the tower.
It's the harvest season now,

555
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:02,031
so the sun rises just south
of due east.

556
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,195
The light pointed to the left
of the sun rose.

557
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:07,868
Good answer.
Any luck?

558
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,598
Not a peep.

559
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:13,204
Blocking their radio transmissions...

560
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,446
Mama, Goliath's faster than us.

561
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,960
We're upwind of them. If we get
a lift on the trade winds...

562
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,536
This is an Asian calculator.

563
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:27,839
Windspeed is 10... and...

564
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:30,685
I think it'll work.

565
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:34,903
OK. listen up!

566
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:40,278
Goliath's on its way to Laputa.
We're on their tail.

567
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,973
With these winds,
I expect contact tomorrow.

568
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:47,817
Ten gold pieces
to whoever spots her first!

569
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:49,228
Ten!

570
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:54,538
Whatever we find. I'm sure Laputa has
riches enough for any pirate gang!

571
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:57,934
Earn your keep, boys!

572
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,491
Course 98. speed 40.

573
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:50,667
You're useless in that get-up.

574
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:53,218
Wear these.

575
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,930
Your station.

576
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:10,876
Sweet...

577
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:21,293
You serve five meals a day.
Go easy on the water.

578
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,052
Get to work, you idiots!

579
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,849
Yes.

580
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,935
I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet.

581
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:34,992
I've never cooked on an airship...

582
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,400
What is it...

583
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:41,967
Sweet...

584
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:46,986
I thought I'd give you
a hand in my spare time.

585
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:50,937
Why thank you. Can you
put those dishes away?

586
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,077
Happy to obli...

587
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:58,736
You said your stomach hurt...

588
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:01,709
I've got some free time. Canl...

589
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:04,783
Move.

590
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:07,395
Some stomach ache, jerk!

591
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,123
Hey, can I help...

592
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:24,882
You've changed. chasing the likes
of Goliath... But it's pointless.

593
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,141
It's Laputan treasure l'm after.

594
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:32,406
They're certainly nice kids...

595
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,809
Get to the point, you crank.

596
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:39,104
They're too upright and honest
to aver respect you.

597
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:40,625
What's that!

598
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,227
No, ] mean... Check...

599
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:47,053
Good... good...

600
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:52,817
Seconds anyone?

601
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,716
Seconds! Seconds!
Seconds!

602
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,077
Hey. shake a leg.

603
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,135
It's your watch,

604
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:22,978
Take it, it's cold.

605
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,269
Watch?

606
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,610
Darn cold!
Go on up.

607
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:41,887
My turn.

608
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:43,081
Great.

609
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,302
Sheeta!

610
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:03,625
That was scary!

611
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,687
Beautiful.

612
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,174
Sheeta.
Get in.

613
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,750
Can't sleep?

614
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,406
Nice and warm...

615
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,538
Look out behind.

616
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:35,507
Pazu.

617
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,686
I'm really, really, scared.

618
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,183
l really don’t want to go to Laputa.

619
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,710
l hope we never find Goliath.

620
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,950
The light really did
point that way.

621
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:55,259
About the robot?

622
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:58,903
Poor thing.

623
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:04,463
I never dreamed that
little spell could...

624
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:09,395
I learned lots of other spells.

625
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:14,379
To help find things. cure the sick.
And one must never, ever use.

626
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,567
Never, ever use...?

627
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,079
A spell of destruction.

628
01:15:18,748 --> 01:15:24,107
I had to learn bad ones so the
good spells had power, But not to use...

629
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,761
l was so scared, I couldn't sleep...

630
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:31,702
That stone should be locked away.

631
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:36,955
They hid it in the fireplace.
Only wore it for weddings.

632
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,140
My mother's and grandmother's and
great. great grandmother's.

633
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:45,943
l should have thrown it away.

634
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:49,935
You're wrong. We only met
because of the stone.

635
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,559
Throwing it away won't
change anything.

636
01:15:54,817 --> 01:15:58,447
Airships are improving.
Someone will find it.

637
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:04,446
(don't know what to do, but if
Laputa is so dangerous,

638
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,237
it's sure not
for the likes of Muska.

639
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,099
Besides,

640
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:13,126
if we run now,
they'll hunt us forever.

641
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,919
But don't become a pirate for me...

642
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:18,733
[ won't become a pirate.

643
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:22,572
Dola understands.
She's nicer than she looks.

644
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:27,019
Once things are settled,
I'll take you to Gondoa.

645
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:31,937
l want to see where you were
born, the valley, the yaks...

646
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:34,693
Pazu...

647
01:16:36,659 --> 01:16:37,648
What's that!

648
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,036
Below us, look!

649
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,799
Goliath, right below us!

650
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:56,848
Come about!

651
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,200
Do we have to hurry?
l hate to lose them.

652
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,809
We can't catch them in this fog.

653
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:36,242
We'll get them. Thay won't go far.

654
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:39,163
Steady as she goes.

655
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:53,867
Farther north than I thought.

656
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,240
There's no time, so listen.

657
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,983
lf we lose Goliath,
it's all over.

658
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,436
Follow them in the crow's nest.

659
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:03,681
What do I do?

660
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:06,925
It turns into a glider.
See the crank?

661
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:08,486
Yeah.

662
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:09,916
Turn it clockwise.

663
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:16,439
Once it's locked. the upper
laver spreads the wings.

664
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:24,971
Use the wire to stabilize them.
Figure out how to steer as you go!

665
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:27,562
Sheeta, you there!

666
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:29,774
Get back down here.

667
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:30,942
Why?

668
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,120
Because you're a girl!

669
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:37,833
But so are you! Besides, I'm
a mountain girl with sharp eyesight.

670
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:39,317
Sheeta!

671
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,327
Please, Pazu agrees.

672
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,681
Once you're aloft. the voice tube
won't work. See the head set?

673
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,400
You mean this...

674
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:53,755
Wow...

675
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,600
OK. I'll give it a try. Release us.

676
01:18:57,266 --> 01:18:58,375
Here goes.

677
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,510
They're gone.

678
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:21,251
Slipped behind clouds.

679
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:24,134
Stay alert. They could be anywhere.

680
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:29,973
Hold on tight.

681
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:37,592
What's wrong!

682
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,390
We're fine.

683
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:41,919
Ran into a gust of wind.

684
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,206
We'll keep watch.

685
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:46,985
Scared?

686
01:19:47,216 --> 01:19:48,086
No.

687
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,364
I'm getting the hang of it.
Rough skies ahead.

688
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:57,594
Get the rope from my bag, Sheeta.

689
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:01,791
Tie yourself to me.

690
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,052
The mercury's sinking. mama...

691
01:20:08,404 --> 01:20:11,884
Lousy luck. Storm coming up...
How long 'til dawn?

692
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:13,617
One more hour.

693
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,392
It's dawn.

694
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:35,097
Strange that the sun's
rising on that side...

695
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:38,967
I know! We're supposed to
be heading east. Bridge!

696
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:41,818
What! We're heading north?

697
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,904
The compass is pointing east.

698
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,369
The shifting winds must have
put us off course.

699
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:48,730
Look!

700
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,694
What is it? Goliath?

701
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,260
It's a cloud. A huge one...

702
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,186
A cloud?

703
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:57,351
It's headed for us!

704
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:12,537
A castle in the sky...

705
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:15,678
We're headed into
a low pressure system.

706
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:18,358
Turn her away, full speed!

707
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:38,719
It's sucking us in.

708
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,517
Hold tight, we can’t help!

709
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,420
l can't steer!

710
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,981
Where's your brute strength.

711
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,678
Engine’s burning up.

712
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,987
Stop whining! Do something!

713
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:00,818
We're clearing the clouds!

714
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:09,452
Sheeta, the ocean!

715
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:23,498
The Dragon's Lair!

716
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,885
So this is the Dragon's Lair...

717
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:39,755
Dad said, that wind
blew in opposite directions.

718
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,766
Look out, a wall of wind!

719
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:49,186
Help! It's sucking us in!

720
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:51,674
Don't give up! Be a man!

721
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,087
Bridge! Laputa's inside!

722
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,520
What was that!

723
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,501
Dad saw Laputa inside
the Dragon's Lair.

724
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:02,197
Ridiculous! It'll blow
you to smithereens!

725
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:03,548
Pazu!

726
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:04,682
Look.

727
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:09,916
Just what we need.

728
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:25,584
Let's go! It's the path dad took.
He made it back.

729
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,352
Into the Dragon's Lair we go!

730
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:42,977
Got ‘em!

731
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,041
Our ship's in danger. Retreat.

732
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:47,501
Stay the course.

733
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:50,920
The light's pointing
right for the clouds.

734
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:55,578
Laputa's in there.

735
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:58,934
Stay the course.
We'll find a way in.

736
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:12,983
Here we go, Sheeta!

737
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,126
Sheeta. Sheeta!
Are you all right?

738
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:22,340
Look...

739
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:37,888
Laputa...?

740
01:27:40,322 --> 01:27:41,192
Oops.

741
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,854
Wait... I tied it really tight.

742
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:50,097
My hands are shaking...

743
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:10,808
We did it!

744
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:31,499
Birds...

745
01:28:33,175 --> 01:28:34,575
Where is everyone...

746
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,077
Coming to greet you?

747
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,405
But I don't have the stone.

748
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:50,721
I'll use a knife.

749
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,049
What are you doing!

750
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,150
Wait.

751
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:16,965
Please don't break that.
We need it to get home.

752
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:35,245
A flycatcher's nest!

753
01:29:35,804 --> 01:29:36,794
He's protecting the nest.

754
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:45,348
I'm glad no eggs were broken.

755
01:29:46,181 --> 01:29:47,201
The birds aren't afraid.

756
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,010
- Follow.
- You understand?

757
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:58,285
! feel it.

758
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,124
It's a city...

759
01:30:52,147 --> 01:30:54,317
But we're inside...

760
01:30:58,653 --> 01:31:00,083
You can see the sky...

761
01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:14,335
A city so advanced...
Why did it...

762
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:16,161
A grave...
l wish 1 could read the writing.

763
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:20,671
Flowers...

764
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,423
Do you tend them?

765
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:30,401
Another robot!

766
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:37,827
It broke a long time ago...

767
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:52,895
Must've been the gardener...

768
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:57,829
...who protected this place ever
since the people went away.

769
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:15,424
You picked flowers for the grave.

770
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:19,763
Thank you.

771
01:33:22,230 --> 01:33:26,240
Are you all alone? Are there
any other robots here?

772
01:33:52,894 --> 01:33:54,764
He doesn't seem to be lonely.

773
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:59,099
He's got friends and
birds' nests to look after...

774
01:34:16,284 --> 01:34:17,183
This way!

775
01:34:29,264 --> 01:34:30,554
This section's been destroyed.

776
01:34:50,585 --> 01:34:51,985
They got Tiger Moth.

777
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:53,837
l hope the pirates are OK.

778
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:58,057
Look!

779
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,300
They're prisoners!

780
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:02,912
They hang pirates.

781
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:04,101
We must help them.

782
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:05,235
Let's go!

783
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:13,016
We found a way in.

784
01:35:13,675 --> 01:35:16,045
Mountains of treasure.

785
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,130
Wow...

786
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:23,086
Want some?

787
01:35:23,685 --> 01:35:25,965
I'll give you plenty... of rope.

788
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:28,874
Have you reported we found Laputa?

789
01:35:29,257 --> 01:35:30,126
Just about to.

790
01:35:30,692 --> 01:35:33,322
Make the code good and complicated.

791
01:35:33,795 --> 01:35:36,635
Hey! No looting!

792
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:40,269
The perfect distraction for those idiots.

793
01:35:58,186 --> 01:35:59,496
What amazing roots.

794
01:35:59,988 --> 01:36:01,388
Can you climb trees?

795
01:36:04,192 --> 01:36:05,062
It looks safe.

796
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:40,230
How horrible...

797
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:43,476
If they reach the garden...

798
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:45,934
The only way to save this...

799
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,749
is to get the stone back.

800
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,409
l see why the clouds parted.

801
01:36:54,442 --> 01:36:57,252
Otherwise they never
could have landed.

802
01:36:58,513 --> 01:37:00,063
Was it my spell...

803
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:03,737
Muska was right.
The seal's broken, and

804
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,018
the kingdom's waking up.

805
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:10,285
It's welcomed the visitor
with the stone.

806
01:37:11,626 --> 01:37:13,406
But Muska will become the king.

807
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,592
He's got much worse in mind.

808
01:37:17,098 --> 01:37:20,558
But what do I do with the stone
when I get it back...

809
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:23,073
That spell...

810
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:27,045
Spell... you don't mean...

811
01:37:55,136 --> 01:37:56,186
l see a way.

812
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:15,522
I'll go first.

813
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:36,363
It's here somewhere.

814
01:38:47,355 --> 01:38:48,344
Please God...

815
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:55,455
This is it!

816
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:07,277
It's that kid.

817
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:12,549
Oh, no!

818
01:39:12,847 --> 01:39:13,807
Don't shoot, capture her.

819
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:18,443
Well if it isn't the little princess.

820
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:20,773
Sheeta! Shoot!

821
01:39:23,758 --> 01:39:24,987
What is it, Colonel?

822
01:39:25,993 --> 01:39:29,213
The last of the pirates.
There's one right under you.

823
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:31,404
Yes sir! Search!

824
01:39:35,036 --> 01:39:36,346
Wait for me, Sheeta!

825
01:39:37,572 --> 01:39:38,442
Pazu!

826
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:42,979
Grenades!

827
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:44,941
Must be Pazu.

828
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,019
What was that?

829
01:39:51,586 --> 01:39:52,606
No, it wasn’t.

830
01:40:01,429 --> 01:40:02,829
The General is over there.

831
01:40:03,431 --> 01:40:05,891
Militia, assemble!
On the double!

832
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:14,211
Ma'am!

833
01:40:14,876 --> 01:40:18,796
They've got Sheeta. I'm going after her.
I'll cut your ropes, Escape.

834
01:40:28,556 --> 01:40:29,545
Get out of here.

835
01:40:30,258 --> 01:40:31,428
Hey, wait!

836
01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:35,178
Take this.

837
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:38,001
Thanks.

838
01:40:41,636 --> 01:40:43,156
The boy has become a man.

839
01:40:43,738 --> 01:40:44,608
What's that!

840
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:47,862
Muska destroyed
the radio equipment.

841
01:40:48,309 --> 01:40:50,889
Yes. while the ship
was short-handed.

842
01:40:51,846 --> 01:40:53,745
Some of the guards
are badly wounded.

843
01:40:54,315 --> 01:40:56,245
The Colonel is in a
black sphere down there.

844
01:40:56,984 --> 01:40:58,154
There's a witness.

845
01:40:59,253 --> 01:41:02,183
That upstart's finally
showing his colors.

846
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:04,299
Hunt down the spy!

847
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:05,759
Company assemble!

848
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,333
Hey! Hurry!

849
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,099
Shoot if he resists!

850
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:12,021
Find the entrance.

851
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:36,120
Where are we, Colonel...

852
01:41:36,557 --> 01:41:39,807
Laputa's core. The castle
above is just a trinket.

853
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:44,295
All of Laputa's knowledge
is crystallized here.

854
01:41:50,905 --> 01:41:52,195
You two wait here.

855
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:53,616
Colonel!

856
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:57,378
Only royalty may enter
the sacred area.

857
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:01,908
What is this!

858
01:42:05,052 --> 01:42:06,862
The roots come this far...

859
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:11,964
Eventually, we'll burn it all.

860
01:42:12,994 --> 01:42:14,134
Come, this way.

861
01:42:27,908 --> 01:42:28,778
Ow!
I found it!

862
01:42:29,276 --> 01:42:30,236
This is it!

863
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:39,272
Here, too!

864
01:42:54,869 --> 01:42:55,739
Found it!

865
01:43:00,041 --> 01:43:05,171
Behold the giant crystal!
Source of Laputa’s power.

866
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:10,477
Fantastic. It has awaited
a king for 700 years.

867
01:43:11,552 --> 01:43:12,541
700 years...

868
01:43:13,788 --> 01:43:16,687
Your family even forgot that?

869
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:26,487
The black rock!
As the epics described!

870
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:35,758
l can read, I can read it!

871
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:38,361
Just who are you?

872
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:44,357
I, too. have an ancient.
secret name. Lucita.

873
01:43:45,419 --> 01:43:47,699
My name is Romuska Palo Ur Laputa.

874
01:43:51,292 --> 01:43:55,012
We are descended
from the same royal family...

875
01:43:56,497 --> 01:43:58,717
...that split in two down on earth.

876
01:44:09,143 --> 01:44:10,483
Not even a crack.

877
01:44:10,778 --> 01:44:11,858
What's the catch?

878
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,290
Deploy all our explosives.

879
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:17,635
Force won't be necessary.
Your Excellancy.

880
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:19,489
Muska, where are you!

881
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:17,917
Why hesitate. General?
Please enter.

882
01:45:19,213 --> 01:45:20,112
Darn it! Follow.

883
01:45:20,347 --> 01:45:21,956
Follow His Excellancy.

884
01:45:34,261 --> 01:45:35,491
Follow.

885
01:45:37,031 --> 01:45:39,991
What is this! Muska, where are you!

886
01:45:40,734 --> 01:45:41,964
Silence.

887
01:45:47,308 --> 01:45:48,568
What on earth!

888
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:54,671
Watch your tongue. You're in
the presence of Laputa’s king.

889
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:57,006
Are you insane...

890
01:45:57,585 --> 01:46:02,715
Let's celebrate Laputa’s resurrection
with a display of its power.

891
01:46:04,458 --> 01:46:05,327
Sheeta!

892
01:46:05,693 --> 01:46:08,533
Behold, Laputa’s thunder.

893
01:46:09,763 --> 01:46:10,633
Sheeta.

894
01:46:32,953 --> 01:46:36,673
It's the heavenly fire that
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.

895
01:46:37,658 --> 01:46:40,758
It's the Ramayana’s Arrow of Indra.

896
01:46:41,695 --> 01:46:44,974
The world shall bow down
before Laputa once more!

897
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:51,710
Wonderful. Muska. You're a hero.
A monumental achievement.

898
01:46:59,046 --> 01:47:02,036
I've had it up to here
with your stupid face.

899
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:06,619
Run, everyone!

900
01:47:08,022 --> 01:47:09,072
Die!

901
01:47:36,417 --> 01:47:37,557
It's those monsters!

902
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:39,682
Run!

903
01:47:44,525 --> 01:47:46,165
Check our Flaptors.

904
01:47:48,095 --> 01:47:49,265
They're ready to fly!

905
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:50,610
Let's hurry!

906
01:47:50,864 --> 01:47:53,553
Quiet. Keep your voice down.

907
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:04,830
What are you two doing!
I'll have to leave you behind.

908
01:48:07,181 --> 01:48:09,521
l advise you not to anger me.

909
01:48:12,386 --> 01:48:14,996
We'll be alone together here.

910
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:22,995
They should've escaped.

911
01:48:27,835 --> 01:48:29,475
You think you can fight me?

912
01:48:58,298 --> 01:48:59,168
Robots!

913
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:37,039
Sheeta!

914
01:49:45,946 --> 01:49:47,056
Fantastic!

915
01:49:48,048 --> 01:49:49,947
A marvelous display, no?

916
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:54,970
Aha, some human garbage.

917
01:49:57,925 --> 01:49:58,885
How dare you!

918
01:50:12,005 --> 01:50:14,285
Be a good girl, give it back.

919
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:17,879
Please, open!

920
01:50:26,787 --> 01:50:28,537
Just where will you go?

921
01:50:30,824 --> 01:50:31,994
Open it!

922
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:52,391
Sheeta!

923
01:51:10,964 --> 01:51:12,424
Pazu!

924
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:22,745
Pazu!

925
01:51:23,277 --> 01:51:24,147
I'm coming.

926
01:51:25,579 --> 01:51:26,449
Get back!

927
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:30,040
Take this. hurry!
Muska's coming, quick!

928
01:51:38,425 --> 01:51:39,975
Throw it into the sea.

929
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,430
Hold onto that stone.
I'll trade her life for it.

930
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:22,240
Stand up! No time left for hide and seek.

931
01:52:29,676 --> 01:52:33,366
How delightful that it should end
in the throne room, Come here!

932
01:52:34,281 --> 01:52:37,881
The throne room?
This will be our grave. Ours...

933
01:52:39,953 --> 01:52:43,203
What is a king when his
country lies ruined.

934
01:52:44,057 --> 01:52:45,427
l won't give you the stone.

935
01:52:46,126 --> 01:52:49,026
You'll die, trapped here with me.
There's no escape.

936
01:52:50,464 --> 01:52:53,864
This is why Laputa died out.

937
01:52:55,235 --> 01:52:57,894
There's a song in my valley...
Put down your roots in the soil

938
01:52:58,372 --> 01:53:01,272
Let us live together with the wind

939
01:53:01,908 --> 01:53:05,388
Pass the winter with the seeds,
sing in the spring with the birds...

940
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:11,547
No matter how powerful your weapons,
or numerous your poor robots,

941
01:53:12,286 --> 01:53:14,016
you can't survive apart from the earth.

942
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:21,539
Laputa will not die. It will revive.

943
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:24,879
Its power is the stuff of
humanity's dreams.

944
01:53:27,734 --> 01:53:30,804
Next, ! shoot off your ears!

945
01:53:31,405 --> 01:53:34,594
Beg for your life. Make the kid
hand over the stone.

946
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:37,573
Wait!

947
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:41,975
The stone's hidden. You can shoot.
but you won't get it.

948
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:46,493
Stay away, Pazu.
He'll kill us both.

949
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:51,264
I'll spare her life if you tell me
where the stone is.

950
01:53:52,859 --> 01:53:56,369
Or do you intend to conquer me
with that cannon of yours?

951
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:00,866
Let me talk to Sheeta alone.

952
01:54:01,268 --> 01:54:03,518
Don't come.
Throw it away and run!

953
01:54:05,472 --> 01:54:07,022
3 minutes.

954
01:54:29,463 --> 01:54:33,563
Sheeta. calm down and listen.
Repeat the words of that spell.

955
01:54:36,203 --> 01:54:37,343
I'll say them with you.

956
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:40,434
Put your hand in mine.

957
01:54:50,584 --> 01:54:52,424
[ cut the pirates’ ropes.

958
01:54:57,591 --> 01:54:59,261
Time's up. What do you say?

959
01:55:42,803 --> 01:55:45,793
My eyes, my eyes...

960
01:56:06,493 --> 01:56:08,103
Mama, it's collapsing!

961
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:10,178
We've no choice, escape!
Hurry!

962
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:11,627
Hurry!

963
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:25,450
Look, the bottom's falling out!

964
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:18,740
Sheeta was such a nice girl...

965
01:57:19,833 --> 01:57:21,702
They used the spell of destruction.

966
01:57:22,602 --> 01:57:25,592
Those kids saved Laputa
from those idiots.

967
01:57:29,442 --> 01:57:30,612
It's stopping!

968
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:40,010
A crystal! A humongous one!

969
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:41,980
It’s rising.

970
01:57:48,595 --> 01:57:52,075
The tree... it's carrying
it away, Chase it!

971
01:57:52,866 --> 01:57:54,706
You're heavy. get off.

972
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:56,028
You're crazy!

973
01:58:39,346 --> 01:58:41,425
The roots protected us.

974
01:58:58,098 --> 01:58:59,298
We can still use this.

975
01:59:00,367 --> 01:59:01,237
Here goes.

976
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:14,147
What are you doing.
we're not moving.

977
02:00:14,641 --> 02:00:17,010
Of course not, we're overloaded.

978
02:00:22,348 --> 02:00:23,398
It's Sheeta!

979
02:00:24,718 --> 02:00:25,738
She's alive!

980
02:00:31,024 --> 02:00:32,014
Ma'am!

981
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:33,735
Thank God you're alive!

982
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:35,737
You guys OK?

983
02:00:36,296 --> 02:00:39,696
Oh, no! My galleon's wrecked...

984
02:00:41,434 --> 02:00:44,474
Oh. stop blubbering.
We'll make a better ship!

985
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:49,582
You poor child. the worst is
having your hair hacked off...

986
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:51,970
That hurts, Ma’ am.

987
02:00:54,447 --> 02:00:57,787
Pathetic. All that work.
and only this to show.

988
