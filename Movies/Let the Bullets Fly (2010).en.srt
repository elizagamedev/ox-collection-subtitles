1
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,580
"To the end of horizon,”

2
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,850
“four corners of Earth,”

3
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,030
scattered one’s true friends.

4
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,009
“A bottle of wine for remaining joy,”

5
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,798
as sun sets among the mountains.

6
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,639
Brilliant...

7
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,920
Counselor!
You prefer the food or my singing?

8
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,780
llove them both! Outstanding!

9
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,300
"Brain and brawn have helped me far,”

10
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,820
that's why lam so unique!

11
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,710
One must learn to live in style!

12
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,960
"Governor, with your style and poise,”

13
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,380
you remind me of...

14
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,199
a modern-day Robin Hood!

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,710
Bullshit!

16
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
Robin Hood is a common thief!

17
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,399
with Samson's might and Solomon's wisdom!

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,870
"Bullshit! - Yes, bullshit!"

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,859
"Counselor, if you're trying to flatter me,”

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,360
you must first woo my wife!

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
Compose a poem in her honour.

22
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,730
"It must have a tempest, food,”

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,990
"a hotpot, some mist,”

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,170
“pretty maidens, and a mule!”

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,540
Get up!

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,159
"Let's eat, sing and be merry!”

27
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,790
"Sir, we are the elite Republican Guards,”

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,690
here to ensure your safe passage!

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,500
We -

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,120
clon't - need - to - eat!

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,800
You missed?

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,859
Let the bullets fly...

33
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,030
Two and Three come with me.

34
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,620
The rest round up the horses.

35
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,039
Raining hot pot?

36
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,390
"Pop, we've looked all over.”

37
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,290
There is absolutely nothing!

38
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,620
Should we just kill the two survivors?

39
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,810
Tell me where the money is?

40
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,140
"Or I'll cut off your head,”

41
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,150
when the alarm goes off.

42
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,490
Stop it!

43
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,700
Tears won't stop it from ticking.

44
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,930
You'd better come clean with them.

45
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,100
"Who might you be, ma'am?”

46
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,790
I'm the Governor's wife.

47
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,090
Forgive my impudence.

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,890
So you must be the Governor.

49
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,340
"Yes, of course! There's money!”

50
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,950
We're on our way to inauguration.

51
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,400
He ruined it all by getting drowned!

52
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,060
But we can still hit jackpot

53
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,270
if we take his vacant post.

54
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,310
lll give you another chance.
Tell me more.

55
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,540
"$200,000..."

56
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,170
Where is it?

57
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,599
Bought the post with it.

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,040
What for?

59
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,909
To make more money.

60
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,479
How much?

61
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,930
Twice as much.

62
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,500
How long will it take?

63
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,229
Ayear.

64
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,210
I've to wait one year?

65
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,590
“A month, if you're in luck.”

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,090
Who will be the governor?

67
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,679
Me.

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,190
And who might you be?

69
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,880
I'm a counselor.

70
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,740
You dare to impersonate the Governor?

71
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,900
They've never met him.

72
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,810
Done this before?

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,430
Twice a year.

74
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,159
Since when?

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,820
Eight years ago.

76
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,469
You've made more than $6.4 million?

77
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,750
"That's what the ""Governor'™ made.”

78
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,990
l only get the small change.

79
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,750
Ever failed?

80
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,750
"We use our brains, not brawn.”

81
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,470
Where are you heading to?

82
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,460
Goose Town.

83
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,470
How do you explain
the hold-up and the bodies?

84
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,950
l bought the train and hired the soldiers.

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,479
No one will ever find out.

86
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,490
Don't take it off! Leave your mask on!

87
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,340
I know the rules.

88
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,720
No one lives after seeing a bandit's face.

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,380
Just wait here for me.

90
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,260
lll bring you the money once I have it.

91
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,590
"We came to rob a train,”

92
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,630
we can't go empty-handed.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,280
"No, you can't.”

94
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,660
If you die for peeking at me...

95
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,720
That's even worse.

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Can I borrow those bodies?

97
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,650
Yes. These bullies deserve no better.

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,670
But what do you want to do with them?

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,580
They can be more useful than the living.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,170
Take a look at me.

101
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,239
Look at me!

102
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,639
Just one look!

103
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,580
What's your name?

104
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,469
he.

105
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,510
What's your bloody name?

106
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,170
Tang.

107
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,409
"Tll be the Governor,”

108
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,990
and you'll be my counselor!

109
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,330
Let's go and rule Goose Town.

110
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
"Ma'am, coming with us?”

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,079
"Well, why not?”

112
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,130
"Brothers, let's move on to Goose Town!"

113
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,599
Goose Town here we come!

114
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,799
We've messed up badly.

115
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,690
End up drowning your husband.

116
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,399
feel bad about it.

117
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,080
I've already been widowed four times.

118
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,090
"Don't let there be a fifth time, then!"

119
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,630
That's all up to you.

120
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,239
What's important for a couple?

121
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,040
In love.

122
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,760
I can't hear you.

123
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,090
In love.

124
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,400
"Six, come greet your Mom.”

125
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,470
"wish you well, Mother.”

126
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
You bring your son to battles?

127
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,799
His father was a comrade. Died in battle.

128
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,840
Sol adopted him as my god son.

129
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,930
Now you're my mother.

130
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,330
"After we're done with Goose Town,”

131
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,440
you must come and join our gang.

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,879
Then you can continue to play mother.

133
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,630
One should always aim high.

134
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,950
“After serving as county governor,”

135
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,050
I can't return to banditry.

136
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,620
I won't be able to handle it.

137
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,500
Once you've scaled Mount Everest...

138
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,260
Such eloquence!

139
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,640
Then what should we do?

140
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,900
We can continue to be civil servants!

141
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,010
"Use your brain, not brawn.”

142
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,940
Think twice before you make a move.

143
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,810
Got it.

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,790
Counselor!

145
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,750
We're government officials now.

146
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,559
We can't act like bandits!

147
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,700
What is a good governor's virtue?

148
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,970
Forbearance.

149
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,090
You've escaped once.

150
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,560
Try this one more time...

151
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,550
You'll have me beheaded!

152
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,830
Let's gol!

153
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,550
City girls are so fair and delicate!

154
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,620
"Pop, look!”

155
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,600
Look what they've mace of you!

156
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,140
"The less it resembles me, the safer lam!"

157
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,730
"Welcome, your honour!"

158
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,330
Appointment Warrant!

159
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,830
Ma Bangde is appointed
Goose Town Governor

160
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,760
“by authority of the Provincial Chairman,”

161
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,370
“on this 28th day of February, the 8th year of the Republic...”

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,340
Master Huang has arrived!

163
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,530
Greetings to Master Huang!

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,370
Good fortune to Master Huang!

165
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,010
Huang Silang is the local godfather.

166
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,859
Made his fortune from opium and human trafficking.

167
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,819
Master is currently engaged.

168
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,189
"So he sends his majordomo, Hu Wan!"

169
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,850
"And his militia coach, Wu Zhichong!"

170
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,160
"To welcome you, sir, with his hat!"

171
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,630
Who dares win!

172
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
Do you dare?

173
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,020
"He's here, sir.”

174
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,000
Who's here?

175
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,860
Yourself!

176
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,190
Long live Master Huang!

177
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,370
Greetings from Yang Wanlou!

178
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,420
A remarkable fake!

179
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
A remarkable fake!

180
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,819
Take a few steps.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,630
Take a few steps.

182
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,050
Walk purposefully.

183
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,580
Purposefully...

184
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,900
Walk with spirit.

185
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,550
Spiritedly...

186
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,820
Walk pensively.

187
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,750
Pensively...

188
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,719
Why isn't she afraid?

189
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,220
She must be daft.

190
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,050
Know why we shot these bandits?

191
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,930
It's because they ambushed the Governor.

192
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,830
Let this be a lesson to all!

193
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,939
Never mess with the Governor!

194
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,819
Hail the Governor!

195
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,699
Peace and justice is here!

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,320
Great speech!

197
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,280
Remember what I told you?

198
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,260
The dead can be really handy.

199
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,719
You're absolutely right.

200
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,490
Such arrogance!

201
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,849
He's trouble.

202
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,459
A show of force!

203
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,010
This one is a tricky customer!

204
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,880
Should we strike first?

205
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,590
No hurry.

206
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,339
Let's toy with him.

207
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,050
"No hurry, let's toy with him!"

208
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,680
Cut it out!

209
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,750
Cut it out!

210
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,110
Cut it out!

211
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,480
Cut it out!

212
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,319
Cut it out!

213
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,150
Cut it out!

214
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,760
Cut it out! Cut it out!

215
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,170
Cut it out! Cut it out!

216
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,970
Cut it out...

217
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,620
Cut it out...

218
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,240
Cut it out!

219
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,319
Cut it out!

220
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,800
Cut the bloody hell out!

221
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,569
Butler!

222
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,550
Yes sir!

223
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,689
Take him to the dentist.

224
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,310
Fix him up with gold teeth like mine.

225
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,020
Yes sir!

226
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,800
Madam!

227
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,310
"The reason am here,”

228
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,980
“is to get rich,”

229
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,070
hot to get laid.

230
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,560
"We share a bed,”

231
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,420
but not our dreams.

232
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,420
Here's a pistol.

233
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,350
"Just in case,"

234
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,550
"l overstep my mark,”

235
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,100
shoot me between the eyes.

236
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,790
"But if you have that urge,”

237
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,199
“then yours truly,”

238
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,710
would be happy to oblige.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,650
Let's sleep!

240
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,030
Husband and wife - even for a day...

241
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,060
"I've always wanted to be a governor's wife,”

242
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,340
and I don't care who the governor is.

243
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,290
Your guest?

244
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,119
Go ahead!

245
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,630
You make me blush!

246
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,000
"Well, do I?”

247
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,840
Then must oblige.

248
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,470
We're late!

249
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,670
Previous governors

250
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,990
have levied tax for the next 90 years!

251
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,930
So everyone has paid up to 2010!

252
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,560
We've come to the wrong place!

253
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
"Llike this town, though.”

254
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,380
But people here have nothing left.

255
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,050
I never take from the poor.

256
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,300
"Who are your victims, then?”

257
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,590
"The rich, of course.”

258
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,610
Ever been a Governor?

259
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,750
No.

260
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,699
Listen carefully!

261
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,310
"You have to devise ways to raise money,”

262
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,560
"Make the rich pay first,”

263
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,310
townsfolk will follow suit.

264
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,370
"Then reimburse
the rich with what they paid,”

265
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,770
and split the rest 30-70!

266
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,470
We only get 70?

267
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,030
"No, the rich get 70.”

268
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,650
We get 30 at Huang’s discretion.

269
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,720
At whose discretion?

270
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,690
Him.

271
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,770
Him?

272
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,370
"I come all this way,”

273
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,890
only to become his running cog?

274
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,020
Correct.

275
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,810
"It's hard enough robbing your train,”

276
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,870
and play-act governor.

277
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,590
"I still have to play boot-licker to the rich,”

278
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,570
“make up silly excuses,”

279
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,970
and do things at his whim.

280
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,030
Doesn't that make me a beggar?

281
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,310
If you want to put it that way...

282
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,890
"Many would love to be in your position,”

283
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,570
but few could afford to buy a post.

284
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,050
Do you know why I became an outlaw?

285
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,700
It's because my legs
are not built for kneeling!

286
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,280
“If you want to make money standing tall,”

287
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,670
tide back to the mountains.

288
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,579
I don't get this.

289
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,930
"Lam now governor,”

290
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,550
how can I be worse off than a bandit?

291
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,180
You may be a governor to the townsfolk.

292
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,380
"But in the eyes of Huang,”

293
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,479
you're a mere beggar!

294
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,390
This is only business. There is no shame.

295
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,390
The hell there isn't!

296
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,319
I's shameful!

297
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,590
"Do you prefer to stand tall,”

298
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,690
or do you want to make money?

299
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,380
I want to do both.

300
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,230
No way.

301
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,030
Why not?

302
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,800
It's impossible.

303
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,170
Can make money with this?

304
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,329
"Yes, but only as a bandit.”

305
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,340
Or with this?

306
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,040
"Yes, but only on your knees.”

307
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,970
"Combining the two,”

308
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,240
can l make money standing tall?

309
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,449
"Mr. Nine, who exactly are you?”

310
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,150
"Rocky" Zhang!"

311
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,579
Stop it! This is not a tree!

312
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,380
It's an ancient magisterial drum!

313
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,770
"Totally neglected,”

314
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,860
it's taken root and sprouted leaves.

315
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,640
"Pop said to me,”

316
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,700
we need this to convene court.

317
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,660
He wants to try a case.

318
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,699
What case?

319
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,270
Has someone filed a complaint?

320
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,510
It's been here for 100 years.

321
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,170
“If you now unveil the drum,”

322
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,640
who knows what case it may bring?

323
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,120
Where's your old man?

324
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,800
In bed.

325
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,530
At this hour? Who with?

326
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,910
What happened?

327
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,640
Where is it going?

328
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,610
Look what you've done!

329
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,150
Drum...!

330
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,250
Out of my way!

331
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,670
It's homing in on me!

332
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,089
Help! Help!

333
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,790
"My wine is ruined,”

334
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,080
my mood destroyed!

335
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,100
Everything's spoilt!

336
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,570
lll deal with you another clay.

337
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,360
The drum is shattered!

338
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,190
So there must be a case to try!

339
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,379
Court!

340
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,890
How have you been wronged?

341
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,689
I'm not.

342
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,810
"If no one is wronged, case dismissed!"

343
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,139
Sir!

344
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,310
Ihave wronged Master Wu.

345
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,440
Il was careless.

346
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,970
[ran into him and knocked over his wine.

347
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,050
Completely ruining his day.

348
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,000
I need to kowtow and apologise. Sorry!

349
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,559
That was nothing.

350
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,720
How dare you say nothing?

351
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,120
Kneel!

352
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,300
He coaches Huang’s militia.
Go easy on him.

353
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,020
"During the reign of the last Emperor,”

354
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,620
Iwas bestowed a Martial Scholar.

355
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,500
My rank was higher than yours.

356
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,350
You should kneel in front of me!

357
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,280
Kneel!

358
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,300
Kneel!

359
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,890
This is bullshit!

360
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,429
The last Emperor? Havel ever met him?

361
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,250
“If you'd been a Literary Scholar,”

362
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,940
he'd have to kowtow 200 times.

363
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
“But as a Martial Scholar,”

364
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,400
you'll get only 100 kowtows.

365
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,760
"Since he has already clone 200,”

366
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,140
you've to return 100 kowtows.

367
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,170
But I've only kowtowed twice!

368
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,910
Does it really matter?

369
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,799
Do it!

370
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,879
Flog him!

371
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,810
That's no good. This is more effective.

372
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,750
Stop! I'll do it.

373
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,940
Splendid.!

374
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,540
"You kowtow, and you cdo the counting.”

375
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,639
"One, two, three, four...”

376
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,620
"Hail, Governor!"

377
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,050
Stand up everyone!

378
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,780
No one is worth kneeling to.

379
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,850
Least of all to me!

380
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,110
I've brought three things to Goose Town.

381
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,360
“Justice,”

382
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,730
“justice,”

383
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,010
and goddamned justice.

384
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,580
"Hail, Governor!"

385
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,200
Stand up! No kneeling!

386
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,950
That's better.

387
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
No kneeling?

388
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,929
"He was not only flogging me,”

389
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,680
he was slapping you in the face!

390
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,620
"When my butts stop hurting,”

391
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,830
I will personally avenge you.

392
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,740
Summon the noodle vendor.

393
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,550
“If our governor loves to try,”

394
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,820
we'll give him a case to try.

395
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,390
"Pop, you were brilliant today.”

396
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,430
Flogging that martial scholar was a hoot!

397
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,030
I'd love to be a governor one day.

398
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,790
I don't want you to be a bandit or politician.

399
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,399
"When your father entrusted you to me,”

400
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,820
Il promised I'd raise you properly.

401
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,780
Then what should I do?

402
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,679
Study and learn to enjoy this.

403
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,220
There is no sound!

404
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,120
Politicians only know how to bully.

405
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,660
"This gramophone was broken,”

406
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,989
Now it is fixed.

407
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,350
"Once we're done here,”

408
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,820
ll let you study abroad.

409
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,659
"3 years in the east,”

410
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,200
"3 in the west,"

411
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,720
and 3 more in the south.

412
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,900
How about 3 years in the north?

413
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,160
"No, you're born in the north.”

414
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,680
Who is this by?

415
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,649
I think it's Wolfgang.

416
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,689
Sometime known as Amadeus.

417
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,800
We call him M-o-z-a-r-t.

418
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,950
You can tell by listening?

419
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,479
It depends.

420
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,530
On what?

421
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,390
If his name was printed there.

422
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,780
"Pop, this Mozart..."

423
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,410
How did he get the sound in there?

424
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,250
You'll learn by studying abroad.

425
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,460
Where's this Mozart?

426
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
How can I find him?

427
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,729
He is far away from us.

428
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,270
Know what you have to do?

429
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,270
Yes.

430
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,730
Who ordered you to co this?

431
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,860
"Who, sir?”

432
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,820
Did I tell you to do it?

433
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,040
"Yes, sir. You did.”

434
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,110
"No, it's "me!"

435
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,949
You?

436
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,399
"You, you yourself!”

437
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,680
"Yes, me and me alone.”

438
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,790
I can't hear you.

439
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,200
It's my own plot.

440
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,310
There are no co-conspirators.

441
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,210
Saviour! My saviour!

442
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,479
Saviour!

443
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,550
You're addressing me?

444
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,540
Since when have l become your saviour?

445
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,870
"You spared my life,”

446
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,720
and I'll save yours in return.

447
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,179
Do tell.

448
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,970
Never sleep with a widow.

449
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,100
It's very bad luck!

450
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,120
She?

451
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,460
Is she really a widow?

452
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,700
She doesn't act like one.

453
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,620
But! witnessed her husband drowned!

454
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,720
“If she really is a widow,”

455
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,889
Then I must not...

456
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,560
leave her alone uncomforted.

457
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,430
That's my first move.

458
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,840
Within three...

459
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,080
“they'll either leave with
tails between their legs,”

460
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,000
or stay and become our poodles!

461
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,570
"Right, absolutely right.”

462
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,480
"You're looking for me, sir?”

463
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,350
Have you entertained our new officials yet?

464
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,280
Not yet.

465
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,560
The Governor doesn't frequent brothels?

466
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,510
He'll never make a good governor.

467
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,120
I don't indulge much in sex.

468
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,860
So you won't make a good governor either.

469
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,850
Why is that so?

470
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,479
The two bear no comparison!

471
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,250
Governors come and go.

472
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,320
"But you, sir, will always be our godfather!"

473
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,959
You speak welll!

474
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,260
I'm sure they will come.

475
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,690
“Eavesdrop their every conversation,”

476
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,550
report their every move.

477
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,770
Yes.

478
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,030
Go now. Just don't become a Mata Hari!

479
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,130
"Who's Mata Hari, Master?”

480
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,560
What kind of whore are you?

481
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,909
She's the world's most
infamous double agent!

482
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,679
You two can leave.

483
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,650
Now the Governor is in bed with his wife.

484
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,169
Let him enjoy one more night in peace!

485
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,710
"The Governor's boy is in trouble,”

486
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,420
your presence is requested at the teahouse.

487
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,700
Why don't they convene at the magistracy?

488
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,129
The magistracy is just for show.

489
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,000
All cases are tried at the teahouse.

490
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,180
"Master Six,”

491
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,510
"you've eaten two bowls of jelly,”

492
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,760
and paid only for one.

493
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,510
Bullshit! l have only eaten one bowl!

494
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,890
And I paid him for one.

495
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,010
How many bowls did he eat?

496
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,879
Two...

497
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,140
No way!

498
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,980
"Master Six is the Governor's godson,”

499
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,899
why would he want to cheat you?

500
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,680
But he ate two bowls and paid for one.

501
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,699
The Governor brings justice to our town.

502
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,970
Good!

503
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,560
And justice is what I seek today!

504
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,320
Hear hear!

505
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,270
"From the Governor's son, of course.”

506
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,860
"Ate two bowls, paid for one!”

507
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,990
That's so wrong!

508
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,219
"Since his boy is guilty of unjust,”

509
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,090
the Governor's crusade is bullshit!

510
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,110
Screw youl!

511
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,060
Master Six...

512
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,490
Master Six is the Governor's godson!

513
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,370
Would he cheat over a bowl of jelly?

514
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,480
Did you see it with your own eyes?

515
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,930
You double-crosser!
What's wrong with you?

516
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,929
You're thinking with your butts?

517
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,570
It's not about my butts.

518
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,370
We're here for the truth!

519
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,110
One or two bowls?

520
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,479
No beating about the bush!

521
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,440
"Ladmire your courage, sir.”

522
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,760
I know how to count!

523
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,540
late only one bowl!

524
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,350
You ate two and paid for one.

525
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,899
“If you can't afford it, my treat!”

526
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,729
I can afford all the jelly in this world!

527
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,179
But I pay only for what I ate.

528
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,399
How many bowls did he eat?

529
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,370
Let's be frank.

530
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,520
He wants to be treated fairly.

531
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,420
It's wrong to bully a commoner.

532
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,040
Are you an honest person?

533
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,260
"Yes, lam..."

534
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,370
How many bowls cid I eat?

535
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,300
Tell him!

536
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,639
Speak up!

537
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,899
Stop threatening this poor man with a gun!

538
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,030
Who doesn't carry a gun around here?

539
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,840
Noodle vendor!
How many bowls did he eat?

540
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,620
“Everyone in this teahouse,”

541
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,610
will bear witness on your behalf.

542
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,480
Speak up! How many?

543
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,490
Two bowls.

544
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,350
You're nasty!

545
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,700
But I dare you to match me!

546
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,520
Take a good look!

547
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,270
"If there are two bowls
of jelly in me, I'll die!”

548
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,940
“If there's only one, I'll die.”

549
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,510
"If he has two bowls in him,
I'll die with him!"

550
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,989
Where's the jelly?

551
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,330
Deeper! I can't see.

552
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,300
"Very gutsy, sir!”

553
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,420
"Try sliding the blade sideway,”

554
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,900
so that we can all see.

555
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,550
Show us if there is one or two bowls.

556
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,700
Out with it!

557
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
"Here's a bowl, sir.”

558
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,600
See! Can you see?

559
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,530
One bowl!

560
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,250
"There's only one bowl, right?”

561
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,550
Hang in there! I'll get a doctor!

562
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,209
"There's only one bowl, right?”

563
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,500
"There's only one bowl, right?”

564
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,310
Your turn!

565
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,480
I knew it all along.

566
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,730
You fell for it.

567
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,530
"You mustn't kill him! No, l won't!"

568
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,060
"Tell me why! should spare him,”

569
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,910
“or I'll shoot you, too.”

570
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,830
Don't let Six die in vain!

571
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
I didn’t do it. He stabbed himself.

572
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,280
We'd a wager.

573
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,330
He lost.

574
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,530
Let me blast his head off!

575
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,360
You wouldn't dare! You can't do it.

576
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,330
Huang is provoking you.

577
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,880
He wants you to lose your head.

578
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,820
We'll lose if we kill him now.

579
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,580
Let him go.

580
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,050
You must destroy Huang’s soul!

581
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,639
". Pop, he's right. - Let him go!”

582
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,110
He stabbed himself? What about the jelly?

583
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,690
Yes

584
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,260
and no...

585
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,970
Tell me if it was still jelly.

586
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,100
"Yes, it was.”

587
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,030
Come over here.

588
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,479
And...

589
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,040
is he dead?

590
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,030
Yes.

591
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,709
Did you implicate me?

592
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,530
Idid invoke your name.

593
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,110
Were they scared?

594
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,230
"They said to kill,
a person's soul must first be destroyed.”

595
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,560
Murder? Soul destruction?

596
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,270
How awful.

597
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,460
"Brother, l vow to avenge you!”

598
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,870
"Brother, l swear I'll avenge you!”

599
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,679
"Brother, l vow to avenge you!”

600
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Two is drunk. lam pledging for him.

601
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,880
"He will avenge your death, too.”

602
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,990
"Brother, l swear to avenge you!”

603
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,460
"Two is sober, he's just pissed off!”

604
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,560
Chief doesn't want to risk our lives.

605
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,430
Are we boy scouts or what?

606
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,700
Chief should have ignored Tang.

607
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,449
He is a good-for-nothing!

608
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,440
Huang kills without lifting a finger!

609
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,469
We must retaliate by destroying his soul.

610
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,450
We can't jeopardise our chance to get rich!

611
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,060
Six...

612
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,930
Ido not care about being rich.

613
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,580
But Il must come up with a game plan

614
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,610
to rid of Huang once and for all

615
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,729
"Give me time,"

616
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,850
Pop will avenge your death.

617
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,120
Show your respect!

618
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,340
“Have a safe journey, Six.”

619
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,300
"Safe travel, Six!"

620
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,570
How should I play my hand?

621
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,430
“Banquet, kill him or throw him to the dogs?”

622
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,790
ld say kill him!

623
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,700
No!

624
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,540
No?

625
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,030
Host a banquet!

626
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,000
Dinner invitation! It's a death trap!

627
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,370
Our ploy is working!

628
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,879
lI have another idea: delay tactics.

629
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,160
The longer we drag this on the better!

630
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,080
Huang will end up kneeling here.

631
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,490
What kind of banquet is this?

632
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,409
It's just a meeting between two thugs!

633
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,180
It's like MacBeth hosting Banquo.

634
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,570
What'd become of Banquo the guest?

635
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,540
His son became king.

636
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,290
And MacBeth the host?

637
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,540
So we should go.

638
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,439
"We can also sound out Huang,”

639
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,889
and see if we can work together.

640
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,190
Got it!

641
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,440
Understood!

642
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,399
You see Six's death
as a shortcut to bonanza?

643
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,970
Perhaps your severed head
can make us more.

644
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,310
What do you mean?

645
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,130
Let's go and meet your new pal.

646
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,720
Attention!

647
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,179
"Governor, counselor! Welcome!"

648
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,010
Master's citadel dominates Goose Town.

649
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,670
Itis simply impregnable.

650
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,959
“An intrepid governor, an erudite counselor.”

651
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,139
What a dream team!

652
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,740
Master Six has died heroically.

653
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
I've invited you here today

654
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,379
to witness how justice is done.

655
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,720
“If I'm proven to be the instigator,”

656
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,449
"I will follow Master Six's footstep,”

657
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,030
and disembowel myself!

658
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,930
"Linvite you to be my second,”

659
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,840
to ritualistically cut my head off

660
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,710
and hang it from the restaurant.

661
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,980
“If I'm proven innocent,
those who slandered me”

662
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,560
and shamed you in the process...

663
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,380
will have to kill themselves.

664
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,730
It's me against these three.

665
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,620
lam reacly.

666
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,690
You should use this for disembowelment.

667
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,700
The full blade is for your second.

668
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,699
Really?

669
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,969
It's great to have an expert as my second!

670
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,478
"This way, please.”

671
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,580
I bought this governorship.

672
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,370
Sole purpose is to get rich.

673
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,780
But I don't take from the poor.

674
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,830
Then who are you targeting?

675
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,879
Only the wealthy people.

676
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,800
Who are the wealthy?

677
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,690
Such as you.

678
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,150
"Whatever you fancy, help yourself.”

679
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,580
I'm no bandit. 'm a governor.

680
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,429
I make my fortune the proper way.

681
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,569
Well said!

682
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,620
Goose Town has two big families.

683
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,609
"They sell people
to America to build railroads,"

684
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,009
in return for dollars!

685
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,910
What do you mean by dolls?

686
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,149
"No, d-o-I-l-a-r-s! American money.”

687
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,730
Dollar! You know?

688
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,910
"Oh, dollars!"

689
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,710
Ican smell it in your presence!

690
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,540
Let's drink to that!

691
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,370
"Great, cheers!"

692
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,360
Cheers!

693
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,638
Master Huang is so modest.

694
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,080
"It is an open secret that,”

695
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,880
"in Goose Town,
Master Huang is our real boss!"

696
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,520
It is hard to be a boss.

697
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,340
Hundreds of people everyday

698
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,120
waiting to be fed.

699
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,370
There is little left for me.

700
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,710
"If you're looking to make a fast buck,”

701
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,210
I know exactly what to do.

702
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,319
Please tell.

703
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,500
Pocky Zhang!

704
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,930
One of them just died!

705
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,680
Pocky Zhang?

706
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,180
"Yes, Pocky Zhang!"

707
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,970
What has he got to do with us?

708
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,310
Or with our money?

709
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,279
Everything!

710
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,310
Is he here in Goose Town?

711
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,140
"Well, yes...”

712
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,270
and no!

713
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,009
Master Huang speaks in riddles!

714
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,629
"Where is he, then?”

715
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,689
Let Master Huang enlightens us.

716
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,549
He has grabbed Goose Town by its balls!

717
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,490
Know what I mean?

718
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,118
No.

719
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,660
Know what do for a living?

720
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,390
No.

721
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,319
Half the opium smokers in this nation

722
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,259
rely on Master Huang for their supply!

723
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,970
"No, I'm only a pawn for General Liu.”

724
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,540
I'm just one of his runners!

725
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,850
How many runners does Liu have?

726
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,080
Three.

727
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,500
And Master is the most able one!

728
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,260
"Yes, the strongest one!”

729
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,870
“But this runner,”

730
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,140
is now crippled!

731
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,100
Crippled?

732
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:14,820
What happened?

733
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,810
Zhang has seized nearly all my goods.

734
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,420
Imagine what he can make from them.

735
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,360
He must be very well off!

736
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,810
l wonder if this is true.

737
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,819
"You can write your own cheque,”

738
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,430
if you can take him out!

739
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,270
We wouldn't dare to!

740
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,830
"But if this can make us rich,”

741
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,350
I wouldn't mind having a go!

742
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,080
Then blame yourself for your timidity!

743
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,209
But I would be happy to assist.

744
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,410
I can put up money as a bait.

745
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
The families have to match my contribution.

746
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,740
We're hoping you'd say that.

747
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,460
"How about $800,000?"

748
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,230
No! I'll put up $1.8 million!

749
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,270
The more the merrier!

750
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,580
"Yes, we'll pay you back $1.8 million,”

751
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,650
and split the dollars from the others.

752
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,970
There's no need to pay him back!

753
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,180
We'll hit these bandits hard!

754
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,680
"Whatever they seized in the past,”

755
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,589
we will retrieve for the Master.

756
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,500
“Look at the bigger picture,”

757
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,650
the $1.8 million bounty
is but a strand of hair.

758
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,930
Surely you won't mind!

759
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,410
We'll get rid of Pocky Zhang!

760
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,680
Cool!

761
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,480
Cool enough?

762
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,069
Very cool!

763
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,290
We can discuss that later.

764
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,210
The only thing I want to do now

765
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,670
is to fix Master's crippled leg.

766
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,470
Pocky Zhang's such a nuisance.

767
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,920
He shouldn't have messed
with Master Huang!

768
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,720
Let's top up.

769
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,689
"Il believe in taking our time,”

770
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,390
doing things step by step!

771
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,879
I don't want to break my balls

772
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,290
by over-stretching!

773
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,319
"We should agree on the split first,”

774
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,799
before thinking of how to fix his leg.

775
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,650
“If you want to settle the split now,”

776
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,980
then just carry on.

777
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,960
"Counselor, you decide.”

778
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,970
“About the dollars,” !

779
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,430
let's do a customary 30-70 split.

780
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,990
How can you even say that?

781
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,580
Master Huang is so instrumental.

782
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,720
And you give him only 30%?

783
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,270
Let's go 50-50!

784
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,500
"My apologies, Master Huang.”

785
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,540
So inconsiderate!

786
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,880
"Counselor, I'll go along with that: 50-50."

787
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,050
“If you've the guts to take on the bandits,”

788
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,140
“the dollars from the two families,”

789
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,380
are but strands of hair!

790
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,290
Strands of hair!

791
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,430
May not be even that!

792
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,900
I know you have the courage.

793
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,160
But ability-wise...?

794
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,810
How do I know if you can overcome Zhang?

795
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,880
"May lask you a question, sir?”

796
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:44,910
Go ahead.

797
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,080
"If Zhang can seize your goods,”

798
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,520
why can't he break in here?

799
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,670
My citadel is impregnable.

800
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,490
There's no way that he can get in.

801
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,920
Are you sure

802
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,710
that we're the only ones here?

803
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,980
An order to retreat!

804
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,420
- Split? - You sure?

805
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,140
Let's split.

806
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,070
Did you hear that?

807
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,490
Yes.

808
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,560
"Where Pocky fails to breach,
I succeeded!"

809
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,670
I can kill him when he is least expecting it.

810
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,069
Another one bites the dust!

811
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,690
Implicate me for all you like.

812
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,370
I couldn't care less!

813
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,649
Governor. l sense that you're special.

814
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,810
lam flattered.

815
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,540
"But those who waged war on the bandits,
none has survived.”

816
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,190
Why not?

817
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,730
Pocky Zhang is a tough cookie.

818
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,379
I met him once 20 years ago.

819
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,819
Isn't that fate?

820
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,520
How did it happen?

821
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,750
"He stood by a lantern
and turned towards me,”

822
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,510
and I was standing in the shade.

823
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,640
“He was well lit up, and you're in the dark!”

824
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,300
"Quiet, quiet...”

825
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,029
So it was there and then...

826
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,420
"A bit like, here and now!"

827
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,800
What a coincidence!

828
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,290
Exactly!

829
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,980
But you're missing something.

830
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,450
You mean his facial scars?

831
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,610
Of course not.

832
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,040
Then what is it?

833
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,900
You don't know how to play act.

834
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,279
Exactly!

835
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
A fortune teller told my mother

836
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,550
before l was even born!

837
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,110
He said my Achilles heel

838
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,120
would be my inability to play act!

839
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,930
Can I change it?

840
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,470
No way! It's in your genes!

841
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,440
But our counselor is a born actor!

842
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,850
Confusing dollar with dolls?

843
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,460
What is dollar?

844
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,330
American money!

845
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,910
A genius when it comes to play acting.

846
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,000
"Counselor, cheers!"

847
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,640
"Thanks for your compliment, sir.”

848
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,799
Allow me to play the fool for once.

849
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,830
“After defeating the bandits,”

850
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,040
we'll take just 20% of any opium recovered.

851
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,200
"No, Linsist 50-50!"

852
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,890
"To show my sincerity,”

853
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,040
I'll send over $1.8 million now.

854
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,730
That's too soon. We haven't started yet!

855
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,000
"Marie, Claire!”

856
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,040
"Master, I can't take women.”

857
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,210
"No interest in money or women,”

858
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,120
what do you want?

859
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,950
Arunner.

860
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,950
What runner?

861
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,230
Master Huang’s a runner
of exceptional courage!

862
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,740
Brother!

863
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,310
Brother!

864
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,770
We can run side by side!

865
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,380
We'll run for our lives!

866
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,279
"Roads won't exist in this world of chaos,"

867
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,150
unless people like us run on them!

868
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,620
"Il see, I see...”

869
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,720
"Yes, me too.”

870
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,259
Stupid bitch!

871
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,770
"While flowers can blossom again,”

872
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,089
time lost will never return.

873
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,650
This girl is as delicate as jade.

874
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,009
Please don't be mad at her.

875
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,110
"Master Huang, easy easy...”

876
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,920
Shame we didn't meet until now!

877
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,190
"Diamonds, the girl - they're all yours.”

878
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,210
I've brought my wife with me.

879
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,860
So I can't take her home.

880
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,390
Then take the diamonds for your wife.

881
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,810
l accept them on her behalf.

882
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,930
Get up.

883
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,930
I thought you'd summoned two girls.

884
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,390
How come there's only her?

885
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,970
You mean she is Marie-Claire?

886
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,560
You are really na?vel

887
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,290
She's adopted a fashionable name.

888
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,270
It's Marie-Claire!

889
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,920
There goes the last of them!

890
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,490
A wise counselor! !

891
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,490
A tough governor!

892
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,370
"Master, you're both wise and tough.”

893
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,060
"Are you really "Pocky Zhang?”

894
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,810
Supposing that you are.

895
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,350
You've already made a fortune

896
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,680
“from crippling’ Liu's runners.”

897
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,870
Why bother with Goose Town?

898
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,990
But if you are someone else...

899
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,540
Saviour?

900
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,440
Kill the chicken and take the eggs.

901
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,790
Let him die in his own bed.

902
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,040
Don't kill him on his way home

903
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,339
after dining as my guest.

904
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,558
Understood!

905
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,570
"Who is the ""chicken""'?”

906
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,300
The Governor.

907
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,350
"And the "eggs?"

908
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,089
I'll cut his balls off!

909
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,530
Diamonds!

910
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,520
My two diamonds!

911
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,360
"Don't worry, sit!”

912
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,730
I'll retrieve your diamonds.

913
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,210
I'm sorry.

914
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,120
"My pleasure, sir.”

915
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,920
Know why I'm sending you?

916
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,030
It's because I'm already dead.

917
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,290
Do you know why?

918
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,509
I shouldn't have implicated you.

919
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,990
"Right! If you are alive,
you'll eventually die.”

920
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,670
"But if you're dead,”

921
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,339
you may live on forever!

922
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,460
Understood.

923
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,620
"Kill the chicken, take the eggs!”

924
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,799
Where's Chief?

925
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,069
Punch drunk!

926
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,410
Where is he?

927
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,170
We're still chatting just now!

928
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,930
"IT must be drunk, too!”

lll sort you out later.

930
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,609
He must've fallen off the horse.

931
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,060
lheard that you slept.

932
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,540
Look up when you speak.

933
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,270
l heard that you slept last night.

934
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,609
I sleep every goddamned night!

935
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,370
Look at me when you speak.

936
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,970
You slept with the bandit?

937
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,180
Do you want a blow-by-blow account?

938
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,799
Tell me more.

939
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,250
"When a seasoned pro
meets a bandit chief,”

940
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,970
anything could happen!

941
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,170
What now?

942
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,000
Whore! Bitch! Vixen! Tramp!

943
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,190
What did you call me?

944
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,080
Whore! Bitch! Vixen! Tramp!

945
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,140
"If 'cl more time,”

946
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,860
lll put you in your place!

947
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,020
Come on!

948
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,610
Idare you!

949
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,480
You're all talk!

950
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,980
“A perverted, dirty old man.”

951
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,860
Could you have bought
the post without my money?

952
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,410
Don't piss me off!

953
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,609
I think the bandit is more able!

954
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,440
What do you mean?

955
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,540
He's got more balls than you!

956
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,330
He's good at getting drunk!

957
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,540
These will make your day!

958
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,550
Three of Huang's clogs died today.

959
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,500
I know they're not worthy of you.

960
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,520
"was going to lead our brothers,”

961
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,560
“engage Huang in a deadly duel,”

962
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,690
and avenge your death.

963
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,070
But I've changed my mind.

964
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,810
I can't take revenge this way.

965
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,320
I can't risk more lives.

966
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,560
"Chief, we're looking for you.”

967
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,890
Why did you signal retreat?

968
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,669
Huang heard your whistling.

969
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,660
I knew that I was safe.

970
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,810
"Leave,
I want to spend time alone with Six.”

971
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,370
“It has finally dawned on me,”

972
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,170
why I became a bandit in the first place.

973
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,050
I was no match for these people.

974
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,400
"But l must take them
on at their own game now,”

975
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,710
and to win for you.

976
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,380
What the heck?

977
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,390
You stole my diamonds.

978
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,850
They're not meant for you.

979
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,820
They're a gift for Mrs. Governor!

980
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,689
Which of us is the Governor?

981
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,710
Who's the Governor?

982
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,490
Tell me who's the Governor!

983
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,589
You want to kill me?

984
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,580
Or to sleep with me?

985
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,440
Is there a difference?

986
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,350
It's different!

987
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,319
"Lcan bed you first, and kill you later.”

988
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,609
Then you'd better kill me now.

989
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,930
I don't sleep with dead bodies!

990
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,260
"lL won't take drunken
advantage of a widow,”

991
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,080
"so I'll just sleep next to you,”

992
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,880
not with youl!

993
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,529
Holy smoke! I was fooled!

994
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,710
You and Wu both faked death!

995
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,500
That's right.

996
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,740
Why dressed up as a bandit?

997
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,070
"I'm a bandit. ""Pocky' Zhang's my boss!"

998
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,650
"What's your rank, then?”

999
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,480
lam Three!

1000
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,089
"Three, you've hit big time!”

1001
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,259
You've got yourself a fake!

1002
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,640
"Chief, con't listen to his bullshit!"

1003
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,120
He plotted Six's death.

1004
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,350
Let me shoot him now!

1005
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,060
Chief?

1006
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,750
"Were you sent by "Pocky" Zhang?”

1007
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,520
Or by Master Huang?

1008
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,610
I want the right answer!

1009
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,350
Master Huang.

1010
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,279
Why?

1011
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,370
"We commit crimes posing as bandits,”

1012
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,480
forcing governors to launch expeditions.

1013
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,110
Creating more chances
for Huang to swindle.

1014
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:11,750
And then?

1015
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,550
That's all.

1016
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,279
Really?

1017
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,010
I don't know anything else!

1018
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,460
Why did you target my bed?

1019
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,830
"Master said you're arrogant,”

1020
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,010
a threat!

1021
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,350
Take him a message:

1022
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,690
"While he likes people to fake death,”

1023
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,750
I'm fond of killing people more than once!

1024
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,610
Letting me off again?

1025
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,890
He can only understand words you say.

1026
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,740
"Chief, you're...”

1027
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,300
"Yes, Pocky’ Zhang.”

1028
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,879
Where are your pockmarks?

1029
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,279
“Does your boss have
Huang” inscribed on his face?”

1030
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,500
That's true.

1031
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,670
"My friend,”

1032
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,920
"you must not tell anyone,”

1033
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,760
“that lam "Pocky" Zhang.”

1034
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:44,990
You have my word!

1035
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,700
"[ never want to be a governor,”

1036
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,919
but you still bought me this post!

1037
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,260
"The position has been usurped,”

1038
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,718
and now you're dead too.

1039
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,950
Huang has brought his militia.

1040
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,879
Wanting to fight bandits with us.

1041
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,250
She was my wife.

1042
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,720
lam the governor!

1043
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,490
Let him in.

1044
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,220
lam Ma Bangde!

1045
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,020
Is the Governor okay?

1046
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,200
Give chase! Don't let anyone get away.

1047
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,930
Those goddamned bandits!

1048
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,620
Scum of the earth!

1049
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,140
The Governor has only just arrived...

1050
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,279
"Said I didn't want to be a governor,”

1051
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,520
but you still bought me this post!

1052
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,020
"The governership is now mine,”

1053
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,439
but you've left me on my own.

1054
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,120
She was my wife.

1055
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,990
lam the governor!

1056
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,180
lam Ma Bangde!

1057
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,830
You're too hot-headed.

1058
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,790
You shouldn't have shot those bandits.

1059
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,910
They'll take revenge for sure.

1060
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,870
Don't cry.

1061
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,370
She died for Goose Town.

1062
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,150
She deserves a proper burial!

1063
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,580
Invite every townsfolk to attend.

1064
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,290
Certainly. I'll take care of it.

1065
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,810
..to be relieved of life’s burden.

1066
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,790
Thus we commit their bodies to earth.

1067
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,860
"From which they came,”

1068
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,880
and do now return.

1069
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,080
"We know we can place ourselves,”

1070
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,439
"in the hands of our Father in Heaven,”

1071
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,910
who has promised us eternal life.

1072
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,109
"We're from "Pocky" Zhang's gang.”

1073
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,799
We're here for the money.

1074
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,450
Sorry for the intrusion!

1075
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,030
We're looking for...

1076
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,050
“Huang, heads of families,
show yourselves!"

1077
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,440
Hu Wan?

1078
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,209
"Father, our apologies.”

1079
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,799
“Ladies and gentlemen,”

1080
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,589
the rest has nothing to do with this.

1081
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,558
Leave!

1082
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,430
Gag them!

1083
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,050
Get up!

1084
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,730
I'm the governor of this county.

1085
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,118
Il volunteer to be your hostage.

1086
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,200
Just shut up!

1087
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,070
We spare you to deliver our ransom.

1088
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,050
"Three days, pay up and they go home.”

1089
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,160
“If not, they die.”

1090
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,490
- Shoot me first! - Stop it!

1091
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:52,740
You're asking for it.

1092
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,250
Beat him up!

1093
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,650
You talk too much!

1094
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,240
I'll teach you a lesson!

1095
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,500
Stop messing with my mask!

1096
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,120
Don't screw things up.

1097
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,100
Take them away!

1098
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,910
-It's him. - Three!

1099
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,730
Pack them!

1100
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,540
No one goes until we get his ransom.

1101
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,190
"Butler, stay calm!"

1102
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,490
"One, two, three..."

1103
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,879
Huang is in there!

1104
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,750
"One, two, three..."

1105
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,410
You plotted this scheme

1106
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,620
over my wife's dead body?!

1107
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,750
lam impressed!

1108
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,718
We'll kill the hostages in 3 days!

1109
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,509
"Remember, lam Nine!”

1110
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,520
That was quite a show.

1111
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,960
- Almost pass for real! - Sure.

1112
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,420
I'll be more convincing with some blood.

1113
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,230
Right!

1114
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,940
Was that necessary?

1115
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,630
Was that really necessary?

1116
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,430
Shoot! Give them hell!

1117
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,850
"Butler, hold your fire!”

1118
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,680
We need time to prepare the ransom.

1119
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,330
Otherwise they will kill the hostages.

1120
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,640
Let them kill the hostages.

1121
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,650
"In fact, l want them dead!"

1122
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,740
Why do you think I need a double?

1123
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,100
lll not pay any ransom.

1124
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,240
But the families will pay up.

1125
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,009
You'll get your money for sure.

1126
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,550
“Brother,”

1127
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,980
I'm fine.

1128
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,190
Don't worry about me.

1129
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,290
Hu Wan must have defected to Zhang.

1130
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,740
"He must be found,”

1131
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,140
dead or alive!

1132
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,480
"A double is useful. Find me one, too.”

1133
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,439
"Pocky, have you no shame?”

1134
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,700
The game's up!

1135
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,630
Really?

1136
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,220
"Yes, game's up.”

1137
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,990
The fun has only just begun.

1138
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,870
Amen!

1139
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,820
Release them.

1140
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,330
Here's a souvenir. Don't look back. Scram!

1141
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,270
"Ma'am, if you're still alive,”

1142
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,560
you'd see this for yourself.

1143
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,320
"If she was alive, there'll be nothing here.”

1144
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,900
She traded her life for this.

1145
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,120
Doesn't Six's life count?

1146
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,110
It's different.

1147
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,020
Goddamned it isn't!

1148
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:20,660
My wife.

1149
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,610
Whose wife?

1150
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,300
Mine.

1151
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,120
What about her?

1152
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,970
She was murdered by Huang.

1153
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,640
But Six died at his own hands.

1154
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,660
"TI shoot you dead,”

1155
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,860
for demeaning our Six!

1156
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,220
"Two, put down your gun.”

1157
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,120
Stop pointing your gun at me!

1158
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,230
I've never seen bandits as dumb as you!

1159
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,110
Stop laughing! Cut it out.

1160
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,670
I didn't belittle Six! He had courage!

1161
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,200
He was a hero!

1162
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,930
"Yes, he was heroic.”

1163
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,049
My wife went to sleep and died in bed.

1164
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,420
"Don't cry! Your wife was heroic, too.”

1165
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,840
"Brothers, why are we here?”

1166
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:58,730
To get rich!

1167
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,700
Have we succeeded?

1168
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,380
"Yes, we have.”

1169
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,250
So let's leave!

1170
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,129
Let's go.

1171
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,080
Why are you still in tears?

1172
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:04,800
I'm overjoyed.

1173
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,130
"Chief, when cdo we leave?”

1174
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,410
We're not.

1175
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,290
This is not Huang’s money.

1176
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,970
But the money's still good!

1177
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,910
I want Huang’s fortune.

1178
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,110
You refuse to take
money from rich or poor...

1179
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,500
"The blood debt of Six and Madam,”

1180
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,390
must be repaid by Huang!

1181
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,560
You're gambling with our lives!

1182
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,050
You call this a gamble?

1183
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,790
"Yes, and you'll end up a loser!"

1184
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,030
We're not leaving.

1185
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,910
We don't want this money either.

1186
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,010
Give them away.

1187
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,540
But Chief...

1188
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,050
Who do you want to give this to?

1189
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,310
To the poor.

1190
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,799
Who are the poor?

1191
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,970
Those in dire need.

1192
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,109
"You wore ""Nine™
when you ambushed me.”

1193
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,200
What amI wearing now?

1194
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:18,960
Feel it for yourself.

1195
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,300
™"One™"

1196
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,440
"Fun, isn't it?”

1197
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,129
Brilliant!

1198
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,439
Haven't you always wanted to play God?

1199
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:26,960
Yes.

1200
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,190
What has it got to do with Huang?

1201
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,279
"If lam God,
tidding him should be a piece of cake.”

1202
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,030
I think l know her.

1203
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,240
So doll

1204
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,780
Let's give her some money.

1205
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,940
Hang on!

1206
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,700
"She is not exactly poor, is she?”

1207
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,020
So who are the poor?

1208
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,460
Those who're forced
to sell their own children.

1209
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,670
Correct! She was sold by her parents. !

1210
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,710
Make sense!

1211
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,549
So you're bandits in disguise!

1212
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,930
We've come to give you money.

1213
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,780
Kill her. No option!

1214
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,670
Whoever sees a bandit's face has to die.

1215
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,480
It's your own rule.

1216
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,350
Counselor.

1217
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,400
The first to see our faces

1218
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,120
was youl!

1219
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,930
“Our mission is only half accomplished,”

1220
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,770
and we're bickering over a broad!

1221
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,310
You're the lead
drummer at my inauguration?

1222
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,100
What's your name?

1223
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,529
Call me Flora.

1224
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,990
Are you related to Huang?

1225
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,730
"No, he bought me.”

1226
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,920
There are posters by the city gate.

1227
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,990
Know what they're for?

1228
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,970
"Bounty offers for ""Pocky'” Zhang.”

1229
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,060
"Lam "Pocky" Zhang.”

1230
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,170
The bandits were behind this.

1231
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,750
ls it because of the masks?

1232
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,680
We have masks tool

1233
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,440
Then it must be the Governor!

1234
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,590
He is giving money to the poor?

1235
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,320
No bogus governor would do that.

1236
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,720
I want you to dress up as bandits.

1237
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,620
Exactly like them.

1238
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,310
"What they give out, you take away.”

1239
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,820
Let's cause havoc!

1240
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:56,790
Understood.

1241
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,819
I'll have him checkmate in 3 moves!

1242
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,600
But we've made 3 moves already.

1243
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,010
Really?

1244
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,950
"Driving Six to death,
killing the chicken for the eggs..."

1245
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,300
Those were old moves!

1246
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,220
I'm talking about 3 new moves!

1247
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,350
"First, check out the Governor.”

1248
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,450
He doesn't act like
someone who'd buy a post.

1249
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,140
“At least, he’s not Ma Bangde.”

1250
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,819
Have you found Hu Wan?

1251
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,850
Hu Wan? Not yet.

1252
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,780
How come he is still missing?

1253
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,960
"Don't worry, sir. I'll find him.”

1254
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,090
Do you know...

1255
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,170
how much I miss him?

1256
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,780
"On master's order, let's wreak havoc!"

1257
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,500
Let's show how we can mess things up!

1258
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,520
Did you get your share?

1259
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,200
Yes.

1260
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,810
How are you going to thank us?

1261
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,980
Any way you like.

1262
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,750
"Any way I like? Great, you said it!”

1263
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,760
Know why we gave you money?

1264
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,590
It is because you're benevolent.

1265
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:15,840
Benevolent?

1266
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,940
We can do even better!

1267
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,470
Batter! Batter!

1268
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,859
"Governor, we want justice!”

1269
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,230
It's all over! We're finished!

1270
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,140
Even rabbits wouldn't do this.

1271
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,890
"Six men, in front of her husband,"

1272
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,090
and in broad daylight!

1273
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,120
Disgusting!

1274
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,640
I've never even cone this with lights on!

1275
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,730
“If you're desperate, paid for it!”

1276
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,220
Be extravagant!

1277
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,140
Visit a brothel! !

1278
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,990
It won't cost much!

1279
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,690
You don't even have to be discreet.

1280
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,000
This is stupid!

1281
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,990
You're worse than bandits!

1282
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,170
And we'd wanted
to leave a good impression!

1283
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,270
One word comes to mind: revolting!

1284
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,220
Our scheme is now in ruin!

1285
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,070
Disgusting!

1286
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,840
“Filthy, nauseating...”

1287
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,280
Revolting!

1288
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,650
You know me.

1289
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,940
"When it comes to this sort of thing,”

1290
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,760
I prefer to be passive...

1291
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,480
"You know me,”

1292
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,430
"Lam a lone wolf,”

1293
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,620
always acting on my own.

1294
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,950
"You know me,”

1295
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,640
"If it was me,"

1296
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,000
she wouldn't have lived to squeal.

1297
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,880
You know me.

1298
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,770
"I may be the eldest,”

1299
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,450
butlam...

1300
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,720
still a virgin.

1301
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,370
Stop staring at me!

1302
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,399
You know me well.

1303
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,960
"If lwas responsible,”

1304
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,750
“the one on the receiving end,”

1305
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,669
would have been her husband!

1306
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,140
Each of you is so unique.

1307
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,380
But...

1308
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,960
I've been betrayed.

1309
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,390
By who?

1310
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,160
Tang!

1311
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,259
How could he overlook the obvious?

1312
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,570
Huang is behind this scam.

1313
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,080
Tang's not behaving properly.

1314
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,860
He must be up to something.

1315
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,090
Come out! Stand up!

1316
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,089
Who have you been seeing lately?

1317
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,660
Master Huang?!

1318
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,040
Don't move! Raise your legs.

1319
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:56,670
Who's there?

1320
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,750
"A boy, my child!”

1321
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,390
Your child?!

1322
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,198
"Yes, mine.”

1323
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,210
You're a child?

1324
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,430
How old are you

1325
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,209
Eight!

1326
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,020
Come out!

1327
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,580
He's eight?

1328
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,180
I find it hard to believe myself!

1329
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,640
As tall as Mom when he was three.

1330
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,038
Taller than me when he was five...

1331
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,880
Screw youl!

1332
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:17,900
"Mom, mom!"

1333
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,630
Screw youl!

1334
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,260
Hands off my boy!

1335
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,430
". Screw youl - Screw you, too!”

1336
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:21,990
Screw youl!

1337
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:22,509
Screw youl!

1338
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,319
She's your mother

1339
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,290
"Yes, she is.”

1340
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,240
And he's your dad?

1341
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,210
None of your goddamned business.

1342
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,650
Stop it!

1343
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,860
"Ma'am, what's going on?”

1344
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,030
I come for money.
I won't leave until he pays.

1345
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,310
He owes you?

1346
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,900
It was eight years ago in Shanxi.

1347
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,580
This crook made me pregnant.

1348
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:46,990
He is a man of poor repute.

1349
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,680
"Ran up a mountain of debts,”

1350
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:49,840
then vanished without trace.

1351
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,609
Creditors kidnapped my younger son.

1352
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,799
He'll die if l don't clear his debts.

1353
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,930
He's not my child

1354
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,000
He is!

1355
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,300
- He isn't. - He is!

1356
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,279
He is! ] counted the days!

1357
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,050
He swindled someone.

1358
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,940
"His victims tracked you down,”

1359
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,890
and kidnapped your younger son.

1360
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,220
Threatening death...

1361
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,050
"Yes, sol need the money.”

1362
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,100
Pay her.

1363
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,760
Money! The stones...

1364
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,930
"Just a small gift,
to mark our acquaintance.”

1365
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,470
I don't want these. I want real money.

1366
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:21,770
You stupid idiot...

1367
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,960
These diamonds are worth a fortune!

1368
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,790
No kidding?

1369
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,830
Bicycle!

1370
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,080
I can ride that?

1371
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,620
We rode one once in Shanghai.

1372
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,360
You have been to Shanghai?

1373
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,360
Pudong!

1374
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,400
I'm sure you'd fall over.

1375
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,410
Come on. Try it.

1376
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,360
Hop on!

1377
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,760
Let's gol!

1378
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,150
Bicycle!

1379
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,470
Bicycle! !

1380
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,270
made of flesh and bones...

1381
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,700
Havel come to the wrong place?

1382
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,730
Or at the wrong time?

1383
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,069
Serve your customers,

1384
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,300
They're my customers.

1385
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,390
We're here first.

1386
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,150
Have they paid?

1387
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,770
"The "bicycle ride" doesn't count.”

1388
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,250
Show them out.

1389
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,070
But I've paid my dues.

1390
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,460
With what?

1391
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,850
Money you received through the window?

1392
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,440
Isn't that bandit money?

1393
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,230
l wonder if they are also bandits.

1394
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,279
"No, they work for the Governor.”

1395
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,170
How dare you pay
their tab with bandit money? !

1396
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,950
Cut the crap! Let her go!

1397
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,970
White knights to the rescue!

1398
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,220
White knights to the rescue!

1399
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,750
I'm no damsel in distress.

1400
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,970
They're no knights in shining armour.

1401
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,730
“After all, they're customers.”

1402
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,700
I've already settled their bills.

1403
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,740
"You taught me yourself,”

1404
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,309
customers are always supreme

1405
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,320
Isn't that right?

1406
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,760
Yes!

1407
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,200
Correct!

1408
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,649
“Instead of knights coming to your rescue,”

1409
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,660
they are being saved by a damsel.

1410
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,800
You're turning into a Mata Hari.

1411
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,090
You've just pissed him off.

1412
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,790
He doesn't need to be pissed off.

1413
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,200
“If he wants you dead,”

1414
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,860
you die!

1415
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:27,750
I should've put a bullet through his head.

1416
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,389
That would be the end of it.

1417
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,090
Don't be silly.

1418
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:34,109
Chief wants to go after his fortune.

1419
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,490
“If you're here for the money, then...”

1420
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,930
why are you giving it away?

1421
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:42,629
Is this the right colour?

1422
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,540
Lower the umbrella.

1423
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,290
The red is fine. Come over here!

1424
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,640
“First apply green, then red.”

1425
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,880
". Okay, got it. - Understand?”

1426
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,460
Don't forget to lock up.

1427
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,030
- Bring the shovels. - Got it.

1428
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,549
- Six shovels! - Got it.7

1429
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,700
"Chief, how do llook?"

1430
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,310
Hair is fine. Face is flushed. Come here...

1431
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,120
Apply that to a dead man's face

1432
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,879
will turn it into pinkish red.

1433
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,039
- Got it. - Good.

1434
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,630
Green.

1435
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,720
Come here.

1436
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,080
Green is the base colour.!

1437
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,310
Add that and you'll get this!

1438
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,970
". Oh, lsee... - Got it?”

1439
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,169
You want shovels like these?

1440
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,480
Shorten them and put them in the bag.

1441
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,080
How short?

1442
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:24,800
Short enough for the bag.

1443
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:25,390
Okay.

1444
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,010
Hurry up! Six shovels!

1445
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,299
Where are you going?

1446
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,720
What's with the make-up?

1447
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:30,840
Are you leaving for good?

1448
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,840
Come with us to give out money?

1449
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,559
"No, what a waste!”

1450
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,970
- So you're not coming? - No.

1451
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,790
Now listen.

1452
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,730
"This time, may come back,”

1453
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,059
“but, then again, I may not.”

1454
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,900
"If ldo, you can leave with us.”

1455
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,420
“If not, you plan your own getaway.”

1456
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,959
Aren't you just giving out money?

1457
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,620
"Yes, we are.”

1458
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,470
“By the way,

1459
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,269
“at midnight tonight,”

1460
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,620
someone may come calling.

1461
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,519
Engage him in conversation.

1462
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,900
"Whatever the topics,”

1463
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,050
just chat along with him.

1464
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,440
But...

1465
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,560
"you have to stay calm,”

1466
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,590
make it nice and slow.

1467
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,119
You saw it with your own eyes?

1468
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:17,920
Indeed.

1469
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,799
You saw the Governor
leading his men out?

1470
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,530
"Yes, with my own eyes.”

1471
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,890
They've gone to give out money?

1472
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,009
"Yes, indeed.”

1473
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,299
Which mask does he wear?

1474
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,279
“Mine

1475
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,370
Splendid. Tonight we shall only kill!

1476
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:32,630
Our target?

1477
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,690
"The Governor, wearing "Nine!"

1478
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,269
"Masked or not, consider this done!" !

1479
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,280
“All of you, put on your masks!"

1480
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,750
"Firefight with bandits,”

1481
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,200
“intrepid Governor killed!"

1482
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,730
That would be music to my ears!

1483
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,140
Which mask is their leader wearing?

1484
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,360
“Mine

1485
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,140
"Let's all change to ""four'™!"

1486
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,890
"Kill anyone who is not a "four!"

1487
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,440
Which mask is their leader wearing?

1488
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,470
BOUL

1489
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,550
"Know what we'll be wearing, then?”

1490
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,380
Got it.

1491
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,220
"Let's get rid of ""Nine™'!"

1492
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,220
"Master Huang, what brings you here?”

1493
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,910
Can I not visit the magistracy?

1494
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,089
Light it!

1495
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,620
"When the cat prowls,
the mouse seizes control!”

1496
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,000
Sit down!

1497
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,570
Where's the Governor?

1498
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,890
"Everyone is a "Four? I'm confused!"

1499
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:02,889
"Tm confused, too!”

1500
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,260
It's bad to stay out in a thunderstorm.

1501
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,280
"Yes, it's awful.”

1502
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,129
Let's reschedule. Split!

1503
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:08,900
Be in touch!

1504
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,280
What now?

1505
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,119
It's back to square one.

1506
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,309
"Yes, square one.”

1507
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,740
"Split! 1, 2, 3."

1508
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,440
Listen! Someone's been shot.

1509
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,240
Soon someone will mourn.

1510
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,100
Mourning will lead to confessions.

1511
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,340
Confess!

1512
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,080
You've at least three confessions to make.

1513
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,210
I shouldn't have
given your diamonds away.

1514
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,650
Try again.

1515
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,400
"l suggested "to kill someone,
first destroy his soul.”

1516
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,910
Not that either.

1517
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,009
We should have
hosted the banquet instead.

1518
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,730
The banquet?.

1519
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,930
I can't hear you.

1520
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,438
I can't hear youl!

1521
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,629
There was a shoot-out.

1522
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,160
Six killed. We're unscathed.

1523
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,090
"Counselor, come take a look.”

1524
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,510
Your saviour may be among them.

1525
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,660
"No, you are my saviour.”

1526
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,760
"If that is the case,”

1527
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,670
"remove his mask,”

1528
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:49,769
and have a good look.

1529
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,510
"Come on, lights!"

1530
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,660
What's going on?

1531
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,800
What's happening here?

1532
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,009
It's Hu Wan!

1533
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,690
Hu Wan?

1534
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,920
How come it's Hu Wan?

1535
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,179
This is weird!

1536
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,438
“All those wearing ""four"""

1537
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,349
are my men!

1538
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:14,130
Where are the bandits?

1539
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,410
Where are they?

1540
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,050
Hu Wan was a bandit!

1541
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,380
He was one of them!

1542
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,990
"Murderers and kidnappers,”

1543
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,310
“those who terrorised Goose Town,”

1544
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,570
were led by your own Hu Wan!

1545
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,830
I wondered why you
didn't fund the expedition.

1546
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,769
You may even be the bandit chief himself!

1547
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,490
You dare to turn your guns on me?

1548
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,850
You dare to turn your guns on me?

1549
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,910
Do you want a shoot-out

1550
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,820
Take a good look at a bandit's fate!

1551
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,890
ld still have him shot

1552
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,480
if he was my father...

1553
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,440
sooner or later!

1554
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:06,190
You just shot Hu Wan 5 more times.

1555
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,680
You want to show justice?

1556
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,120
Or to make sure he's dead?

1557
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,620
"Only "Pocky"
Zhang would want to silence him.”

1558
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,309
"If you'd only wanted to show justice,”

1559
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,560
why not fund my expedition instead.

1560
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:20,769
Done deal!

1561
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,570
You shall receive a nice surprise in 3 days.

1562
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,070
He was Hu Wan's boss.

1563
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,320
"Now he's your boss, too.”

1564
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,170
Please act as our interpreter.

1565
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,140
"What is a "nice surprise?”

1566
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,880
Interpret for me

1567
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,700
There's nothing to interpret

1568
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,450
"What on earth is a nice surprise?”

1569
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,360
It is what it is.

1570
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,879
"You just don't get it, do you?”

1571
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,358
Go ahead and interpret. What is it

1572
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,299
A nice surprise!

1573
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,490
Translate for me!

1574
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,039
"What is this "nice surprise""?"!

1575
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,410
"What is this goddamned "
“nice surprise?”

1576
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,640
"What is this "nice surprise?”

1577
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,360
"It means that in 3 days,”

1578
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,100
"TH put up $1.8 million
for your campaign,

1579
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,510
to fix my crippled leg!

1580
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,680
Is that clear?

1581
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,120
"That's the "nice surprise!"

1582
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,419
Interpret.

1583
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,150
Interpret.

1584
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,780
"The nice surprise is that,”

1585
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,030
“he will give you $1.8 million in 3 days,”

1586
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,570
to fund an expedition to fix his broken leg!

1587
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,810
What a nice surprise!

1588
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,219
I'm willing to wait 3 days.

1589
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,940
Master Huang.

1590
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,639
"L adore my Counselor,”

1591
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,900
I can't let you have him.

1592
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,509
Fair enough.

1593
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,450
Six.

1594
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,720
We're almost there.

1595
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,190
"Say, 70% clone.”

1596
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,390
I've asked Two to take off first.

1597
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,550
He'll wait for us at Emerald Creek.

1598
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,010
I will keep my promise.

1599
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,389
Know what you have to do?

1600
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,950
Yes.

1601
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,210
"When $1.8 million is in hand,”

1602
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,410
I'll consider Six avenged.

1603
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:17,990
I feel that...

1604
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,259
my wife's death is also avenged.

1605
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,410
"Saviour, you still want to kill Huang?”

1606
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,130
I'm not your saviour. Huang is.

1607
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,269
You're my saviour. Not him.

1608
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,110
Did you think I was lying dead back there?

1609
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,250
"No, of course not.”

1610
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,120
Sure?

1611
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:42,880
Never crossed my mind.

1612
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,620
I've to hand this to you.

1613
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,830
"Abracadabra, and Hu Wan
magically appeared!"

1614
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,030
But I really clidn't get it.

1615
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,129
"Those six bodies,”

1616
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,990
"such a distance, so little time,”

1617
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,438
how did you move them so quickly?

1618
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,440
Huang and I took the shortcut.

1619
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,610
You've to carry six bodies.

1620
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,110
How did you manage?

1621
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:09,250
They weren't buried at the magistracy.

1622
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,420
The bodies were buried there all along.

1623
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:15,100
lensure the standoff
was at their burial site.

1624
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,910
That's where I led Huang to.

1625
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,190
"I'm convinced you're "Pocky" Zhang.”

1626
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,810
Sit down.

1627
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,930
My name is Zhang

1628
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:32,800
I know that.

1629
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,269
Zhang Muzhi.

1630
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,790
A fine name!

1631
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,260
It has auspicious meanings.

1632
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,160
You father must have high hopes.

1633
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,240
“After graduating from military academy,”

1634
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,760
l enlisted in General Cai's army.

1635
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,570
Served as captain of his riflemen.

1636
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,269
How old were you then?

1637
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,340
Seventeen.

1638
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,540
A youthful genius!

1639
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,550
"Cai was wounded during
the Battle of Luzhou,”

1640
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,970
and later died in exile in Japan.

1641
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,780
I came back alone.

1642
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:09,900
The country was in total chaos.

1643
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,240
Sol became a bandit.

1644
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,110
"They nicknamed me "Pocky."

1645
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,900
Shame! You're so handsome.

1646
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,880
"People have an odd way of thinking,”

1647
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,360
that bandits shouldn't have proper names.

1648
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,180
"They love calling their bandits ""Pocky"".”

1649
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,940
"Not only that,”

1650
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,120
they want their bandits scarred and scary.

1651
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:41,530
People can be so ignorant.

1652
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,179
My own story started like this...

1653
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,940
"[ too was a tenderly 17,”

1654
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,210
and so was she.

1655
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,130
"Stop, I'm not interested.”

1656
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:00,830
I don't confess to just anyone

1657
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,799
I've to continue now that I started.

1658
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,460
Take it back!

1659
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,750
It's all made up anyway.

1660
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,460
You're a conman!

1661
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,040
"In our part of China,”

1662
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,830
there are only two such landmines.

1663
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,140
Both limited edition.

1664
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,750
Made in U.S.A. - 1910!

1665
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,940
Bang and everything's in smithereens!

1666
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:47,650
"So if it doesn't take some lives with it,”

1667
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:52,179
it'd be such a waste.

1668
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,830
Well...

1669
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,540
where's the other one?

1670
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:57,630
It exploded.

1671
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,400
Really?

1672
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,520
The first bang during the 1911 Revolution!

1673
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,120
"Oh yes, I've heard!

1674
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,040
It went off at Xinhail!

1675
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,340
Xinhai's not a place!
It's a revolutionary icon!

1676
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,410
You should've said so earlier.

1677
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,240
"Now, tell me about this one.”

1678
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:14,580
You must stay focused.

1679
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,450
"Lwant it to shake the world,”

1680
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,800
I want it to rock and roll!

1681
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:21,950
Understood.

1682
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,070
"Pick a good spot,”

1683
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,299
find an auspicious time...

1684
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,559
"So, who's our target?”

1685
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,120
You should've asked...

1686
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,620
™ Where?"

1687
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:30,560
"Where, then?

1688
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,700
Where the expedition force must pass.

1689
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,080
Yet another expedition?

1690
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,140
Canhave a bigger cut this time?

1691
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,000
You can have it all
if you're the real Pocky!

1692
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,919
"No problem, sir. I'ma fake.

1693
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,900
I'll take whatever you can spare.

1694
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,210
When do you want it to blow up?

1695
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,210
That's our denouement

1696
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:51,480
Let's play out our second act slowly.

1697
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:52,849
Hold still!

1698
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,450
Let her speak.

1699
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,900
Two left without saying goodbye.

1700
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,290
Now Three is leaving too.

1701
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,470
You are tearing us apart!

1702
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,490
You're doing this for Two or Three?

1703
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,560
Shut up!

1704
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,290
"I know your left hand's intention,”

1705
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,740
I know your right hand's intention.

1706
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,870
But both hands together... don't get it.

1707
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,599
I'd rather be dead!

1708
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:15,620
Typical Scorpian!

1709
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,810
Shut up!

1710
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,730
"Sit down, all of you.”

1711
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,590
Let me talk to her.

1712
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,880
You were bought by Huang?

1713
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:25,870
Yes.

1714
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:26,860
Been mistreated?

1715
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:27,570
Yes.

1716
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,360
Have I ever laid hands on you?

1717
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,050
No.

1718
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:29,860
- Hate him? - Yes.

1719
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:30,769
-And me? -No.

1720
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,710
Then why threaten me with a gun?

1721
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:33,769
Because you're a good person.

1722
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,560
What?

1723
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,050
What kind of stupid logic is that?

1724
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,919
You threaten me because I'm good?

1725
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,440
"Flora, Chief is right!"

1726
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,250
Go back! Sit down!

1727
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,080
You bunch of idiots!

1728
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,370
I told you to give money to the poor.

1729
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:48,600
And you gave it to her?

1730
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,910
I warned you but nobody listened.

1731
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,900
Shut up! You're a born cheat!

1732
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,469
Always plotting to swindle me.

1733
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,240
Working with Huang behind my back.

1734
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,310
"When a bandit confronts a godfather,”

1735
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,639
the outcome should be simple.

1736
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,460
How can you screw up so badly?

1737
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,250
How dare you still point your gun at me?

1738
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,320
“If l don't dare to draw a gun on you,”

1739
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,880
I'll never make a good bandit.

1740
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,460
I dare you all!

1741
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,790
Whose quirky idea is this?

1742
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,089
Whose?

1743
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,639
Il was just teasing her

1744
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,850
You want to become one of us?

1745
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,780
"Yes, to give money out to the poor,”

1746
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,420
to hear and share their joy.

1747
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,860
You're now one of us.

1748
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,389
But lam not prepared.

1749
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,350
No need!

1750
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,870
Did you make preparation?

1751
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:38,640
No.

1752
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,750
How about you?

1753
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,580
I was eating hotpot and singing songs.

1754
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,160
My train plunged andl ended up here.

1755
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,040
We're leaving Goose Town soon.

1756
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:50,799
But you have to stay.

1757
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,290
No.

1758
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,810
A bandit must have discipline.

1759
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,150
Chief is right

1760
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,730
"But she has a point, too.”

1761
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,950
lI have an important mission for you.

1762
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,440
Ithink you can manage.

1763
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,840
This is our nice surprise!

1764
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,420
A nice surprise indeed. !

1765
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,560
He is not Ma!

1766
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,129
"Now that we know,"

1767
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:26,650
my next move can be more leisurely.

1768
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,559
Leisurely?

1769
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,120
Impersonating a governor
warrants capital punishment.

1770
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,660
His whole clan dies with him!

1771
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,440
"Master, just you wait.”

1772
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,719
lll go and blow him away!

1773
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,959
No!

1774
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,120
"Before they die,”

1775
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,429
I want to toy with these circus monkeys.

1776
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,620
"But Master,”

1777
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,970
they're not worth your while.

1778
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,219
"No, [must toy with them!”

1779
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,830
"Otherwise, I couldn't get others to pay,”

1780
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,599
“the Governor couldn't
go and fight the bandits,”

1781
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,920
and they wouldn't trot on my landmine!

1782
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,000
Huang has a double.

1783
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:03,700
They are indistinguishable.

1784
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,130
I can't tell if this is really Huang.

1785
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,220
Ineed you to check for me.

1786
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,090
He's a fake.

1787
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,049
He's not Huang.

1788
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,310
Told you I'm not Huang!

1789
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,020
lreally am not him

1790
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,309
I'm certain.

1791
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,800
Let me go.

1792
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,730
Keep an eye on him until our return

1793
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,260
“If you have to, use your guns.”

1794
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,260
I've never used a gun.

1795
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,950
"Three, show her how."

1796
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,950
Is that your photo?

1797
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:50,950
"Yes, it's mine.

1798
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,290
Sure?

1799
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,260
"Yes,"

1800
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,080
I was slimmer then.

1801
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,210
I don't think it's you.

1802
01:26:58,640 --> 01:26:59,800
Itisn't?

1803
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:00,840
"No, it isn't.”

1804
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,519
I don't think so either.

1805
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,410
"No, that ain't me.”

1806
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,358
What is this all about?

1807
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,759
I was totally baffled myself.

1808
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:12,429
"When I bought the post, l needed papers.

1809
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,210
"had my picture taken at a gallery,”

1810
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,240
and that's what they gave me.

1811
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,200
I said the man in the photo wasn't me.

1812
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,690
They insisted that it was.

1813
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,830
I've no choice but to use it.

1814
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,610
Is that so?

1815
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:28,970
Bullshit!

1816
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,219
That's obviously me!

1817
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,450
lam the real Ma Bangde.

1818
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,920
Is that so?

1819
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:39,370
Iwas ambushed
by bandits on my way here.

1820
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,199
He saved! my life.

1821
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,830
So I let him take the post.

1822
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,570
“After all, he’s my nephew.”

1823
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,300
"Uncle, we shouldn't be telling him this.”

1824
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:49,840
Shut up!

1825
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:53,559
"I've travelled all over China,”

1826
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,019
Ihave been governor in 9 counties.

1827
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:00,119
l excel in confusing facts with fiction!

1828
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,730
"So, Governor Ma...”

1829
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,000
Yes?

1830
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,330
He's addressing me.

1831
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,320
You were saying?

1832
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,160
"Just as l uncover the truth,”

1833
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,310
you blow your own cover!

1834
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,100
What a coincidence.

1835
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:15,740
™" Stop frowning to dispel ill feelings,

1836
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,120
“and brush aside quarrels with a smile."

1837
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,700
Want to make peace?

1838
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,650
Splendid. Where's my double?

1839
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,810
Return him and we'll call it quits.

1840
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:25,870
We've killed him.

1841
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,690
Which asshole ordered his execution?

1842
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,809
You're that asshole!

1843
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,490
I dare you to pull your trigger!

1844
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:36,970
Lay down your guns!

1845
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,490
I know I could take you out first.

1846
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,940
Put down your guns on my count of three!

1847
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,810
"One, two, three!"

1848
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,930
“Huang, put it down!”

1849
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,820
"He may be a brute, but you too?”

1850
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,230
You're the worst!

1851
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,210
When are you leaving for your expedition?

1852
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,270
We aren't.

1853
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,140
We can't leave without funding.

1854
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,430
We can't fight without leaving!

1855
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,040
You've failed to live up to your promise.

1856
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,640
You had agreed to

1857
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:06,910
lead the contribution

1858
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,809
in order to make the others pay.

1859
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,599
"Not only have you not put up any money,”

1860
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,660
you've also fought us posing as bandits!

1861
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,820
Wrong! You saw my men
dressed up as bandits.

1862
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,509
"I saw yours posing as bandits, too.”

1863
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,190
"But when the others see these bandits,"

1864
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,720
they wouldn't know that they're fakes.

1865
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,950
Now is the time to pay for the expedition.

1866
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,810
“If l pay, others will follow suit.”

1867
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,150
Where's your money?

1868
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,460
It's all here.

1869
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,640
I've money stowed away everywhere!

1870
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,120
It's all here?

1871
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,490
This is only half of my share.

1872
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,390
Each family will have to put up the same.

1873
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,200
"Uncle, this is a trap.”

1874
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,570
Atrap?

1875
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,000
"After all these confrontations,”

1876
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,200
he has not put up a dime.

1877
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,059
Why so generous all of a sudden?

1878
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,099
Did I surprise you?

1879
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,799
"Yes, you did.”

1880
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,880
I surprised myself too!

1881
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,000
Want to know why?

1882
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,080
Come here.

1883
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,960
I - want - to - be -

1884
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,410
Governor!

1885
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,340
You?

1886
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,580
I won't make a Governor?

1887
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,060
Don't I look the part?

1888
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,719
"Yes, you can swear in as soon as we leave.

1889
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,139
Goose Town?

1890
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,009
I bought governorship of 6 more counties!

1891
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,049
I can't handle all on my own!

1892
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,709
That is why...

1893
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:26,630
Get out!

1894
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,360
Leave us.

1895
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,590
I need you to govern three of them for me.

1896
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,639
Brilliant! I'm good at governing.

1897
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,510
"Hey, wait...”

1898
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,480
"What about me, then?”

1899
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,600
You...

1900
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,370
“can play “Pocky” Zhang!"

1901
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,870
Great ideal!

1902
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,049
"Since the abdication of the last Emperor,”

1903
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,330
Goose Town has 51 governors.

1904
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,250
"They're all bastards,
parasites and leeches!"

1905
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,799
"But our beloved Governor Ma,”

1906
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,830
“is neither a bastard, parasite,”

1907
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,269
"leech, nor a beast!"

1908
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:39,830
He risks his life to combat the bandits.

1909
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:43,599
He is our hero!

1910
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,030
"Counselor, please.”

1911
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,199
It's time for heroes to take centre stage!

1912
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,830
It's time for heroes to show their mettle!

1913
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:00,650
We must rid ourselves of these bandits.

1914
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:02,080
We don't have a choice.

1915
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,240
“Imagine, if you take your wife out,”

1916
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:09,170
“singing, eating hot pot and be merry,”

1917
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,120
when bandits jump on you from nowhere!

1918
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:15,270
"Llong for a world without thieves,”

1919
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,340
for days of wine and roses!

1920
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,550
"Governor, please!

1921
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:23,960
March!

1922
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,690
"Saviour,"

1923
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,519
want to check this out?

1924
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,309
Isn't that the warrant?

1925
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,370
Read it out loud.

1926
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:48,290
Ma Bangde is hereby appointed...

1927
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,470
Read on!

1928
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,220
8th month of the 8th year of the Republic...

1929
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:53,070
Don't miss out the words in between...

1930
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,110
Ma Bangde is hereby
appointed Kang County governor...

1931
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:57,730
Hang on...

1932
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,650
Kang County?

1933
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,800
Not Goose Town?

1934
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,400
It has always been Kang County.

1935
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:04,350
You bastard!

1936
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,190
Blame yourself!

1937
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,920
"When you dumped me in the river,”

1938
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:10,290
“scared as l was, [had an inspired moment.

1939
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,140
I brought you to Goose Town.

1940
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,470
What's their difference?

1941
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,170
Kang County is affluent.
Goose Town is deadly.

1942
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,860
Why Goose Town for me?

1943
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,460
"You're a tough cookie, aren't you?”

1944
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,990
There can only be two outcomes.

1945
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,100
“Either Huang kills you dead,”

1946
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,240
and I'll move on to Kang County.

1947
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,190
"Or we sort out Huang instead,”

1948
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,530
like what's happening now.

1949
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,570
Very clever!

1950
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,480
You goddamned crook!

1951
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,640
"One day Pocky will get you,
and blast you to hell!”

1952
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,019
You won't. You love me too much,

1953
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,009
"You still think I'm "Pocky Zhang?”

1954
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,190
"If not, the real one must
be somewhere around.”

1955
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,090
We're doomed if we run into him!

1956
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,080
Speak of the devil!

1957
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,199
Tell our men to hold their fire!

1958
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,160
Scatter! Run for the peak.

1959
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,260
10 to the west.

1960
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,720
§ to the south.

1961
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,790
Another group to the east.

1962
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,280
Tell Seven to join Three!

1963
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:31,930
Secure our west flank.

1964
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,950
Message from Three. West is secured.

1965
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:07,080
These pheasant calls really work wonder!

1966
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:07,900
Tell them!

1967
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,860
Three joins Four to secure our south.

1968
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,219
Seven back to protect the Counselor.

1969
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,500
Three and Four are done.

1970
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,640
I'm back. I'm back.

1971
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,360
Stay with the Counselor!

1972
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,199
Understood.

1973
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,280
"Counselor, come!”

1974
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,300
Three!

1975
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,810
It looks like Two.

1976
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,410
Pocky Zhang is here.

1977
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,269
Leave your money...

1978
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:18,450
It's Two.

1979
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,670
Is he dead

1980
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,760
Goddamned it!

1981
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,820
Tell everyone to go east.

1982
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,920
Bring one in for interrogation.

1983
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,480
lll kill their leader myself.

1984
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:41,960
Let's move.

1985
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:47,990
Where's your leader?

1986
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,299
"In the north, with a pockmarked face.”

1987
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,570
Go north! On the hill.

1988
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:56,500
AmI dead?

1989
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:57,730
"No, you're still alive.”

1990
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,290
Do you want to signal a message?

1991
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,170
How do you whistle?

1992
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,090
Can you lead the way?

1993
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,179
"No, [can't run any more.”

1994
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:15,190
"Follow me, then.”

1995
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,240
Ican't run.

1996
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,419
You've only blown up your cheeks.

1997
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,330
Your legs are fine.

1998
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,210
The Chief is dead?

1999
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,900
You just signalled the Chief's death!

2000
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,030
“Five, go check it out.”

2001
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,370
Chief!

2002
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:37,950
Chief!

2003
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,610
Chief!

2004
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:41,500
They said you're dead.

2005
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,220
Bullshit! Am [not alive?

2006
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,440
"Why missed out signalling "bullshit?"

2007
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,169
Hear that?

2008
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,650
He said we're full of shit.

2009
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,870
Wait.

2010
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,380
They caught the fake!

2011
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,960
"You're "Pocky Zhang?”

2012
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,690
Where are your pockmarks?

2013
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,050
No one asking that question has survived.

2014
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,610
Oops! I take it back.

2015
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,850
I've got something special.

2016
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:13,219
"You can have them,”

2017
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,570
in exchange for nvy life.

2018
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,040
What happened to them?

2019
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,049
“If I tell you, will you spare me?”

2020
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:21,959
Speak!

2021
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:23,920
I sawed the legs off the tall one.

2022
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:24,870
And the short one?

2023
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:25,849
She died of fright at the sight!

2024
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:29,719
Counselor.

2025
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:30,880
Counselor..

2026
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,280
Who's behind this scam?

2027
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,040
Master Huang.

2028
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,830
Nice pockmarks!

2029
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:35,780
He burnt them.

2030
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,199
How many governors have you robbed?

2031
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,320
Will you spare me?

2032
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,050
Speak!

2033
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,559
"I've killed five governors,”

2034
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:42,990
and shared the loot with Master Huang.

2035
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,559
What's that?

2036
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,310
A governor's silver umbrella.

2037
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,290
Take it!

2038
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:48,919
- Which way to Shanxi? - I have four more.

2039
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,400
I know the way.

2040
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,230
Will you spare me if I tell you?

2041
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,419
Goddamned it! Speak!

2042
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,800
"To the east, to the east!"

2043
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:58,639
Come back! You mustn't go that way!

2044
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,670
But Shanxi really is to our east.

2045
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,599
East...

2046
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:22,179
"Are you really "Pocky Zhang?”

2047
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,290
"Yes, lam.”

2048
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,950
"Lam about to kick the bucket,”

2049
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,120
don't lie to me.

2050
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,500
Don't worry.

2051
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,760
"Lreally am Pocky’ Zhang.”

2052
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:34,279
Pocky!

2053
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:35,009
Yes?

2054
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,179
My ass...

2055
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:39,530
it hurts.

2056
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:43,490
Counselor.

2057
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:45,630
Your ass is on that tree.

2058
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,370
You can't feel it.

2059
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:53,140
"On my ass over there,”

2060
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,460
[have another five warrants.

2061
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,809
Take them.

2062
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:04,250
Promise never to return to Goose Town.

2063
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:09,370
You can't beat Huang.

2064
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:12,890
Take the money and run.

2065
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,650
"Don't worry, l won't go back.”

2066
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:20,980
lied about two other things.

2067
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,480
No big deal.

2068
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:24,820
No.

2069
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:29,170
I must confess before I die.

2070
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,770
"What was the first lie, then?"

2071
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:36,099
Can I confess my second lie first?

2072
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,470
Yes.

2073
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:41,090
Do you still remember...

2074
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,300
I can't quite figure you out.

2075
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:27,090
Counselor Tang or Governor Ma?

2076
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:30,040
"Now that you're gone,”

2077
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,810
™ Pocky” Zhang, too, is no more. "

2078
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,870
Fact or fiction no longer matter now.

2079
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:43,390
"For you, I'll go back and finish this war!"

2080
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:46,460
Brothers!

2081
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,690
March on Goose Town

2082
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,179
"This "Pocky" Zhang”

2083
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,550
has killed his imposter.

2084
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:00,320
"But instead of fleeing with the money,”

2085
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,160
he wants a showdown with me.

2086
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:05,750
Let's get reinforcement.

2087
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,460
I've sent Hu Bai to fetch troops.

2088
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,710
Cavalry will arrive in 3 days.

2089
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,100
"Governor swears to behead Huang,

2090
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:22,050
public enemy number one.

2091
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:27,090
"Trades in opium and human misery,”

2092
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:33,140
Huang has killed five governors.

2093
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,639
"The money that's been given out,”

2094
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:44,380
is but one-tenth of his hoard!

2095
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,160
"In memory of his cleacdl comrades,”

2096
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:57,610
Ma will parade Huang’s head in 3 days!

2097
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,980
He gave away all his money to the poor.

2098
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:06,980
Disgraceful!

2099
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,360
The money is not being taken!

2100
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:15,010
No one dare to go
hear except those geese!

2101
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,309
lll go and find Flora!

2102
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,230
Bring her and Huang’s double back.

2103
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,070
We only have three clays.

2104
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:31,200
What is on his mind?

2105
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:32,870
They're a bunch of clowns!

2106
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,740
We simply want them... dead!

2107
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,130
"He has sworn publicly,”

2108
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:39,179
to behead me in 3 days.

2109
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:42,350
Some said I'd win the lottery too!

2110
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,130
Can the four of us

2111
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:50,530
kill Huang in three days?

2112
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:51,830
Yes.

2113
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,980
We've been telling everyone that.

2114
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,349
We can't back out now!

2115
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,660
What are our chances?

2116
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,190
30%? Are we out of our mind?

2117
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:03,560
Time for a nap. Keep watch.

2118
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,480
Queen!

2119
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:18,559
Knavel

2120
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,720
Bingo!

2121
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:21,870
"Chief, the money is gone.”

2122
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:22,870
I could see that.

2123
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,910
We must have a 40% chance now!

2124
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:24,879
50%?

2125
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:25,610
70%?

2126
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,110
Surely not!

2127
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,440
Still only 30% after they took the money?

2128
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:30,960
“If things are that simple,”

2129
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,290
our efforts will be in vain.

2130
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:34,410
Send the carriages!

2131
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,810
"TIL show you how to”
“borrow arrows with a straw boat!"

2132
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,780
"But we just sent horses,
hot straw boats.”

2133
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,679
Idiot!

2134
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,710
It's only a metaphor!

2135
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,930
You're almost metaphysical!

2136
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,260
Huang has taken all the silvers.

2137
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,970
We've no chance of winning.

2138
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,010
"Huang didn't even have to show up,”

2139
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,830
everyone has surrendered their money.

2140
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,000
How can it be 60%?

2141
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:25,750
Well said! So why 60%?

2142
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:26,710
It's because of fear.

2143
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,120
What lies beneath fear?

2144
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:29,839
Rage!

2145
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:33,080
We need to bring forth their rage!

2146
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,910
“As guns and ammos wait for you,”

2147
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,580
Huang hoards fortune in his citadel.

2148
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,680
“As guns and ammos wait for you,”

2149
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,349
Huang hoards fortune in his citadel.

2150
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,130
“As guns and ammos wait for you,”

2151
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:51,670
Huang hoards fortune in his citadel.

2152
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,620
Never-say-diel

2153
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:19,910
I like that!

2154
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,470
Those are guns! Send carriages?

2155
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,540
Money incites greed.
But guns are seditious!

2156
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,530
They wouldn't dare.

2157
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:32,440
The money's gone,
but the guns remain!”

2158
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,279
hat do we do now?

2159
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,219
What are our chances?

2160
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,870
Huang has taken all the money.

2161
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,400
But no one takes our guns.

2162
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,530
How come it's 70%?

2163
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,360
“If he hadn't taken the money,
I wouldn't have to distribute the guns!"

2164
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,570
. wouldn't have distributed the guns!

2165
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:50,849
he.

2166
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,200
heed a nap.

2167
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,438
- Queen! - Bingo!

2168
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,700
I got it!

2169
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:10,870
You were inciting rage and anger!

2170
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,480
Collect the guns.

2171
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:14,760
You missed?

2172
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,810
Let the bullets fly!

2173
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,620
Shots were fired!

2174
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,050
Look!

2175
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:43,180
They're all raging mad!

2176
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:49,120
How dare they shot my horse?

2177
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,929
Those with guns follow me.

2178
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,430
Kill Huang

2179
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:21,450
and storm his citadel.

2180
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:25,360
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2181
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,590
Those with guns follow me.

2182
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:38,700
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2183
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,940
Those with guns follow me.

2184
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,370
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2185
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:53,009
Those with guns follow me.

2186
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:55,380
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2187
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:02,140
Those with guns follow me.

2188
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,730
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2189
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:09,030
Those with guns follow me.

2190
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,210
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2191
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,940
Those with guns follow me.

2192
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:24,890
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2193
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:41,400
"Chief, look.”

2194
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:42,970
Only they have come this far with us!

2195
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,559
We're on our own!

2196
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,440
I see.

2197
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,410
They will only side with the victors.

2198
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,370
We can't overcome Huang's 400 men!

2199
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,279
Shoot! We can win!

2200
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,219
What's our target? There's only a gate.

2201
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,419
"Let's blast the gate, then.”

2202
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:03,660
How many people have they brought?

2203
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:04,849
Just the four of them.

2204
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,719
You're kidding!

2205
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:06,280
and also...

2206
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,000
fifty geese.

2207
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,830
Great! Let them shoot!

2208
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:11,889
Let them goddamned shoot!

2209
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,070
It's almost day break.

2210
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,930
If Three doesn’t return in time...

2211
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,920
I know what's on your mind.

2212
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:37,759
Can you draw an exclamation mark?

2213
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:40,330
Let's do one on the gate!

2214
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:41,450
Right on.

2215
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:46,530
What's that? Where's the dot?

2216
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:48,929
You missed!

2217
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,389
Move over.

2218
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,180
A hook stroke?

2219
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,169
Look again!

2220
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:58,559
A question mark!

2221
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:02,290
“If you can shoot straight,”

2222
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,740
you'll have nothing to worry!

2223
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:05,120
Empty your guns

2224
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,769
at the question mark!!

2225
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,080
Okay!

2226
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:12,410
"Chief, chief..."

2227
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:16,050
Speak up!

2228
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,030
I'm back!

2229
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:17,860
"Three cays,”

2230
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:18,570
one mission!

2231
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,810
Where are they?

2232
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:21,120
They're here.

2233
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,440
"You're back, at last.”

2234
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,480
I'm not Huang! I'm just an actor!

2235
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:26,360
What happened?

2236
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:28,600
He ran away and I chased after him.

2237
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:29,700
We ran a long way!

2238
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:30,470
I caught up with them.

2239
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:32,470
He finally succumbed after I'd him cornered.

2240
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,130
That was it?

2241
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:36,709
"Yes, that simple.”

2242
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,480
Brothers!

2243
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,330
"To mark Three's return,”

2244
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,160
let's go and empty our guns!

2245
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,099
- Right. - Let's go!

2246
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,150
What about me?

2247
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,039
What about me?

2248
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:44,630
Squat!

2249
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,580
Just four of them?

2250
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,269
Go and take a look.

2251
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,570
Someone will die!

2252
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:05,490
There will be fatalities!

2253
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:09,460
At least one of them will die!

2254
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:11,870
Hoist!

2255
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,700
Brothers! We've won the war!

2256
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:16,860
Understood?

2257
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:17,570
Understood!

2258
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,360
Say it out loud!

2259
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,640
"Yes, victory.”

2260
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:21,040
Let's parade him.

2261
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,160
Follow me.

2262
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:31,810
Huang's been captured.

2263
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:34,290
Huang's been captured!

2264
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:39,000
Huang's been captured.

2265
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,710
Kill!

2266
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:07,800
"Shit, we're in trouble!"

2267
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,880
I've died as my double!

2268
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:12,990
Reclaim what's yours from the citadel!

2269
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:21,389
Come with me!

2270
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,370
Charge!

2271
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:39,960
Charge!

2272
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:49,720
Follow me!

2273
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,240
The citadel’s been breached?

2274
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:13,190
Yes!

2275
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,190
Huang's been captured!

2276
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,190
Yes!

2277
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,730
They took him for his double.

2278
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:20,880
You've ended Huang's reign.

2279
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,170
What do we do with him now?

2280
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:24,500
Let him go?

2281
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,240
"You bastard, go over here! Over there!”

2282
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,210
Stand properly!

2283
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,419
My fellow townsfolk!

2284
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:31,330
Huang has died!

2285
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:33,160
But he has got off lightly!

2286
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:34,720
Swoosh!

2287
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,440
He was fell in one blow

2288
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,690
by that stupid Governor!

2289
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,760
That was stupid! That was ignorant!

2290
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:42,950
That's not justice!

2291
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:43,959
No! It's not!

2292
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:45,360
Can you let this pass?

2293
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:46,370
No!

2294
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:47,450
lam not him.

2295
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:48,540
I know you're his double.

2296
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,240
But you shared his life and
committed his crimes.

2297
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:52,740
So you should be punished

2298
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,540
as if you were him! Kneel down!

2299
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:55,470
really am not him!

2300
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,090
Kneel down! Kneel!

2301
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:58,099
Don't make me mad!

2302
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,099
On my count of three!

2303
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:00,080
One!

2304
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,419
Two!

2305
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:03,970
One!

2306
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:05,230
Two!

2307
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:07,330
What the...? Who's the son-of-a-bitch?

2308
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:09,260
Want your ass kicked again?

2309
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:11,020
"AmI bothering you, sir?”

2310
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,129
Say the word and I'll disappear.

2311
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:15,220
“If not, I'll just carry on.”

2312
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:17,160
Go away.

2313
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:19,530
"Right, we're going.”

2314
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,370
Just yell if you need me.

2315
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:22,730
"Always at your service, sir.”

2316
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:24,860
"Goodbye, sir. Beat it!”

2317
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:38,510
What's next for you?

2318
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,220
Take my place here?

2319
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,620
I'm not a caged bird.

2320
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,850
You're a predator.

2321
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:55,760
"The day of your inauguration,”

2322
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,250
“had greeted you in person,”

2323
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,130
would things have turned out differently?

2324
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:05,130
It was a nice hat. I liked it.

2325
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:08,110
[have nicer ones at home.

2326
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:11,130
I can give them to you.

2327
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,349
Everything's gone in a flash.

2328
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:18,930
You've totally wiped me out.

2329
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,020
It's not that bad.

2330
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:24,140
"You're still having a smoke,”

2331
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:25,639
still chit-chatting.

2332
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:31,320
"But Six, Two, Counselor and his wife...”

2333
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,210
I can no longer hear their voice.

2334
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:37,280
Never ever again.

2335
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,570
"Their four lives,"

2336
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:43,240
“in exchange for my heirloom,”

2337
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,719
isn't that enough?

2338
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:47,230
That's none of my business.

2339
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:48,720
"To me,"

2340
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:51,260
They are separate issues.

2341
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:53,760
You could have kept the money.

2342
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:56,980
But why did you give it away?

2343
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:01,140
"Master Huang, let me ask you a question.”

2344
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:02,470
Shoot!

2345
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,900
Which is more important to me?

2346
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:06,830
You or your fortune?

2347
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,530
Me.

2348
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:11,240
Think again.

2349
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,760
Can it be the money?

2350
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:18,040
Think again.

2351
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,290
I still think it's me.

2352
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:27,130
Neither matters to me.

2353
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:29,890
Then what is?

2354
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:36,560
To rid of you is more important.

2355
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:48,370
Looking for a light?

2356
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,520
No.

2357
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:50,540
You must be...

2358
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,980
looking for this.

2359
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,930
You're a man of honour.

2360
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:10,500
There's only one bullet left.

2361
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,860
That's enough.

2362
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,679
Wait.

2363
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,870
Any message for Tang?

2364
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:18,549
"Right, tell him...”

2365
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,920
lowe him an apology.

2366
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,830
Hied to him.

2367
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:25,279
What was your lie?

2368
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,490
I said wouldn't come back.

2369
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:29,180
But here lam.

2370
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:30,430
You...

2371
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,639
You should have kept your promise.

2372
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,250
"Yes, Llet him down."

2373
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:36,750
"But when it comes to you,”

2374
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:39,410
I'll definitely keep my words.

2375
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:45,309
Understood.

2376
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,340
Understood...

2377
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,750
Governor...

2378
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:00,599
These chairs are mine.

2379
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,890
Chief...

2380
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:13,870
Easy...

2381
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:14,959
Canlask you a question?

2382
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:15,620
Sure.

2383
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:18,300
"You fancy Flora, right?”

2384
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,970
"Governor,"

2385
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:22,910
may l interrupt?

2386
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:24,830
l overheard everything.

2387
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,950
Huang is not an honourable man.

2388
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:28,700
I gave hima pistol.

2389
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,260
He can take his own life.

2390
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:34,140
"If he doesn't, lend him a hand.”

2391
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:35,120
Understood.

2392
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:36,759
lI have 9 ways to skin this cat!

2393
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,059
Nine ways!

2394
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:40,500
You'll hear my roar!

2395
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:43,450
Maybe just a little. Why?

2396
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:49,140
Don't say I tipped you off.

2397
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,870
"Chief, we're off to Shanghai.”

2398
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:57,559
Not riding back with me?

2399
01:59:57,880 --> 01:59:58,960
Still want to resume banditry

2400
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:00,400
You're too old for this.

2401
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:03,210
You should've given me a heads-up.

2402
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:05,610
That's what we're doing!

2403
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,670
Didn't you want to be one of us?

2404
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,599
just helped to dish out the money.

2405
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:12,190
I've never had a more satisfying cay!!

2406
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:13,849
I'm even dressed for the part!

2407
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:15,679
So...

2408
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:18,080
you've changed your mind?

2409
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,360
That goes without saying!

2410
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,580
"What's your plan, Three?”

2411
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:26,140
"I'm going to marry her, on behalf of Two.”

2412
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:30,320
Two...

2413
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:33,360
"Chief, I'm Three!”

2414
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:38,640
"Three, it no longer thrills you”

2415
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:40,880
to ride with me?

2416
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,389
Yes!

2417
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:43,360
But...

2418
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,250
it's been hard going lately.

2419
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:48,358
What about you?

2420
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:48,670
We've had...

2421
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:49,880
better days.

2422
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,130
Seven?

2423
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:57,370
Chief...

2424
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,640
“Flora,”

2425
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:02,140
“hold your guns like this,”

2426
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:04,010
makes you look even cooler.

2427
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,559
They're yours.

2428
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:14,870
"Chief, we've got to go.”

2429
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:15,670
"Goodbye, Chief.”

2430
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:16,400
Gol

2431
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:17,130
“Bye, Chief!”

2432
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:20,279
Give me a heads-up next time.

2433
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,469
"Chief, take care.”

2434
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:22,450
Take care.

2435
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:23,340
"Goodbye, Chief!”

2436
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:25,830
“Bye, Chief!”

2437
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,620
“Bye, Chief!”

2438
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:37,920
"Rocky" Zhang!"

2439
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:01,420
"Six, Two, Counselor, Madam...”

2440
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:03,389
Did you see that?

2441
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:52,360
"Three, Shanghai or Pudong?”

2442
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:55,660
"Three, Pudong or Shanghai?”

2443
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,019
Shanghai is Pudong!

2444
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:01,250
Pudong is Shanghai!
