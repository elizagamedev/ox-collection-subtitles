00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:05,769
Hi. Welcome to Surf's Up.
Audio commentary.

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,673
I will be your guide...

3
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,937
.. through this wonderful presentation
of Surf's Up.

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,457
I'm Chris Buck, one of the directors.

5
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,613
Ash Brannon, another director.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,495
And I'm Chris Jenkins
and I make the coffee.

7
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,932
And it's good coffee too.

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,255
Not that crystal stuff.

9
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,606
And he's the producer, okay,
here we go.

10
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,168
Hey, look at that logo, guys.

11
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,758
We came up with the logo
just for Surf's Up.

12
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,025
Here we are.

13
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,238
Okay.

14
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,026
Interesting thing about this one
was that...

15
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:41,384
.. this was the last scene created
and the first scene in the movie.

16
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:45,316
But the movie originally started
with the sequences coming up...

17
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,602
.. which was what we call
the legend sequence, right?

18
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,339
And, Ash, you boarded the whole bit--
The sort of history of surfing.

19
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,733
-Yeah.
-We thought that we needed Cody.

20
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,555
Cody to introduce it and get to know
Cody a little bit more before--

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,668
Yeah, it was originally
a disembodied voice.

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,840
You didn't know who it was.

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,030
Okay, everybody wants to know...

24
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,963
.. why a documentary, right, guys?

25
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:11,804
Why do an animated documentary?

26
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,592
Lots of reasons.

27
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,657
First of all, surf videos are actually
made that way.

28
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,440
And we thought it would be cool...

29
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,939
..to do the subject of Surf's Up
as a surf documentary.

30
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,509
Well, there was originally
a storyline, right?

31
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,442
When Chris Jenkins was on this
about four and a half years ago.

32
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,945
It was 48 years ago, actually.

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,260
It was a comedy based
on Romeo and Juliet.

34
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,753
Yes, it was, Ash Brannon.
Thank you.

35
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,467
And they were racing cars...

36
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,609
..and they were wearing clothes
and all that, right?

37
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,494
Yeah, and they were dressed
as policemen...

38
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,589
..and they were falling off cliffs
and dying and--

39
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,749
-Isn't really a comedy.
-Okay.

40
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,621
-And how did it become this, Chris?
-It became this--

41
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,949
It became this when, you know...

42
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,928
. I'm kind of looking at the idea
of doing a surf movie.

43
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,791
And looking at the prevalence
for surf docs...

44
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,986
.. movies to be done
as documentaries.

45
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:09,958
Or for the whole reality TV thing
to be realized in animation.

46
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:13,887
-Did that make sense?
-Yeah, kind of. In a Welsh kind of way.

47
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,118
And the storyline was designed
to work as a documentary.

48
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:24,007
We had to imagine that there was a kid
we heard about who's up and coming.

49
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,575
We decided to send a crew
down there and follow him...

50
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,414
..as he went to his first contest.

51
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:29,892
And then follow him.

52
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,917
Yeah, and be able to just put
a camera--

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,249
Not a camera. What do they call
the things where you--?

54
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,118
-Like a microphone.
-Microphone, yeah.

55
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,040
Like that thing in front of you
right now.

56
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,595
But it's interesting, we had rules.

57
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:43,386
Like, we never saw
the documentarians. We never--

58
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,841
No, people really wanted to know
who the documentarians are.

59
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,661
-What species.
-Yeah.

60
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,312
And we felt that if we did that...

61
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,831
.. then we would really be winking
at the audience...

62
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,871
..in a particular way, you know?

63
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,263
It would be more--

64
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,537
I suppose, more mockumentary
in that way...

65
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,290
.. than we wanted it to be.

66
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,787
And the thing, I think,
that fascinated me was that...

67
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:07,501
..we could get inside
an animated character's head.

68
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,021
Via the interviews, you can find out
what these guys were thinking...

69
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,491
..and what they just thought
about the scene that we just shot.

70
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,246
I don't know. It's something
that we'd never done before...

71
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,659
..in other animated movies.

72
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,626
There was a lot of things going on,
the idea that in this day and age...

73
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,234
.. everybody seems to have an opinion
or reaction to a camera...

74
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,738
.. being put in their face and they have
an opinion about something.

75
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,331
Maybe they're hiding things.

76
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,546
Maybe they wanna use it
as a confessional.

77
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:41,116
And it just felt it was the right time
to take an animated feature...

78
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:41,851
And it just felt it was the right time
to take an animated feature...

79
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,749
..and really follow the inner life
of these characters on the screen.

80
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,766
Well, people are fascinated
by the documentary and reality TV.

81
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,930
I mean, I know that's what we watch
at home.

82
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:52,101
I mean, I know that's what we watch
at home.

83
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,789
There's so many of those shows
who love it.

84
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,867
I mean, a lot of times, it's what,
you know...

85
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,819
.Jit's what the camera catches
that they weren't supposed to catch...

86
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,209
.. that everybody loves.

87
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,677
Or the thing that somebody
said that, you know...

88
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,633
.. they didn't really mean to say this
or whatever...

89
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,076
...but it's very telling.

90
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,383
The-camera-doesn't-lie
kind of thing, so....

91
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,778
-We planned in a kind of spontaneity.
-It's fun.

92
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,224
Planned spontaneity.

93
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,153
Planned these things, like the camera
would stay on a character...

94
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,743
.. after they'd finished saying
what they were gonna say.

95
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,235
And their reaction, then,
after their last sentence...

96
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,522
..Was more telling
than what they were trained to tell you.

97
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,704
And it wasn't easy
the whole way through.

98
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,707
There are a lot of rules we set up
for ourselves.

99
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,760
And it was tough
between the camera work...

100
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,166
.. where the camera could be.

101
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,110
The type of questions
that we would ask these guys.

102
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,719
When the character's
aware of the camera or not.

103
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,947
These are rules,
set of rules that we had.

104
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,612
Once in a while, we'd break them.

105
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,177
And we can talk about those
as we go through this but....

106
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,152
It's kind of
the whole documentary thing.

107
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,436
Remember, we had lots of talk about,
you know...

108
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,265
.. where the camera crew
is coming from...

109
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,715
..and how did they get there.

110
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,146
All the kinds of things
that quite honestly in the end--

111
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,625
-Nobody thinks about.
-Yeah.

112
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,184
He can't help it.
That's just the way he is.

113
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,671
It was important
when we started the movie...

114
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,513
...we knew it was a surf movie,
but the surfing is really a metaphor.

115
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,417
And we didn't want the film just to be
about surfing per se.

116
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,700
And we came across an article...

117
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,852
.. by some guys named
the Malloy brothers.

118
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,367
They said something interesting.

119
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,682
They said, "A lot of surf movies
don't get it right.

120
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,967
They think it's all about just riding
the waves.

121
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,296
And it's really about life
and the way you live it."

122
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,922
And we just really fell in love
with that concept.

123
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,846
Being one with the wave
and with life--

124
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,604
And that's how we, you know,
faced the production every day.

125
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,820
We came in
to have a good time every day.

126
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,321
-Not gonna touch you.
-Do you see this?

127
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,760
-Don't. Please?
-I'm not.

128
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,041
Well, now, Shiverpool's...

129
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,599
.. kind of inspired
by an Errol Morris film...

130
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,895
..he did one about a
town in Florida...

131
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,601
.. where nothing happens.

132
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,049
This is where, again,
we play with-- This whole sequence...

133
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,952
..we play with the whole
documentary feel.

134
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,758
Like you're saying,
that's an Errol Morris film.

135
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,574
The cutting that we did,
we kept moving things around.

136
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:07,967
And then the interviews.

137
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,003
Yeah, our editor Ivan Bilancio
kind of took all these moments...

138
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,224
Yeah, our editor Ivan Bilancio
kind of took all these moments...

139
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,727
..as if he had coverage.

140
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,712
And just found an entertaining way
to intercut them.

141
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,954
Kind of a proof of concept,
this whole sequence, in a way.

142
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,824
Right, ! remember this is one
of the first ones.

143
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,194
And it was really interesting how...

144
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,486
..when Errol came in
to take a look at the stuff...

145
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,702
..and we were calling it
a mockumentary...

146
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,584
..he said, "It's not a mockumentary.
It's a documentary."

147
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,994
-Right.
-Because we don't nod to the camera.

148
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,299
Right.

149
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,087
Yeah, that was important to us,
to keep the tongue out of the cheek.

150
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,300
And have these characters believe
who they were.

151
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,542
And you get the humor
out of the seriousness of that.

152
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,021
Right.

153
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,493
But this kind of performance too,
all this improv...

154
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:55,837
..all these multiple cast recording,
this was pretty new.

155
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,940
I mean, it sounds strange to say it...

156
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,475
.. but this was a new technique
for animation.

157
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:01,974
Because in animated movies...

158
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,339
.. usually we have the actors
by themselves.

159
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,101
And we get a very clean recording...

160
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,209
..and then you can cut
everybody together.

161
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,298
The problem with that is that,
you get a very--

162
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,477
You can get
a very sterile performance.

163
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,939
And they don't always feel like
they're in the same room together.

164
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,706
Or that they're actually relating
to the other character.

165
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,669
Biggest challenge for an editor...

166
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:25,257
.. 1s to cut a natural performance
from a bunch of different sessions.

167
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,382
And they said, "Well, let's skip
all that. Let's encourage--

168
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,782
Get them in together,
have them overlap...

169
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,027
.. have them, you know, of course,
work off the script...

170
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,046
..but turn the pages over and see...

171
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,427
.. and just let it, kind of,
go on its own and wing it."

172
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,544
We told all the actors
we're gonna do this at the outset.

173
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,354
-And they were all excited.
-Right.

174
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,069
And they were all really good at it.

175
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:52,094
Not all actors can pull that off.

176
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,258
James Woods, of course.

177
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,722
We have so much recording
of James...

178
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,945
... that in the end, we were
unable to use for all sorts of reasons.

179
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,861
It was a heart thing, you know?
Can we just take five minutes?

180
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,534
We couldn't have written
some of the stuff the way-- You know?

181
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,727
So we try to replicate
as much as possible...

182
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,876
.. the conditions
on the recording stage.

183
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,345
So the actors could even get out
from behind the podium...

184
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,107
..and move around
and act things out.

185
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:24,686
And we had a guy with a boom,
following them on occasion.

186
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,142
And I just freed them up
to get more physical with everything...

187
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,658
..and make it real.

188
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:34,076
l remember many times, you guys
would pick up a video camera.

189
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:38,414
And really be in-- Quite intrusive
with the camera like you were there.

190
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,225
That's right. We did that to Jeff.
That's right.

191
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,967
And you really did throw
something at us.

192
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,538
How's your head, by the way, there?

193
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:53,061
Sal Masekela,
the real voice of the X Games.

194
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,160
This all worked--
I forgot how this happened.

195
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,937
But we came up with the idea that...

196
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,739
. if we had
this fake sports network...

197
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,187
..we could just get a lot of information
out in short order.

198
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,983
And then coincidentally,
Sal dropped by the studio...

199
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,394
..through Quicksilver
and was a perfect match.

200
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,620
Over lunch, I think,
we had an accidental lunch--

201
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,029
Yeah, we just talked about it,
how we could use him in the movie.

202
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,776
And same with Kelly.

203
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,401
Yeah, they did their scenes together.
We had Kelly, Rob and--

204
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:22,975
-Yeah, all three.
-And Sal.

205
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,316
They weren't originally a part of--
Kelly and Rob...

206
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,255
.. weren't originally in the movie.
They were on as consultants.

207
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,638
To help us get the waves right
and the surf culture right.

208
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,925
-Right.
-But it turned out to be really good.

209
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,945
The twisted Tank.

210
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,536
Diedrich.

211
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,898
You never want to get in there
and help them out...

212
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,564
He is the biggest character
in the movie.

213
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,360
A big personality
and the nicest guy.

214
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,076
He's a really great guy to work with.

215
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,459
But Tank, you know, we tried
to just find something...

216
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,404
...a little bit different for him,
so he wasn't the same old villain.

217
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,465
And I think we came up
with something very unique for him.

218
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:02,867
Yeah.

219
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,629
We always said he was like
a cross between...

220
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,005
..John McEnroe and a forklift truck.

221
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:07,996
..John McEnroe and a forklift truck.

222
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,396
Mikey Abromowitz played
by Mario Cantone...

223
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,629
.. is anything but the typical surfer.

224
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,722
He's sort of a-- He's sort of a--

225
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,890
We refer to him
as an office gopher...

226
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,406
.. which got very confusing because
he's really a sandpiper.

227
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,289
And he's the kind of guy,
originally, anyway--

228
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,224
We were thinking of
the kind of guy...

229
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,057
..that really didn't wanna get
his feet wet with his boss.

230
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,766
So the sandpiper's interesting...

231
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,001
.. because they never really seem
to get their feet wet...

232
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,121
.. when they're fishing for....

233
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,783
Yup, and he's a talent scout
that doesn't surf.

234
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,503
A surfing talent scout.

235
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,339
But Mario gave him a great edge.

236
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:57,492
This guy has done this way too much.
Nothing fazes him.

237
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,176
Ash, you brought up Mario
from a one-man show.

238
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,606
Oh, yeah, my wife and I saw him
in his last show in Broadway.

239
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,357
His one-man comedy show.

240
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,826
And a few months later,
we're trying to figure out...

241
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,962
..who would do the voice
and popped in the head.

242
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,295
-Great.
-He's a huge animation fan.

243
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,847
He knew more about animation
than we did.

244
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,250
Jon Heder knows about animation.
Jon Heder, Chicken Joe.

245
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,330
Now, this was added late.

246
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,039
But it was about...

247
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,209
.. showing what Cody really wanted,
you know?

248
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,037
It's not about winning
the competition.

249
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,417
He just wants somebody
to be there for him.

250
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,376
And he clearly doesn't have it
in his hometown.

251
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,347
You know, I think it was also added...

252
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,195
..S0 that he would have a chance
with mom.

253
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,137
Because originally,
it wasn't in there...

254
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,140
..$0 he would just go from the fish pile
to the water, to the whale.

255
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,064
-He's gone. He never says goodbye.
-He didn't get to say goodbye.

256
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,479
To his family.

257
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,625
And this was his chance
to say goodbye...

258
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,574
..but mom, still,
is not really interested, so....

259
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,840
It seemed to help his character
a little bit better.

260
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,560
Well, I think it re-injects that pathos
that you have for this young kid...

261
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,111
Well, I think it re-injects that pathos
that you have for this young kid...

262
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,045
.. that just has a passion
right from the beginning.

263
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,346
Lets you know what he really wants,
what's important.

264
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,958
-And how no one understands him.
-Yeah.

265
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,354
I gotta thank my wife, Nicole,
for that toucan line.

266
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,072
She had a handle on who Mike was.

267
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,709
Can't this blubber ball go any faster?
Step on it, fish sticks!

268
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,596
Bunch of other surfers up there
on the whale.

269
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,332
They were gonna be bigger characters
initially. We have an Aussie up there.

270
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,182
Japanese surfer.

271
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,409
-Brazilian.
-Brazilian, yeah.

272
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,084
There's so much material
that you discover...

273
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,877
.. when you create a movie like this.

274
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,199
Particularly, I think, as a documentary
or reality show.

275
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,205
You can really get
into these characters.

276
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,948
And then, at the end of the day...

277
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,453
.. you realize, well, you got 80 minutes
and a story to tell.

278
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:08,454
So there were a lot of casualties
simply from the point of view...

279
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:13,236
..of not having enough time
to get into all those back-stories.

280
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,473
-Casualties.
-Casualties.

281
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,646
It sounds painful.

282
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,732
The whole idea of Cody
chasing this whale...

283
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,384
..Was inspired by surfers...

284
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,284
...who ride the wakes of oil tankers,
I think, in the Gulf of Mexico.

285
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,778
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

286
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,036
Yup.

287
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,392
They had a hard time getting
these two together too.

288
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,807
We had to get Joe and Cody
get an introduction...

289
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,514
.. before we get to the next sequence
of Pen Gu where the just takes off, so...

290
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,281
Yeah, they needed a quick moment
to bond.

291
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,292
Deeply enough that you could buy...

292
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,560
.. that Joe would spend
the next several days...

293
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,836
..going to find Cody
as he's lost in the jungle.

294
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,899
Joe, kind of--
We always had that character.

295
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,795
He was gonna be that guy that,
you know, nothing fazed him.

296
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,608
But we did have. We went down
the road where he got a little.

297
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,245
You know, he'd get angry sometimes
or this or that...

298
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,171
..and you realize, this guy just--
Nothing fazes Joe.

299
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,609
Everything is good.

300
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:09,875
Every moment is good.

301
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,992
And he turned out to be one
of the favorite characters in the movie.

302
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:18,123
He seems to epitomize
a quintessential surfer attitude.

303
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,893
Inspired Ash Brannon moment
there.

304
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,899
Butt freeze?

305
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,894
No, the whole whale spout.
Joe being blasted off in the air.

306
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,029
Finding a way to end that scene
properly.

307
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,782
Our visual development team,
Paul Lasaine...

308
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,409
..Marcelo Vignali.

309
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,322
Hope I pronounced it right.

310
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,524
Armand Serrano, Ron Lukas...

311
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,050
..designed a beautiful world.

312
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,544
-The characters.
-They're natural primitive.

313
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,412
-Oh, yes, Sylvain Deboissy.
-Sylvain Deboissy.

314
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,989
He had a real challenge...

315
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,754
.. because most of our characters
.
are penguins.

316
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,448
It's real easy for them to start
looking alike...

317
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,160
..but he gave them all distinction.

318
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,129
They ended up having different tattoos
to help you....

319
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,540
I think it started with
the Hawaiian shirt thing.

320
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,427
-That was a Marcelo invention, right?
-Yeah, Marcelo.

321
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,834
It was a brilliant, brilliant invention...

322
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,676
.. because it just carried forward
to everybody else then.

323
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,508
I think we wanted to find
a much more organic way...

324
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:28,831
..to actually feel the excitement
of this island and the MTV style.

325
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,250
You know, music video
was the best way to go.

326
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,106
Introduced a lot of things in here.

327
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,367
Introduced the fact that Joe and Cody
are really good friends.

328
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,339
Or have become really good friends.

329
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,047
Yeah, saving--
Joe saving Cody made all that work.

330
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,578
Just instant bond, you get that.

331
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:51,294
Like when we pulled you out
from in front of that moving train.

332
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,214
Yeah, the one that you were driving.

333
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,144
Coming through! Oh, crap.

334
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,557
-Introduction of Lani.
-Lani.

335
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,026
Now, the squid life preserver.

336
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:09,727
That was an invention of our character
designer, Sylvan Deboissy.

337
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,324
Brilliant invention.

338
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:18,053
This is why animation is great
because of that squid.

339
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,173
This is also a scene that Zooey
ad-libbed.

340
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,160
She came up
with the character Arnold.

341
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,882
She was holding a sandbag,
remember?

342
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,849
-And invented that character.
-That's right.

343
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,439
Then we said, "Well, she's talking
to a kid, we need a kid."

344
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,005
And Chris Buck...

345
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,337
.. took a portable DAT recorder
home.

346
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,323
-Yup.
-And just recorded his--

347
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,192
What was he, eight at that time
or seven?

348
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,200
-He was probably eight.
-His son, Reed, just at home.

349
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,230
To do scratch
and it turned out so good...

350
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,809
..we had to use it in the production.

351
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,453
Yeah, because a lot of times
there's nothing worse than an adult...

352
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,696
..trying to do a kid voice.

353
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,214
So we have real kids.

354
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,626
l love my job.
I have an amazing job.

355
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,413
This is so Zooey.
This whole thing here.

356
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,056
Again, the camera work here,
working so beautifully.

357
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:11,532
They're gonna go...

358
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,971
..for the interesting thing
that's happening at the moment.

359
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,953
That would be this little kid
who's about to drown.

360
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,368
And James Williams,
our head of layout.

361
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,435
Wonderful cinematography
in this movie.

362
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,990
A lot of times, the camera--

363
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,113
We had to sort of give the illusion
that the camera was finding the action.

364
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,793
It couldn't be ahead of it.

365
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,871
As you would normally create
these shots at this stage.

366
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,414
-Remember?
-No, no. Not really.

367
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,629
More of the archival footage that we--
Little scratches on the side.

368
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,260
Actually, that stuff is pretty easy to do
from what I've been told.

369
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,306
It looks hard.

370
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,192
I think a lot of times it was just--

371
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,384
Well, you know,
the guys would do the work...

372
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,979
..and it'd be beautiful and pristine
and the color would be perfect.

373
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,085
And then, we would say,
"Okay, now, make it look--"

374
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,030
Yeah, muck it up,
make it look pretty bad.

375
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,330
And then, you know--

376
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,037
-They would do it.
-And then, on the long run, they go:

377
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,329
"Okay, I get it.
I know what you guys are doing."

378
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,417
It was all part of getting
a real organic look...

379
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,820
..and feel for the movie.
That was really important to us.

380
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,349
That it didn't feel CG.

381
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,795
And in fact...

382
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,527
.. archival footage aside...

383
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,828
..every shot including shots like this
have film grain.

384
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,108
Because when we saw
the original images...

385
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,590
.. they were too perfect.

386
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,842
And, too, almost a little sterile.

387
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,061
But adding that little bit of film grain
took the edge off everything.

388
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,679
The character of Tank
was really articulated...

389
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,440
.. by Jeff Ranjo, our head of story.

390
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,279
He took what could have been
a real cutout, cardboard-like villain...

391
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,477
..and went somewhere different
with him as you'll see later.

392
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,753
We used to have a sequence...

393
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,858
.. that took us off into a big luau party
right here.

394
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,247
And actually, Cody was gonna ride
the wave the next day, isn't that right?

395
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,711
It slowed everything down.

396
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,793
We had, like, a three-hour first act,
didn't we?

397
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,254
Yeah, 80 minutes. Get to the point.

398
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,169
This used to be
a much more complicated scene.

399
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,197
It was a big dialogue-driven--

400
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,730
Or even before that, remember?

401
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:22,128
When Cody was saving Chicken Joe
from being beaten up.

402
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,838
-That's right.
-And then the Ransoms came in.

403
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,957
They were Tank's cronies.
And they held Cody down.

404
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,645
Lani rushed in and flipped Tank
on his back.

405
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,141
That was the three-hour version,
I think.

406
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,884
It was our head of story, Jeff Ranjo.

407
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,822
He came up with the great,
efficient way of just moving forward.

408
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:40,412
You have the memorial surfboard
out on the rock.

409
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,023
You have the memorial surfboard
out on the rock.

410
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,375
And somebody's throwing rocks at it.

411
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,138
Now, those urchins, they come back
a little bit later.

412
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,434
At least one of them does.

413
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,518
This one used to be, like,
so much longer too.

414
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,397
Cody would--
He wouldn't take a wave.

415
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,131
And he was really-- Really was
wearing his fear on his sleeve.

416
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,456
You just wanted him to wipeout.

417
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,546
l remember nearly doing this.

418
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,541
Of course the wave that I was on
doing that...

419
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,061
..Was about a foot and a half high,
but it was still pretty frightening.

420
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,977
Well, we've had some
of the best teachers in the world.

421
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,110
We had Kelly and Rob
teaching us too, so....

422
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,020
And we still surf the way we do.

423
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,525
-Yup, no reflection on their skill.
-Yup.

424
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,677
-We're still useless.
-l wouldn't call it surfing.

425
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,322
Now, we can't tell you anything
about the waves technically...

426
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,579
.. because we don't know anything
about the waves.

427
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,657
And we all, between us, we have
a brain the size of a hamster.

428
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,617
But a lot of the scenes with the water,
and the jungles and everything...

429
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,510
..1 know we would look at them
and say, "Fantastic."

430
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,999
And the guys would say,
"Yeah, but we're not done yet."

431
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,496
You know, and a few days later,
it would look even better.

432
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,566
And these guys
kept topping themselves.

433
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,493
And this one, this is an odd one
where we kept trying, you know...

434
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,867
...well, would it be
just two wipeouts, three?

435
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,006
Rule of comedy is three.

436
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,035
But somehow when we added
the fourth one in...

437
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,181
.. people really laughed.
The three was funny.

438
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,550
The fourth one they weren't expecting,
especially the different angle.

439
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,213
Plus Cody had said, "You know,
you're gonna wanna watch it...

440
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,282
..one, two, three.
Over and over and over and over."

441
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,470
Now, why the camera people
didn't go and rescue Cody--

442
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,033
-I'm not sure why they--
-There's a rule of noninvolvement.

443
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,562
-Oh, right. That's right.
-Yeah, don't make the news.

444
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,038
-Just report the news.
-Yeah.

445
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,504
We used to have Lani out there,
doing the rescue.

446
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,917
Cody was passed out...

447
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,155
..and she was the one
kind of suffering for Cody.

448
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,294
I don't know why we did that.

449
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,396
-Now, this scene...
-Try, you try.

450
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,869
..described to us by a guy
from Quicksilver and he walked in.

451
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,339
Yeah.

452
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,476
He described what it's like
to almost drown.

453
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,210
It stayed with this, because I think...

454
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,562
. it was early on that he showed us
that-- You know...

455
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,731
..what it looked like to drown
as he's, sort of, like, lying on the floor...

456
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,591
..of the conference room
with his arms and legs in the air.

457
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,013
-l forgot about that.
-Yeah.

458
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,988
A lot of the surfers talk about
how once you're--

459
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,907
If you've wiped out
and you're under water...

460
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,979
.. often, you can't tell which way is up,
which way is down.

461
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,335
And you'll be swimming thinking
you're surfacing...

462
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,221
..and you'll hit the bottom
of the reef...

463
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,996
.. realize you're going
the wrong way.

464
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,204
When you come up for air,
sometimes that next wave...

465
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:18,113
.18 right down on top of you.
You don't even get another breath.

466
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,911
-Tank, you okay?
-Tank needs fuel.

467
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,683
Now, he says it tastes like--

468
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,379
-Shellfish.
-Shellfish.

469
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,198
Shellfish, I just wanna be clear
about that.

470
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,389
And he doesn't like shellfish.

471
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,049
I think it was Ed who animated that.

472
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,268
I'm sorry, boarded that scene,
initially.

473
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,531
And there were fish coming out
of Cody's mouth...

474
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,554
.. when Lani was pushing down
on his chest.

475
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:44,799
That's right.

476
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,387
Ed Gombert.

477
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,567
-You know, I'm--
-Ha.

478
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,473
We had these three actors
on the coach together and they were--

479
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:58,277
This was the moment
where Glen acts out Cody wiping out...

480
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,694
... that was a touch that the animator,
Pete Nash, added.

481
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,908
-That was beautiful.
-We didn't expect that.

482
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,792
Again, beautiful camerawork here...

483
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,411
.. with a little spotlight that they used.
The rain.

484
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,488
We did have one point,
we were gonna do it...

485
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,033
all that sort of night camera.

486
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:23,085
Green with those sort of, you know,
those glowing eyes.

487
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,429
-Green retinas and all that.
-Just a little too creepy.

488
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,642
-But I think we always wanted this.
-Yeah.

489
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,741
And it came out beautifully.

490
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,373
I think from the beginning...

491
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,961
..we always imagined setting up
the Geek as--

492
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,577
Or introducing him as being a guy
asleep outside in the rain.

493
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:42,278
Just kind of tells you all about
how out of touch he is...

494
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,665
...how washed up he is.

495
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,718
Jeff's great here.

496
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,336
Remember when he first came in...

497
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,474
..he was actually doing more
of a cartoon voice.

498
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,646
Yes, little bit higher voice
and all that.

499
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,675
We said, "Just do your own voice."

500
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,036
-l remember.
-Jeff is this character.

501
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,961
-He just--
-Yeah.

502
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,179
He brought so much
of himself to it.

503
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,028
These actors did this, mean,
the same thing all together...

504
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,017
..the three of them.

505
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,163
It gives all that overlapping feeling.

506
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,745
The three of them acting,
workshopping this sequence...

507
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,086
.. was fantastic.

508
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:21,562
Okay, Fire Urchin.

509
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,729
Oh, Ivan, you know, this is a tribute
to our editor.

510
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,577
Who came--? Who did this first?
Was this Ed Gombert, who did the--?

511
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,907
Yeah, but I think it was your idea,
Chris, to--

512
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,930
To interview the Fire Urchin.

513
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,645
Yeah, and then Ed Gombert
boarded it...

514
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,817
..and came up
with a lot of great dialogue.

515
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,179
I'll take credit for it...

516
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:42,887
. if you like it at home.

517
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,298
And if you don't,
it was Chris Jenkins.

518
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:48,741
And Matt Taylor did the voice
for the urchin...

519
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,451
.. which is-- Matt was one of our
storyboard artist.

520
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,258
And great improviser. He helped--

521
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,873
We would workshop scenes
with Matt...

522
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,673
..and one of our development guys,
Pete Burns...

523
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,355
..and they would give us
great material.

524
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,115
Particularly with our final sessions
with him.

525
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,334
It was written in a different way
in that regard.

526
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,280
I mean, we just allowed the improv
to, you know, create the scenes.

527
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,535
Knowing that we were hitting marks
all the way along that....

528
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,489
We went back and forth in this scene
a couple of times.

529
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,223
Yeah, well, our first instinct
was to go with this.

530
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,954
That's what you do when you get
some kind of--

531
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,379
Yeah, it's really a surefire cure.
It really is.

532
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,498
Then, we second guessed ourselves.

533
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,447
Well, Jeff, every time he came in,
he'd go, "Is the pee scene still in?"

534
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,160
We got nervous at one point.

535
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,368
-We said, "Yeah, kind of."
-Because I'm not, you know--

536
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:41,554
-Oh, good. Okay, good.
-And it really works, right guys?

537
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,348
-l hope.
-I don't know.

538
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,940
We hear.

539
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,646
Why did you--?
That time I cut my foot?

540
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,016
Why did you--?
That time I cut my foot?

541
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,910
Then the kids came in later
and I think...

542
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:58,620
.. they kind of take the ick factor off it,
if you have any of it.

543
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,593
Now, this is Reese,
our youngest daughter.

544
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,658
And then Reed, my son,
and Jeff Ranjo's son.

545
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,668
-Jack.
-Smudge, Jack.

546
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,464
-Playing Smudge.
-ls his son named Smudge?

547
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,460
-Son Jack playing Smudge.
-Okay.

548
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,034
-Oh, come on.
-Bye.

549
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,723
-This was a much longer scene too.
-Oh, yeah.

550
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:27,261
And then we decided to end
with a little classy joke.

551
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,444
-Look at that for--
-Masterpiece Theatre right there.

552
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,289
Now, that burp was provided
by Jon Heder.

553
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,462
-Jon Heder.
-Jon Heder.

554
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,658
That's right.

555
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,379
With the Reggie character...

556
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,918
.. he was originally much more
of a villain, and then he just--

557
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,285
Cody was his own villain, really.

558
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,359
You know,
it's his struggle whether to--

559
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,095
Yeah, the internal struggle
and his struggle with Z.

560
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,328
-Yeah.
-We didn't need a-- kind of villain.

561
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:58,721
-Right. So Reggie's part got a little--
-We couldn't even spell that.

562
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,924
-Or villain?
-Yeah.

563
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,159
-l can't spell either of them.
-Yeah.

564
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,428
Okay, so then...

565
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,908
..we got the idea of Joe--
We gotta keep Joe in the movie.

566
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,879
Everybody loved Joe,
but Joe was separate from Cody.

567
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:14,086
So, what is-- l guess the idea came up
that he would be searching for him.

568
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,533
-Yeah.
-So that keeps Joe alive.

569
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,199
Well, not in that scene.

570
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:24,102
Chicken Joe, of course,
was just a breakout...

571
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,087
..cool and wonderful character
in the movie.

572
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,161
Yeah, Jon just found him.

573
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,184
But Jon found him
in the first session.

574
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:37,163
-Yeah, he did.
-But we had him come in and audition.

575
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:41,059
Just in that room, set up a little tape
recorder and did some great stuff.

576
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,393
Jon was always the choice
for Chicken Joe...

577
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,435
.. after seeing Napoleon.

578
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,731
Napoleon Dynamite that is.

579
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,661
At this point in the movie,
you can't smell this...

580
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:56,144
..but, you know, Z hasn't washed
for about 10 years.

581
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,537
The jungle that these guys created,
the lighting...

582
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,284
..and the leaves
and the wind blowing...

583
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,463
. it's amazing.

584
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,773
I think it was one of our writers,
Don Rymer...

585
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,852
..who came up with this idea
that Cody lost his necklace.

586
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:16,022
And once he had made
that suggestion...

587
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:17,851
.. everything fell into place here.

588
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,627
Because we struggled
for a long time...

589
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,778
.. about how to get Z motivated
to help this kid out.

590
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,645
-And get involved in his life.
-That's right.

591
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,918
Yeah, we had that whole thing about Z
having a particular scar.

592
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,626
Yeah, and Cody would recognize.

593
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,880
So losing the necklace brings up
the conversation...

594
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,504
.. about the meeting
10 years earlier.

595
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,562
And then gives Z a chance
to make a decision...

596
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,032
.. after he's gone back to his tree.

597
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,187
Yeah, so Z feels somewhat
responsible...

598
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,110
.. for where this kid is right now.

599
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,391
And has set him on his path.

600
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,017
Beautiful song
by Ken Andrews here.

601
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,106
It's just fantastic.

602
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,608
We had a great music supervisor...

603
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,937
...Liza Richardson,
also working with Lia Vollack.

604
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,674
Some incredible music.

605
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,220
They would just turn up--

606
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,411
These original songs would come
into the studio.

607
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:10,489
They can bring a CD in and say,
"Hey, we're gonna play this moment."

608
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:12,783
They were perfect.

609
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,135
It was a treat the day this came in.

610
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,777
This anchors the scene emotionally.

611
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,687
The values in this scene,
it's not sad.

612
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,883
It's just, there's a certain kind of...

613
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,688
.. something that I can't think about
right now.

614
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,751
-If you say so.
-Not quite.

615
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,771
This is the international version,
listeners.

616
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,148
One of the inspirations for Z...

617
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,097
..Was a legendary surfer named
Greg Knoll...

618
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,920
.. who rode big waves
before anybody else was.

619
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,361
Back in the '50s.

620
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:01,072
And he rode one of the biggest waves
ever recorded.

621
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,750
It wasn't filmed or anything...

622
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,437
..and he walked away from surfing
after that.

623
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:09,397
And that was part of our-- Something--
That idea led to, you know...

624
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:13,472
.. what if we had
this Elvis-type surfer...

625
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,113
..who got really big...

626
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,465
..and then all of a sudden
disappeared one day?

627
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,146
We learned all about the koa wood.

628
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,756
And how boards...

629
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,207
.. how they're made, best boards.

630
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,367
You want to make one?

631
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,226
Remember we talked about
this bit, too...

632
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,966
.. where, you know,
l was talking about a scene...

633
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,017
.. you know, at home...

634
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,832
.. where you go to your teenager
and wanna do something with them.

635
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,069
And you wanna be the best dad
in the world.

636
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,904
And you're gonna go to them
and say:

637
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,416
"Hey, you wanna go do this with me?
I think it'll be great."

638
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,247
You're expecting the kid to say,
"Yeah, Dad. You're the best."

639
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,938
And give you a big hug and all that,
whatever.

640
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,226
But normally, they would just say:

641
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,617
"Never mind, I don't really want to."

642
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,773
And so we tried to go
for that kind of feeling...

643
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,822
...more than-- You know,
the believable kind of relationship...

644
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,352
..with Cody and Z...

645
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:08,173
..as opposed to just the, you know,
the fantasy of it all.

646
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,324
I think that happened to you,
didn't it?

647
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,312
Isn't that--? There was an example
that weekend...

648
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,604
.. you brought it in, we thought,
"Great, let's get that."

649
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,320
Oh, yeah, we bring our lives into this,
you know...

650
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,404
. this movie.

651
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,569
And I think our families...

652
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,022
..Will be scarred forever
by watching some of this.

653
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,277
Now, this whole log-rolling concept
came up...

654
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,003
..we just needed a device
to get Z and Cody to the beach.

655
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,057
We knew Z wouldn't consciously
go back to his old place.

656
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,793
See, he's heading back
to his house.

657
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,862
His house is off on the right there.

658
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,487
And now, they're heading away.

659
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,141
Mychael Danna created
some really great music for this.

660
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,436
It was fun watching this stuff
being recorded too.

661
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,706
Oh, once again we threw something
completely different to him, you know.

662
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:01,054
Instead of this big, lush,
symphonic score, we were like:

663
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,852
"This little bit, try something
kind of Islandy sort of thing.

664
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,370
-You know, log chasing."
-"Okay."

665
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,554
-And he'd go for it.
-Yeah.

666
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,442
His brother happened to be in town
that weekend.

667
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,028
And his brother plays the uke
and they put this little piece together.

668
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,031
-It's a great piece.
-Yeah.

669
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,363
Well, the scene used to feel
really dangerous.

670
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:24,406
We had Steve Ticknor,
who's our sound designer...

671
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,686
..and he did brilliant work.

672
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,068
But it was scary
because a giant log rolling down...

673
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,718
..and Z caught going off a cliff.

674
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,839
But we added the music
and it made it...

675
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:39,031
.. Just gave it a tone--
A little more humor, right?

676
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:43,518
Here's the most perfect beach
you will ever find.

677
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,486
And it doesn't exist.

678
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,082
-Darn.
-Yeah.

679
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,879
Squids don't necessarily need
to live in water in our movie.

680
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:00,911
There's a tank of water
just off frame.

681
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,132
There's a tank of water
just off frame.

682
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,556
Our visual development team...

683
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,831
.. just did a beautiful job
.
coming up...

684
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,517
.. with this world.

685
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,437
We said we wanted something natural
and primitive.

686
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,774
-And I think it was Armand Serrano.
-Armand Serrano.

687
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,675
-Beautiful.
-Who drew this originally.

688
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:29,666
This leaned-over palm tree converted
into a board shack, like an old garage.

689
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:34,276
l love watching this with people.
Actually people that-- Or kids.

690
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:37,573
They may have figured it out
in the scene before, you know.

691
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,516
-It was Z.
-"It's Z. It's Z."

692
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,555
But they're not sure yet.

693
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:45,158
So they're with you on the journey.

694
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,028
Of course they look
at the Hawaiian flowers.

695
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,535
They sort of figure it out.

696
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,791
Yeah, on his chest.

697
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,001
Everything's working in the scene.

698
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,062
The way that the flowers
in the background...

699
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,308
..at the bottom left there.

700
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,817
Sand's moving.

701
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:04,627
It was tough finding out
where to reveal Z.

702
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,483
And then, it just kind of landed
in our laps.

703
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,830
When he gets to his old house,
it's the perfect way to reveal it.

704
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,189
Well, he reveals himself
and he doesn't tell Cody who he is...

705
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:15,803
. it just happens, right?

706
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,985
Because of his being confronted
with his past, he just--

707
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:22,826
That's how he reacts to everything.

708
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,458
Cody puts it together.

709
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,020
It's a very organic reveal that--

710
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,520
l remember we had so many ideas
about Z having a scar...

711
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,549
..a Cupboard of trophies....

712
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,777
Well, the question was always, like,
"How would Cody know who this--?"

713
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,804
It's like,
"Wait a minute, Cody's not--"

714
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:45,054
He's pretty bright.
He's gonna put it together, you know.

715
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,300
You see this character reacting
the way they do.

716
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:51,177
Often in story development,
you work on these things.

717
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,056
And you second guess yourself.

718
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,615
Or you're being guessed
by a lot of people around you.

719
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,084
All for good reasons, really,
but you kind of forget...

720
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,774
.. that people are discovering
their journey with you.

721
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:07,453
And sometimes you try too hard
to disguise things without realizing...

722
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,450
.. that your perspective as a storyteller
is everything.

723
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,219
You know the story inside out.

724
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,387
But the audience
is just walking this path...

725
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,773
..and discovering things
as they come up.

726
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,405
-What happened?
-l don't want to talk about it.

727
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,388
I love the way he looks
in the camera there.

728
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,747
We were always trying to keep
that idea alive...

729
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:34,181
.. that these characters
were going about their business.

730
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,569
But at times,
when they were revealing things...

731
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,957
.. they didn't wanna be revealed,
in particularly with Z...

732
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,104
.. they'd looked right at the camera.

733
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,840
Yeah, we wanted awareness
of the camera throughout.

734
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,060
Not too often,
but enough to remind you...

735
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,009
.. that there's cameras
on the beach.

736
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,752
And there's only 800
and something shots in the movie.

737
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,121
It's a really low shot count
for a movie like this.

738
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,358
Especially when we get to
making the board...

739
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,977
..which is very long.
Couple of long scenes.

740
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,024
We wanted the limitation
of the camera...

741
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,886
.. having to stay away
from the characters.

742
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,484
It couldn't get exactly where it wanted
to get for the perfect shot every time.

743
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:16,217
We had this kid thing all as one
and then, I think, lvan our editor...

744
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,912
. Split it up into three.

745
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:22,317
Just kind of wrap the whole thing
around, yeah.

746
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,664
lvan's not only a fantastic editor...

747
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:29,363
. he's a really great,
accomplished surfer himself.

748
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,811
It turned out to be indispensable
that he was--

749
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,302
Could help us connect
to the surf world...

750
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,388
..and keep it real every day.

751
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,572
Jack Ranjo's big line coming up.

752
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,095
He's a dirty trashcan full of poop.

753
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,688
Hey, now, nobody made him
say that line, Chris.

754
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,397
That was his own line.

755
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,962
Yeah, well, maybe Jeff wrote it.
We don't know.

756
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,712
-Hey, what's that?
-And Tank's mom--

757
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,165
-What a looker.
-Oh, yeah.

758
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,998
-Played by Diedrich Bader.
-Yeah.

759
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,167
Who is also a looker
as a matter of fact.

760
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,356
Okay, this is probably the weirdest
sequence in the whole movie.

761
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:11,852
Yeah, we admit it.

762
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,093
-And it's Jeff Ranjo's fault.
-Jeff Ranjo, it's all his fault.

763
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:19,386
Then Diedrich ran with it
and we encouraged it and all that.

764
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,098
But as strange as this is, you know,
we were questioning it...

765
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,338
..-you know,
is this just too out there?

766
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,524
Then I think about at the same time,
it was Super Bowl Sunday...

767
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,574
..and in this particular Super Bowl,
they had--

768
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,922
When you cut away
from the game...

769
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,841
.. they would cut to photographs
of the players...

770
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,580
.. posing with the trophy...

771
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,145
..and kissing the trophy
and hugging the trophy.

772
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,998
And we realize this is not so...

773
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:48,682
-... far out.
-This isn't weird.

774
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,997
You know, but we pushed it.

775
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,540
We make a little weirder.

776
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,472
We had a test screening
and this first version...

777
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,755
.. Slightly, sort of the same,
people didn't like.

778
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:02,277
We did a different version, edited it.
Nobody liked.

779
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,221
So we went back
to the original version.

780
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,231
-You know...
-l like the pretty--

781
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:08,422
Kids get it on one level.

782
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,529
Adults get it on another.

783
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,879
Well, one of the ideas
is that Cody was--

784
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,457
That's all Cody wanted to do,
was to win the trophy.

785
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,658
That's all Cody wanted to do,
was to win the trophy.

786
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,774
Epitomized winning. Well, we thought,
"What if our villain--?

787
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,230
That's what he's all about.

788
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,746
It's all about the trophy."

789
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,792
One of our best
documentary shots here.

790
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:31,303
Camera follows. It's still one shot.

791
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,555
Hey, who said you--

792
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,287
Turn the board around.
Get back here.

793
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,697
I think the water is--

794
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,045
Some of the best water
is when it's like that.

795
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,328
Not necessarily
when there's breaking waves.

796
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:46,717
I just love this scene.

797
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,655
-You wanna jump in.
-Yeah.

798
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:52,535
-Well, I'd like you to jump in there.
-Beautiful.

799
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,111
Jump off.

800
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,538
We never got tired of putting Cody
through the ringer.

801
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,274
He needed to be.

802
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,669
Well, it's a cocky--

803
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,964
A cocky character,
you don't mind seeing him....

804
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,005
That was the interesting thing
with him...

805
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,690
.. was keeping him sort of driven
and cocky and that--

806
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,098
-Likable?
-Likable.

807
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,100
-Gotta keep him likable.
-And believable, I guess.

808
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,020
-Mychael Danna's score.
-Oh, yeah.

809
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,792
-We gotta--
-Funny little ditty that he did here.

810
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,405
The guy was versatile
more than like--

811
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,035
-That's--
-He's amazing, amazing.

812
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:33,086
But he also wrote the SPEN theme,
the original, the opening theme.

813
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,303
And then the Boneyards.

814
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,694
-Incredible music at the end.
-Score.

815
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:44,016
Now, this X started off as a gag.

816
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,444
And it also showed...

817
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,740
.. you know, that Zeke was really
connected to the water.

818
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,586
He knew when the waves
were gonna break.

819
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,884
And it was kind of a one-off gag
at one point.

820
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,358
And we'd realize
we could use it later on.

821
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,723
Now, the precursor of that
Was a scene...

822
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,861
...that, [ think, Ed Gombert
had created.

823
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,285
A lovely scene.

824
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,849
Where Z was very much--
Kind of like...

825
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,295
.. he's doing transcendental meditation
on the beach.

826
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,607
Oh, right.

827
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,686
And he was counting down
the waves...

828
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:12,858
..and he knew exactly
when each wave would break.

829
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,691
With his eyes closed.
He didn't really need it.

830
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,020
That wasn't ultimately, what,
Cody needed to learn.

831
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,134
He didn't have to learn the technique
or the technical aspects of surfing.

832
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,434
He needed to learn
how to have fun.

833
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,816
We could have gone conventional
and said:

834
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,098
"Well, there's gonna be a big contest
in act three...

835
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,427
..and we need to have Cody,
like, training every day...

836
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,062
..in leading up to that.

837
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:34,508
We tried some versions.

838
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,062
Yeah, they just never--

839
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:39,711
It wasn't fun and it felt
like you had seen it before.

840
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,982
Now, Rob has hair kind of like that.

841
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,274
And by coincidence...

842
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:47,535
.. adolescent penguins grow
this crazy, brown feathery stuff...

843
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,692
..out of their head
when they're teenagers.

844
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:55,271
Not quite as much of a Chia Pet
as Rob became in this movie.

845
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,094
Okay, you gotta tell
our wonderful listeners...

846
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,163
.. about this one right here.

847
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,048
Well, Reed was talking about--

848
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,477
Actually, he loves, you know,
toy guns and stuff like that.

849
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,799
So l was asking him,
"What would you like on your gun?"

850
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,401
He said,
"I'd like grenade launcher."

851
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:12,213
So we took that out of context
and put it into the surfboard thing.

852
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,799
Those happy accidents.

853
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:17,415
-Oh, the Pen Guans.
-It's another happy accident.

854
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,863
How many cameramen did we lose
in the movie?

855
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,120
Now, we gotta give a nod
to Jason Lethcoe.

856
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,621
-Yes.
-He really--

857
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,423
Early on in production...

858
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,338
..he took the whole middle
of the movie...

859
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:33,954
..with Cody and Z...

860
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,042
..and worked out a through line
about making a board.

861
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,435
Now, he-- I think he told us
he was inspired by--

862
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,694
Being in the workshop...

863
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,407
.. With his granddad
when he was a kid.

864
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:49,803
And he tapped into something here
that's universal.

865
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,672
He really understood
the father-and-son dynamic...

866
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,777
..of these guys.

867
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:59,524
And in creating this scene,
it had echoes back...

868
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,991
..and into the end of the movie.

869
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:07,744
The movie, I think, really sort of
added those elements back in...

870
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:09,982
..to all aspects.

871
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,912
Again a lot of great improv
from Jeff and Shia.

872
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,979
Yeah, they were
in the room together.

873
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,887
I think it was their first time together,
like the second day.

874
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:21,074
We did three days in a row.

875
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,602
And they did four takes.
That was all we needed.

876
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,138
-Yeah.
-We wanted the overlaps.

877
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,448
We wanted the improv.

878
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,036
We wanted it to feel natural.

879
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,841
This scene could be so written...

880
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:37,671
..and really traditionally,
the information in this scene--

881
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,823
It could be over in a few seconds.

882
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,555
But to actually experience...

883
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,564
..this relationship developed
on-screen...

884
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,802
. this is kind of the core
of the movie in a way.

885
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,281
-Yeah.
-It is.

886
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,390
We were asked many times to cut it.
Trim it...

887
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:55,462
..way back.

888
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,033
We kept saying, "I don't know."

889
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,395
I think the whole gag works...

890
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,864
.. because of the tension that builds up
throughout the sequence.

891
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:06,228
The subtlety of these performances
is just staggering.

892
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,124
But they were cuing off too, I think...

893
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:10,006
..of the great performances
they were getting.

894
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:12,118
The very natural cadence
of the actors.

895
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,103
And those little eccentric...

896
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,526
.. you know, characteristics
that you don't normally get...

897
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,117
... because lines are, in other movies,
so delivered.

898
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,053
Very unusual to have two actors
in the same space...

899
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,214
.. acting out a scene
for an animated movie.

900
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,729
Normally, you would record
one actor at atime...

901
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:36,971
..and then a great deal of work goes
into trying to forge a connection...

902
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,988
.. between the performances.

903
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:43,235
And that seemed a little crazy to us,
quite honestly. We thought--

904
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:47,568
"If you want a natural performance,
put them together in the room."

905
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,839
And everyone was worried about them
overlapping dialogue...

906
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:55,307
..and how it would limit us
when we got back to editorial.

907
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,647
No, we embraced it.

908
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:01,239
We embraced to a large degree
the idea of spontaneity...

909
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,389
..and kind of being stuck with
what you get on film...

910
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:05,839
..or what you get on tape.

911
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,013
That's what documentary filmmakers
have to deal with.

912
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:12,786
It was important to keep that sense
of spontaneous reality in everything.

913
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,808
The camera moves, then obviously,
the character performances...

914
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,389
..the story events.

915
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,634
We wanted a sense of reality
unfolding in front of you...

916
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:25,775
.. not these sort of...

917
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,751
..preordained events
being locked down...

918
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,250
..in a kind of a formulaic way.

919
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,325
That can sometimes happen.

920
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,190
We had transcripts
of everything that these guys said...

921
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,666
..S0 we could go in and find just the
right things with our highlighters...

922
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,143
.. and try to cut it all together.

923
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,599
We had hours and hours of tape
to work with.

924
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,913
So that made it a lot easier
with the transcripts.

925
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:50,446
We have to thank
the blistered fingers...

926
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,877
-...of Jeannine. Yeah.
-Jeannine Marques, yes.

927
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:57,786
So those voices are really good
on those penguins.

928
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:00,486
-Who plays those guys?
-Why, that would be us.

929
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:02,425
Sped up.

930
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,290
Well, l have never--

931
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,572
Oh, it is just us.

932
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:11,186
Again, you know, like with the kids,
you added more kids...

933
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,408
..as the movie went on,
we added more Pen Guans.

934
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,075
-They're a very popular character.
-Yeah.

935
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:20,745
And John ad-libbed this scene here.

936
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,281
-We just said, "What--?"
-Yeah.

937
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:26,247
"How would Chicken Joe
take being put in a pot...

938
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,094
..a boiling pot of water...?"

939
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,199
l love the opening up
the pores and....

940
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,601
This is something that-- l remember
you bringing this idea into work, Chris.

941
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,399
The idea of going non-linear
with this sequence.

942
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,874
Going back and forth, yeah.
Cutting ahead.

943
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,873
We always had that struggle of trying
to keep the documentary alive...

944
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:55,513
.. because sometimes
it would just become too narrative.

945
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,930
We're trying to tell the story
and we forget that it's a documentary.

946
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,540
And we'd push ourselves
to keep that alive...

947
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:03,723
..and others would push us too.

948
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,908
So wherever we could,
we tried to keep those bits going.

949
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,114
And then the fun idea, too,
that came in late.

950
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,443
Not late. I mean, it's always there,
but I think we just kind of lost it...

951
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:17,907
..in the second act a bit.

952
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:22,852
So we tried to keep that alive
and it started here, I think.

953
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,018
Because this sequence
was a little more melancholy...

954
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:27,437
.. than we really wanted.

955
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:29,712
-Yeah, Z was too down.
-Yeah.

956
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,764
And we realized,
if he's gonna be the mentor...

957
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,827
.. he's gotta be the one who realizes,
"Wait, what are we doing? We're--

958
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,660
We should be having a great time."

959
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:42,156
And even Z hasn't been having a good
time and when he realizes that...

960
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,548
..then it's time for him to be
a great teacher to Cody.

961
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:50,168
And also, you know,
Cody, for Z, is a way of kind of...

962
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:53,235
.. reconciling with his past
because he's--

963
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:56,354
Cody is kind of like Z was as a kid.

964
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:59,841
Z is what Cody might be
if he goes down the wrong path...

965
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,588
.. where winning becomes
everything.

966
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:05,194
And if it's everything,
it's not gonna--

967
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,026
Being the champion,
you're not gonna be on top forever.

968
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,761
And what your life's like,
when your glory days are behind you?

969
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,461
-So--
-Right.

970
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,696
That was a strong hook in the movie,
I think, is that...

971
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:17,321
.. they're the same character
essentially separated by time.

972
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:25,376
This is a huge moment
for Lani in this sequence, I mean--

973
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:29,627
A little nod to Denise Koyama
who storyboarded...

974
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,647
..a lot of the Lani stuff.

975
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,840
You know, being guys,
we just didn't understand the girl.

976
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:38,577
And she brought a warmth
into this character...

977
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:43,776
..and the slight sense of romance
building between Cody and Lani.

978
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,055
I think it's a really lovely--

979
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,919
Ash, you rewrote
some of this stuff too.

980
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,489
-That's right.
-That kooky stuff she does.

981
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,488
Yeah, the waterfall stuff and all.

982
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,150
-That's great. That's good.
-Yeah.

983
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,653
What was the whole thing
with the lava tube?

984
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,352
Because we knew that we were really
pushing the rules of a documentary...

985
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,348
..in a camera following them
down here.

986
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,024
Well, there's a parallel track
through...

987
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,049
..the ride coming up.

988
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,002
-Yes.
-And that's how the camera followed.

989
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,261
Yeah.

990
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,778
Bravest cameraman
in the history of animation.

991
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,311
-We lost a few.
-Yeah.

992
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:21,861
All right!

993
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,266
But James Williams came up
with this idea of a parallel track.

994
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,080
-To make it more believable--
-How'd they get ahead of them there?

995
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,627
Yeah, how did they--? How are they
ahead of them?

996
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,886
-Where's the camera--?
-l track-- You know what?

997
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,481
-The guy's Welsh, I can't explain it.
-Yeah.

998
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,167
And by the way,
penguins didn't invent surfing.

999
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,924
-You're kidding.
-Yeah, I know it's surprising.

1000
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,037
Man, all this time.

1001
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,444
This idea came up--
I'm not sure where it originated.

1002
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:50,003
We were well into production...

1003
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,197
..and then somebody read about
how the Hawaiians were doing this...

1004
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,724
..2000 years ago.

1005
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,402
They called it lava sledding.

1006
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,517
-Jerry had been to Hawaii.
-Yeah, yeah.

1007
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,794
And glow worms really do exist.

1008
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,734
-Yeah, it was--
-That really is their poop.

1009
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:07,583
Yeah, the glowing stuff
is their poop.

1010
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,465
Now, maybe they don't output
that much.

1011
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,837
I don't think so. I hope not.

1012
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,563
These guys are big eaters
on Pen Gu.

1013
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,722
A little known fact that
that's actually radioactive.

1014
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,871
We're kind of concerned
about Cody, I think.

1015
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,943
Yeah, Ash, the stuff
coming up here.

1016
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:29,316
You wrote this beautiful stuff
between Cody and Lani.

1017
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,678
Look at that, look at the sentiment
of that. It's just--

1018
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:37,211
I think that was Zooey-ism, right?
That stink-stink thing?

1019
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,948
No, that was Ash.

1020
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:40,296
That was an Ash-ism.

1021
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:43,481
What happened is you--
You know, well, you'd--

1022
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:46,767
You're with actors and you kind of
get to know their voices...

1023
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,958
..and we could all go back.
We can all write.

1024
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,693
Yeah. You're right because it's one
of the last scenes we did.

1025
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,239
You just got to know
their voices after a while...

1026
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,712
..and they talk to you in your head.

1027
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:00,323
Oh, do they talk to you
in your head?

1028
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,888
-You know, I never had that, Ash.
-Oh, okay.

1029
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,207
We can cut that.

1030
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,373
He's my uncle.
He's the only family I've got.

1031
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,356
-There she is.
-Bucktoothed Lani.

1032
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,553
-Even though penguins don't--
-Do they grow teeth?

1033
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:15,848
I'm not sure.

1034
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:20,046
No, I think that might have been
some kind of snack food...

1035
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,941
.. that she was eating at that time.
It just looks like a tooth.

1036
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,140
-It was a lucky photograph.
-Oh, it was a snack food.

1037
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,730
Another great song
that came in from a band called--

1038
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,241
-Dirty Heads.
-Dirty Heads.

1039
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,301
Slow mo, we slowed that down,
didn't we?

1040
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:43,783
Didn't we stretch it?

1041
00:50:44,108 --> 00:50:45,918
-Yeah.
-ls that what it's called?

1042
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,811
We were down in the wire.
We had a shorter scene...

1043
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,706
..and then we just--
We wanted to--

1044
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,981
We wanted the music
to hit certain beats...

1045
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,027
..and, you know, really swell here.

1046
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,638
-So we open up a couple of the shots.
-Can we stretch it?

1047
00:50:58,122 --> 00:50:59,412
I think it was all carefully planned...

1048
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,397
.. you guys are just
making this up now.

1049
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,812
No, no. They have
a stretching machine.

1050
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:06,555
There was the idea of that--
That curl of wood...

1051
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,627
.. looking like the wave,
which is kind of nice little--

1052
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,187
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

1053
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,312
-Little thing that we threw in there.
-We tried.

1054
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,347
It was out there.

1055
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,810
That's pretty good
for a second board.

1056
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:25,750
-Pretty good job.
-The ones that he damaged...

1057
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,053
.. before we got to this state.

1058
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,259
-No.
-Let's see here.

1059
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,391
Don't try this at home, by the way.

1060
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,533
Come on! Come on!

1061
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,792
I think this is the most beautiful scene
in the movie.

1062
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,432
I love this one.

1063
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:47,655
We wanted to bring in the concept
of the tube as a--

1064
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,499
Because we--
We went down to Trussels--

1065
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,430
It's a surf spot near San Diego.
--and we interviewed real surfers.

1066
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,964
They're the voices
that you hear coming up.

1067
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,373
And we just started to realize that....

1068
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:01,536
Yeah, surfing is competitive,
but there's also a real spiritual side.

1069
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:06,442
Everybody kept talking about
what it's like to be inside the barrel.

1070
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,151
And we just knew we had
to incorporate it into the movie...

1071
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,064
..and it became--

1072
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:18,011
Became the metaphor, I think,
or the theme, in a way.

1073
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,499
Wait, wait, that's Toby, Cody.

1074
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,334
It became the metaphor
of the symbol.

1075
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:24,316
-Tobey, Tubey?
-This is Surf's Up...

1076
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,018
.. not Spider-Man,
ladies and gentlemen.

1077
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:30,772
Isn't it? I thought we were talking
about Spider-Man all this time.

1078
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:34,445
No, it was Cody's thing.
It was Cody to be tubed.

1079
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:36,132
Right, to get tubed.

1080
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,203
-It's not what he wanted to--
-Be one with the wave.

1081
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,491
--you know, necessarily do but--

1082
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,913
Well, here, this moment right here
sums it all up...

1083
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,090
.. for where Cody still is.

1084
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,106
Yeah, "How many points
can I score for getting barreled?"

1085
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:52,882
Didn't understand the spiritual
quality of being one with the water.

1086
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,297
Now, Reggie Belafonte
is not a gopher.

1087
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,300
-He is not a--
-Koala bear.

1088
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,786
-Koala, hedgehog.
-We're here to tell you-- What is he?

1089
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:03,174
-We're here to tell you.
-He is a sea otter.

1090
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:06,244
-Sea otter.
-Okay.

1091
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:07,716
-So chosen because--
-Look at the feet.

1092
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:08,328
-So chosen because--
-Look at the feet.

1093
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,635
Is that his real hair, do you think?

1094
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,168
-I don't know.
-Hard to say.

1095
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,179
I've never seen a sea otter
like that personally, but, you know....

1096
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,691
He's a sea otter because of--

1097
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,787
He's a sort of a manipulative guy.

1098
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,001
-And sea otters are very manipulative.
-They have hands.

1099
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,404
-That's great.
-Oh, they have hands.

1100
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:32,735
Did you ever go to...

1101
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:37,515
..Monterey and watch how
they pick pockets and stuff.

1102
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,229
I get it. You guys look hungry.

1103
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:41,961
So Joe got away
from the natives.

1104
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,019
We had to bring him back.

1105
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,051
Now, the Pen Guan language
is similar to Hovitos.

1106
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,190
Hukana matusa means, I think,
"kill him" in Hovitos...

1107
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,216
..but in Pen Guan,
it means "tastes like chicken."

1108
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,723
So there's no confusion.

1109
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,755
Squids can actually
either be made into a snack food...

1110
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:07,368
..or into a life preserver on Pen Gu,
by the way.

1111
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,665
-What face?
-Oh, man.

1112
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,317
They go pink when you cook them.

1113
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,999
That was all improv to. Reed's...

1114
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,806
It wasn't true.

1115
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:25,847
It was the improv of--
Reese was actually--

1116
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,643
-That 's right.
-Sitting at home recording that line...

1117
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:30,913
-...and the cat--
-Oh, the cat.

1118
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:33,735
The cat had a trouser cough
as we call it back in Wales.

1119
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:36,348
Cat had too many
bean burritos that night.

1120
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:37,946
And she responded to that.

1121
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,366
Hey, Z! Come on!

1122
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,544
-Where you going?
-l thought we were going to train.

1123
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,987
Not in the water. Jeez.
What are you thinking?

1124
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,122
And this all became--
Again, last minute thing.

1125
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:51,541
All became about fun also.

1126
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,085
-Yeah, originally--
-The training--

1127
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,173
It was real nuts-and-bolts
training like--

1128
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,582
Here's how you balance on a board
and here's how you turn.

1129
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,928
There's a little leftover
with the rock thing, right?

1130
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,234
Yeah.

1131
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:02,642
But this was Ed again, right?

1132
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:07,415
Ed Gombert had done a lot of stuff,
initially. 1 know that--

1133
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:10,255
I think I actually brought
a lot of gags in here too...

1134
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:12,727
.. but the pineapple slices
on the eyes was from--

1135
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,957
Yeah, that came from the scene
you mentioned earlier.

1136
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:20,521
That was a line improvved by Jeff.

1137
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:24,266
Right, so we added that music back in
and sort of--

1138
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,621
-That sitar.
-Sitar.

1139
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,426
Okay, how did Jeff do that, guys?

1140
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,067
He was talking about--

1141
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:33,565
He wanted us to show him
doing this great wave...

1142
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:35,371
..and he acted out this whole thing.

1143
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,482
-How he would surf the wave.
-Surf the wave.

1144
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,651
He was not--
He didn't think he was on mike, right?

1145
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,910
-Yeah.
-He's just showing us, so it's all real.

1146
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,523
These are the kind of tricks...

1147
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,032
..we used to play on each other
in making a movie.

1148
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,524
Pineapples on the eyes.

1149
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:51,057
Yeah.

1150
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,310
Can I take them off now?

1151
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,651
Ash and I do the interviewers
throughout the movie...

1152
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,642
Ash and I do the interviewers
throughout the movie...

1153
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:58,794
..S0 those are our voices.

1154
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,160
Whether you like them or not.

1155
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,560
l love them.

1156
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,569
You owe me 20 bucks for that.

1157
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,075
Where's my wallet?

1158
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:13,884
Now, this used to be a heck
of a lot more complicated.

1159
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,295
And there's the X again.

1160
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,473
-Show them that Cody has--
-Number two X.

1161
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,627
--learned to read the waves.

1162
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,696
And have fun.

1163
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:25,952
Then, Cody...

1164
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,330
And we took a lot longer for Z
getting back in the water...

1165
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,365
..and we also
had this moment where--

1166
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:31,774
-The tiptoeing in.
-Yes, but....

1167
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,989
But Z, wouldn't he
have this spiritual moment...

1168
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,674
..going back in the water?
At this point in the movie...

1169
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,259
.. nobody cares.
It's like, let's just get into the water.

1170
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,098
-That scene was much bigger.
-Yeah.

1171
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,990
I just took forever to get Z
in the water.

1172
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:47,269
We thought we had to make a big deal
about it...

1173
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,924
..and he'd have to tiptoe
out there and--

1174
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,457
Yup.

1175
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:54,495
The idea was Z hadn't been
in the water for 10 years.

1176
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:57,125
And so that was
such a big moment...

1177
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:01,205
..and you had it be very serious.
He was, you know...

1178
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:04,782
..considering whether to smack Cody
on the head...

1179
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:06,699
..or go surfing and--

1180
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:08,287
Just had him jump in the deep end.

1181
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:09,675
-Yeah.
-Yup.

1182
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,133
It came through Chad Stuart
animated that great shot...

1183
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,906
.. where Z's upon the board
for the first time and he's tipsy.

1184
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,673
It all came through right there.

1185
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:22,566
We wanted to do--
Slow-mo photography...

1186
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:24,726
is a big part
of surf documentaries.

1187
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,658
The waves look so much better
if you're shooting at...

1188
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,928
..200 fps rather than real time.

1189
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,031
Again, Imageworks folks,
they pulled it off.

1190
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,301
You're gonna see
a few shots coming up here...

1191
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,180
. that's just couldn't be
more beautiful.

1192
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,830
Thanks to Sugar Ray
for this fantastic song.

1193
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:45,697
And for Liza for bringing it to us.

1194
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,857
Now, in this sequence, originally...

1195
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,196
. Cody was gonna get tubed.

1196
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,686
He was gonna find out
what it's all about...

1197
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:56,592
..and he was gonna unlearn
that lesson...

1198
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,724
.. that was much too complex.

1199
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,602
I think we felt that just to be able
to hold on to the experience...

1200
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,706
..that's transformative for him.

1201
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,766
Yeah, if you got tubed this early...

1202
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,226
.. then it said that he'd gotten past
needing to win.

1203
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,353
If he went back to wanting to win,
then he hadn't learned a thing.

1204
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:18,082
-So it was confusing.
-So we just keep it.

1205
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:21,281
He has a good time out here,
but he doesn't get tubed.

1206
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,491
Yeah, it's more about just getting
his confidence back so that he can....

1207
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,895
That he feels he can really ride
these waves...

1208
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:31,080
..and maybe has what it takes
to go compete now.

1209
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,330
Now, where did the cannon ball
come from?

1210
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,852
-Was that in animation?
-[ don't remember.

1211
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,095
Was it--? Was it lvan?

1212
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,567
Oh, Ivan suggested it.

1213
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,345
-lvan Bilancio.
-Great moment.

1214
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:52,315
The water in that shot even when
they're not waves, the refraction--

1215
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,427
I just wanna dive in.

1216
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:59,109
So this is probably, I would say...

1217
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:04,058
.. the most complex story sequence
of the movie.

1218
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:09,649
Z having to reveal what happened.
It was not easy.

1219
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,960
We had it earlier in the movie.

1220
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:17,020
Or I don't know if it was earlier,
but it was in a different place.

1221
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,144
How much to reveal?
How much to say?

1222
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:24,027
We had one point when both
the characters were really angry.

1223
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,038
-You kind of hated both of them.
-Yeah.

1224
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:29,214
You really didn't care
what happened.

1225
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,303
But somehow Z's journey
was about coming back to life...

1226
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,974
..and returning to the beach
and to his--

1227
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,485
His old friends and his family.

1228
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:46,273
We let that fear of having lost
so many years ago...

1229
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:49,787
..be the thing that keeps him
from being able to go to the contest...

1230
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,873
..and support Cody
and be there for him, so....

1231
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,508
-It was tough.
-Yup.

1232
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,627
History revised,
we call this sequence.

1233
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:03,539
And I think we revised this one about
1000 times.

1234
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,674
It's such a delicate balance
on information in here...

1235
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:09,325
..and tone for the movie.

1236
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,542
Gets too deep and you start
to break the tone, the movie...

1237
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:14,153
.. becomes more of a drama.

1238
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:18,045
But there are some very big and
important things going on in this scene.

1239
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,228
It turned out
to be the right moment...

1240
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,924
.. for Z to reveal why he was
in hiding.

1241
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:27,253
And that his fear of showing
his face again as a loser...

1242
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,178
.. kept him from being able to go
and support Cody.

1243
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,180
So they didn't pass.

1244
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:38,204
God, it looks so easy now, guys.
We struggled....

1245
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,720
Back to the archival footage.
Great grainy look.

1246
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,260
Ash, you did some beautiful
versions of this...

1247
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:53,466
..[ mean, going all the way back
to virtually the beginning of the movie.

1248
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,144
-Well, we have--
-Yeah, it used to be in...

1249
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:01,061
..in his tree, he revealed this,
didn't he?

1250
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:02,897
Oh, really?

1251
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:08,607
And even before that this is where
Geek revealed that he was Big Z.

1252
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,893
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1253
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,236
Oh, this is the exact
same scene, right?

1254
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,064
-That we used earlier.
-Yeah.

1255
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,368
There's this spot lit....

1256
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:23,109
So if you go back
and look at that scene now--

1257
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:25,707
Back when Cody
first arrives in the island.

1258
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:30,749
--you'll see Z backing off the board
and disappearing in the white water.

1259
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,315
Not wiping out.

1260
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:36,854
thought it would be kind of nice
to have a Zapruder like moment.

1261
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:44,031
I mean,
I think our hats are off to...

1262
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:47,411
-...our actors on this.
-Oh, yeah.

1263
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:51,005
Yeah, we put Shia
through the ringer on this.

1264
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,089
But he committed totally.

1265
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,155
Well, every session we'd come in,
we probably had a new version of it.

1266
01:01:58,682 --> 01:02:02,162
And they'd keep asking,
"What was wrong with the old one?"

1267
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:04,983
-They were troupers.
-Yeah.

1268
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,258
But kudos to Shia, man.

1269
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:11,332
He can handle both, you know,
the comedy and the drama.

1270
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:14,638
-He can handle anything.
-Just anything we threw at him.

1271
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,388
He's been an amazing guy.

1272
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:20,647
So this is Cody's lowest moment
in the movie.

1273
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,874
In case you hadn't noticed.

1274
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,827
Well, you struggle with that.
It has to be somewhere in here...

1275
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,574
..but you're not exactly sure.

1276
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,692
Yeah, you question, when to--
When to do an interview...

1277
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:35,709
..and when just to let the moments
play out without the interview.

1278
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:39,833
But we really felt
we needed to remind people...

1279
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,129
.. that he's are not just there
to win a trophy.

1280
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,835
That there's
something deeper going on.

1281
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,668
What he's really missing is a dad.

1282
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:52,174
And what was a joke in the one
of the first sequences of the movie...

1283
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,712
..ends up being,
as we kind of knew it...

1284
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:59,118
..then really, just a core emotion
for this guy.

1285
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:02,303
I think Cody's really been looking
for a chicken all his life...

1286
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,422
.. more than a dad.

1287
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:05,803
Like many of us.

1288
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,786
-Great.
-Yeah, I've been looking.

1289
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,814
-l'm still looking.
-How's lunch coming?

1290
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:18,496
We won't ask how far the beach is.

1291
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,272
Of course, it's right there.

1292
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,125
The jungle set and the beach set were
two completely different models...

1293
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:26,749
..and there was no way to--

1294
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,260
We couldn't move
the camera around to show--

1295
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:30,849
Show that the beach was close.

1296
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:35,052
Now, this whole competition day
was inspired by a location...

1297
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,140
..up in Northern California
called Maverick's.

1298
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,549
Where Cody got his last name,
right?

1299
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:45,615
Yup, we were-- It was that--
That documentary we watched--

1300
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,959
-Condition Black.
-Condition Black, yeah.

1301
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:51,668
Surfers going out in Hawaii
after a hurricane or--

1302
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,555
They were gonna cancel it, right?

1303
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,417
And the promoter wanted
to keep doing it.

1304
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:57,439
Yeah, that was back in '74.

1305
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,734
The promoter pushed the surfers out
against their will...

1306
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,740
.. because he had a big, live broadcast
all set up to go.

1307
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,807
That's right.
Didn't wanna have it cancelled.

1308
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,390
So Reggie was inspired by that.

1309
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,066
And if he's watching right now,
we apologize.

1310
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:16,354
We hope you learned your lesson.

1311
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:19,574
Without you, we'd never have been
able to get story point.

1312
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,193
So thanks.

1313
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,380
I'm trying to think of all
the incarnations of this scene.

1314
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:28,387
-l couldn't tell you.
-The whole--

1315
01:04:28,732 --> 01:04:30,662
Yeah, the fight Reggie and Lani
had about...

1316
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:33,501
.. whether the contest
would proceed or not.

1317
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,523
That's right. Man, I remember
this used to be like...

1318
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,850
.. 15 minutes longer
to set up the contest rules and--

1319
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,899
Oh, we had the rules
and the scoreboards and all that.

1320
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:45,283
And we realize that...

1321
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,695
.. you folks, out there don't really need
all that information.

1322
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:50,241
You already know this stuff.

1323
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,257
If a surfer falls, you probably lost.

1324
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:54,261
If he stands up on the board,
rides it, he'll win.

1325
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,677
Those were our rules,
we decided.

1326
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,857
That's all people really care about.

1327
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,812
Now, this scene kind of
really happened.

1328
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,939
-With our animators--
-Surf day.

1329
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,012
Surf day out at Zuma Beach.

1330
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,624
Not quite that size a wave.

1331
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,186
Watching 40 or 50 people...

1332
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:12,768
.. taking the same wave.

1333
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,839
Wiping out all at the same time.

1334
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,462
Hey, you guys came up with this.

1335
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,457
-Little flashbacks, they're great.
-Flashbacks, great.

1336
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:22,354
Just needed to get inside his head.

1337
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,043
Yeah, you were doing something
unimportant...

1338
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:29,183
. like you were having a baby
at that point, I think, and--

1339
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:33,416
Not me, I won't take credit.

1340
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,345
Great shot here.

1341
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:40,493
-l love this.
-Not sure if he's gonna make it or not.

1342
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,280
I love the soundtrack.

1343
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,245
It was a huge moment for Cody...

1344
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,357
..and we had to watch the music
still swell but we didn't get too big...

1345
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:55,194
.. because it's not the climax
of the whole sequence.

1346
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,854
-There he is.
-That was a late addition.

1347
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,009
Oh, we struggled. Should we bring
him back, should we not.

1348
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,070
Really hats off to Ash
on that one, we....

1349
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:09,624
We weren't sure.

1350
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,806
We kept thinking we could
bring him back at the shrine.

1351
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:15,015
But it's nice to bring him back earlier.

1352
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,839
We used to have a really extended--

1353
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,111
-We showed everybody--
-Two minutes of--

1354
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,093
--rising up through the ranks.
It's called that, right?

1355
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,118
-Rising through the ranks?
-Yeah.

1356
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:25,414
Oh, nobody care.

1357
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,295
I just told you what you already knew
was gonna happen.

1358
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:28,794
Exactly.

1359
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:34,739
-Joe was enjoying everything.
-We knew from the beginning...

1360
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,180
-...we wanted Joe to win the contest.
-From the beginning.

1361
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,147
Just didn't know how
it was gonna happen.

1362
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:42,279
Joe's gotta win. Joe's the guy
who doesn't care about it.

1363
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:46,727
As his character developed,
it made more sense though.

1364
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,990
l love Chicken Joe's surfing style
and that scene too.

1365
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:54,580
It's like holding on to the rails
with his talons.

1366
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:00,834
-Joe, typical Joe.
-Yup.

1367
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,623
Again this is all improvved, right?

1368
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:09,622
Yeah, although they were
recorded separately, the kids, were.

1369
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:13,893
Their agents and managers
would not let them work together.

1370
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,703
So we had to record them
separately.

1371
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,554
And the hiccup was real too.

1372
01:07:19,936 --> 01:07:24,006
The hiccup-- I think this is when
Jeff brought the DAT recorder...

1373
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,411
.. back in the first day.

1374
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,974
And his son was just hiccupping,
and we go, "We gotta have that."

1375
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:35,114
This was a late little addition, too,
but it's a nice touch of Lani.

1376
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:41,942
Instead of just supporting Cody,
actually hurt by the whole thing.

1377
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:48,196
That he would choose
to compete over Lani and Z.

1378
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:54,555
Well, I like that story point,
it just holds...

1379
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:55,136
.. that energy back
for the end of the story too when...

1380
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:57,357
.. that energy back
for the end of the story too when...

1381
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,710
.. everybody realizes
that Cody's triumphed.

1382
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,328
I love that kind of decision.

1383
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:05,046
One thing we never got
to make a point of...

1384
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:08,575
...was that surf board of Joe's,
it's an ear of corn.

1385
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:11,706
Some bit of old wood
that fell of a barn somewhere...

1386
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:14,205
..and turned it into this corn board.

1387
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:18,260
Remember there was a long dialogue
scene with Cody and Joe here?

1388
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,948
Where Joe is talking about
the meaning of life.

1389
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:23,147
It got a little preachy.

1390
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,265
Yeah, it got a lot preachy.

1391
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:27,978
Much better for Joe to be
talking about kittens in the cloud.

1392
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:29,640
Yeah.

1393
01:08:30,073 --> 01:08:32,293
A reminder of Z.

1394
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,543
That medallion came in
real useful.

1395
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,434
It wasn't planned
that way, originally.

1396
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:47,920
This used to go by so quickly
that-- A big moment--

1397
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,645
-Tank wiping out, yeah.
-Weren't you guys saying:

1398
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:54,554
"lL wish we could just replay it."
And we said, "We can, it's SPEN."

1399
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,694
"It's animation. It's SPEN.

1400
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:59,993
-We can do it."
-So here you go. So we did slow mo.

1401
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:02,517
So anybody that missed
what's happening...

1402
01:09:02,904 --> 01:09:05,514
..we not only show them
we have Sal tell you.

1403
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,965
But the energy that Sal
brings to this when you hear it.

1404
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,619
It's great.

1405
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:13,287
Well, Sal did a lot of improv.
We just showed this to him.

1406
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:15,773
We showed him the scene
and he just did a few takes.

1407
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:17,679
As if he was commentating
on a live event.

1408
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:18,924
Doing it live.

1409
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:23,397
And we hoped that the audience
would forget about Tank...

1410
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,033
..and think that maybe...

1411
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,836
.. you know, you misdirect to think--
Make everybody think....

1412
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,598
The last wave is gonna be about Cody
having to ride against his best friend.

1413
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,538
-Right.
-And we were struggling...

1414
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:37,849
.. With all this in editorial.

1415
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,084
Well, we struggled every day
in editorial.

1416
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,990
And Ivan said, "You know what?"
We wanted Tank to come back into it.

1417
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:48,882
And Ivan said, "Well, there's a
really tough move called the Airdrop...

1418
01:09:49,484 --> 01:09:54,615
.. where a surfer comes off the top
of a wave and drops straight down."

1419
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,138
And then that spurred all
this, coming up.

1420
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:01,558
Yeah, that was the signature sound
of the tube again.

1421
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:04,851
So Cody's about to get tubed.

1422
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,588
He has a choice to make.

1423
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:09,894
Here he comes.

1424
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,077
Joe's unfazed.

1425
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,595
Even then, yeah, Joe doesn't go,
"Hey, wait."

1426
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:17,218
He just-- He enjoys it.

1427
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:21,067
Of course, Cody's
gonna do the right thing.

1428
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:26,077
Boneyards was there from
the beginning, wasn't it?

1429
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:28,712
Yeah, we had that.

1430
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,175
It was gonna be our climax.

1431
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:34,081
We had that thing where
Cody went back and saved Tank and--

1432
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:36,391
Right.

1433
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:39,513
But they were taking
Lani's job away from her.

1434
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:42,756
It was getting convoluted so we said,
"Well, we gotta get Cody to Z.

1435
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:45,085
That's where the story
picks up again."

1436
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:48,828
We made some tough trims
in here that was really--

1437
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,162
We'd animated some of them.
It was beautiful.

1438
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,681
That wave-- That wave
is just staggering there.

1439
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,834
-This whole Boneyard sequence.
-Just incredible.

1440
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,754
And the mist that these guys
are put in there and...

1441
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,187
l love these shots in here.
All the...

1442
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,575
Yeah, Mychael Danna incorporated
some Hawaiian drums...

1443
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:13,303
...into the score here,
especially coming up right here.

1444
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:15,543
I just love this part.

1445
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,138
Now, that was--

1446
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,613
We saw something like that
on some documentary stuff.

1447
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:22,126
It was a guy on a jet-ski
getting pushed up onto the rocks.

1448
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:23,808
-Yeah.
-Trapped.

1449
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:25,787
In, like, this area,
they couldn't get to him.

1450
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:30,847
We poured over this moment
for hours...

1451
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,194
..to get this last--

1452
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,022
-Days, months.
-Weeks, months.

1453
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:40,306
-Maybe you hours.
-It all blurs together now.

1454
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:45,998
This is where we talked about
the X again so we'd play it off again.

1455
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,366
Third X.

1456
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:52,914
And Cody having to let go.

1457
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:54,582
-Oh yeah, the third X.
-Stop fighting.

1458
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:57,194
Fighting life, fighting everything.

1459
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,268
This really does work
if you're in a situation like this.

1460
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,757
-We tested it out.
-Well, we put Chris in--

1461
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:07,814
-Yeah, he tested it out for us.
-Well, only needed--

1462
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,603
l only need one leg to get around.

1463
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:18,077
"Is he dead? Are they dead?"

1464
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,639
Where's Cody?

1465
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,670
Lani is an incredibly powerful
.
penguin.

1466
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,634
The way she can maneuver
something like that.

1467
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:33,152
And the Reggie character
that really cares.

1468
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,452
There's more of Reggie
we had in the movie at one point.

1469
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:39,293
-Just couldn't fit it all in.
-Yeah.

1470
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,628
Love this scene.

1471
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:48,150
Z hasn't yet decided
to go back on the beach.

1472
01:12:48,898 --> 01:12:53,758
But here he kind of admits he lost
and Cody lost and it's no big deal.

1473
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:57,884
In fact, we had another take for Cody
where he was really down about it.

1474
01:12:58,507 --> 01:12:59,906
He said, "I lost."

1475
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:02,986
And then you found
another one, of course, that...

1476
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:06,109
-...wasn't so--
-He's just kind of tossed it aside.

1477
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,112
That's right.

1478
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,964
It's a great way
of bonding two guys...

1479
01:13:11,454 --> 01:13:13,124
.. who have gone through
the same thing in life.

1480
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,742
Realize it's not that important.

1481
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,325
It's so subtle.
It's not like you would normally do.

1482
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:24,289
You really push for maybe
very sentimental lines...

1483
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,437
.. but this is very natural.

1484
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:30,717
Every time I've been on a surf board
in that situation--

1485
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:33,584
-"Let's go, loser."
-Yeah.

1486
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:37,982
"Don't touch his stuff,"
if you guys remember the line.

1487
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,284
Oh, yeah.

1488
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:42,832
When Z says,
"Don't touch my stuff, man."

1489
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,733
-Okay, Doris and Sheila.
-There's Doris and Sheila right there.

1490
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,094
-Yeah, Z's ex-girlfriends.
-Mindy Sterling.

1491
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:52,135
-Jane Krakowski.
-We had to cut them out.

1492
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,518
They gave such wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful stuff.

1493
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,388
But those are not their voices.

1494
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,163
Yeah, because they were trimmed out
of the movie.

1495
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:04,590
We wanna save them
for another movie.

1496
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:09,884
--l got lost for a little while.
But that kid there, Cody...

1497
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,306
Okay, I'm a sucker,
but I love this moment here.

1498
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:18,360
Yeah, we'd knew that Z's appearance
would overshadow Cody.

1499
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:22,805
And that it would be great if Z could
take the spotlight back over to Cody.

1500
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:26,302
-And then Mario takes it back.
-Yeah.

1501
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:33,142
The animator did this little
touch here, Z...

1502
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:37,646
.. rubbing Cody's head just like he did
back in Shiverpool, 10 years ago.

1503
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:40,071
Nice touch.

1504
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,483
The one piece-- The guy's
we never got together...

1505
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:44,962
-...were James and Jeff.
-Oh, Yeah.

1506
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,634
They never got to do
their scenes together.

1507
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:52,151
The idea of dropping the boards
was that they were Reggie boards...

1508
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,657
..and everyone was kind of--

1509
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:56,671
-Done with Reggie.
-Yup.

1510
01:14:57,893 --> 01:14:59,353
Notice the fluorescent colors...

1511
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:02,629
..as compared to the natural colors
of the other boards.

1512
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:07,003
We used to have an extra long
wrap-up, then we just said, "Well..."

1513
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:11,277
These two scenes with Kelly and Rob
were animated without their voices.

1514
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,304
We didn't--
We couldn't get ahold of them.

1515
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:17,186
They were always off in
the other side of the world...

1516
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,837
.. Surfing some great breaks.

1517
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:23,682
And we finally caught up with them
over the Internet basically...

1518
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,219
-...and recorded in Hawaii and--
-Very last day of production.

1519
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,810
Last day.

1520
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:33,875
Yeah, within an hour their lines,
recorded in Australia and Hawaii...

1521
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,037
.. were cut into the movie.

1522
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,566
That's a nice touch.

1523
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:42,273
-Look, that hair's not real.
-Hey.

1524
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,755
Now, he looks like a sea otter.

1525
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:50,098
Sponsors of the competition
were Reggie Belafonte's--

1526
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:51,973
-Hair gel.
-Wood wax and hair gel.

1527
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,684
That's right.

1528
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:57,757
We had really wonderful help
in this movie.

1529
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,197
There was a really--

1530
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,990
It's quite a vision to carry out
for the second movie at a new studio.

1531
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,263
But there were great people...

1532
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,412
..we were lucky enough
to help us along the way.

1533
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,715
-Incredible, incredible artists.
-Yeah.

1534
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:13,624
Incredible voice talent, everyone.

1535
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:19,004
We talked about this
being the ultimate--

1536
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,588
It's Z's beach
but it's never looked better.

1537
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:24,264
And everyone's back on,
it's full of life again.

1538
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:28,371
How did they get that thing
out there, that pot?

1539
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,848
We always ask that.

1540
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:35,090
With that-- Who better to put, you know,
on the board than Mikey at the end.

1541
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,571
We got Kelly and Rob surfing.

1542
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,717
-Look at the lighting on this.
-Yeah.

1543
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:45,402
Cody used to get tubed
a lot earlier in the movie.

1544
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:49,621
And it seem like such a spiritual
thing that it's something that...

1545
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:52,056
.. Maybe you shouldn't earn
until right at the end.

1546
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:56,195
-Right.
-And he also went in by himself.

1547
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:59,159
And then Chris said, "No.
That's how he started the movie.

1548
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,638
He's alone, so why don't we get him...

1549
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,893
-...in there with Z?"
-He's never had the dad.

1550
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:08,266
We thought, "Oh, come on, we gotta--
The two of them together, finally.”

1551
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,861
Kelly Slater said after seeing
the movie...

1552
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,043
.. that there were various
other times in the movie...

1553
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,742
..he wanted us to go into the tube
and see inside there.

1554
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:19,512
He was just, like, really eager to
see that and then he realized...

1555
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:24,496
..at the end, to hold off and to-- To get
the experience of being in the tube.

1556
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:27,994
He was happy, relieved.

1557
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:32,982
A ring of fire there
with the golden light around there.

1558
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:35,196
That's wonderful.

1559
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:38,044
-Gives me goose bumps.
-Incredible.

1560
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:40,634
Love it. Oh, but it's not over yet.

1561
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:43,453
No, we're gonna have a really
long extended "Where are they now?"

1562
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,509
And we're gonna check
with all the characters.

1563
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:47,975
-Oh, that's right.
-But they were all kind of wrapped up.

1564
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,530
-Yeah, except for these two.
-Yup.

1565
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:57,842
We needed-- We had a lot of feedback
on what happened to Mom and Glen.

1566
01:17:58,574 --> 01:18:00,654
-Particularly Mom.
-Yeah.

1567
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:03,690
There are suggestions
that they show up for the competition...

1568
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:06,763
..and we just didn't want that
so this was--

1569
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:11,486
And that Mom has a change of heart
right here.

1570
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:16,028
-But not Glen.
-Never Glen.

1571
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:20,906
So Mom's supporting Cody,
Glen never.

1572
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:23,407
We tried a version
where Mom was a little more--

1573
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,472
-Yeah, just like Glen.
-She's like--

1574
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,418
-She didn't--
-"What do you mean he didn't win?

1575
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,413
Why are you doing this?
You're embarrassing us?

1576
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:31,415
-Get out of here," so....
-Yeah.

1577
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:34,557
And then we went--
Others went, "Wait a minute."

1578
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,179
They wanted to see Mom
change a bit.

1579
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:39,851
-And so--
-She does.

1580
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:42,669
We went-- Dana was right down
the hall, we recorded her.

1581
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:46,555
And then we went through
the transcript of Brian Posehn...

1582
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,799
..and found lines that worked,
you know.

1583
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,181
That was the value of these transcripts
we had.

1584
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:54,177
-Yes.
-Hours and hours of material that--

1585
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:57,217
There's always a little nugget
that was right for a moment.

1586
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,373
-Right.
-If you looked hard enough.

1587
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:03,248
So those two did not record
those scenes together.

1588
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,151
The fact that Cody's mom
comes back...

1589
01:19:08,644 --> 01:19:11,044
..and understands that
something good happened...

1590
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:14,977
. this, I think--
Satisfied a lot of folks.

1591
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:18,898
We also--
The scene that's at the very end...

1592
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:23,402
.. with Glen, was pushed up here
when we thought:

1593
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:25,986
"You know, let's just leave it
with those two."

1594
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,858
And it was such a great out,
with, "This interview's over."

1595
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:31,144
But the scene
was already animated...

1596
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:33,087
..1 don't know if it was all lit yet.

1597
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:36,099
But it was such a great scene and we
said, "We gotta put it somewhere."

1598
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:38,419
So we decided to put it
at the very end.

1599
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:43,091
So those are the people that stay
to the bitter end...

1600
01:19:43,846 --> 01:19:45,335
..get a little treat.

1601
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,860
So yeah, it's a fun movie to do and--

1602
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:55,543
It's a nice way to spend a few years
on the beach, in the water.

1603
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,842
It's fantastic.

1604
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:01,311
So it came out well.

1605
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:03,634
-This is actually very fun. It's great.
-Yeah.

1606
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:08,076
l haven't seen the movie in a while
and it's, you know, it's cool.

1607
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,734
In a week.
Haven't seen the movie in a week.

1608
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:12,043
That's a while.

1609
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:15,561
l was watching it
probably five times a day, you know.

1610
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:18,198
-So--
-You know what, these movies...

1611
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,107
..these kind of movies,
they come along so rarely...

1612
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:25,957
..and I just wanna say,
it's great working with you guys.

1613
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:27,862
-Likewise.
-Where are the tissues?

1614
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,940
And I'm looking up all the names
in the credits here and just--

1615
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,103
-It's an incredible team.
-Yup.

1616
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:36,867
-Couldn't have hoped for better.
-Very lucky, really.

1617
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,856
And I think everybody
had a really good time on this.

1618
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:43,274
Hope you guys
had a good time listening.

1619
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:47,479
-Yeah, thank you.
-Hope-- A little insight to the movie.

1620
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:51,487
Or at least we hope we helped you
take a nap if you were sleepy.

1621
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:55,624
Maybe you're asleep right now.
We can make subliminal suggestions.

1622
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:58,607
Buy more DVD's...

1623
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:01,671
..or Blu-ray.

1624
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:04,558
Thanks for listening, guys.

1625
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,969
-Appreciate it.
-Thank you, guys.

1626
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:10,775
Thanks for getting this little movie
for your home theater.

1627
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,140
Get out there.
Get out there and surf.

1628
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:16,946
-What do you doing watching TV?
-And if you live in Indiana...

1629
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:20,749
..the lakes are going off today.

1630
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,687
If you need a river, you can dam
the river then surf that.

1631
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:25,349
Do you wanna follow a tanker?

1632
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:27,931
Oil tankers are going down in
the gulf right now.

1633
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,257
-Yeah.
-Pretty good ride.

1634
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:31,976
And there's always snowboarding.

1635
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:33,961
Hey, that's a thought.

1636
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:35,726
Shakabrah.

1637
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:38,461
-Over and out.
-See you, dudes.

1638
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,971
Remember when we were talking
about you leaving? That was great.

1639
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:03,861
Remember when
you were gonna go?

1640
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:06,012
-We were gonna go--
