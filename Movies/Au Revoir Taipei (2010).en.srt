00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:26,776
Hello Faye!

2
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,577
Are you good?

3
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,566
Paris are good?

4
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,641
T learn French for you!

5
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,285
I want to live with Paris in you.

6
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,318
But money I do not have.

7
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,739
Paris is world of love.

8
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,682
Without you Taipei is very sad.

9
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,473
Very very sad.

10
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,286
Work with my father and my mother.

11
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:01,086
Day after day, my life is same.

12
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,019
I always think of you.

13
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,345
Imagine us on the streets of Paris.

14
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,406
‘You are my happiness.

15
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,569
You are...

16
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,373
Anyway, I'm still practicing everyday.

17
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,862
Hope I have a chance to speak
to you soon.

18
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,429
So...call me back when you can.

19
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:26,939
Okay, that's all for now.

20
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,490
Bye-bye.

21
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,832
The moonlight shines...

22
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,736
On an open road...

23
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,467
A breeze is blowing...

24
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:05,518
I wait for him..., but he's not there.

25
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,613
But my heart doesn't know...

26
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,281
If he is coming.

27
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,370
It sounds ridiculous

28
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,629
But really...

29
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,760
T haven't felt like this in a long time.

30
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,780
This woman has brought love back
into my life.

31
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,135
Think about it.

32
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,979
All this other stuff: Protection...

33
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,402
Prostitution...

34
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,603
Gambling...

35
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,504
Running numbers, loan-sharking...

36
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,591
It's all meaningless to me now.

37
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,797
Brother Bao.

38
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,338
I think you might be having...

39
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,866
Some kind of mid-life crisis.

40
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,153
‘You ever been to Hainan Island?

41
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:41,915
Never.

42
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,762
What are you going to do there?

43
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,307
Enjoy life with her.

44
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,784
And grow old together.

45
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,570
Oh, my South China Sea Girl.

46
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,763
Don't be so brokenhearted!

47
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,470
Fuck off.

48
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,234
But Brother Bao...

49
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,230
Your real estate company
is making good money.

50
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,884
Yeah, it's doing well.

51
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,108
Everyone knows that.

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,343
And it's clean.

53
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,510
But this other score...

54
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,192
If we take care of that...

55
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,980
Then I'm set!

56
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,273
Brother Bao...

57
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,620
Are you sure about this?

58
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,304
When you get to my age...

59
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,904
‘You just want to be happy.

60
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,377
Fuck off.

61
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,315
I don't understand.

62
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,474
I don't understand.

63
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,608
Excuse me, sorry.

64
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,554
This isn't a library you know.

65
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,648
I'm just flipping through this.

66
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,027
But you're here every night.

67
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,826
Why don't you just buy it?

68
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,169
I don't know. I guess I'm just bored.

69
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,830
‘You must be really bored.

70
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:05,975
Yeah.

71
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,697
I'm not making fun of you.

72
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,732
It's just that I see you in here a lot.

73
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,210
Oh.

74
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,251
Anyway, see you tomorrow.

75
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,797
Oh, okay.

76
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,969
Hello Faye.

77
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,036
How are you?

78
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,207
T haven't spoken to you in a while.

79
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:31,644
If you get a chance

80
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,532
Can you give me a call back?

81
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,601
You're always in my heart.

82
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,321
Good night, my little butterfly.

83
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,132
About those four units...

84
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,074
Right, four units,
each 300 square meters.

85
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,084
Thad them appraised already.

86
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,983
I start showing them next week.

87
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,265
It's all taken care of.

88
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,856
Very good.

89
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,251
Uncle, I got a handle
on the real estate stuff.

90
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,140
But there are other things
I'm capable of.

91
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,078
Kai, take this to Brother Bao.

92
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:24,931
Oh.

93
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,288
Are you asleep?

94
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm fine.

95
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,157
If there's anything I can help with...

96
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,419
Brother Bao.

97
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,362
Kai, you're around a lot these days.

98
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,138
Oh yeah, just helping out.

99
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,253
It's temporary.

100
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,257
I see.

101
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,368
Actually,
we could use a smart college boy.

102
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,451
It's okay, I've got plans already.

103
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,882
Well, if you need anything....

104
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,445
Just let me know.

105
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,790
Don't be shy.

106
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,094
Sure. Thanks, Brother Bao..

107
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,366
Enjoying that?

108
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:01,817
Uh-huh.

109
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,918
-Good luck. -Thanks.

110
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,426
-Come again. -Sure.

111
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,255
Ma'am, I'd like to buy a scratcher.

112
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:19,839
Sure, what kind?

113
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,623
One "Dream Come True".
One "Treasure Chest".

114
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:22,555
Okay.

115
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,800
The fortune god wishes you luck.

116
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,435
He hasn't been much help lately.

117
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,328
No way.

118
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,816
Come play more often.

119
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,957
And he'll take good care of you.

120
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,084
Hey! Come back here!

121
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,685
Thugs!

122
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,414
Come back!

123
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:55,988
I'm going to get you!

124
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,146
Watch the hair!

125
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:57,820
You little thugs!

126
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:58,501
Running away!

127
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,732
Come back here!

128
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,681
Come back!

129
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,729
I don't understand.

130
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,920
What are you reading?

131
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,524
Just this.

132
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,529
Oh.

133
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,840
It's got a pronunciation guide.

134
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,423
So... you're teaching yourself French?

135
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,533
Yeah.

136
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,015
Is it working?

137
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,709
I'm not sure.

138
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,145
Maybe you should try something else.

139
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,661
Hello Faye.

140
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,392
Is something wrong?

141
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,888
Why haven't you called me?

142
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,377
I just want to know that you're okay.

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,439
I miss you so much.

144
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,932
T love you so much.

145
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,367
Goodbye.

146
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,279
Fuck off!

147
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,467
-Don't run! = -Freeze!

148
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,931
Hey, don't run!

149
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,163
Fuck, what are you doing?

150
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,802
Hey, be careful!

151
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,270
Let's get the little prick!

152
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,235
Someone's coming.

153
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,137
How may I help you?

154
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,221
Fuck you.

155
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,069
Did it go smoothly?

156
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,437
Tran into some problems.

157
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,852
What? Cops?

158
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,079
Thid it. It's safe.

159
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,295
Hey, this is my retirement fund.

160
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,607
What is it, Hong?

161
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,826
Nothing. I just...

162
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,573
If there's nothing else I'm going home.

163
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,878
Wait for me outside.

164
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:35,998
Okay.

165
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,474
Uncle, who was that?

166
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,685
Listen, Hong.

167
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,949
I'm getting ready to retire

168
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,693
And I've decided to leave
all this to you.

169
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,026
No problem, Uncle.

170
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,839
But this lottery store shit...

171
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,272
It's beneath you. Cut it out.

172
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:01,983
Understand?

173
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,302
But Uncle, you know...

174
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,436
It was a real sweet score!

175
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,442
Everything here could be yours.

176
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,260
That's not enough?

177
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,506
It's just that...
I want to see a little action.

178
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,033
Action?

179
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,125
Okay, I understand.

180
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,493
Say no more.

181
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,479
So we're clear?

182
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,440
We're clear.

183
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,889
Good.

184
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,567
What are you looking at?

185
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,599
Nothing.

186
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:06,388
Hey, Kai.

187
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,443
Hey, Gao.

188
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,248
Thanks.

189
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,568
So was Peach there tonight?

190
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:14,733
Yeah.

191
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,159
And?

192
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,951
Oh, we...

193
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,869
I'm working on it.

194
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,538
Oh.

195
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,141
What's wrong?

196
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,814
Nothing.

197
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,621
You still hungry?

198
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:40,923
Yeah.

199
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,155
Okay.

200
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,190
To your happiness!

201
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,988
Come with me now.

202
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,342
I'll take care of this bastard first.

203
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:05,651
No!

204
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,116
Mandy...

205
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,146
How could you do this to me?

206
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,734
Dinner's almost ready.

207
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,415
Ji-Yong.

208
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,634
What did you say?

209
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,443
I said dinner's ready.

210
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,669
But I'm heading out.

211
00:13:58,871 --> 00:13:59,721
Okay.

212
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,131
Hello? I'll be right down.

213
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,016
Wushing's downstairs.

214
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,614
Oh.

215
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,906
Okay, I'm going then.

216
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,070
They were all wearing suits.

217
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,716
The color? Orange.

218
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,042
The were all quite handsome and polite.

219
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,276
One of them said they wanted to buy one.

220
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,864
And started scratching.
I was distracted.

221
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:41,774
And there was a...

222
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,321
Don't worry, Ma'am.
We'll take care of it.

223
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:45,214
Thank you.

224
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,518
Wait, I'm not done yet.

225
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,338
Next time we get a case like this,
just shoot me.

226
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:53,925
Are you hungry?

227
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,300
Let's grab something to eat.

228
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,288
Okay, sir.

229
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,288
Jack-knife one. Over.

230
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,175
Sir, do you think they'll really
come back?

231
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,629
‘You can count on it.

232
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,140
It's the big time for us.

233
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:16,939
All right.

234
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,105
Here.

235
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:25,951
Hello?

236
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,226
I'm working. Call you back later.

237
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,305
Sir, was that your girlfriend?

238
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,378
Huh?

239
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,884
-Your girlfriend? -Huh?

240
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,578
Your chick?

241
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,757
None of your business.

242
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,279
Oh.

243
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,580
It was just one of them!

244
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,378
And I'm telling you, guys like us...

245
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,810
We get all the chicks.

246
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,127
Really?

247
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:03,919
Watch and learn.

248
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:05,670
Okay.

249
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,013
Stay focused.

250
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,031
Okay.

251
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,771
Whoever comes back, we'll grab them.

252
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,141
Hey.

253
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,412
Hi.

254
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,514
Hey, have you thought taking
some classes?

255
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:32,881
Um...

256
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,916
I think it might be faster.

257
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,014
I'm taking dance classes right now.

258
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,803
Have you ever heard of the Lindy Hop?

259
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,525
The what?

260
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,805
It's a type of swing dance.

261
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,069
Um...maybe I can just show you.

262
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,454
It goes something like this...

263
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,396
Something like that.

264
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,249
Oh.

265
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,096
Hey, that have some
language classes there.

266
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,029
English, Japanese...

267
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,705
They should have French too.

268
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,407
I can get you a schedule.

269
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,851
That's okay.

270
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,567
Really...

271
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,255
Hey, so are you going to France
or something?

272
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:39,845
Yeah.

273
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,082
Really?

274
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,634
My girlfriend's over there.

275
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:45,524
Oh.

276
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,724
So you're studying French
for your girlfriend?

277
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:51,997
Oh.

278
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,566
That sounds romantic.

279
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,591
Really?

280
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,234
Doesn't she think so?

281
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:02,708
Yeah.

282
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,193
Hello?

283
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,575
Faye? Hi.

284
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,343
How have you been?

285
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:28,937
Oh.

286
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:35,897
Oh.

287
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,150
So, is everything okay?

288
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:44,823
Oh

289
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,136
Me? I'm doing okay.

290
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,300
Nothing much.

291
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:57,418
What is it?

292
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:01,837
Oh.

293
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,573
Why?

294
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,919
What's wrong with you?

295
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,070
We don't have the money for that.

296
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,049
I'll pay you guys back.

297
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,482
What are you thinking, kid?

298
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,548
I don't know...
I just need to get over there.

299
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,054
Forget about it! Just forget about it.

300
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,230
Maybe this is all for the best.

301
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,835
Think about it.

302
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,714
or why don't you go get a job?

303
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,735
We're not forcing you to work here.

304
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,582
Right?

305
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,918
I'll close up.
You guys can to upstairs.

306
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,533
Don't dwell on it too much.

307
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,269
How much do you need?

308
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,910
Just enough to get to Paris.

309
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,993
And maybe to stay out there for a while.

310
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,304
Not a problem.

311
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,297
It's just that...

312
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,812
We had already made these plans.

313
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,708
No need to explain.

314
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,564
That's the way love goes.

315
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,121
You'll figure it out.

316
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,316
Thanks, Brother Bao

317
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,777
How long have I been eating
at your restaurant?

318
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,206
I know you're good for it.

319
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,596
Ah...the one that got away...

320
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,418
It's nice to be in love, isn't it?

321
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,264
Sir...

322
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,531
Do you think we'll get to use our guns
this time?

323
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,202
I can handle it, sir.

324
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,075
What is it?

325
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,262
What?

326
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,455
Okay, I understand.

327
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,120
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

328
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,958
I said get out of here!

329
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,266
Kai, where are you going?

330
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,962
Oh,I have some stuff to do.
I can't work tonight.

331
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,555
I'll be back later.

332
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,568
Hey, what are you here?

333
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:29,637
I'm here to see Brother Bao.

334
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:31,903
Brother Bao?

335
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,388
He told me to come by.

336
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,552
Oh.

337
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,410
Sure you don't need help with anything?

338
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,792
I'm okay. Thanks.

339
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,212
Uncle, he's here to see you.

340
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:13,825
Don't you have something to do?

341
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,217
Oh, I have an apartment to show.

342
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,580
I better get going.

343
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,617
Come, have a seat.

344
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,793
So are you all set?

345
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:30,865
Yeah, just about.

346
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:31,906
Good.

347
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,074
Thave a little favor I need
to ask of you.

348
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:36,798
Oh, okay..

349
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,949
Sorry to trouble you.

350
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,401
Ineed you to take something with you.

351
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,327
Okay, okay.

352
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,325
Uh...Brother Bao, where is it?

353
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,944
Oh, I need you to pick it up for me.

354
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,327
Oh, okay. Sure.

355
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,700
Don't worry, it's all taken care of.

356
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,345
Someone will give it to you.

357
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,260
This package is very important to me.

358
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,178
So you better be careful.

359
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,389
Got it?

360
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:04,766
Yeah.

361
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,221
‘You must be very excited.

362
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,147
Oh, yeah.

363
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,002
But Brother Bao...

364
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,183
What is it?

365
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,164
It's just...I don't know...

366
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,509
Hey, is your flight all set, Kai?

367
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,915
Yeah, I leave tomorrow morning.

368
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,921
Do you need some extra cash?

369
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,650
No, I have enough.

370
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,668
Good.

371
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,365
Hello and welcome.

372
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,682
Hello and welcome.

373
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:16,711
Hey, Peach.

374
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:18,592
Huh?

375
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,669
Do you...

376
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:25,867
What?

377
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,950
Do you know if we have more
of these in stock?

378
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,358
I don't know. Go check in back

379
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,141
Oh, okay.

380
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,575
Thanks.

381
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:42,967
No problem.

382
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,609
Hello and welcome.

383
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:54,499
Hey, Gao.

384
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,146
Hey.

385
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,024
So I'm just about set.

386
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,245
I just came over to say bye

387
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:58,753
Okay, let's go.

388
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,428
Go where?

389
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,712
To eat.

390
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:02,894
That's okay, really.

391
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,122
I have some stuff to take care of.

392
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,416
But you're leaving.

393
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,061
Hey, Peach.

394
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,173
We'll be back in an hour or so.
Is that okay?

395
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:11,993
Oh.

396
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,887
T only have two hours.

397
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,499
See? No problem.

398
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,178
Okay.
But I have to go pick something up first.

399
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,299
Okay.

400
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,920
Look guys...

401
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:44,678
He has this score...

402
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,520
And he's cutting us out of it.

403
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,272
Aren't we brothers?

404
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,645
Instead he has us showing
shitty apartments all day.

405
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,029
Brother Bao is almost finished anyway.

406
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,244
There's nothing to worry about.

407
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:59,385
If anything happens,
the kid takes the blame.

408
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,329
We make a sweet score,
someone else takes the fall.

409
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,648
Don't you guys want to make a big score?

410
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,144
Here's your chance!

411
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:10,949
Mr. and Ms. Cheng...

412
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,473
Excuse us.

413
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,028
What do you think?

414
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,353
Actually, our last tenants
really loved this place.

415
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,578
But the husband got caught cheating.

416
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,231
Things got messy and...

417
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,990
We can install your new washer
and dryer in a few days.

418
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,620
We'd like to think about it some more.

419
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:27,935
Very wise, very wise.

420
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,417
But I can assure you
for a place like this.

421
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,769
The price is quite reasonable.

422
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,950
Here's my card.

423
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,636
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to call.

424
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:37,849
Okay.

425
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,020
Thanks.

426
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,567
Morons.

427
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,745
Anyway, I'll be with Brother Bao.

428
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,247
That way he won't suspect anything.

429
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,050
Once you make the grab

430
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,511
Bring it your aunt's place.

431
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,889
I'll meet up with you guys there.

432
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:00,475
One more thing...

433
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:11,846
Sweet, eh?

434
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,651
Sweet!

435
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,071
Sir, do you want a piece?

436
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,129
I'm not hungry.

437
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,588
But sir, it's really good.

438
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,141
I said I'm not hungry.

439
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,387
Sir, are you sure?

440
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,043
Oh.

441
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,647
Sir, look!

442
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,395
Wushing, move it!

443
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,648
Hey, Kai.

444
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,609
Password.

445
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,101
Password.

446
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:15,794
Huh?

447
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,121
Password!

448
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:20,062
Brother Bao told me to come
pick up something...

449
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,659
If you don't give me what I need...

450
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,883
How can I give you what you need?

451
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:25,079
Password.

452
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,159
But I...

453
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,383
I'm just messing with you.

454
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:30,868
Don't be such a dipshit.

455
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,123
Be careful with this.

456
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,775
This is it?

457
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,204
What should we do, sir?

458
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,555
Follow them!

459
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,303
Hey, Gao.

460
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,338
Let's go.

461
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,035
Did you get it?

462
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,432
Yeah, no problem.

463
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,592
Let me see it.

464
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,194
You can't handle it.

465
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,309
Come on!

466
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,653
No way,
it's my gun, not your gun...got it?

467
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,924
-Please? -No.

468
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,905
Okay, let's eat

469
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,090
Okay.

470
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,290
Where do you want to start?

471
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,473
You decide

472
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:54,482
Okay.

473
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,879
So...what are you going to do
when you get to Paris?

474
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,688
Get Faye back.

475
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,678
Those dumplings are pretty good.

476
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:35,806
Okay.

477
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:44,931
What is it?

478
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,337
Nothing.

479
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,202
Do you know her?

480
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,133
Sort of.

481
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:49,857
Okay.

482
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,178
Hey, wait...

483
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:53,707
Hi.

484
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,400
Hi.

485
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:57,742
Hi.

486
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,086
T haven't seen you around recently.

487
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,837
Yeah, I've been a little busy.

488
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,049
Oh.

489
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,005
Oh yeah...

490
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,324
I was at dance class the other day.

491
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,390
And I checked it out for you.

492
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,112
I think they do have French classes...

493
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,545
It's okay. I'm going to Paris.

494
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,168
Really? When?

495
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,331
Um, tomorrow morning.

496
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,630
Oh.

497
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:26,994
I probably won't get this tood
for a while.

498
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,259
So I better eat it while I can.

499
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,579
Do you want to get something to eat?

500
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,615
Oh, this is Gao.

501
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,466
This is...

502
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:41,946
I'm Susie.

503
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,755
She, um, works at the bookstore.

504
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,126
Can you guys get me some dumplings?

505
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,831
I'm going to go get a sausage roll.

506
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,069
Oh.

507
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,484
So are you here alone?

508
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,812
Yeah, I'm just on my way to class.

509
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,402
Seems like you take a lot of classes.

510
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,290
T like to keep myself busy.

511
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,688
Oh.

512
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,279
Please don't cut in line.

513
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,157
Excuse me. You're coming with us.

514
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,020
We'll be right back.

515
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,064
What do you want?

516
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,777
-Do you have it? -Hand it over.

517
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,368
I don't know what you're talking about.

518
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:55,846
Show him what we're packing

519
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,834
Don't run, Police!

520
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:03,984
Don't run!

521
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:13,371
Hey, where did you go?

522
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,598
Hurry, hurry!

523
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,283
Come on.

524
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,211
Stand still!

525
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,029
What's wrong with you?

526
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,330
Nothing, I was just thinking...

527
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,570
It was a little too crowded over there.

528
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,335
Are you running from someone?

529
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,517
No.

530
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,427
Fuck.

531
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:45,306
What now?

532
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,741
Hey, isn't that his friend?

533
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,871
Are you hiding from those two guys?

534
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:56,817
No, I don't even know who they are.

535
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,507
Right. I'll see you later.

536
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:01,886
Wait a second.

537
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:02,997
What?

538
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,781
Let's just hang out here for now.

539
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,414
What about Gao?

540
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,687
Just be cool, Stretch!

541
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,633
-Let's go. -Oh.

542
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,690
Gao!

543
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,629
What?

544
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,321
Excuse us. Coming through.

545
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,007
Excuse us.

546
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,272
What's going on?

547
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,078
Gao.

548
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:53,801
Excuse us, sorry.

549
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,541
Where are we going?

550
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,562
Shut the fuck up and get in.

551
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,419
Who were those guys?

552
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:19,596
They're...uh...

553
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:22,476
Was your friend just kidnapped?

554
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:23,676
No.

555
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:33,671
What are you doing?

556
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:34,905
Calling the police.

557
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:35,883
Oh.

558
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,685
Wait, you can't do that!

559
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,537
Why not?

560
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,785
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.

561
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,727
Seriously, don't do that.

562
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,413
What's this all about?

563
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,125
I don't know.

564
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,081
Fine. Go ahead and call.

565
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,482
Hello, please connect me to the police.

566
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,681
Hey, please don't do that.

567
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,524
Hold on, listen to me.

568
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,989
Maybe it have something to do with this.

569
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,237
Let me explain.

570
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,793
Okay. Explain.

571
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,123
-Back to the Palace? -Yeah.

572
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,694
What about him?

573
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,450
Oh, you can just drop me off here.

574
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,013
I'm hungry.

575
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,718
Aren't you guys hungry?

576
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,982
Yeah, but is there anything good
around here?

577
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,783
How would I know?

578
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,458
I know a pretty good
dumpling place nearby.

579
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,674
I don't know, okay?

580
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,737
I'm just trying to get to Paris
to see my girlfriend.

581
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,810
Well, where did the package come from?

582
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,602
I was picking it up for someone.

583
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:07,431
Who?

584
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:08,695
Brother Bao.

585
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,317
I'm borrowed some money
from him to get to Paris.

586
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:13,946
Brother Bao?

587
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,559
Yeah. I was desperate.

588
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,981
I don't know how he's involved
in all this.

589
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,495
Well what does he do?

590
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,500
Real estate.

591
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,548
Okay, I'll try calling him.

592
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,505
I don't buy it!

593
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:51,185
I'll get it.

594
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,343
Hello?

595
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,535
Hello, may I speak to Brother Bao?

596
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,188
May I ask who's speaking?

597
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,776
This is Kai. It's kind of urgent.

598
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,793
Of course, how can I help you?

599
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,850
Oh, no. I just really need
to talk to him.

600
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,545
Do you know when he'll be back?

601
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:10,946
I don't have that information
on me right now.

602
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,329
But...I really need to speak to him.

603
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,615
I'll tell you what...
go ahead and send me a brochure.

604
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:17,991
Okay, let's keep in touch.

605
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,279
Hello?

606
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,347
Credit-card scam.

607
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,906
I think Brother Bao is busy.

608
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,004
So?

609
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,089
I don't know.

610
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:40,821
Let's just open it.

611
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,712
-No -Let me see it.

612
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,317
What's in here?

613
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,910
I don't know.

614
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,625
Don't you think it's a little strange?

615
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,502
‘You have no idea what you're delivering.

616
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:58,782
What were you thinking?

617
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,435
What is it?

618
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,801
That guy.

619
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:07,914
-You recognize him? -No.

620
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:08,839
Police!

621
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:09,997
What is he yelling about?

622
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,088
I don't know

623
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,223
‘You two!

624
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,032
-What should we do? -Run!

625
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,363
Hey!

626
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,533
Hey, wait for me!

627
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:24,651
Hurry!

628
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,176
You two, stop!

629
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:27,872
Stop!

630
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:28,782
Hurry!

631
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,890
Okay!

632
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,611
I'm a police officer!

633
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,178
Excuse me.

634
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,292
Kids, no running in the subway!

635
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:01,975
Sir, no running in the subway!

636
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,620
Hey, I think we ditched him.

637
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,365
Yeah, great.

638
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:19,896
Hey, where are you going?

639
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,155
(The Palace)

640
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:34,294
Get out!

641
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:44,391
I, Howard, promise I
will also love Mandy!

642
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,556
That will never change!

643
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,593
I, Mandy...

644
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,952
Will be with Howard forever!

645
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,338
Auntie, we're going upstairs.

646
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:02,636
Oh.

647
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:26,098
Fuck! These are pretty good.

648
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:36,583
How much longer do we have to wait?

649
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:38,691
A little while, just sit tight.

650
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,442
I'm sorry

651
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,267
I don't know what's going on either.

652
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,212
How did you get yourself involved
in this?

653
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,443
I don't know, I was just trying to
get to Paris.

654
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,105
That's all.

655
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,473
‘You couldn't think of an easier way?

656
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:56,676
It seemed reasonable at the time.

657
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,261
I'm sure it did.

658
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,320
What now?

659
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:01,618
What about Gao?

660
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:05,625
Kai...

661
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,272
This way!

662
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:24,517
Hurry!!

663
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,583
Police! Stop running!

664
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:38,966
Hurry!

665
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,704
This way!

666
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,930
Oh shit.

667
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:02,749
What are you doing?

668
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,497
Dance or we're going to get caught!

669
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,350
Come on! Dance!

670
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:17,951
Okay.

671
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:31,621
You're doing it wrong.

672
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,453
-Does it matter? -Yes

673
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,048
Forward.

674
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,627
Worry about yourself.

675
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:40,683
Like this.

676
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:41,902
Here.

677
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,010
Hey, where is he going?

678
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,224
I think we can go now.

679
00:46:58,516 --> 00:46:59,626
Oh, okay.

680
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,980
Sir, I think you have the wrong person.

681
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,789
Uncle, I have an apartment to show.

682
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:38,125
Now? This late?

683
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,086
It was difficult to schedule.

684
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,791
This is the only time they
were available.

685
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:43,987
I better get going!

686
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:45,432
I don't want to be late.

687
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,041
Nice moves back there.

688
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:01,915
Pretty bad right?

689
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,978
There's room for improvement.

690
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,589
So what now?

691
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,688
I don't know.

692
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,060
Why you need to get
over there so badly?

693
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:24,884
Didn't you say that
she's waiting for you?

694
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,306
Yeah. I guess so.

695
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:34,208
Actually,
she doesn't even know I'm coming.

696
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,437
You're kidding, right?

697
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,570
We talked about going to Paris together.

698
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,161
And then?

699
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:48,843
I guess she decided I
should just stay in Taipei.

700
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:57,094
I thought that if I could
get over there somehow.

701
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,251
At least I would have that.

702
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,899
I don'thave a whole lot going
for me here.

703
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:55,582
Draw!

704
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,069
Flush! Red dragon,
three seasons, mixed suits!

705
00:49:58,529 --> 00:49:59,109
Wiped you out!

706
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,200
Fuck! We're not playing for money!

707
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,133
I told you guys...I have mahjong skills.

708
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,140
What are you wearing?

709
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:08,955
Oh, I forgot to take it off.

710
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,726
What a crappy job.

711
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:13,504
Hello and welcome, please come again.

712
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,238
Good impression.

713
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:16,035
Shit yeah.

714
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:17,587
Ijust got drafted though.

715
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,965
Fuck.

716
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:21,540
You got a girlfriend?

717
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,158
Better hit that while you still can!

718
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,011
For real.

719
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,744
No. I don't have a girlfriend.

720
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,308
But I'm working on it.

721
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:34,551
Working on what?

722
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,028
Yeah what?

723
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,035
Nothing.

724
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,940
Who's the girl?

725
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,266
Co-worker.

726
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,911
What's her name?

727
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:46,980
Peach.

728
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:49,555
Oh...Peach.

729
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:50,937
Peach.

730
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,825
So cute.

731
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:53,763
Yeah.

732
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:54,944
How much longer do you have?

733
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:55,829
Not much longer.

734
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,042
Does she know you're leaving?

735
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,125
No.

736
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,166
Fuck! When she hears that...

737
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,079
Her bra will fly right off

738
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:04,387
Really?

739
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:05,738
Just tell her...

740
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,110
"Girl, I'm going off to the army..."

741
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,328
"T want you to know..."

742
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,209
"T won't stop thinking about you".

743
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:11,413
That's how it's done.

744
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,005
Definitely. You're in. No problem.

745
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:15,021
Really?

746
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,349
How do you think he ever gets laid?

747
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:21,284
Actually, I've never even been
in the army.

748
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,114
Damn.

749
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,283
Playing mahjong?

750
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:27,716
Hey, Hong

751
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,918
I want to play, who's winning?

752
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:35,962
Who's this moron?

753
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,926
We grabbed him.

754
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:39,923
Where's the package?

755
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:42,689
Oh.

756
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:45,801
We had kind of a setback.

757
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,170
But his friend has it.

758
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:49,705
Right, so we were thinking...

759
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:51,847
Who told you guys to think?

760
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:53,873
If we grabbed him...

761
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,520
What is this? A picnic?

762
00:51:59,316 --> 00:51:59,926
I said get the package.

763
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,460
But you bring back this moron!

764
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:09,051
I can't believe you guys are my crew.

765
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:12,485
Our bad, Hong.

766
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,990
Yeah, sorry Hong.

767
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,258
Sorry, Hong.

768
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,842
It's okay, it's okay.

769
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,096
We'll just have to adapt
to the circumstances.

770
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,598
We can still make this
a successful score.

771
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,523
Hey, Gao?

772
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:12,020
Hey Kai, it's me, Gao.

773
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:13,983
I know it's you! Are you okay?

774
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,251
It's Gao.

775
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,640
Hey, Gao.

776
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,929
Not bad.

777
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:22,371
Where are you?

778
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,910
Hey.

779
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,442
You have thirty minutes
to get me the package.

780
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,981
Huh?

781
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:32,643
Or there's going to be a dead body
at bottom of the rive

782
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,457
Dead body?

783
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:36,752
What do you want me to do?

784
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,759
You know the Yongfu Bridge?

785
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:41,378
Uh-huh.

786
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,072
On the other side of the river.

787
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,350
So...walk forward a little bit.

788
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,790
And then...

789
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,368
Walk forward a little bit more.

790
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,983
And then...on your right...

791
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:51,995
There's an empty lot on the right.

792
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,489
Just wait for us there.

793
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:55,438
Okay, I'll be right there.

794
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,596
I'm warning you! Come alone. No cops.

795
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:01,327
Or there will be a dead body
in the river!

796
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:02,872
Okay, I understand.

797
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,372
Just hold on, I'll be there.

798
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,168
Tie him up now please.

799
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,247
Oh, okay.

800
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,403
What?

801
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,024
They want to exchange the package
for Gao.

802
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:21,384
What are you going to do?

803
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:23,856
I guess I should get going.

804
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,295
Really?

805
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:30,287
I guess I should take care
of this myself.

806
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,689
You're really going alone?

807
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:38,441
Probably.

808
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:45,738
Hey.

809
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,185
I'm think it might be better
if there's two of us.

810
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,219
‘You sure you want to come?

811
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:54,981
Okay.

812
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,476
‘You sure you're okay?

813
00:55:18,382 --> 00:55:20,932
Thanks so much for listening.

814
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,349
I'm just glad I can be here for you.

815
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,509
So...I guess this is goodnight?

816
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,231
Goodnight.

817
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:41,377
What is this?

818
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,142
Ji-Yong, what are you doing here?

819
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:45,692
Ji-Yong?

820
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,006
Who is he?

821
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,194
Didn't you see the note I left?

822
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,716
I saw it. But who's he?

823
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,342
A friend.

824
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,061
Hi, I'm Raymond.

825
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:57,146
-A friend? -Hey.

826
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,154
That's right.

827
00:55:58,889 --> 00:55:59,499
Oh yeah?

828
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,063
Hey, why don't you calm down?

829
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,321
IT am calm!

830
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:03,933
Don't do that!

831
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:05,401
Raymond, are you okay?

832
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,685
I'm okay, no need to worry.

833
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,169
What did you push him for?

834
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:11,854
He started it.

835
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,262
I barely touched you.

836
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,437
We were just talking, that's it.

837
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,179
-Although... -Raymond!

838
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,238
Yuan finally realizes you're
not worth it

839
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:23,026
Is that true?

840
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:23,973
I...

841
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,994
‘Yuan, tell him.

842
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,777
Stay out of it.

843
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:33,235
I'm sorry!

844
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,193
Yuan, wait...

845
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:37,837
T already told you.

846
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,491
I need time to think things over.

847
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:42,778
‘Yuan...

848
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,095
Hey, your phone's ringing.

849
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,008
I know.

850
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,281
At least I'm getting Gao back.

851
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,070
I've gotten so used to waiting.

852
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,477
I'll just be stuck here a little longer.

853
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,253
Being stuck here isn't so bad.

854
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,249
Where's the package?

855
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:06,089
Where's my friend?

856
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,455
Where's the package?

857
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:08,821
Where's Gao?

858
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,486
Who?

859
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:11,721
My friend.

860
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:14,196
Hand it over.

861
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:14,884
What are you doing?

862
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:16,202
What are you doing? Let her go!

863
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:18,321
Hey!

864
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:20,686
Why did you hit me?

865
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,891
Leave him alone! Hand it over!

866
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:30,873
Just give us the package, okay?

867
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:33,299
Did you hear me?

868
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,108
Okay, just take it easy.

869
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:43,363
Idiot.

870
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:44,347
Why did you have to hit me?

871
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:45,488
Let's go!

872
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:48,834
Are you okay?

873
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:50,098
My nose is broken!

874
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:51,437
Let me see.

875
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:52,958
It's not broken.

876
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,757
But it will probably be swollen.

877
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,980
Gao's gone, the package is gone.

878
00:58:58,335 --> 00:58:59,415
I'm finished.

879
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:04,527
Hey, where are you going?

880
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:06,649
Wait for me!

881
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:13,912
Susie, wait for me!

882
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:28,497
What are you doing?

883
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:29,632
There has to be one!

884
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,860
What?

885
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:33,089
Look!

886
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,301
That's not a good idea.

887
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,199
Aren't you going a little fast’?

888
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,949
Well done, we're all set.

889
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,461
Very good.

890
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:02,259
Sir, where have you been?

891
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:07,657
Where is he?

892
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,241
Inside.

893
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:12,468
Get down.

894
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,240
Back to the Palace?

895
01:00:21,518 --> 01:00:22,308
Yeah.

896
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,524
Fuck, that was lame.

897
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,029
Seriously.

898
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:37,997
Hello?

899
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:41,102
Hey, uh... Kai.

900
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:42,881
How's everything going?

901
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,756
Brother Bao,
I've been trying to reach you!

902
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,858
What's wrong? Did you have the package?

903
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,547
Yeah, I did...but someone's after me!

904
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,406
They grabbed my friend too!

905
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:52,598
Who?

906
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,539
I don't know!
They were all wearing orange suits.

907
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:58,192
But you still have the package?

908
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:01,754
Yeah...I still have it.

909
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,928
-But they... -Okay, listen to me.

910
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,617
Just get yourself to the airport.

911
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:07,189
I'll take care of everything else.

912
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:07,986
But Brother Bao, you don't understand.

913
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:09,508
Things are a little messed up right now.

914
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,913
Don't worry, just do what I said.

915
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,585
-But Brother Bao... -Safe travels.

916
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:16,788
Brother Bao, wait...

917
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:18,635
What?

918
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,298
Hey, watch the road!

919
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:32,913
Hello! You've reached Hong's cell phone.

920
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,156
I'm sorry that I'm unable
to take your call...

921
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:50,595
Hey, this is Brother Bao.

922
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:53,088
Have you seen my boys there tonight?

923
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:55,406
Okay.

924
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:58,017
What?

925
01:01:58,915 --> 01:01:59,785
Let's go!

926
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,819
Let's go, let's go.

927
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:09,395
Excuse me, ma'am.

928
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,559
Did you just see someone run in here?

929
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,700
Quicky? Three hundred.

930
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,124
Oh, we're not, uh...

931
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,181
Eight hundred for the night.

932
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:24,886
Okay, thanks.

933
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:32,351
Does she know that you like her?

934
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:33,671
No.

935
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:35,554
Why not?

936
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:40,824
Because I get so nervous around her.

937
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:43,522
So you must really like her.

938
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:44,960
Yeah.

939
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,680
So why don't you tell her that you
like her?

940
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:50,788
Oh.

941
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,540
I've thought about it.

942
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:01,064
I think being in love is
a beautiful thing.

943
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:02,942
But you have to be brave.

944
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:05,383
And be prepared for rejection.

945
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:08,854
Like a man.

946
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,022
Oh.

947
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:16,421
Hey, Hong.

948
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:18,517
Did you get it?

949
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:20,132
We got it.

950
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:25,264
We're leaving now, Hong.

951
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:26,895
Hold on, hold on.

952
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,784
Despite a few minor setbacks

953
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,540
And a little miscommunication
on my part.

954
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,888
We still managed to make a sweet score.

955
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:35,614
Excellent.

956
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,771
Oh...

957
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:56,891
It was a good try, Hong.

958
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,477
Right.

959
01:03:58,768 --> 01:03:59,698
You're still our Hong.

960
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:00,519
Yeah.

961
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:02,377
Where are you three morons going?

962
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:04,079
There's no point anymore.

963
01:04:05,075 --> 01:04:07,384
Oh yeah, you can have this back.

964
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,259
Sorry, Hong.

965
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,910
Sorry, Hong.

966
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,216
What are you looking at?

967
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:42,611
Close call.

968
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:07,970
Hear anything?

969
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,269
It's probably not this one.

970
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:17,286
Hey, be careful.

971
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,990
Wait for me here.

972
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:46,504
Hey, noodle boy.

973
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,006
What is this?

974
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:52,017
Why did Brother Bao give this to you?

975
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:54,536
I don't know.

976
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,894
He doesn't know.

977
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:58,386
Someone told him to bring it to Paris.

978
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:00,152
Paris?

979
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,142
Did that hurt?

980
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:04,486
No.

981
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,828
I don't believe it.

982
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:13,068
There has to be something.

983
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:15,223
What are you doing?

984
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:16,472
Shut up.

985
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,700
Hey, what are you doing?

986
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:21,279
Come on.

987
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:23,655
Where is it?

988
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:27,955
French lessons? What the hell?

989
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,587
It makes no sense.

990
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:38,176
Brother Bao gave you his photo.

991
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,105
To take to Paris...

992
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:43,131
That's Brother Bao?

993
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,356
Please be quiet.

994
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,674
So tell me again what's really going on?

995
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,626
I don't know. Really.

996
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:53,832
Hong.

997
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,007
Uncle.

998
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,228
What's wrong with you kids?

999
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:00,912
You don't listen to anything I say.

1000
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:03,188
Kai

1001
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,383
Shouldn't you be on your way
to the airport?

1002
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:06,958
You can go to Paris now.

1003
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,046
It's cause...

1004
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,400
Oh...

1005
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,334
Nicely done!

1006
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:17,152
Uncle, I was just...

1007
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,870
You wanted a big score, huh?

1008
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:20,839
You think I'd hand over
anything important

1009
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:22,480
To this dipshit?

1010
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,975
I already took care of the real package.

1011
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:30,909
Police! Freeze!

1012
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:36,021
Put the gun down!

1013
01:07:36,953 --> 01:07:37,743
It's fake.

1014
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,157
-Put it down! -Put it down!

1015
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:40,579
It's fake.

1016
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:41,752
Put it down.

1017
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:52,765
Huh.

1018
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:03,946
Go!

1019
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:06,895
Sir, are you okay?

1020
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,293
Go after them!

1021
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,483
Hey!

1022
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:12,741
What about us?

1023
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,505
Can you get your hands free?

1024
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,070
It's not tied too tightly.

1025
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:29,274
Can you try?

1026
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:30,929
Okay.

1027
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:38,363
Gao, come help!

1028
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:40,983
Oh.

1029
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:45,571
Did you get it?

1030
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:53,599
Are you okay?

1031
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:54,729
I'm okay.

1032
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:10,912
You guys?

1033
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:28,767
You take care of everything?

1034
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:31,943
I'm supposed to be retiring.

1035
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,000
No more of this shit.

1036
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:49,596
I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.

1037
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,670
Where are you taking me now?

1038
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,125
Back to the station?

1039
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,271
You know, I would make a good cop.

1040
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:58,136
What do you think?

1041
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:00,462
Are we going in the cop car?

1042
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:02,124
I want to ride shotgun.

1043
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,299
Hey, take it easy.

1044
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:11,782
Aren't you coming?

1045
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,638
Sir, everyone's gone.

1046
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:16,228
No sign of the kids either.

1047
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,079
All I found was this.

1048
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,490
Come on, get in. Let's go.

1049
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:34,246
What should we do now?

1050
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,221
Go back to the real estate office?

1051
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:39,956
Hello!

1052
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:42,702
Sir, are you okay?

1053
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:51,489
I'm fine.

1054
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,900
Get in the car. Let's go.

1055
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,905
You have time to get to the airport?

1056
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:29,887
Oh, I think so.

1057
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:34,933
Hey, are you guys hungry?

1058
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:36,922
A little.

1059
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,387
You want to get something to eat, Gao?

1060
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:41,069
Oh, no I'm stuffed.

1061
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:44,516
Huh?

1062
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,156
I should head back,
Peach is waiting for me.

1063
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:49,241
Oh.

1064
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:57,019
Hey, tell me where you get sent.

1065
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:58,333
Take care.

1066
01:11:58,581 --> 01:11:59,951
Okay, I'm going now.

1067
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:01,303
Bye bye.

1068
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,740
I didn't know it was so late already.

1069
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:18,283
It's okay.

1070
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,501
I should go home anyway

1071
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,104
But I thought you were hungry.

1072
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,394
Yeah...

1073
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:31,656
But it's getting kind of late.

1074
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:36,108
And...you should get going too.

1075
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:45,529
Hey, I know where we can go.

1076
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:15,544
Hello and welcome.

1077
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:16,661
Peach.

1078
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,837
I thought you said only a few hours?

1079
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:21,223
I'm sorry.

1080
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,086
What took you so long?

1081
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:29,857
Tran into a few problems.

1082
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:34,642
Well, you're covering my next
two shifts.

1083
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:36,091
Okay.

1084
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:37,922
There's more stuff that needs
to be stocked.

1085
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:40,338
Okay.

1086
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:56,051
Peach.

1087
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:57,262
Hmm?

1088
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,552
What?

1089
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,121
See you tomorrow.

1090
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,102
Bye bye, Gao.

1091
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:15,433
Bye bye.

1092
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:28,480
What is this place?

1093
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:35,724
Give me a minute.

1094
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,009
Sorry, we're out of dumplings.

1095
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,940
It's okay.

1096
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,484
‘You sure you have time?

1097
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:17,632
I think so.

1098
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,370
I just have to grab my stuff upstairs.

1099
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:27,259
How is it?

1100
01:15:28,424 --> 01:15:29,354
Not bad.

1101
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:38,093
What are you smiling about?

1102
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,620
Nothing.

1103
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,684
I was thinking about you bugging me
at the bookstore.

1104
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:48,022
Yeah right.

1105
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,285
‘You were just someone to talk to.

1106
01:15:57,787 --> 01:15:58,687
Oh.

1107
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,112
Wait a second.

1108
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:10,544
So I...

1109
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:16,874
I should...
