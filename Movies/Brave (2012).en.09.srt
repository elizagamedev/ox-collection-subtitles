00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,234
Welcome to the Brave commentary.
I'm your host Mark Andrews.

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,946
I'm the director of Brave.
And I'm here with...

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,212
Steve Purcell,
co-director and co-writer.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:11,747
Nick Smith, editor.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,202
I'm Brian Larsen, story supervisor.

6
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,135
We were thinking
that with the Disney castle

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,520
we would actually change it into
the Dun Broch Castle.

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:20,983
There was a discussion

9
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,881
but we decided just to go with
the original Disney castle.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,258
We talk about a lot of things.

11
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,332
We talked about a lot of things
over the course of the film.

12
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,244
Wasn't there something you
wanted to do on the Pixar logo?

13
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,403
-Yeah, we wanted...
-The bagpipe thing.

14
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,785
We wanted him to come in
with some bagpipes.

15
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,537
-Or at least give him a kilt.
-And a kilt?

16
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,936
No when he jumped in it would be...
A bagpipe.

17
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,963
-Then a groan...
-Then a... Yeah.

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,159
-We should do that.
-It's not too late.

19
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,314
-We just did.
-Yeah.

20
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:54,663
So, the beginning of Brave
started very differently for a little while.

21
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,223
l had this whole scene where

22
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:01,574
Fergus was hunting
through the snow to find Mor'du

23
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,832
and we were going to
give the audience this experience of

24
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,603
encountering Mor'du
so that we'd know who he was

25
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,551
and know why Fergus
was missing the leg

26
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,464
and establish his hatred for bears.

27
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:20,148
Almost this Captain Ahab to Moby Dick,
kind of lust to destroy this bear

28
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,500
which plays into the story later.

29
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,276
We boarded it. We put it through layout.
We animated it.

30
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,603
We started to render it
and then in one screening

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,570
we realized that we're too far away
from our main character, Merida.

32
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:38,441
So there was this idea about
showing Merida when she was younger.

33
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:43,492
Of showing Merida and her mother
Elinor when everything was good.

34
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:48,863
So that after the sequence opened
and we flash forward in time,

35
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,980
we pick them up
and now their relationship is strained.

36
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,552
Well, that's what ultimately this scene,
I think, is trying to really set up

37
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,398
is, like, their relationship, family,
Mor'du, the wisps, the bow.

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,140
There was so much that this scene
was trying to incorporate

39
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,456
-and like you were saying with...
-Right.

40
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,000
-And Dad's relationship with Mom, too.
-Yeah.

41
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,842
And get it through organically.

42
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,880
We see her and her mom having
this great relationship where

43
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,094
they're playing and loving each other.

44
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:17,061
Dad gives her a bow for the birthday,
so this creates her love for the bow.

45
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,344
And we establish the wisps here
that lead you to your fate.

46
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,642
And in this case lead her away

47
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,877
from getting eaten by
this big, evil, demon bear.

48
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:31,481
But then this is that encounter
where we call Mor'du by name

49
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,841
and still get the encounter
between Fergus.

50
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,722
Well, originally we had Merida alone.

51
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,394
Right, sneaking out of the castle.

52
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,392
Yeah, we've had
many different openings.

53
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,567
And actually
it's surprising to think back on

54
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,149
how often we would do scenes that had

55
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,025
only a couple of
the characters together.

56
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,914
And I think there's a lot to be said for

57
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,486
putting all the characters together
right away,

58
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,955
so you can kind of
feel their dynamic from the get-go.

59
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,411
So we had to very quickly
create a brand new character.

60
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,083
That young Merida here.

61
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,366
And to get her right, we were
talking about taking a triplet

62
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,613
-and putting longer hair on it.
-Yeah.

63
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,581
We actually took Merida
and scaled her down to a little girl.

64
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,939
Pulled in the body
and got the proportions right.

65
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,041
Then we really had to
subtly adjust the face.

66
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,763
And we had to have
a whole new hair rig,

67
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,216
our new hairdo done.

68
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,424
And everybody just rallied
and did a marvelous job.

69
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,610
And we have this
super-cute little girl now.

70
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,518
And we also had to find a voice, too.

71
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,857
And Patrick Doyle, our composer,
found this girl to sing the lullaby.

72
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,924
The lullaby, yeah.

73
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,616
And thought that she might work.
And you went over and...

74
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,035
Met her and then we got the song.

75
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,874
And then I said, "Hey, I have this scene
l want you to try."

76
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,807
-What was her name?
-It was Peigi.

77
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,779
And she said, "Sure,"
and she'd never kind of acted before.

78
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,565
But then she did the voice
and knocked it out of the park.

79
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,721
We auditioned a bunch of little girls.

80
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,460
But it turns out
Peigi was the most natural.

81
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,916
And two sessions and she nailed it.

82
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,043
-She had a sweet voice.
-It was unpolished in a really sweet way.

83
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,603
And then we get into the attack here.
So everything is fate.

84
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,241
You can almost say that
the wisps led this encounter to happen

85
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,208
to be resolved
several years down the road.

86
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,392
This is the inciting incident
to kind of bring them all off.

87
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:15,421
And then to really get this big hit,
l really wanted this.

88
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,832
-Well, it's two great bookends.
-Yeah.

89
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,194
The beginning and the end of the family
coming together to fight Mor'du.

90
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,491
And so this is the opening here,

91
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,931
once we go through
the coming out of the clouds

92
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,232
and going into
the Highlands of Scotland

93
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,760
and coming down to find the castle.

94
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,995
It was my homage to
The Sound Of Music.

95
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,585
And I thought that
getting into the movies...

96
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,265
‘Cause that used to be our opening,

97
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:40,323
as just starting coming out of cloud
into images of Scotland.

98
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,227
But I really wanted to
transport the audience.

99
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,685
And there's several movies
that really do this well.

100
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,013
I think Braveheart does it well
by coming across the water

101
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,634
and rising up over
the Scottish Highlands.

102
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,366
Which I also do in this sequence.

103
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,756
And then, in Sound Of Music

104
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,820
to just give us a sense of this world
that we're going to be in,

105
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,985
I thought was very important.

106
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,745
This next scene right here,

107
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,293
actually Mark choreographed this
and we filmed it.

108
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,579
This fight scene right here,
Mark was actually Fergus.

109
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,509
You should be able to
find that on the Blu-ray.

110
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:15,988
-And were you...
-l was in there.

111
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,329
Yeah, I was one of the guys
who gets kicked.

112
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,514
How many guys? Did you actually
do it with that many guys?

113
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,086
I did it with that many guys, yeah.

114
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,464
We choreographed the whole thing.

115
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,427
The animators were really into
all the archery and the sword fighting.

116
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,278
And I was teaching them the swords

117
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,337
and doing all the choreography
and we were filming it.

118
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,945
-So they can really go in there...
-'Cause you're trained in this, right?

119
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,978
lam. But so they could go in there,
‘cause it's those details of

120
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,658
how you move and where you
shift your weight and all that stuff.

121
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,684
And they really wanted to nail it
and get it down.

122
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,555
There we see Merida as a teenager.

123
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,724
But I wanted to,
as soon as the doors opened,

124
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,453
find her doing something wrong.

125
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,330
She's just doing the stuff
that she wants to do,

126
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,463
like eating that apple,
but she's constantly getting in trouble

127
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,147
or being frowned upon by her mother.

128
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,579
Just so that we get that instant

129
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:05,182
change of dynamics of their relationship
from the beginning of the film.

130
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,312
We want a chance to see Mom
and Merida together.

131
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,347
So we could see,
even in their body language,

132
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,980
how different they are as characters.

133
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:15,402
Where Mom's pulled in and very formal.

134
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:20,102
And Merida is always more relaxed
and kind of has her head elsewhere.

135
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,691
We had this idea for just one day.

136
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,653
Ascene for a day in the life of Merida,
which had all these elements in there.

137
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,037
And then we decided to make it
like this mini montage

138
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:39,887
so we get that she's being kind of
ruled or run by her mom constantly

139
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,544
day after day after day after day
after day

140
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:48,347
with all these lessons,
and these reasons to be a princess.

141
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,821
So that when she gets her day
it's a real breakout.

142
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,594
We had a big issue because
we had a princess in this movie,

143
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:02,341
and because this is fairly
familiar ground with Disney films,

144
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,513
and other movies
that have a princess in it,

145
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:09,864
that we really wanted to define what
everybody thinks a princess is

146
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:11,563
in the opening,

147
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,408
so that we can break it
in this sequence once she gets out.

148
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,068
I mean, she ends up...

149
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,416
She's riding through the woods
and having this great day.

150
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,145
And we see her skills with the arrow.

151
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,490
How much she's developed
since the beginning of the film

152
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:23,955
when she couldn't hit nothing.

153
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,810
How capable and athletic she is,
how brave and bold she is.

154
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,635
And, later on,
she's even mucking out her own stall.

155
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,421
You don't really see princesses
mucking out their stalls in any movies.

156
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,528
So, we're visually saying, "This is not
the princess you think she is.

157
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,165
"She is not timid, a faint heart,
waiting for Prince Charming to come.

158
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,909
"She's going to do it all herself."

159
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,049
Well, this sequence in particular
is really a response to

160
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,676
the sequence with her mother.

161
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,047
The camera was very still
and muted colors.

162
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,840
Where here, the camera is very active
and the colors are bright.

163
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,190
So it's kind of comparing what Merida is
truly feeling during both sequences.

164
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,759
Right. Life in the castle is this drab,
boring, restrictive place.

165
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,167
But once she's out on Angus
riding around,

166
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,556
then it becomes
this big, bold free place.

167
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,916
And she's much more in her element,
her environment.

168
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,539
And she's ultimately
exploring who she is.

169
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:23,352
And finding things that she likes
and are inspiring to her, and risking.

170
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,880
I mean, she almost slips
and falls off of this rock.

171
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,989
We call that the Crone's Tooth.

172
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,891
Those are the Fire Falls
which was inspired by

173
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,443
this natural phenomenon that actually
happens in the United States

174
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,530
in Yosemite National Park
at a certain time of year.

175
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,644
The sun, when it sets,
casts this light on the falls

176
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,625
that makes it catch on fire
and they call that the Firefalls.

177
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,810
There are three songs in the movie.

178
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,350
And this is the first song written by
our very own Alex Mandel

179
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,560
who l asked to do these as temp songs

180
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,527
‘cause we needed something
in these positions.

181
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,992
And we listened to 'em so much
and everybody really liked 'em.

182
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,790
And I remember John Lasseter
and Andrew Stanton saying,

183
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,932
"Who did those songs?
Those are great!"

184
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,366
And so we kept them in the movie,
and got them re-recorded

185
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,829
and found a Scottish singer
and they turned out really great.

186
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,334
One thing that we were
talking about is that

187
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,529
the teenager is
always late to the dinner table.

188
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,418
And they've already eaten usually
or have gotten some snack

189
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,857
and she's always
stuffing her face before.

190
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,076
So it was a bigger thing at one point,
and we just scaled it down to

191
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,516
the couple shots of her
entering the kitchen,

192
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,656
having a couple of bites, and nibbling.

193
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,291
So that she can steal this
platter of cupcakes for her brothers.

194
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,890
What I like about the scene that you,
I think, were trying to establish was

195
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,967
you're setting up
the space of the castle.

196
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,899
You're trying to introduce the castle
and the family as a unit.

197
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,348
So you're trying to get a lot of space
associated for the audience.

198
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,143
So we want to meet these
characters that they're in

199
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,305
this exotic time period for us.

200
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,177
And so we want to see them in a way
that we recognize the situation totally.

201
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,050
And then we can get on board with
the characters much more easily.

202
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,537
It's a typical day.

203
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:14,026
You want to set up the normal day
before you see the extraordinary day.

204
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,734
It's really hard when you've got
something that's in the round here.

205
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,391
You've got a four-sided table
with characters on each side

206
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,927
to keep 'em straight.

207
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,818
So there is a pattern to
the cutting of who you see

208
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,056
and when and who locks down
on one side or the other.

209
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,779
With Fergus, usually Merida's head's
there on the left side of the screen.

210
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,293
And then with Mom, Merida's
head's on the other side of the screen,

211
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,793
on the right side of the screen.

212
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,527
So we know where Mom is
in relation to Dad.

213
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,204
And where the triplets are.

214
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,995
The filmmaking is all there
to try and lock us down into place.

215
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,195
And it also really illustrates
the difference in the relationship

216
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,537
between Mom and Dad.

217
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,531
Where she has this very
sweet relationship with her father.

218
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,828
And then her mother is barely
paying attention to her at this point.

219
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,051
Right. And we wanted to
switch that old dynamic

220
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,490
of Dad's usually reading
at the dinner table with the newspaper.

221
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,107
It's actually Mom, you know,

222
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,911
she has all of her affairs of state
and the castle,

223
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,945
you know, accounts and things,
so she's the business one

224
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,981
while Dad is engaging with the family.

225
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,913
And here's to set up a dynamic of just
between Merida and the triplets

226
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,043
that they're not antagonistic
towards one another.

227
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,955
They help each other out, and
you'll see that again later on in the film.

228
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,141
Ted Mathot actually had this great gag

229
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,820
when the dogs jump up
and try and start eating Fergus' food,

230
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,994
and he knocks them away.
And I thought that was just hilarious.

231
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,173
Because it just kind of goes to
the whole character of who Fergus is.

232
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,117
But what the air of
everything is inside the castle.

233
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,729
So for the dogs to jump up
and run across the table,

234
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,769
you have this chaotic air.

235
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,967
We had a back and forth a lot of time

236
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,492
of how queenly
or how kingly is this environment.

237
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,817
And I didn't want
a Queen Elizabeth queen

238
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,692
because that's devoid of emotion.

239
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,666
In this time period
kings and queens were just

240
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,654
beginning to emerge
in this kind of class society.

241
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,848
So there weren't established rules
of how one should act.

242
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,962
So we could be a little bit more loose
and relaxed and just made it more real.

243
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,686
And that way we could also
recognize the characters as parents,

244
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,927
even more so than as royals.

245
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,752
So we kind of recognize their behavior

246
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,704
and their issues
that they have with their daughter.

247
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:18,512
Right. Them being the royals just
created higher stakes in the story.

248
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,332
The larger problem that was
going to come up in the movie

249
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,517
by Merida refusing to marry anybody
and break with tradition.

250
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:28,521
So this scene is the start of
Merida and Mom's real blowup

251
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,815
in a big way that's coming.

252
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,220
And the crux of it ends up
in the tapestry scene.

253
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,454
Right. We're not that long
into the movie.

254
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,129
And I wanted to establish quickly

255
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,353
exactly what this story
is going to be about.

256
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:45,146
The main conflict is going to be
between this mother and this daughter.

257
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,565
This whole thing is
to get both of their sides.

258
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,800
‘Cause a lot of the time
what was happening was

259
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,899
Mom would be too stern,
a Mommie Dearest-type,

260
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,088
and we'd hate her.

261
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,596
And we could never hate her.

262
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,861
And then Merida, to go the other way,

263
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,673
would be too complain-y teenager
and we would hate her, too.

264
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,437
So it was to really find that,

265
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,770
and it's a very narrow path,
to dial in to where you like both of them,

266
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,031
and you understand both of them.

267
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,316
But very much this is Merida's picture.

268
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,212
And you have to be on Merida's side
without hating Mom.

269
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,302
Brad Bird had said,
"Nobody was really following

270
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,839
"that message of her
talking about this ancient kingdom."

271
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:27,879
So we had the idea to have
these little flashes of kind of showing it.

272
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:32,507
And it did for us, A, it identified this set.

273
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,455
This ruins, this ancient kingdom that
we're going to see later on in the movie,

274
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,356
so we recognize it.

275
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:44,040
And visually set up who this prince was
who was later going to become Mor'du.

276
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,911
Yeah, in our minds it seemed like
Mom tells these stories all the time.

277
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,268
And for whatever reason,
this one seemed like it stood out

278
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,604
and Merida would pay more attention.

279
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,926
Because the consequences of this story

280
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,992
seemed a lot more dire than
what she had heard before.

281
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,906
We went into this moment
that we called "deep thoughts."

282
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,578
Il had drawn Merida
sitting on top of a castle,

283
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,411
or that she's alone with her thoughts

284
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:12,073
so that we would get that this decision
or what can she possibly do.

285
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,759
How is that going to affect her life?

286
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,901
Then we also had this sequence where

287
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,216
Mom's got to talk about her daughter
to somebody.

288
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,732
The parents are always talking
about their children.

289
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,558
And we can get the other aspect of it.

290
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,516
And Katherine Sarafian, our producer,

291
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,293
would do this type of thing
to me all the time.

292
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,136
Where she would want to role play

293
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,577
before we'd go into a meeting
or something like that,

294
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,193
where Katherine would be the person
that l was having the meeting with,

295
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,374
so l could kind of
test run my questions and stuff,

296
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,127
or she could ask me questions
and I would fire back.

297
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,358
And I thought that was a great idea.
We could actually put that in the movie.

298
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:52,557
And Dad could be Merida
and Mom could actually talk to Merida.

299
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:52,788
And Dad could be Merida
and Mom could actually talk to Merida.

300
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,094
But it also illustrates the fact that

301
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,760
they are incapable of actually
having a conversation with each other.

302
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,536
So all they do is talk to themselves

303
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,136
as though they were having
a conversation with the other person.

304
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,115
And it fully gets out there
what their issue is.

305
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,367
Right, yeah, yeah.
So you understand both sides of it,

306
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,579
but neither of them actually
talk to each other.

307
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,551
We knew that we were going to have
these parallel conversations going on

308
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,971
and that's how we scripted it
in the beginning,

309
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,337
but then at some point

310
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,481
we realized we could
feather the conversations together

311
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,160
and make it feel like these characters
are actually talking to each other.

312
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,681
And it's the conversation
you sort of wish they'd have

313
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,426
where they're kind of calm,

314
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,275
they're actually
spilling their guts a little bit

315
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,293
and you kind of see the point of view
of each character.

316
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,409
Yeah, there were two separate scenes
until we figured out,

317
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,009
"This is the same information,
we should put it in one scene.

318
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,040
"Let's just edit these things together."

319
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,850
Then me and Steve went at it
and started writing it as one scene,

320
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,401
playing with the cuts back and forth.

321
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,585
As soon as we had that,
it was really working.

322
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,368
Here's Mom, what Mom wants to hear.

323
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,548
And here's Merida,
what Merida wants to hear.

324
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,487
So you know later on
when Mom's dressing Merida

325
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,957
and they're together that
they have this uncomfortable silence.

326
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,478
It's like, "Now here's the moment where
you guys can speak to each other."

327
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:05,624
And then they let it go,
‘cause they're incapable of doing that.

328
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:09,771
We have the introduction of the lords.
We had had it when they first arrived,

329
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,643
but it was nice to see them
arrive by longship,

330
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,174
just to get a sense of who they are,

331
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,673
having their names
announced by the pride of their clan.

332
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,874
Also, get a little sense of who
their characters are in the boat,

333
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,445
but that there's instantaneously
this rivalry between them.

334
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,685
So it doesn't come as a surprise
in the next scene

335
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,603
where they actually get to the castle.

336
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,295
Weren't you playing drums on that?

337
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,054
I was playing drums.
I'm the last guy who's rocking out.

338
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,457
We got that going on, yeah.

339
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,278
When you see them rolling in
on those ships,

340
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,683
you want to feel, "Here comes trouble."

341
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,954
Absolutely. Absolutely.

342
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,645
In this sequence,
we didn't always have the medallion.

343
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,500
We had it in other versions,
but with the medallion,

344
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,923
we needed something later on
to give to the Witch to pay for the spell,

345
00:16:56,716 --> 00:17:00,906
but also to give Merida the spell
in the first place, right?

346
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,957
Why would this witch
come out of retirement

347
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,080
to do these spells if not for something
that's really, really, really valuable.

348
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,118
And we had to go back in

349
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:13,297
and put the medallion into
all those finished shots.

350
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,296
We wanted to feel that
longing for that connection

351
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,059
that keeps falling away.

352
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,827
They have these moments
where they could,

353
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:23,448
if they could remember the language,
how to talk to each other.

354
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,790
And like a lot of parents and children,
you can get out of sync with each other.

355
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,844
And you're wishing
they would find a way to do it.

356
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,944
We actually cut this scene
from the movie in one iteration

357
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,230
thinking that it was too much.
But then later on,

358
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,879
once we had the movie together,

359
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,934
we realized
that we needed to put it back in,

360
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,102
‘cause what it showed was

361
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,591
they had this moment that they missed,
as characters.

362
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,882
They could have solved
the whole dilemma right here

363
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,038
if they just talked to each other.

364
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,010
But neither of them do.

365
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,817
Here, all Merida has
as she's dressed up by her mom,

366
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,991
she has one defiant gesture

367
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,713
and that's to pull her hair down
out of that wimple,

368
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,579
so that she's taking
some bit of control that she can be,

369
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,233
not just defiant, but her own person.

370
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,021
And now we're in here,
this is the first time

371
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,560
we're kind of meeting the lords.

372
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,168
Which has always been in the film,
hasn't it?

373
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,328
Yeah, there's always been
this setting up the stakes

374
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,356
of the threat of these guys
that are coming to Merida's fate.

375
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,811
We always had them where
they didn't get along with each other,

376
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,797
so we knew they were always
in danger of spinning off the rails

377
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,763
and going to war at a moment's notice.

378
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,293
So they were always
brewing as this threat.

379
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,432
But the way to introduce them
changed many times

380
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,169
over the course
of the story development.

381
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,518
Well, part of her marriage
is keeping the peace as well.

382
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,850
It's the inter-marriage between clans.

383
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,913
The fun thing about Fergus

384
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,406
setting up as not being
a very good public speaker,

385
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,488
as all kings should probably be
good public speakers,

386
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,688
was again to illustrate
that Mom is there to back him up.

387
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,781
We had always talked about
maybe she practiced with Fergus

388
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,581
of what he was going to say.

389
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,336
And as soon as he starts to blow it,

390
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,565
then she could very simply
just jump up and fill in.

391
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,107
And here's her potential suitors.

392
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,626
We've got
Mr. Captain Arrogance right here.

393
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,256
Which they weren't always
in the film either.

394
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,607
For a long time it was
just the lords themselves.

395
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,713
But we thought it was better to always
have this parent’child relationship.

396
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,991
This is setting up, still,
the competition between

397
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,247
all of the lords
that are introducing their sons,

398
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,413
their stories get more extravagant

399
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,252
and each of their sons
are clearly different characters.

400
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,922
And again, the animators
just blew this out of the water.

401
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,920
Yeah, Young MacGuffin here
being the shy,

402
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,111
afraid of his own powers,

403
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,030
even though he is the strongest,
the most powerful one.

404
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,006
Macintosh, the first guy,
with the sword being

405
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,391
all cocky pants and arrogant.

406
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:53,532
all cocky pants and arrogant.

407
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,169
And then this gag,
which is one of my favorites.

408
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,632
-With Dingwall? Yeah.
-With Dingwall.

409
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,609
He's always kind of
the butt of everybody's joke.

410
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,684
I mean, we even wanted him where
he came in on a little dinghy,

411
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,541
he never had a longboat.

412
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,739
Just 'cause he's so diminished and that
his son is totally diminished, too.

413
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,611
But you have this hulking,
we call him Conan, the big buff guy.

414
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,840
You know, that that is the hero.
He has the hero physique.

415
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:21,916
But then just to illustrate that these are
totally fish stories and exaggerated.

416
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,795
Also you can completely understand
why Merida wouldn't like any of them.

417
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,271
Exactly.

418
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,805
And Kevin McKidd is speaking
a dialect called Doric

419
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,038
which his mother speaks and he would
send his lines home to her.

420
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,341
And she would give him a translation
and he'd come in all ready

421
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,465
with this incomprehensible
authentic dialect

422
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,608
to do his lines as Young MacGuffin.

423
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,250
Yeah, it was a great character piece.

424
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,561
And to have
that character of Scotland in there,

425
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:49,134
because there are so many dialects
in Scotland and it's so varied.

426
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,515
And that was another thing
that really impressed me

427
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,311
when we were there researching,
was how varied not only the terrain are,

428
00:20:55,888 --> 00:21:00,608
but also the climates and the people
and the dialects.

429
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,549
And this is clearly setting up

430
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,869
that Mom is the ultimate peacekeeper
between all of the lords.

431
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,708
So this is, again,
exposition through entertainment

432
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,463
so you realize as the film will go on,

433
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,336
this is information
you need to be aware of

434
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,574
-that will happen later on.
-Right.

435
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,255
If they're left to their own devices.

436
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,068
Yeah, I mean,
they're just a big bunch of children,

437
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,068
and how easily they erupt into fighting.

438
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,816
Right? How can you run a kingdom
with these guys being in charge?

439
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,380
But Elinor is able to calm it down.

440
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,279
And that's what
this whole part of the sequence was for.

441
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,601
And there was a lot of talk about
how violent the sequence was,

442
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,829
or how much fighting there was.

443
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:43,431
And there was actually
more fighting in it

444
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,722
than what you're seeing
in the current thing.

445
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,795
I cut it down a little bit,
but just only a little bit.

446
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,645
A lot of it is still there.

447
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,113
A lot of it is in there.

448
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:57,618
But again, that, for the story point,
is to pay off Elinor being able to do this.

449
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,583
This one thing, to be able to
calm down everybody,

450
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,641
going into this hornet's nest
and get them all in line.

451
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,139
That's the respect that she commands.

452
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,486
And even the King's walking back to
his seat and sitting down,

453
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,666
cowed like a pet.

454
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,868
Then we learn later what happens when
you take Mom out of this equation.

455
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,388
‘Cause you can guess at it now
by watching this,

456
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:22,171
if Mom wasn't there,
this would probably go on for days.

457
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,614
In this moment,
we're trying to let the audience know

458
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,285
that Merida has something in mind.

459
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:32,531
We want to go to the games feeling like
she's got a workaround for this problem.

460
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,645
She's sorted it out
and heard something that Mom said.

461
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,988
And we played with this different ways,
until we just...

462
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,041
We wanted to see the thinking
and the problem solving on her face.

463
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,394
And it cracked us up,
this animation of her

464
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,783
jumping out of her chair,
"Archery, archery!"

465
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,066
And it was pretty late
that we were giving her

466
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,925
the choice of which event
that she could compete in.

467
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,121
But I think it really solidified it
that she now has...

468
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,890
She's in a power position.

469
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,359
Right. And making it work logically
with Mom's statement of,

470
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,493
here are the rules of this thing,

471
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,035
that it is customary for a princess

472
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,851
to pick the competition
for these guys to compete in.

473
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:13,291
It just kind of lines up
how she's going to solve this problem.

474
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,916
‘Cause she has no way out. Right?

475
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,755
She's stuck in this. How possibly
is she gonna get out of this?

476
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,928
We wanted to feel like
she was backed into a corner.

477
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,457
So you would forgive her for
going against her mom

478
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,418
and trying to solve her own problem.

479
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,362
So we have the games here.

480
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:32,684
And again, this was part of
the Scottish culture

481
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,475
where the Highland Games were
mostly created so

482
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,916
you could practice war arts
under the nose of the English

483
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,999
without them actually knowing.

484
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,071
So all the games
go back to that kind of thing

485
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,197
versus how they are played today.

486
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,228
Here we see the triplets
being chased by Maudie,

487
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,587
which is going to be a setup
and a payoff for

488
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,835
later on in the film in the third act.

489
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,629
Fantastic atmosphere
in the background,

490
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,218
just to set the depth of those Highlands.

491
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,510
-That is a Carnyx.
-Carnyx, yeah.

492
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,506
Yeah. And that tongue actually moves.
There's a little wooden piece with it.

493
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,529
Yeah, it was
an actual war horn they would use,

494
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,032
usually shaped like a boar.

495
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:16,287
And so we adapted it to make it a bear.
So it's thematically for our movie.

496
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,702
But they would use that 'cause
it would rise up above the soldiers.

497
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,002
Yeah, it would be
up above the attacking armies

498
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,564
and scare the other army to death.

499
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,908
That predates the bagpipe.

500
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,031
The crowds in this movie
are spectacular.

501
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,678
They're just amazing.
I mean, just the character design.

502
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,962
I don't know how many different people
we actually had

503
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,089
and different hair designs
and different clothes

504
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,167
that they could inter-swap just to
make them this mass of individuals.

505
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,368
It just really works fantastic.

506
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:54,525
And just again setting up
character through action.

507
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,106
And just again setting up
character through action.

508
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:59,828
Every one of these archers has
a different way of shooting that bow.

509
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,640
And this guy is just hilarious.

510
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,451
And his little groupie girls behind him.

511
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,214
Long ago we had
a version of this where,

512
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,151
before we had the lords' sons,

513
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,118
there was a version of the games

514
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:18,866
where Merida just didn't like this idea of
these guys playing for her at all.

515
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:21,775
And so she just gets in there
and starts a brawl.

516
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,996
-We actually had a haggis toss.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,166
And as the haggis was being lobbed
high in the air

518
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,575
she shoots through one of the haggis
and drenches everybody

519
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,041
and causes this blowup
that turns into a fistfight.

520
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,060
So as we worked on the story
we kind of dialed in

521
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,233
and made it these
very specific characters

522
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,258
that she's showing up
instead of the kind of general crowd.

523
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,363
Right. Which works really well because

524
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,954
we establish in the scene before
that this is part of the tradition.

525
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,881
This is a thing that happens

526
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,990
and that there are
specific rules for this tradition.

527
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:55,398
And Merida has found, as the
impetuous teenager always does,

528
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,518
the exception to the rules,
or the loophole for the rules.

529
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:03,031
So, she's actually right.
She's following the rules in her mind.

530
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:07,039
But at the end of the day
she's taken advantage of the system

531
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,668
and made everybody look like fools
and that's what leads to this big blowup.

532
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,072
But we're wanting to
agree with her at this point.

533
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,867
-We are forcing her into a corner.
-Yeah, we're one on her side.

534
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,040
I mean, what princess would want to be

535
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,658
forced to marry somebody
she doesn't want to?

536
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,192
The idea of the dress ripping
has been there forever.

537
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,454
Because it's, again,
another symbol of Mom

538
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,384
and the way Mom has identified Merida.

539
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:35,224
And Merida is pushing back against
that in a really visual, tangible way.

540
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,022
And for a long time she was never able
to make the third shot.

541
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,635
Mom was always able
to stop that third shot.

542
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,937
And then Nick here says,
"What if she does win?"

543
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,577
Yeah, it just creates for bigger stakes.

544
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,753
l also wanted to do this in slow motion

545
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,799
to really just put the aspect of,
she is winning herself.

546
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,447
And she has to beat them undoubtedly,
in no uncertain terms,

547
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,565
that she is the best and so
you couldn't argue it away from her.

548
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,495
So, I really wanted to slow it down.

549
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,660
I had a lot more slow motion moments
in the sequence.

550
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,531
And it stayed too long in Nick's terms.

551
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,454
-We overstayed our welcome?
-That's correct.

552
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,100
But we really get to break down and see

553
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,328
the archers' paradox
that happens with the bow.

554
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,924
You guys can
look that up on Wikipedia.

555
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,600
But it actually occurs.

556
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,262
The argument.

557
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,910
This was a scene that we had
done really early on in the film.

558
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,306
And it always remained as
the ultimate fight,

559
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,461
the knock-down drag-out
between Mom and Merida here

560
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,747
that we really wanted to
kick off the rest of the film.

561
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,259
Yeah, Emma Thompson worked
herself up into a froth

562
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,085
when she was doing this scene.
It was amazing,

563
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,670
‘cause she actually had the stool
in the studio

564
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,643
in her hands and her face turned red.

565
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,421
And she had really gotten herself
into a state

566
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,944
to get Mom's rage in this moment.

567
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,413
It's like all that bottled up rage

568
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,992
at her daughter's misbehavior
is coming out.

569
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,665
Well, there's something great
in this scene, too,

570
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,160
that they really go at each other here.

571
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:01,616
But they both cross the line
and regret it.

572
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,860
Merida chops that tapestry
and Mom burns that bow,

573
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:08,977
but you quickly see that they
come down out of their tempers.

574
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:13,947
Right. There's hypocrisy that's going on
in this scene for both characters.

575
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,440
That they're both unwilling to yield,

576
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,360
and, yeah, they cross the line in their
attempt to punish the other person.

577
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,864
And it just all goes bad from there.

578
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,946
Yeah, and Emma dialed up the intensity
even more so than she had before.

579
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,497
And she adlibbed that line,

580
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,836
"It'll be fire and sword
if it's not set right."

581
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,372
We loved when our actors would
give us material like that

582
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,225
that felt really authentic.

583
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,657
I mean, Emma Thompson's
a writer in her own right.

584
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,533
So, it was great to work with her
and get her suggestions

585
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,873
and it was like
watching a private performance

586
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,426
every time we're recording her.

587
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:49,744
And Mom knew
she was wrong right away.

588
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:50,844
Like a parent,

589
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,626
sometimes you step over the line

590
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,328
and realize you're acting like a kid.

591
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,473
And she regrets it right away

592
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,555
when she steps over
and hurts that precious bow.

593
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,088
This is the same bow that Dad
gave her in the beginning of the movie.

594
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,874
Merida, in this moment,
we always felt like

595
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,755
she was a teenager that got into her car

596
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,628
and drove out of the driveway
and took off.

597
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,966
And she's just letting Angus
run wherever he wants.

598
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,503
She's just along for the ride
and just wailing.

599
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,066
And this scene here, the ring of stones,

600
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,081
we had debated for a long time
on how to introduce this location.

601
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,062
There was even a time
earlier on in the film

602
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,291
where Merida and her dad
had actually seen this spot before

603
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,607
and now she's going to return to it.

604
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,226
But ultimately we came down to,

605
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,491
"Just let her visit the place
when she happens to go there."

606
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:36,195
Right. These big standing stones
that are around in Scotland

607
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,822
that were set up by the Picts
or who knows who

608
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,611
and what their purpose was
is still in question.

609
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:46,845
But there's ideas about fairy rings
and circle rings being magical.

610
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,232
And for our purposes in Brave
this circle ring is magical.

611
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,762
It ends up being a type of portal
that we always return to.

612
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,753
And Angus knows it and Angus...

613
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:59,721
That animal sense is why
he won't cross into the circle,

614
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,792
is that something is going to happen.

615
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,320
He kind of understands that
on his animalistic level.

616
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,511
We were inspired by
the Callanish stones

617
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,009
which we saw on our research trip.

618
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:13,569
But there's all kinds of stones like this
scattered around in Scotland.

619
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,072
You could just find a strange stone
in someone's backyard.

620
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,132
Right. Whether they were
stood up by giants, or...

621
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:22,061
One of our guys
had a great idea, a theory

622
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,301
that they were way markers
for navigating across land.

623
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:26,811
That you'd be able to see them

624
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:31,219
and they'd point you in a direction of
where the next stones were,

625
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,506
or where the next town or village
or city was.

626
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,352
And I thought was
a really interesting idea.

627
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,447
l hadn't heard that one before.

628
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:41,753
But the wisps here are leading her
to her fate or a possible fate.

629
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,547
And she follows them,

630
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,829
like she followed them
at the beginning of the movie,

631
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,081
which leads her to the Witch's cottage.

632
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:50,950
Feel the lighting going darker.

633
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,089
We know we're getting into
unchartered terrain in here,

634
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,870
and that it's a little more threatening.

635
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,168
A little bit more Snow White
to the forest here.

636
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,957
Yeah, magical going from
the light side into the dark side.

637
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,817
This ancient black house cottage.

638
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:06,496
It looks like the cottages
that we saw in Scotland as well.

639
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:07,832
Stone cottage with...

640
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,876
Covered with like grass
and moss on top.

641
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,050
Now this scene was the very first scene
that we ever got approved

642
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,509
to go into production on the film,

643
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,155
but actually turned out to be

644
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:26,485
the very last scene we actually
got finalized in making the film.

645
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,565
Yeah, there was so many different
versions of who this Witch was.

646
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,763
And how even Merida even entered

647
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,700
or discovered
what was really going on in this set.

648
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:39,201
Julie Walters does
a fantastic job with the voice.

649
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,901
And we went over a lot of ground,

650
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:48,010
really nailing down and getting specific
with who this character was.

651
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,887
From a nice old lady to a maniac lady
to a ditzy lady.

652
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,065
She tried it tons of different ways

653
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,630
before we finally
got the scene working right.

654
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,269
And now she's just
kind of a proud salesman.

655
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:04,315
This kindly old lady who just does art
in the back of her house,

656
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,233
but is very excited about
the prospect of having a customer.

657
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:12,014
At one point we had her as this
addled lunatic that had cabin fever.

658
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,844
And when she'd see a wisp,
it was like a mouse in her kitchen

659
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,107
and she'd just wail at it with her broom.

660
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:20,929
We're really fighting
what everybody knows about witches.

661
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,306
We've seen them so much
in films and in literature

662
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,917
We've seen them so much
in films and in literature

663
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,292
that they come with their own baggage.

664
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:31,248
So how do we make it fresh and new
and super entertaining.

665
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,243
The Crow character is unique

666
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,358
in that we discovered along the way
of building the scene.

667
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:40,575
We found that the Witch doesn't have
anybody to counter off of.

668
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,943
So, how do you
make this organic scene happen

669
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,995
with just Merida asking questions?

670
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,960
And she was not necessarily
going to ask the correct questions.

671
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:52,123
Also, how do we find out that
she's actually a witch and does spells.

672
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,787
So, came up
with this idea of having a crow.

673
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,803
You know, like a familiar pet
that can actually talk,

674
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,586
and that would ultimately
give away that she's a witch.

675
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,107
But the Crow had a larger role
in one of the versions of the scenes

676
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,637
where they acted
like an old married couple.

677
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,679
It would antagonize her and
she'd tell it to shut up and everything.

678
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,816
And he would mutter to himself,
"lL was a man. l was a man."

679
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,581
We thought that was fantastic.

680
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,881
And so Steve actually
does the voice of the Crow.

681
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,706
And he does an excellent job.

682
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,593
We knew in the sequence
it was a pivotal moment

683
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:28,936
for Merida to get the device
that was going to alter her life

684
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,154
and set things in motion.

685
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:35,346
But we also had to learn that the
Witch and Mor'du had a relationship,

686
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,941
that she dealt out the same type of spell
ora spell for him, too,

687
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,091
that we find out later is the same.

688
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,669
But how do we
get those kinds of exposition

689
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,168
that we absolutely need to have,

690
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,578
and make it entertaining?

691
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,800
Yeah, there are a group of elements
floating around in the story,

692
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,787
the first being Mom's story
about the ancient kingdom,

693
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,133
and then you get
a second set of information

694
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,841
when you're in here about the prince.

695
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,559
And then it's not until the ruins
that you find out the full story.

696
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,005
Right.

697
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,993
We came up with this idea that

698
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,395
when she walks in
it's a wood carver's shop

699
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,181
to throw off the audience to the scent.

700
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,703
And also, Merida, what she's expecting
the wisps lead her to.

701
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,893
So she's entirely confused.

702
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,482
And she's kind of like a witch in hiding.

703
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,597
We kept a lot of these elements
that she was a witch,

704
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:23,822
she doesn't want to do it anymore
because of...

705
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,942
Well, you deal with magic
and things go bad.

706
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,408
And she doesn't want to do that.

707
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,886
And she finds her true bliss,
which was in carving.

708
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:33,022
Of course, we had these questions
come up of, "Why a bear?"

709
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:36,055
Why does the spell
always turn people into bears?

710
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,467
And we went round and around
with a bunch of different ideas.

711
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,467
We finally
just made her this wood carver

712
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,920
and all she carves was bears
because she's just obsessed

713
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,545
and just left it at that.

714
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,717
‘Cause it doesn't really, ultimately,
at the end of the day,

715
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,515
need to be explained.

716
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,721
You know, whether she only knew
one trick out of a book.

717
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,834
So she doesn't want to
give Merida the spell,

718
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:57,814
‘cause she doesn't want to
go back down those roads

719
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,529
and into her past.

720
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,231
So Merida having the necklace

721
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,507
be an essential part of
getting the spell from her,

722
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,478
being this expensive jeweled thing

723
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,248
that Merida would
buy all the wood from her,

724
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,987
we thought was an element that worked.

725
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,499
And also kept the idea of the necklace.

726
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:20,755
‘Cause the necklace used to be
another birthday present for Merida

727
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,496
given to her by her mom.

728
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,654
And it had much more
of a significant value

729
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,223
that we kind of took away.

730
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,941
And just had it as part of
Mom dressing her up to be like her.

731
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,943
We see Mom wearing it
at the beginning of the movie,

732
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:38,466
but we don't go into that kind of value
as deeply as we did.

733
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,537
I love that all the most dramatic
and unusual lighting

734
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,843
is in the sequences with the Witch.
The most, kind of...

735
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,743
The greens and the odd back lighting

736
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,249
and the reds and stuff
are coming out in her sequences.

737
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,415
In the background
Dad is singing this drinking song.

738
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,496
And we just wanted to
keep alive the idea

739
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,544
that there's this dangerous situation
brewing in the castle.

740
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,292
And so, it was kind of inspired by
things like Pirates Of The Caribbean,

741
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,754
where it's this good-natured song
about doing terrible things.

742
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,118
In this case it's about

743
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,825
how many different ways
they're going to kill Mor'du

744
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,218
and slaughter him and make stew
out of him and things like that.

745
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,567
And, Steve, you wrote a lot of that,
didn't you?

746
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,492
Alex Mandel and I wrote a version.

747
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,061
And then Patrick Doyle
wrote a more Scottish version

748
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,850
that has a lot more
Scottish references in it.

749
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,833
We got our loop group together
and taught them the song

750
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,016
and it was like an old drinking song.

751
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,695
It was singing it in rounds,
it was fantastic fun.

752
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,964
Yes, so we wanted to
hit the story notes of,

753
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,576
you know, that Dad's been
looking for this bear for a long time

754
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,486
and plans to hang his head
up on the wall as soon as he can.

755
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,571
There's a little moment of hesitation
in here

756
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:46,241
where Merida thinks Mom has already
come around to her way of thinking.

757
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,964
And it makes her question whether
she should see this spell through or not.

758
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,393
Merida thinks her mom is relenting
and she's going to get her way,

759
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,049
therefore, no need for the cake.

760
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,274
But then when Mom goes,

761
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,535
"But you still have to
go through with everything,"

762
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,088
then she's going to give her this cake.

763
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,892
Now, Mom is totally misunderstanding
thinking Merida's totally solved

764
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,569
and will go along
with her way of doing things,

765
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,979
not knowing
that she's being had right now.

766
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,306
And we kept talking about this moment

767
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,735
of what does Merida expect
the spell cake is going to do?

768
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,048
Change her right away?

769
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,634
Is she going to just up and eat it and go,

770
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,906
"You know what, on second thought
you don't have to get married."

771
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,457
"You know what, on second thought
you don't have to get married."

772
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,781
So, Merida is
constantly staring at her mom

773
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,757
looking for any sign of change.

774
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,269
And we just keep that build-up going
until we get our answer a little later.

775
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:35,611
Yeah, our big brain trust note
for this idea was,

776
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,047
you wanted to feel like Mom turned into
the worst possible thing

777
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,216
that she could be in this situation,
which was a bear.

778
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,214
Because everybody in this place hates
bears and wants to do away with them.

779
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,743
Right. And just keep that,

780
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,658
it's the fun-naturedness of Fergus
that we have

781
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,729
that, when it actually happens
and there's a bear in the castle,

782
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,282
he is like the Terminator
going after this bear.

783
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:57,604
So we had that contrast.

784
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:58,712
For him it's an adventure.

785
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,083
It's like Jaws,
when those guys go after the shark,

786
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,149
it's scary but it's fun at the same time.

787
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,381
It's got this adventure spirit to it.

788
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,440
l remember we used to have
Mom physically change

789
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,090
that she would grow hair,
her fingernails.

790
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,039
And it started in this scene
a long time ago,

791
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,028
the shots still remain the same.

792
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,990
But after a while it was that we were
taking a lot of those elements out

793
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,133
to keep the surprise
as much as possible.

794
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,545
And there was also that idea

795
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,460
that she was changing into
and looking like Fergus,

796
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,666
because he was a bear king.

797
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,525
And so you think
she's going to turn into him,

798
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,344
but then ultimately turns into a bear.

799
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,983
So it was kind of confusing.

800
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,582
"What are we actually saying?
What direction are we going?"

801
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,731
So we stripped that back out
and gave her this tummy ache instead,

802
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,642
which was very entertaining.

803
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,640
But Merida doesn't know
what to expect with the spell.

804
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,584
Is it working or not?

805
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,292
When is Mom just going to turn around

806
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:50,904
and say, "You know what,
this whole thing is over,

807
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,596
"let me go talk to everybody"?

808
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,207
So, we just keep that idea going.

809
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,488
One of the original concepts was that
she wanted Mom to be more like Dad.

810
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:58,872
Right.

811
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,153
‘Cause Dad was much more
easygoing on her

812
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,119
and less demanding of Merida.

813
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,140
Right. So, to solve her problem,

814
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,646
"If Mom became Dad

815
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,062
"I'd be done."

816
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,739
But again, we took that back out

817
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:13,388
because I didn't want the story
to be about parent comparison.

818
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,532
-Competition between parents.
-Yeah.

819
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,343
So, along the way
we just wanted to feel that

820
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,205
Merida is totally obsessed with the idea

821
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,223
that Mom is going to
change into something.

822
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,639
Not necessarily physically,

823
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:26,084
but just the idea of
coming around to her way of thinking.

824
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,749
Some of this transformation
was inspired by...

825
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,545
We were looking for humor and horror
at the same time.

826
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:40,015
And so one of the references that
we were thinking about was Pinocchio,

827
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,415
when kids turn into donkeys and
how it's kind of horrifying and shadowy

828
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,919
and there's a strange goofiness to it
at the same time.

829
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,669
So, when she's smashing into the bed
and everything it's funny,

830
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,489
but the size of it,
the scale of the transformation

831
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,035
can be scary at the same time.

832
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:58,923
Yeah, there's a great contrast
of reality and comedy

833
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,110
that happens in this sequence,

834
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,452
that we know the sequence was working
when we were getting it.

835
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,249
You know, where you were scared
but it wasn't horrific

836
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:09,796
and you can laugh at the same time.

837
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,271
Then go, "Oh, my gosh,
that thing is huge."

838
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,471
And then laugh because the tapestry
fell over its head, you know?

839
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,759
And that you're bouncing back and forth
between those elements.

840
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,948
And to also make the scene fun,

841
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,335
you can have somebody
transform into a bear and freak out,

842
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,149
but it's not going to
have that entertainment

843
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,625
or the fun that we...

844
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,440
It was really difficult
to find it in that scene.

845
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,159
But once we found it,
it really played well.

846
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,860
Yeah, I mean, getting it in storyboards

847
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,912
and basically composing this
and doing the shots

848
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,679
and finding it,
there's that entertainment value,

849
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,121
but it's not until
you actually get into the animation

850
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:42,524
where the subtlety of the acting
really transforms the scene

851
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,201
and gives you those subtleties
that you need in character.

852
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,556
And Merida is just annoyed

853
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,714
because this thing didn't go at all
the way she was expecting it to.

854
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:57,287
And there's no way she's going to
accept any responsibility at this point.

855
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,006
She's just annoyed.

856
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,747
She feels like
she was ripped off by the Witch.

857
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,609
It's still not her fault,
in true teenager fashion.

858
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,812
It's, "Il didn't do this to you,
the Witch obviously did this to you."

859
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,988
We actually played it in certain versions
for a long time

860
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,078
where Merida didn't know
if this was her mom at all

861
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,758
or this fierce, threatening bear.

862
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:19,834
And we ultimately decided that
the earlier you can perceive

863
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:23,875
that Mom's personality is
inside the bear, the better off we are.

864
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,729
Yeah, you could just
get right to the dilemma of,

865
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,411
"Oh, my gosh, my mom's a bear.

866
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,846
"How do I get her out of this castle
filled with bear-hating men

867
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,620
"that hunt bears and kill bears?"

868
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,881
And then again, pushing that idea that
Mom doesn't care that she's a bear.

869
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,565
She's going to go out and
she's going to talk to Fergus about this,

870
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,574
or go find that Witch.

871
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,919
And so we have this dilemma of

872
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:47,812
there's a bear in the castle
and Fergus is already onto it.

873
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,180
Which gives us
this just great entertainment value of

874
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,276
how do you get this huge thing
out of the castle?

875
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,810
Immediately, they have
the worst thing on their tail,

876
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,583
the pressure and the stakes go right up.

877
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,815
Right up. And when we figured this out
we go, "That's a win.

878
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,929
"That's entertainment right there,”
and we could push this moment.

879
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,489
And the other physical devices we used
to illustrate Mom being in there,

880
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,076
she puts her crown on.

881
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,667
In her mind,
she's just the same as she was before.

882
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,226
She puts her crown on and she pulls
curtains up around her as a dress,

883
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:16,198
because it's not proper
to go out undressed.

884
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,689
because it's not proper
to go out undressed.

885
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,991
-And she stays queenly all through this.
-Totally.

886
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,681
The way that she walks and behaves
and everything.

887
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,687
But she's in this gigantic body

888
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:28,199
so she's constantly
not used to knocking things over.

889
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,616
And we see, visually, that
she doesn't fit in this world anymore.

890
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,971
Again, keeping that tension up
with the little sound

891
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:38,064
and Fergus is hunting them.

892
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,399
Photographing this 5'4" redheaded girl

893
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,811
and this nine-foot-tall bear
was a pain in the butt.

894
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,957
The lenses that we used,
the camera angles that we used.

895
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:52,124
We'd always have to be lower or higher
to get 'em both in frame.

896
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,123
And I like to keep them both in frame

897
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:56,308
because we had
that sense of environment

898
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,754
that they're there together,

899
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,939
instead of just using singles,
which don't necessarily

900
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:04,196
give you the value
of the relationship of the characters.

901
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,412
You'd have to rely on eye line.

902
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,881
But to have them both in the shot,
sharing the shot together,

903
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,031
either in a two-shot or in overs,

904
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,576
was just really difficult to keep going

905
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,042
because of
the size change of Mom-bear.

906
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,268
And whenever you don't see the floor,
we're sinking Mom into the floor.

907
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:21,815
And we're cheating a lot.

908
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,236
And the 2.39 aspect ratio
exacerbated it, too.

909
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,625
It doesn't help anything.

910
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,540
I mean, it is the screen ratio of the gods.

911
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:30,743
But it doesn't help when things are tall.

912
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:32,996
We had a whole section at one point

913
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:36,494
where they go outside the castle
and then they had to make it to the wall.

914
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,948
And so we had
a couple of guards on the wall

915
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,837
and they have to distract one...

916
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,462
It just got too much.

917
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,743
And the sequence suffered from,
when we were building it,

918
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,463
a lot of stop and starts,
stop and starts, stop and starts.

919
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,111
And those kind of moments
where you would run into an obstacle

920
00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:54,187
that you'd have to stop, distract them
or figure out a way to get around them.

921
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,379
Then start up again
to find another obstacle,

922
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:59,131
it was just slowing down
the pacing of the sequence.

923
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,640
So we had to trim it all down,
keep it in the castle,

924
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:05,694
because that was a great visual
of inside to outside,

925
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,044
it's just a clearer read
of they've gotten out.

926
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:11,127
Once they get out,
then I can cross this off

927
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:11,647
and they could be
anywhere in Scotland.

928
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,459
and they could be
anywhere in Scotland.

929
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,958
So, that part of the story
became more action oriented

930
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:17,964
and less of the time we needed

931
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,479
for them to engage with each other
as characters.

932
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:23,932
We wanted to raise the stakes and
have them in the castle to be chased.

933
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:25,772
And so we came up with this idea

934
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:29,373
that she goes and she gets help
from her triplet brothers

935
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:33,744
to distract King Fergus and the lords
so that they can get out.

936
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,542
We came up with this idea that

937
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,526
they're chasing this ghost shadow
through the castle.

938
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,410
And it was originally a little puppet,
a little wooden puppet.

939
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:45,656
And then at some point it got changed
into a barbecued chicken on a stick.

940
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:50,094
Yeah, we thought that the puppet,
while it worked and while it was logical,

941
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,591
there was just something
way more comedic

942
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:55,507
about putting
a chicken on the end of a stick.

943
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,010
Was it a wooden puppet?

944
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,631
It was a wooden puppet.
It was a wood puppet.

945
00:44:58,930 --> 00:44:59,950
It looked like a quick carving,

946
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,008
like something
that they can do really fast.

947
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,466
And I don't know if it was
in a review with John or somebody

948
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,613
they said it was just too...

949
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:08,808
Like they thought about it,

950
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,880
and it had to be
even a quicker decision

951
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:12,472
like, "What do we use?
What do we use?"

952
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,053
You know, out of your resources.

953
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:15,805
It's like, "Grab that chicken."

954
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,832
And we all laughed
at the impossibility of it.

955
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:20,187
It works.

956
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:21,678
But this is animation for crying out loud.

957
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:22,973
It totally works.

958
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,591
And it does its job.
You have this great scene.

959
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:30,823
And they had built this whole castle set
with all these ins and outs,

960
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:35,346
but it's such a great, great set
inside this castle,

961
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:39,977
l wanted to exploit that even more and
have these shots inside and outside.

962
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,218
We used to have
Dad go out on the road

963
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,090
hunting Mom as a bear

964
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,808
and putting the pressure
on Merida and Mom.

965
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,505
And what we found is that

966
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,529
it made it more difficult
for Merida and Mom

967
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,661
to have character moments together

968
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:55,037
if there was always
heat on them from behind.

969
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,819
So, this gave us a comedic way

970
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,731
to let Dad be
the single-minded bear hunter guy.

971
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,091
That's Victor Navone's animation
of the chicken on his head.

972
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,904
He came up with a dozen different ways

973
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:11,310
of this guy coming down the chimney
into the oven there to scare Maudie.

974
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,093
And one of them was

975
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,537
he came down
with the chicken on his head.

976
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,055
And I'm all, "Bingo, that's the one."

977
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,995
This is also Victor with the snot.

978
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,308
There were so many ways that,

979
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,200
after they came out of their tussle,
he had about six different ideas

980
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,320
and he's all, "I don't know
if you're going to like this one."

981
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,872
And when he showed it to us,
it was the booger coming out.

982
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,688
l said, "Done."

983
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,299
Everybody who has a toddler
sees that six times a day.

984
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,835
Yeah, right, that's right. That's right.

985
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,158
And this is setting up...

986
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:40,386
When they come over and they see
the cake, "Anything that you want."

987
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:44,134
We had to, 'cause we're
transforming them into bears later,

988
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:46,970
we had to leave 'em off
with finding that spell cake

989
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:47,381
we had to leave 'em off
with finding that spell cake

990
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,348
where Merida had left it
from the previous scene.

991
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:51,487
And it'll be a long time
till you see them as bears,

992
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,362
so we wanted to make it very clear that

993
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:56,837
you knew what was going to happen
when they ate that cake.

994
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:03,166
Our first shot of nudity, I think,
in all of animation right there.

995
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,404
-For Pixar.
-For Pixar, nudity.

996
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:10,397
I'd have to have
animation historians look into that.

997
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,045
Right.

998
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:16,462
Actually, I think, also one of Kelly's
first line reads was on this scene.

999
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:18,058
We did a test on this, right?

1000
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,642
We did a test on this
which was amazing.

1001
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:23,636
She really knocked it out of the park.

1002
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:28,104
In this travel sequence with
Mom and Merida on the road together,

1003
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:33,177
we were always trying to balance
how upset can they be with each other.

1004
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,774
Because you know
there's contention there,

1005
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,703
but you want it to be entertaining.

1006
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,741
You don't want it to go on so long
that you can't stand to be around them,

1007
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,505
but you want to feel like
they're at odds with each other.

1008
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:46,178
Because Merida just did
a horrific thing to her mom.

1009
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,147
And we wanted to
hold back Merida's self-realization

1010
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,270
-that she had screwed up.
-Exactly.

1011
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:54,912
Yeah, so she's being stubborn
and she wants to do things her way,

1012
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,692
and Mom is asserting herself her way.

1013
00:47:58,109 --> 00:47:59,538
And they're just not getting along.

1014
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:02,474
But we didn't want to see them
arguing the whole time either.

1015
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:06,227
Right. We had the griping happen
during the walk

1016
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:07,714
and it wasn't working.

1017
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:09,822
It seemed like
she was being really mean.

1018
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,297
So then we moved it
and got a different read on it,

1019
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,940
like it was under her breath
before they started walking,

1020
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,029
let them kind of walk in this silence.

1021
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,731
And all of a sudden it totally worked.

1022
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,875
In a very old version
of this part of the movie,

1023
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,278
we actually had
Merida go back to the castle

1024
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,630
and leave Mom in the Witch's cottage.

1025
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,225
And Mom was in there getting hungry,
trying to make tea

1026
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,812
and she burns the place down

1027
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,627
and comes racing through the forest
on fire,

1028
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,130
like, her rear end is caught on fire.

1029
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:38,551
The demon hell-bear, yeah.

1030
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:42,216
Yeah, and the villagers see this bear
with a fiery halo around it

1031
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:46,656
and send home the news that
Mor'du is rampaging through the forest.

1032
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,481
Which sent Dad out on the hunt.

1033
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,734
This had gone through
a few iterations, too,

1034
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,056
that the cottage was dilapidated,
it was old.

1035
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,511
Right. It was destroyed.

1036
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,576
We had weird magic happening
where hundreds of years have passed.

1037
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:03,349
But we had this idea that they return
and there's a note on the door.

1038
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:05,651
Well, a note on the door
is not good enough.

1039
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,266
It's not dynamic, a note on the door.

1040
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:09,975
Or that the Witch was there
and packing up and leaving,

1041
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,404
and she could tell herself.

1042
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:12,609
But then that's not dynamic.

1043
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,370
And we thought,
"Why doesn't she use magic?"

1044
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,890
And this idea of this magical
answering machine came up.

1045
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:23,518
One of my favorite lines in here is...
Steve wrote this sequence.

1046
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:27,304
We were really balancing how modern
the Witch needed to sound,

1047
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:28,794
as if this was her shop

1048
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,083
and she's leaving this message
of the things that she can do.

1049
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,519
"We had wedding cake toppers,"

1050
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,654
and "for messages in Gaelic vial two,"

1051
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,509
and "to speak to a live homunculus"
is probably my favorite,

1052
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,240
and "to speak to a live homunculus"
is probably my favorite,

1053
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,964
one of my favorite lines
in the whole movie.

1054
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,378
And then John Lasseter
had this great moment

1055
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:50,497
to make this really impactful
of the spell,

1056
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:54,581
the actual wording of the spell
is that, clunk, we go red

1057
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,969
and we put echo on it and all this stuff
and made it kind of sinister.

1058
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,712
And she was really
acting the part of the Witch,

1059
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:04,120
which is the only time
she's really traditionally witchy.

1060
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,335
Well, there were years

1061
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,250
that went into making
those specific words of that spell.

1062
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:11,577
And we used to
include the lords' relics.

1063
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,252
The lords' relics,
that she had to gather them all.

1064
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,078
-Caldrons, swords...
-Stones...

1065
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,510
Right, or we needed their tribal artifacts
to make the spell go away.

1066
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,070
Yeah, that was a red herring

1067
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,868
because it was talking about the relics

1068
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,676
which were physical objects
in the movie.

1069
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,329
But when later Merida realizes

1070
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,933
the relics had been
sewn into the corners of the tapestry.

1071
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,260
Which I think still exists in the tapestry.

1072
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,499
Yeah. They're in the tapestry
but they're just an element.

1073
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,674
And then we had later used
that they were the physical lords.

1074
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:40,007
It was the kingdom,
this family had to see this apology.

1075
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,723
But then we just left that element out

1076
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,569
until we found the actual words
that really worked.

1077
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,223
And it's a lot of trial and error.

1078
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:52,379
Story, these moments,
everything is trial and error.

1079
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,977
Right? Reworking it and watching it.

1080
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,252
And you only find that organically,
you know?

1081
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,521
That's what makes it alchemy.

1082
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,659
So the cottage has blown up.

1083
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,743
The message machine blows up.

1084
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:07,761
They overload it accidentally
with the magical spells.

1085
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:11,049
In kind of our homage
to Mission: Impossible.

1086
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,875
So, any chance
of getting any kind of concoction

1087
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:16,234
that's going to change Mom back
.
IS now gone.

1088
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,747
And we have their low moment.

1089
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:21,253
We had this whole other scene
where Mom freaks out

1090
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:25,335
and she gets caught and choked
by ropes and stuff and lashings

1091
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,730
and then Merida calms her down.

1092
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,575
But it was just too much,
that they can both realize

1093
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,331
there's something about getting
the rug pulled out from under you

1094
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,627
that was more meaningful.

1095
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:37,482
It slowed everything down

1096
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:41,305
and brought
the weight of their dilemma to light.

1097
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:46,029
And then Mom is mad at her daughter,
but can't say anything,

1098
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:49,074
and she gives her that one look
and rolls over.

1099
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,256
And now Merida...
It's really hitting Merida,

1100
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:55,113
her guilt of what she's selfishly done.

1101
00:51:57,748 --> 00:51:59,678
This actually came
before the first scene.

1102
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,890
Yes, the flashback.

1103
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,862
We had a young Merida here
that we knew we needed to get.

1104
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,432
But we were debating
whether we were going to have,

1105
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:10,665
because of the difficulties
of creating a young Merida.

1106
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,271
So, as soon as that other scene,
the opening scene,

1107
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,154
we said, "We definitely need
a young Merida."

1108
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,276
Then I said, "Then this is going in."

1109
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:21,445
Patrick Doyle wrote the beautiful lullaby
that was translated into Gaelic and...

1110
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:25,202
Sung by Emma Thompson and Peigi.
Yeah, it was beautiful.

1111
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,613
We had had a temp song in there
that was Gaelic

1112
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,288
that was about drowning at sea
or something, wasn't it?

1113
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,324
But since we didn't understand
the words, it sounded beautiful to us.

1114
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,500
It did, it was totally beautiful.

1115
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,734
We couldn't hear
the drowning story within it.

1116
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:40,733
The run up into this area

1117
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:43,518
is like a power struggle
between Merida and Mom.

1118
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:47,651
And Merida has the upper hand
because she's still a human being,

1119
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,305
but Mom still tries
to maintain her authority.

1120
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,415
And then, of course,
Merida, knowing the woods,

1121
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:58,002
knows that everything Mom has done,

1122
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:01,152
while good-natured and well-meaning,
.
IS wrong.

1123
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,572
There's worms in the water,

1124
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,117
she picked poisoned berries.

1125
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,312
So, they're not going to survive.

1126
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:08,585
She's out of her element there.

1127
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,308
She's out of her element big time.

1128
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:11,731
And we're in Merida's world.

1129
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:15,359
And this is where the transition
happens for us in the story

1130
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,176
of Merida becomes the parent now

1131
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:19,995
over the person that needs help,

1132
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,197
which is her mother,
who's now in the child's role.

1133
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,868
It turns out a nightshade berry
will not kill you, but it'll make you dizzy.

1134
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:25,919
It turns out a nightshade berry
will not kill you, but it'll make you dizzy.

1135
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,876
-So...
-Just dizzy, not sick?

1136
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:28,538
Sick and dizzy. But...

1137
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,389
Sick and dizzy. But...

1138
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,716
We said poisonous
and that is poisonous.

1139
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:33,719
‘Cause they're actually
called deadly nightshade, right?

1140
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,674
Yeah. I guess if you have enough
of something that makes you dizzy,

1141
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,957
-you're going to die.
-Right, sure.

1142
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,685
But poisonous,
we're right on the money.

1143
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,714
Mom would have to
eat a bucket of them to have any effect.

1144
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,923
Well, she's a bear,
she probably could eat a bucket.

1145
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,608
To talk about the production design
a little bit,

1146
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:53,207
we go from this very cold, dim,

1147
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:57,304
rain-filled scene of sorrow and misery to

1148
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,711
they wake up
still in this kind of blue mood

1149
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:00,920
but it's dawn.

1150
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:04,512
But now,
the light is coming into their lives.

1151
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,848
The light is
coming into their relationship.

1152
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:10,051
The dynamics of their relationship
is changing.

1153
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,917
It's the first step of them
actually working together.

1154
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,890
Yeah. But all of what Mom said before
is now coming back to haunt her.

1155
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:20,357
"Oh, if l never had weapons training
we'd be starving to death."

1156
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:23,468
"Here is food that you need
but you're not going to try it," you know?

1157
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,147
And so there's a little push back.

1158
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,263
So we go into the fishing sequence,

1159
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:33,049
which had to be locked down story-wise
fairly early on

1160
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,701
when we came up
with the idea for this sequence

1161
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:38,473
because of the incredibly long time
it would take to do the water effects.

1162
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:41,225
because of the incredibly long time
it would take to do the water effects.

1163
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:44,872
So, David MacCarthy,
D-Mac and his team

1164
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,969
needed to have this sequence
locked down,

1165
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:51,192
which, in animation,
doesn't always necessarily happen.

1166
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:54,788
So, we got it down to its nitty-gritty
and locked it down.

1167
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:56,495
And had to get the song in there,

1168
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,100
so we had the length of all the shots

1169
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,025
and they started working
on the effects of the sequence

1170
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,688
a year before the film was completed.

1171
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:06,351
It takes that long to do the water effects.

1172
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,580
And it turned out,
it's breathtaking, that river.

1173
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,109
They did an amazing job.

1174
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:13,884
There's so many elements
involved in it, just the water flow,

1175
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,028
then there's the foaminess of it,

1176
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:17,806
and the interaction with it.

1177
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:21,075
The splashes, the aeration in the water.

1178
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,199
Lighting did a fantastic job lighting it

1179
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,711
so you get that gold
and those blue reflections in there.

1180
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,687
It's a moving sculpture, is what it is,
and it's gorgeous.

1181
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:33,618
And it's so authentic looking
you just accept it.

1182
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,794
You don't actually appreciate it enough

1183
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,093
unless somebody tells you to look at it.

1184
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,988
Because it feels so natural.

1185
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:44,174
And here comes the song to explain
this new dynamic of their relationship

1186
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:46,538
also written by Alex Mandel.

1187
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:48,427
He and Steve worked on it quite a bit.

1188
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,935
And when I heard it for the first time
Il said, "This is beautiful.

1189
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,598
"I'm keeping this one in definitely.”

1190
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,127
‘Cause it just
summed up their relationship

1191
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,740
in this very economical
and emotional way.

1192
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,070
I mean, the music just plays into this

1193
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,220
where it's not a celebration
and it's not a victory.

1194
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:10,177
There's something still tentative
about it, but hopeful.

1195
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:16,823
And the sim, the simulation department,
to get that wet bear and Merida all wet

1196
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,087
and their clothes wet and clingy,

1197
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,579
Claudia and her team is just fantastic.

1198
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:23,709
It just all goes together.

1199
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,357
‘Cause it's a really memorable,
important moment,

1200
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,333
it's one of the brightest
sequences in the movie

1201
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,656
with this golden light about them

1202
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:35,622
playing and finding each other again
and seeing each other differently.

1203
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,326
So, all these technical aspects
just go in concert

1204
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,673
to make the sequence memorable.

1205
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,992
What could make Merida's crazy hair
even more complicated to do?

1206
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,432
"Let's get it wet now."

1207
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:48,884
If you look in the background on this,

1208
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,449
we have bugs
flying around in the sunlight.

1209
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,230
All these clouds of bugs
flying around back there

1210
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:57,896
to make that forest feel alive.

1211
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:00,775
I mean, that's something
that Ridley Scott did in Legend

1212
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:03,707
when he filmed all of it inside on stages,

1213
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,844
that he can really control
the atmosphere and the debris

1214
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:08,724
that you get for free in the forest.

1215
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:11,486
And we did the same thing. I wanted
atmosphere throughout this movie,

1216
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,029
because it's there in Scotland,
in the air,

1217
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,175
knocking back the backgrounds.

1218
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:20,721
And you see little clingy clouds and
then there's midges all over the place.

1219
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,171
There's bugs all over the place,
so we needed that,

1220
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,590
and it just really helps with the texture.

1221
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:30,332
We used to have a version of the story

1222
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,224
where the entire set
was covered in snow.

1223
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,517
Two-thirds of the movie
took place in a snow cover

1224
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,696
which was based
on the effect of the spell.

1225
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,999
Kind of having this global effect.

1226
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:43,138
And what we gained
by losing that idea is

1227
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:46,123
we just get a beautiful view of Scotland

1228
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:49,876
that we wouldn't have had if we were
covering up all these great sets.

1229
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:51,664
A lot of work done on the snow

1230
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:54,975
that we decided was not needed
for the movie to tell the story.

1231
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:56,815
No. It was pretty amazing stuff actually.

1232
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:58,747
The tests on the snow were fantastic.

1233
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,336
And we had the opening of the movie

1234
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,390
which took place
with Fergus in the snow.

1235
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:05,236
So we had it, but then we chopped it.

1236
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:09,051
So, there is only one shot that exists
in the world, that's in the trailer,

1237
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,669
is Fergus coming across the snow
in his armor.

1238
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,484
We have the flyover with the snow.

1239
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,340
Right, we got the snow
in the very beginning of the film

1240
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,103
in the montage.

1241
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,546
We had a whole sequence in here
that we cut out

1242
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,741
of them getting chased by wolves,

1243
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,305
which was quite fantastic
as an action sequence goes.

1244
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,619
But ultimately
does not serve the story well.

1245
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:34,479
And there were lots of sequences
that we had in the movie

1246
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,871
where we thought we needed
to spend the time with them,

1247
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:41,042
so that they can
earn their reward at the end.

1248
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,558
They could actually have
a longer journey.

1249
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:48,598
But it's pretty fantastic to see
just editing it down

1250
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,272
what exactly do we need.

1251
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,047
We get every moment.

1252
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,912
And by the end
they still earn this journey.

1253
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,764
The wisp sound design is amazing.

1254
00:58:59,036 --> 00:58:59,886
To get this kind of whispery effect

1255
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,897
that almost sounds like
unintelligible talking whispers.

1256
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:05,278
But from children.

1257
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:08,759
It had this eerie quality,
but nice, too, really.

1258
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:11,241
There's nothing creepier
than children whispering.

1259
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,895
-Right.
-Unless it's clowns whispering.

1260
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:18,266
So, this was a key moment
when they find the ruins

1261
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,935
and the crossed battleaxes,
the sigil of House Mor'du

1262
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:26,032
that she's seen before
so that we know it's not just a story.

1263
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,620
It's on the ring that the Witch had.

1264
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:31,264
These stories are now
coming into contact with each other.

1265
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:35,345
And then the Witch is
one of the hubs of this story.

1266
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,489
And that the wisps
are leading them here

1267
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:40,358
so that Merida can find those answers.

1268
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:45,281
And I wanted it to be a very stark place,
just devoid of life and color.

1269
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:45,922
And I wanted it to be a very stark place,
just devoid of life and color.

1270
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,426
And that's an actual broch.

1271
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,467
That's what they look like in Scotland.

1272
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,420
Which was the first castle fortresses
done in almost prehistoric ages

1273
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:57,013
and they're insane,
the construction on them is so simple.

1274
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:04,274
What I love about Steve Pilcher's
art design, especially in here,

1275
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:06,618
is Merida is like a target on screen.

1276
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:10,009
And no matter what setting you're in,
you spot her right away

1277
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,970
‘cause her hair is so striking

1278
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,585
and has that kind of unnatural
cherry red which is... It's great.

1279
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:17,816
You just always know
where she is on screen.

1280
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:19,488
And she's the only color in the room.

1281
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,272
And I love how, in this scene,
her face goes white,

1282
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,939
and her hair, even though it's red,
it's very pale.

1283
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,870
It's like an illustrated book.

1284
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:34,412
Yeah. But seeing this location
colorless, gray, dead.

1285
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:38,332
Yeah. This is the worst place to be,
but she's getting all the information.

1286
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:40,569
Exactly. And we're tying it all together.

1287
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,454
And that's why the wisps
ultimately lead her here.

1288
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:46,837
So she can put together
and solve this mystery.

1289
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:52,058
Her flashback,
that was my little ode to Porco Rosso.

1290
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,082
-Miyazaki film.
-Yeah.

1291
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:57,344
Porco is a pig and she's looking at him
and he's a man.

1292
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,163
And then she looks at him
and he's a pig again.

1293
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:02,116
So [kind of did the reverse
where, in her flashback,

1294
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:03,462
she sees Prince Mor'du,

1295
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,243
but then he turns
and it's the face of Mor'du.

1296
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:07,642
So, we lock home
they're one and the same

1297
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,171
before she figures it out here.

1298
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,970
This is one of the great things
about working at Pixar

1299
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,982
is what we're willing to do
to tell the story.

1300
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,919
And Brave is the darkest film
Pixar has done.

1301
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,440
And that we can go into that
and go into this dark place,

1302
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:27,547
and have this really
intense, scary moment

1303
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:32,750
and come out of it fine, unscathed,
where it helps support the story.

1304
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:37,740
It tells the story that this person needs
to understand these consequences

1305
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:41,708
I think is very important, even
for young children to understand.

1306
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,335
It seems like that's something
that's in classic folktales and fairytales

1307
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,889
is these kind of big ideas
of life and death and loss

1308
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:52,276
and things that kids and people
are grappling with.

1309
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:55,296
Yeah, and she's there.
She goes to her mother for help.

1310
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,525
Her mother is not leaving her there
on her own.

1311
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:01,891
The other important fact of this
is that when you ask for help, it's there.

1312
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:07,048
And we have our magical transition
when they ride out into the fog,

1313
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,040
and... They're already
in the standing stones,

1314
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:13,399
they've just done
25, 30 miles in no time.

1315
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,614
And that's the magic of the world,
that's the portal.

1316
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:20,227
The stones we kind of used
as this hub, the stone ring.

1317
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:25,173
As in legend, all fairy rings
or magical rings

1318
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:29,052
were portals to the other worlds
or even time.

1319
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:32,576
You would have magic toadstools
that you step into and you fall asleep,

1320
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,723
when you wake up you're
in some strange new world,

1321
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,451
or time has passed
and you had no idea.

1322
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:41,098
But later on for Fergus, since
he doesn't buy into all this magic,

1323
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,310
for him the ring of stones
is a corral to corner his prey.

1324
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,659
Right.

1325
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:52,878
So they have the answer of the tapestry,
it's back in the castle.

1326
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:56,060
Which, originally in the scene,
the castle was all...

1327
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,690
Everybody was fighting, all the clans
were fighting all over the castle.

1328
01:02:59,075 --> 01:02:59,924
It was a hornet's nest.

1329
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:03,983
But then,
in a previous incarnation of this,

1330
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,664
they try to sneak back in,

1331
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:09,395
they get spotted, they get shot at,
Mom gets an arrow in the butt,

1332
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:12,467
she turns around
as Merida tries to pull it out of her,

1333
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:14,226
she slashes Merida's arm.

1334
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:15,694
Well, when she pulls it out, yeah,

1335
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,359
-she turns into a bear.
-She turns into a bear,

1336
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:22,141
and slashes Merida's arm and then
turns back into her bear-human self,

1337
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:23,856
freaks out and then runs off.

1338
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,880
And then we had this whole scene
where Mom has given up.

1339
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,687
So, not only do you have to get
back into the castle to get the tapestry,

1340
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:32,062
how do you change Mom's mind

1341
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:35,342
and turn her around
to get her back in the castle?

1342
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,375
So Merida had to chase her down.

1343
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:41,111
Chase her down, stop her,
and then convince her to come back.

1344
01:03:41,685 --> 01:03:42,555
And then they kind of...

1345
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:44,976
And at that point part of
the convincing process

1346
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,288
was Merida's saying
how much she loved her

1347
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,617
and that she's the strength behind her
and so forth and so on.

1348
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,647
Which felt premature,
because then where we play it now

1349
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:55,087
is in the back to the castle scene.

1350
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,551
Right. We solved their issue
before we needed to solve their issue.

1351
01:03:59,102 --> 01:03:59,971
Right, exactly.

1352
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:03,453
That Mom doesn't get to
experience her daughter

1353
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:08,867
in the moment becoming everything
that her mom hoped that she would be.

1354
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:13,746
So, by taking all that stuff
that happens outside

1355
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:17,107
into this sequence
and collapsing it into...

1356
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:19,667
They're not yet solved
until after this sequence,

1357
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:21,196
and Mom gets to see her,

1358
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,628
and get them to where we need to be.

1359
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:27,781
We wanted to hearken back to that
moment of Mom, earlier in the movie,

1360
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:31,371
kind of striding into the middle
of this chaos and taking control of it.

1361
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,151
And Merida is kind of
drawing herself together

1362
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:37,323
to be able to do that in this situation.

1363
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:41,026
Right, and then catching
the ire of the lords

1364
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,011
who would never do this to the Queen,
but because she's not the Queen

1365
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:47,547
and then kind of assault her
by visually closing in on her.

1366
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,581
That Merida handles it in her own way.
The Queen would never yell at them,

1367
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:53,382
but Merida would, you know?

1368
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,875
-Like Fergus would.
-Fergus would, yeah, totally.

1369
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,252
And it's a key moment.

1370
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:00,594
When we were going through the film
and plotting out Merida's arc,

1371
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:04,381
this was one of
the big tentpole sequences.

1372
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,089
And here, with Mom
being in the room, we knew

1373
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:12,699
it was important for Mom to witness
what Merida was about to do,

1374
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,903
but through the many iterations
we had Mom ona balcony,

1375
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:17,868
we had her in a separate room...

1376
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:19,051
A doorway.

1377
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:20,422
Yeah, another doorway.

1378
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,023
But the story point was still the same

1379
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,948
of she needs to be here
to witness what Merida is about to do.

1380
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:28,636
We spent some time

1381
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:31,232
reminding the audience a couple times
where they're going.

1382
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,941
So we drive the camera
right up that stairway.

1383
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:35,384
-The goal.
-So, when they're talking about it.

1384
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:37,622
-Yeah.
-We see that goal in a very real way.

1385
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:39,231
And then sometimes you feel like

1386
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:41,022
you want to remind the audience
where they are

1387
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,087
and what Mom's intent is
when she comes in there.

1388
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,780
She looks up that stairs,

1389
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,214
‘cause she wants to get to
the tapestry room and get out of danger.

1390
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,420
Yeah, we have a goal
that kind of gets derailed in here.

1391
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:53,134
‘Cause then we get caught up,
just like Mom gets caught up,

1392
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:58,453
of seeing her daughter
be this fantastic person.

1393
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:59,185
of seeing her daughter
be this fantastic person.

1394
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:00,789
So Merida is pulling out
all this knowledge

1395
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:05,430
that Mom has probably been telling her
all her life and it stuck somewhere.

1396
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:09,848
So she's able to draw on this knowledge
of how these guys got together.

1397
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,927
And put it back at them
using her storytelling skills

1398
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:18,844
and kind of make them nostalgic
for how they formed as a group.

1399
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:23,002
Yeah, it plays into their characters
and their sense of who they are.

1400
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,250
But that, it's totally organic.

1401
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:28,602
Merida is shooting from the hip here.
And it's just a great read.

1402
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:30,988
Kelly Macdonald just did a fabulous job

1403
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,964
not only in the whole movie,
but in this scene.

1404
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:36,539
‘Cause you really get some big
emotional scales here

1405
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,933
from kind of being nervous
to then being very confident,

1406
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,890
to then being very self-conscious

1407
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,883
and feeling guilty
about what she's done.

1408
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:48,011
And that she's caused
this whole problem herself.

1409
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:51,405
And kind of saying
that she's sorry, apologizing.

1410
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:55,658
Each of them is going to put themselves
in the line of fire for the other one.

1411
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:58,859
So, to have Mom explain to her,

1412
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,005
"How do I tell my daughter it's okay,
she doesn't have to get married?"

1413
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,505
And, "I've got another idea.

1414
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,063
"And I can't A,
speak, because I'm a bear,

1415
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:10,029
"but B, if anybody turns around
and looks at me, I'm dead."

1416
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:16,100
So, this was a great time to put in that
almost Cyrano de Bergerac moment

1417
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:20,033
of her being able to communicate
through her gesturing

1418
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,790
to have it almost come
as the Queen's voice

1419
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,516
through Merida to the lords.

1420
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:26,584
It's also a throwback
to that deep thoughts scene

1421
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:29,430
where now they can communicate
to each other without speaking.

1422
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,308
They understand
each other completely,

1423
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:34,954
where before they couldn't speak at all,
and didn't understand each other.

1424
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:39,186
There was a lot of film work
to really get that relationship

1425
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:42,759
between where Mom was standing
and where Merida is standing to work.

1426
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:46,453
Working into those POVs
and out of those POVs

1427
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:48,166
and who's seeing what

1428
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:52,591
so that it was believable, what was
happening here with the pantomime.

1429
01:07:54,037 --> 01:07:55,966
Steve and I had written
more in the scene

1430
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:59,469
and we pulled out the stuff
that was just the most essential.

1431
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:03,379
And I think that's a great parameter
for any filmmakers out there.

1432
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:06,117
It's when you get into
how important the editing process is

1433
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:07,686
when you're making a film,

1434
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:08,801
even though, in animation,

1435
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,628
we storyboard
the whole thing beforehand

1436
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,958
and you have a really good idea
of what you're getting into.

1437
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:20,788
There's still a process of,
"Can I hone it down?" That less is more.

1438
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,441
And letting the pacing and the timing

1439
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,720
kind of guide you to what
really makes a sequence work.

1440
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:30,770
‘Cause you could get caught up
and just be hanging on stuff.

1441
01:08:31,975 --> 01:08:33,555
Merida's argument is,

1442
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,656
"You guys all got together,
nobody told you to get together,

1443
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:39,225
"it just happened
because of who you were.

1444
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:42,276
"Can't land your sons
do the same thing?

1445
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:44,592
"Can't we be in charge
of our own lives?"

1446
01:08:44,953 --> 01:08:45,853
Everybody was saying,

1447
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:48,609
"Well, how do you convince these lords
who come out of this old school,

1448
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,157
"and who were raised
on these traditions to agree to this?"

1449
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:52,299
"and who were raised
on these traditions to agree to this?"

1450
01:08:52,694 --> 01:08:54,594
And when we figured out
it shouldn't be them,

1451
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,804
it should be their sons who are in
the same situation as Merida,

1452
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,731
who may not want to marry her
and are being forced into this,

1453
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:02,630
that they should speak up.

1454
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,669
And that's what ultimately
turns everything around,

1455
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:10,048
was our central argument and kind of
one of our themes of the whole movie.

1456
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:14,596
Being able to be brave enough
to say what you want.

1457
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:17,058
-And make your own choices.
-And make your own choices.

1458
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,149
And then live by them.

1459
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,749
And Dad acknowledges Merida

1460
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:22,604
as the thing that
she was dreading being,

1461
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,735
which is some version of Mom,
but in this case,

1462
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:30,774
it turns out to be this positive message
that Dad sees the good part of that.

1463
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,917
And she accepts it
in the same way that he says it.

1464
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:41,563
At the end of the scene, we're good.
Merida has come into her own.

1465
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,138
Mom, they both recognize each other,
they've come full circle.

1466
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,548
Everything is solved.
The story is now solved.

1467
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:48,767
So where do we go?

1468
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,125
All we have is this little hiccup

1469
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:54,396
of turning Mom-bear back to Elinor
and getting her human again

1470
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:56,988
as we go into the next bit.

1471
01:09:57,894 --> 01:10:01,844
So now that they're as close as
they've been through the entire film,

1472
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:05,567
we're getting ready to separate them
as much as possible here.

1473
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:06,952
Exactly.

1474
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,540
That's why we see the cut,
the thing that started it all.

1475
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:13,371
The thing that's still between them,
things get unraveled,

1476
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,783
but now that we want them
to stay together,

1477
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:18,335
we separate them big time.

1478
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:20,655
And this is the red herring,

1479
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:23,547
the tapestry was
a red herring in the spell

1480
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,630
that had been going around
and around and around

1481
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,125
exactly what the wordings
of the spell was

1482
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,484
and how they'd figure it out
and how it could...

1483
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:34,290
Literal interpretation versus
our figurative interpretation

1484
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,794
of that what's really torn
is their relationship,

1485
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,527
not necessarily the tapestry.

1486
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,302
So we were going around
and around about that.

1487
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:44,764
If you sew the tapestry up,
does she turn back into a human?

1488
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:46,738
Or do you have to put it
over the top of them?

1489
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:49,913
Or does Merida actually
need to say, "You're sorry"?

1490
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:56,123
So, we're investing in this one tapestry,
this item to be the solve-all thing,

1491
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,159
so that later, by the end of the movie

1492
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,551
when she puts it on her and it's
all stitched up, nothing happens.

1493
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,251
So that our wording
for the spell still works.

1494
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,165
And we're about to separate
Mom from the tapestry.

1495
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:10,431
So we're separating Mom
from the solution,

1496
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,880
what Merida perceives the solution is.

1497
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:16,174
Why Mom changes into a bear,

1498
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:18,661
what motivates her
to change into a bear,

1499
01:11:19,075 --> 01:11:21,625
l wanted to stay away from,
that it just happens.

1500
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:25,538
Because if you have a trigger,
then you're locked into that trigger

1501
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,985
and we really couldn't find
a trigger that worked.

1502
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:31,861
It turns out we already had a trigger,
but we didn't know it.

1503
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,705
For Mom to turn into a bear, was food,

1504
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:40,224
was this primal sense,
this animalistic sense of just hunger.

1505
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,998
So she's eating the fish,
she turns into a bear.

1506
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:43,699
So she's eating the fish,
she turns into a bear.

1507
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,450
When she's sniffing the apples,
she turns into a bear.

1508
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:49,043
And then whenever
the human side of her came out

1509
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,248
was always about compassion.

1510
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:54,947
She was about to hurt somebody
or she has just hurt somebody.

1511
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,181
And we tend to think of Mom

1512
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:59,733
when her personality is there
up on her hind legs,

1513
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,819
‘cause that's
when she's trying to maintain

1514
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,380
what she was when she was a person.

1515
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:07,663
So, when she draws
out of that bear mode

1516
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,344
and comes up on her hind legs,

1517
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:12,022
we recognize it right away
as Mom's body language.

1518
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:17,286
This was also interesting that

1519
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,220
we've taken probably,
the jolliest character in the film

1520
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,130
and now he's in total revenge mode,

1521
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:26,973
which is adding to the stakes of,
and the complications

1522
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:28,652
that Merida now has to deal with.

1523
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:32,661
It's like her father and her closest ally
is now her biggest enemy at this point.

1524
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,242
Right. The thing that you fear the most
from the beginning that we see

1525
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,165
as just this kind of comedic clown

1526
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:40,891
is now the Terminator
by the end of the movie.

1527
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:42,284
And he's not going to stop

1528
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,155
regardless of whether this animal
actually killed his wife or not,

1529
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:46,648
he's going to kill it.

1530
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:49,766
And we needed to go there,
again, to drive up those stakes

1531
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:55,915
and get into this very serious dilemma
of her problem is still not yet solved.

1532
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:59,465
And now Merida is fighting
to get back to her mother,

1533
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,812
while, at the beginning of the movie,
she was running away from her mother.

1534
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:04,892
And now you've come
full circle in their arc

1535
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,614
about how they feel about each other.

1536
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:09,376
Even visually going
from the red-red warms

1537
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:11,629
into the super-super cools.

1538
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:14,858
That we get as much contrast
as possible in the lighting.

1539
01:13:15,358 --> 01:13:17,138
When she breaks a window,
it blows out a light,

1540
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:19,043
so it could be even darker
on one side of the room,

1541
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:20,672
and lighter on the other side
of the room.

1542
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,833
Again, there's that duality that's in play.

1543
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,853
That just kind of supports the story
whenever we can.

1544
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:28,413
Now, we haven't seen the triplets

1545
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:31,891
and there was a scene where
we cut back to them eating the cake,

1546
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,281
where Maudie finds them
eating the cake, half-transformed.

1547
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,968
Because earlier on, when Mom's
going through the transformation,

1548
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:39,231
we had one shot

1549
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,999
where she pops up
from behind the bed half-transformed,

1550
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,527
looking kind of like a were-bear
or a werewolf.

1551
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,181
But ultimately we didn't need that,

1552
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:49,765
and we cut it out as we were watching it
and reviewing the reels

1553
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:54,956
and looking at the story as a whole,
which was a great exercise, to go,

1554
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:57,658
"You know what?
We know that when last we left them

1555
01:13:58,034 --> 01:13:59,933
"they were looking at the cake,
the spell cake."

1556
01:14:00,303 --> 01:14:01,973
So to look and see them
coming out of the shadows

1557
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:04,855
with these little glowing eyes and reveal
that they're bears, that was enough.

1558
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:08,088
It was more of a surprise than
leading the audience down that path.

1559
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,922
I think this scene was the first time
we used Maudie early on.

1560
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:16,666
And as we developed the story
we kept finding ways to use her

1561
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,529
and establish her
as the governess of the triplets

1562
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,796
or give her reasons to exist
in the movie beforehand.

1563
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,962
And I think that helps,
so once you get here

1564
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,284
you know her as a character by the time
you see her go through this trial.

1565
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,077
Yeah, she's always
fabulous to work with.

1566
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,670
We kept just bringing her back.

1567
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:37,000
And also kind of just
broadening this universe

1568
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:40,756
that we're creating of these characters,
of the castle life and everything.

1569
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,150
And then just the mixture here
of chase after chase, right?

1570
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,227
Yeah, we liked the idea
of feathering the two,

1571
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:48,599
the comedic chase
against the dramatic chase,

1572
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,474
‘cause it was a fun way
to cover ground in two places

1573
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:55,461
but you still have time to laugh
as well as be worried.

1574
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,398
Yeah, so you're
on the edge of your seat

1575
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,473
because two things
have to get resolved.

1576
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,318
There's two goals that are happening
at the same time.

1577
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:06,775
As Mom gets further and further away,
the chase with Maudie goes on inside.

1578
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:10,912
Well, they're kind of
paying Maudie back

1579
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:14,427
from all the previous times
that she's been chasing them.

1580
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,378
Well, we know how
they get around the castle

1581
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:21,112
by the little ins and outs
and their little secret passageways.

1582
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,234
So that Maudie could ever think
that she could outrun them,

1583
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,857
to the audience, was kind of ridiculous.

1584
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,626
But they can just show up
out of nowhere,

1585
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:31,929
and that just adds to the whole moment.

1586
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,298
I love this little bit here,
one of the triplets just trips.

1587
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:40,784
The animators asked me,
"Why? Why do you want to do that?"

1588
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,750
I'm all, "Because it's funny.
One of 'em has got to eat it.”

1589
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,726
It's just one of those little aspects.

1590
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,522
It's just a little detail that... Yeah,
does it serve anything for the story?

1591
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:54,012
No, but overall, it just gives
a little entertainment into the shot.

1592
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,990
The whole concept of her sewing
while she's riding

1593
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,790
-has been in since the beginning.
-Yeah.

1594
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:01,428
Brenda was all over that.
She loved that idea.

1595
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:05,137
And I love that little red lantern
on that blue background, it's beautiful.

1596
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:07,594
-Yeah.
-All the red firelight in here.

1597
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,192
It's gorgeous to look at.

1598
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:12,365
Yeah, Danielle Feinberg
and Steve Pilcher

1599
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:16,118
talked about the very
theatrical lighting of this movie.

1600
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,951
And any sequence we can go
to really push it, l was all for.

1601
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:23,139
And it turns out great.
It's just so striking.

1602
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:26,102
And in the early version,
this whole scene took place in snow.

1603
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:29,009
It was like the thickest part
of the snowfall that we had.

1604
01:16:29,452 --> 01:16:31,702
So he was plowing through snow drifts.

1605
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,275
Ropes are not easy in animation

1606
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,501
and to coordinate
how they're going around Mom

1607
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,380
and who's holding them
with the Crowds Department,

1608
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,335
with Paul Mendoza and Paul Kanyuk

1609
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:44,294
and the crowds team was just fantastic
in this whole sequence.

1610
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,027
It just made it.

1611
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:49,371
It's like a cat's cradle game to look at
that diagram of how to arrange.

1612
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:52,594
And which one is going to what horse
and how they pin it down.

1613
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,535
And the wisps lead her to her fate,

1614
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:57,214
lead her back to her mom,
so they can resolve this thing.

1615
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:58,733
But also,

1616
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,861
steer her away from Mor'du.

1617
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:04,891
And there's great acting
from Billy Connolly in this

1618
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:06,376
to get that rage out of him.

1619
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,172
Because he's been
the jolly Scotsman the whole time,

1620
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,555
to really get him to yell and roar,
and Billy was all game for it.

1621
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:15,342
And to be fierce, he was terrific at that.

1622
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:16,968
This took a really long time to block.

1623
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:18,573
Yeah, well this was
one of the first things

1624
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:20,568
-when I came on that we worked on.
-Right, right.

1625
01:17:20,903 --> 01:17:24,063
That we kind of reboarded and set,
and then it went away

1626
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,447
and then it wasn't until almost
near the end of the process

1627
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:29,299
where we came back into it
with Rob Anderson and his layout team

1628
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,495
and got it all situated and set.

1629
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:32,956
Well, we didn't have
all the characters either.

1630
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,115
-Exactly.
-We were waiting for character design

1631
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,504
and to be realized.

1632
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,629
But we were already thinking about
what it needed to be.

1633
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,320
We had the dogs in the beginning
of this sequence and they disappeared.

1634
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,437
And I'm all, "Oh, my gosh."

1635
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,722
It's already being animated and
we're already lighting it

1636
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:50,998
and I'm all, "Where are my dogs?
Wouldn't they do anything?"

1637
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,887
So we managed to sneak them
into a couple of shots

1638
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,596
and see 'em get walloped by the bear.

1639
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,211
So, that explains
why they're not around.

1640
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,526
Because, back in the day,
the dogs would be all over that bear.

1641
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:04,003
So many plates to spin that
you forget about certain elements.

1642
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,220
-But they will come back to haunt you.
-Yeah.

1643
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,005
Sometimes you don't want to
draw attention to something.

1644
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:09,837
You don't want the audience
to worry about either.

1645
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:13,402
Like the audience is hardly worrying
about where the dogs are at this point.

1646
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:15,446
They're totally caught up
in Mor'du, so...

1647
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,278
But if we could balance it just right

1648
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:20,083
to cheat them that
we've explained why they're not there,

1649
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,579
why there are no horses there,

1650
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,050
that everybody's backed off
without showing it,

1651
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:27,126
then it doesn't pull you out
without having any questions.

1652
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:29,700
Gary Rydstrom and E.J. Holowicki

1653
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,055
did an amazing job
with the bear vocals in this movie.

1654
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:34,581
Oh, yeah, hearing the very
different aspects of them.

1655
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:37,937
Yeah, there was a huge amount of
design work that went into their voices.

1656
01:18:38,581 --> 01:18:40,831
-And it's not all just bear sounds.
-Right.

1657
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,800
And there was a version in this
where Mom was turning back and forth

1658
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:46,623
between herself and a bear
during this fight.

1659
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:50,925
Right. From bear mode to Mom-bear,
to bear mode to Mom-bear.

1660
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,960
And it just, all these ideas
which were kind of great ideas on paper

1661
01:18:55,531 --> 01:18:58,461
that we would try,
and we'd try everything

1662
01:18:58,968 --> 01:19:01,108
to find that right concoction,

1663
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:04,492
that right chemical explosion
of all the right things.

1664
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:08,376
And we end up throwing out
a lot of stuff.

1665
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:11,054
It becomes too complex.

1666
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:13,407
And I wanted to catch the audience
by surprise with this,

1667
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,512
where you know they were finished,

1668
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:19,191
but then, it was Mom ultimately
and her kind of smarts.

1669
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,925
She couldn't beat 'em physically,
but getting the help

1670
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:25,344
from this huge stone column
to crush the bear actually did it.

1671
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:29,581
That she recognizes that crack
and she could make it bigger.

1672
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:31,598
It doesn't work
when she wants it to work,

1673
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,629
but eventually there's a slow give away.

1674
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:37,629
That's kind of almost my homage
to Force 10 From Navarone

1675
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,260
when they blow up the dam
to save everybody,

1676
01:19:40,643 --> 01:19:42,453
but then the dam doesn't
break right away,

1677
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:45,741
and then it breaks later
and washes away all the Nazis, yeah.

1678
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:47,888
And we wanted to resolve Mor'du

1679
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,559
instead of just kill him.

1680
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:52,541
So we had this idea
of Mor'du gets killed,

1681
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:56,532
and that releases his spirit to then,
how apropos, to become a wisp,

1682
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:00,936
to then warn others or lead them away
from these negative fates.

1683
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:03,843
Yeah, I really liked the idea
of resolving his story,

1684
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:06,726
so he's not just this dead
carcass under the rock.

1685
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:10,599
He's like the soul of that guy,
however nasty he was,

1686
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:15,862
gets redeemed, somehow, just by being
released by another enchanted bear.

1687
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:18,512
-Yeah.
-He started out being purely a bear.

1688
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:19,811
There were different versions.

1689
01:20:20,049 --> 01:20:22,329
There was versions where
there was less magic around him.

1690
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,211
And we weren't being as clear
in different versions.

1691
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,554
We wanted there to be lore
around him like Moby Dick,

1692
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:30,758
but that we didn't know
where he came from.

1693
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:32,903
And then as the story developed,

1694
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:35,222
it became more obvious
that he was somebody.

1695
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:36,496
And I liked that more because

1696
01:20:36,732 --> 01:20:39,012
it feels more like a magical world
that we created.

1697
01:20:39,435 --> 01:20:42,170
It's a great storyline to help parallel
what Merida is about to go through

1698
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,541
It's a great storyline to help parallel
what Merida is about to go through

1699
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,939
and what the possible outcome
for Mom is going to be.

1700
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:52,647
This was probably, for me,
one of the hardest sequences to do,

1701
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:55,712
was this end moment to kind of tie up

1702
01:20:56,151 --> 01:21:00,371
how the magic actually
works with the words and the tapestry,

1703
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,665
making the second sunrise happen.

1704
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:08,076
When does Mom turn into the bear
so that you know the game is over,

1705
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:12,651
so that we can be sad and crying?
That no matter how hard Merida tried,

1706
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:14,442
even though she's learned her lesson,

1707
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,953
she wants her mom back,
she still kind of failed.

1708
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:20,833
Which I think is a great thing
for kids and adults to understand

1709
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,630
that there are consequences
to our actions.

1710
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,976
And we can't just be selfish.

1711
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:30,268
We have to think about
what's going to happen a little bit more.

1712
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,789
But getting this to work just right
was really difficult.

1713
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,840
Getting the second sunrise in there,

1714
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:39,806
putting it back in the ring of stones
as the focal point.

1715
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,192
We would go around and around
about how that actually worked.

1716
01:21:42,598 --> 01:21:44,878
But I think,
once we finally figured this out,

1717
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,970
and that we actually
had the ticking clock,

1718
01:21:47,336 --> 01:21:49,206
the visual ticking clock of the sun rising

1719
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,791
and the sunlight coming down
the stones and across the ground,

1720
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:58,352
really gave it this extra little bit of kick
in the sequence

1721
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:01,228
to realize when it was actually over.

1722
01:22:01,617 --> 01:22:03,897
And when she says, "I love you,"
just before the sun hits her,

1723
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,069
and then once it hits the tapestry

1724
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:07,821
that changes Mom back
instantaneously

1725
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:10,312
and, again,
we don't see that magic happen.

1726
01:22:10,726 --> 01:22:12,896
We don't see that scene,
it just happens.

1727
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:14,725
Yeah, we wanted to
mute the magic though.

1728
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,370
We didn't want to see
a giant spectacle of special effects here.

1729
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:22,490
We wanted to just feel like this moment
was very personal and very small.

1730
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:25,868
Yeah, it's unexplained,
and it makes it more intimate,

1731
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:30,381
instead of just something that happens
that's fireworks or blue swirly lights

1732
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,626
or anything like that,
that everybody can witness and see.

1733
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:37,272
It's just... Blink! She's back to normal.

1734
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,330
The ending is all about the balance.

1735
01:22:40,656 --> 01:22:43,406
We have all these strings
that we have to tie up.

1736
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:44,912
So it's really tricky.

1737
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,240
The ending of a film is always really

1738
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,679
one of the trickiest things
there is in filmmaking,

1739
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:53,254
‘cause there's always
these emotional qualities to it

1740
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:59,892
that you have to just arrange just right
to have the effect that you really want.

1741
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:03,423
So there was a lot going on
here that we had to navigate,

1742
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:08,159
and how much of what to make it work
and not just seem overbearing.

1743
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:13,312
It seems like near the end of a movie
the audience's perceptions speed up.

1744
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:16,286
And so, you're kind of
weighing this idea

1745
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,482
of how long does it take you
to get to the climax?

1746
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:22,117
‘Cause they're kind of maybe
ahead of you at this point.

1747
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:25,931
And so you want to make sure
you're dishing it out at the right pace

1748
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,342
for the audience to be receiving it.

1749
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:30,433
And sometimes we find we lag too much

1750
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:33,322
and we want to get to it a little sooner
than we thought we did.

1751
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:42,746
This was, technically, one of
the hardest shots we had in the movie

1752
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:47,025
because of the rate of the camera move
and the pan that was in it,

1753
01:23:47,623 --> 01:23:49,843
and you're shooting
24 frames a second,

1754
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:53,069
you get a strobing, this stutter.

1755
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:57,312
And, to work that out,
we had to slow down the move,

1756
01:23:57,933 --> 01:24:00,513
make it not as long,
pan slower or faster.

1757
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,169
But I wanted to see all the stuff,

1758
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:05,947
so we did some magic tricks
and worked it out.

1759
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:09,989
But that's one of the things
that you run into in film.

1760
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:12,465
And then I like getting into...

1761
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:16,388
Merida kind of starts off the movie
with her narration,

1762
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:20,934
and here she ends her narration
with that moral of the story.

1763
01:24:21,857 --> 01:24:27,397
And I think it works great with
Mumford & Sons' song in this moment,

1764
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:30,663
that there's this little hole cut out
for Merida to say her piece,

1765
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,679
and then you go back into the song,
which kind of sums it all up.

1766
01:24:34,136 --> 01:24:36,571
I'm really glad that
Mumford & Sons came on board

1767
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,212
I'm really glad that
Mumford & Sons came on board

1768
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:42,217
and agreed to do the final song,
our final song moment in the movie.

1769
01:24:42,778 --> 01:24:46,348
-And Birdy.
-And Birdy, she sings it great.

1770
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:52,139
It just encapsulates the whole story
in this nice kind of 1-2-3 bit.

1771
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,781
Even their emotional arc,
Merida's emotional arc of where she is,

1772
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,191
just sums up everything perfectly.

1773
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,280
For me, it's very satisfying.
And I don't know that I've seen it before,

1774
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:05,242
but it goes to the original heart
of Brenda's story that

1775
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:08,023
the resolution is a love story
between a mother and daughter.

1776
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:11,687
And I don't know that
we've seen a lot of that in movies.

1777
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,110
-Yeah.
-Especially family movies.

1778
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:14,192
Well, you bookend that

1779
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:17,509
Merida was having her favorite day
with Angus at the beginning of the film.

1780
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:20,626
And now Mom has joined her
in her world,

1781
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:23,893
I think wraps their characters up
quite nicely.

1782
01:25:24,386 --> 01:25:27,896
We had this one idea that I really loved
and I wish we could have kept.

1783
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,599
You're back to the archery tournament.

1784
01:25:30,993 --> 01:25:32,723
And Merida fires an arrow
and makes a bull's-eye,

1785
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:35,431
and then Mom picks up the bow
and splits her arrow.

1786
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:37,353
And she says, "You didn't get
everything from your father."

1787
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:39,686
-Yeah, we had that for a while.
-We had that for a while,

1788
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:43,318
but ultimately it went back to
that it's this competing thing

1789
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,622
and what are they
out there competing for?

1790
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,524
Are they still competing for her hand?

1791
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:49,952
And it was just kind of
the wrong resolution.

1792
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:52,595
But that, again, it went back
into that comparison,

1793
01:25:53,015 --> 01:25:56,115
and the suitors were hanging around.
So it was just muddy.

1794
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:59,672
It was a great moment,
but it was a can of worms

1795
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:01,528
and it opened up all these questions.

1796
01:26:01,857 --> 01:26:03,467
So that doing it this way,

1797
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:06,402
not having everything resolved,
it's resolved.

1798
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:08,732
And Merida and Mom have changed.

1799
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:12,467
Merida is wearing a nicer dress.
Mom's hair is down.

1800
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:15,644
But that you have that resolution
of their characters,

1801
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:18,714
and in the song,
the song's words are basically saying,

1802
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:22,274
"We are what we are, and that's okay."

1803
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:26,590
Getting to see them riding together,
even without that archery moment,

1804
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:28,235
you sort of feel like...

1805
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,263
I think we all believe that Mom

1806
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:32,579
was quite a bit like Merida
when she was young.

1807
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,534
So, you get to see a touch of that
when they're riding together.

1808
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:37,071
And Mom's hair is flowing,

1809
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:39,845
and, of course, she can ride on a horse
fast across the countryside,

1810
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:41,562
‘cause she used to be Merida
when she was a kid.

1811
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:42,113
‘cause she used to be Merida
when she was a kid.

1812
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:43,563
Totally. And they're having fun together.

1813
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:44,434
Totally. And they're having fun together.

1814
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:48,036
Which I think is at the heart
of all relationships

1815
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:49,943
that, when they're working, is that

1816
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:52,168
there's not a hierarchy
in the relationship.

1817
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:56,581
You're just who you are and
you see each other on this equal level

1818
01:26:57,279 --> 01:26:59,739
and play is a big part of that.

1819
01:27:00,182 --> 01:27:01,852
I know as a parent, for me,

1820
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:04,704
when I'm playing with my kids
there's no parent’kid thing,

1821
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:06,463
we're just having fun.

1822
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:08,485
With my friends,
when we go out and see movies,

1823
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:11,044
that's just another form of play.

1824
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:13,727
Well, the last part of the film

1825
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,896
is we had this great idea
of ending a movie.

1826
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:16,247
is we had this great idea
of ending a movie.

1827
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:17,658
-Oh, it's coming up, not yet.
-It's coming up.

1828
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:18,953
You got to wait 'til the very end.

1829
01:27:19,201 --> 01:27:21,511
Well, hold on, there's one other one
that you wanted to end on.

1830
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:22,957
-It was the hawk...
-Oh, yeah.

1831
01:27:23,205 --> 01:27:24,725
-... that came in.
-We had this thing...

1832
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,120
Yeah, we had that. It was...

1833
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:29,624
When they ride out
and the wisp disappears,

1834
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:32,577
we kind of panned up and you see
the ships going off into the sunset.

1835
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:35,854
l had that hawk or an eagle come down,
which represented Merida,

1836
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:37,991
just dive right at the screen and tear it.

1837
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,719
And then I would go into the most
awesome heavy metal soundtrack

1838
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,040
at the end of the movie,
which was fantastic.

1839
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:45,652
With some bagpipes?
Yeah, it was great.

1840
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,536
-Which was fantastic.
-We did that for a couple screenings,

1841
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:49,643
-or one screening we did it for.
-Yeah. And it was great,

1842
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:51,197
but they said, "No."

1843
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:53,426
So to keep the integrity of the piece,
we didn't go that way.

1844
01:27:53,802 --> 01:27:54,701
l thought you were kidding around

1845
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,956
and I didn't realize you really meant
that to be in until a few weeks later.

1846
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:00,202
It's drawn and it's been archived.

1847
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:03,629
Yeah. But what we did settle on
for the very, very end of the movie

1848
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:08,066
is just to have this little button
at the very end, where...

1849
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,943
What happened to all that junk that
Merida bought in the Witch's cottage?

1850
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:14,737
.. bought in the Witch's cottage,
and we came up with this great idea.

1851
01:28:15,157 --> 01:28:16,497
And you guys are going to see it
and we thought that's

1852
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:19,662
just kind of a nice little button
at the end of the movie.

1853
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:21,724
Well, that's it, gang.

1854
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:24,837
Thanks for watching Brave.
l hope you enjoyed it.

1855
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,853
I'm the director, Mark Andrews.

1856
01:28:27,169 --> 01:28:28,279
Co-director, Steve Purcell.

1857
01:28:28,537 --> 01:28:29,647
Editor, Nick Smith.

1858
01:28:29,905 --> 01:28:31,245
Story supervisor, Brian Larsen.

1859
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:32,970
And I couldn't have made it
without you guys.

1860
01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:36,174
It was fantastic working with you
and the rest of the crew.

1861
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,048
-l love you guys.
-l love you guys.

1862
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:39,196
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1863
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:40,904
Thank you and good night.
