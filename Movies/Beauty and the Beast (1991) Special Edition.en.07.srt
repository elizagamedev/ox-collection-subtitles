1
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,927
Little town
It's a quiet village

2
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:19,529
Every day like the one before

3
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,857
Little town
Full of little people

4
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:28,748
Waking up to say

5
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,800
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

6
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,449
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

7
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,524
There goes the baker
with his tray like always

8
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,338
The same old bread and rolls to self

9
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,293
Every morning just the same
since the morning that we came

10
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,281
To this poor provincial town

11
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,959
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question

12
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,022
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell?

13
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,102
- Never part of any crowd
- 'Cause her head's up on some cloud

14
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,426
No denying she's a funny girl
that Belle

15
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,567
- Bonjour
- Good day

16
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,346
How is your family?

17
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,234
- Bonjour
- Good day

18
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,166
How is your wife?

19
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,101
I need six eggs

20
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,856
That's too expensive

21
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,642
There must be more
than this provincial life

22
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,959
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar

23
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,339
! wonder if she's feeling well

24
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,825
- With a dreamy far-off look
- And her nose stuck in a book

25
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,379
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

26
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:18,324
Oh, isn't this amazing?

27
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,573
It's my favorite part because

28
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,731
You'll see

29
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,861
Here's

30
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,597
Where she meets Prince Charming

31
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,645
But she won't discover that it's him

32
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,286
Till chapter three

33
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,627
Now, it's no wonder
that her name means "beauty"

34
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,458
Her looks have got no parallel

35
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,698
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

36
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,861
Very different from the rest of us

37
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,707
She's nothing like the rest of us

38
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,572
Yes, different from the rest of us
is Belle

39
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:38,488
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her

40
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,902
I said she's gorgeous
and I felf

41
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,619
Here in town there's only she
who is beautiful as me

42
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,039
So I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle

43
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,447
Look there, he goes
Isn't he dreamy?

44
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,047
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute

45
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,680
Be stilf my heart
I'm hardly breathing

46
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:05,107
He's such a tall, dark, strong
and handsome brute

47
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,745
Bonjour.

48
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,950
- You call this bacon?
- What lovely grapes

49
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,586
- Ten yards
- Excuse me

50
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,729
- I'll get the knife
- Please let me through

51
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,465
- This bread, it's stale
- These fish, they smell

52
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,179
There must be more
than this provincial life

53
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:23,426
Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife

54
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,760
Look, there she goes
A girl who's strange but special

55
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,583
A most peculiar mademoiselle

56
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,570
It's a pity anda sin
she doesn't quite fit in

57
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,534
- 'Cause she really is a funny girl
- A beauty but a funny girl

58
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,401
She really is a funny girl

59
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,119
- That Belle
- Bonjour.

60
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,955
Bonjour.

61
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,470
Bonjour

62
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,848
Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it?

63
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,782
Madame Gaston
His little wife

64
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,559
No, sir, not me
! guarantee it

65
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,480
! want much more
than this provincial life

66
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,703
! want adventure
in the great wide somewhere

67
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:03,028
! want it more than I can tell

68
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,046
And for once it might be grand

69
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,753
To have someone understand

70
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,797
! want so much more
than they've got planned

71
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,006
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

72
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,650
Looking so down in the dumps

73
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,487
Every guy here’d love to be you, Gaston

74
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,043
Even when taking your lumps

75
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,817
There's no man in town
as admired as you

76
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,643
You're everyone's favorite guy

77
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,477
Everyone's awed and inspired by you

78
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:02,456
And it's not very hard to see why

79
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:10,812
No one's slick as Gaston

80
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,890
No one's quick as Gaston

81
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,004
No one's neck’'s
as incredibly thick as Gaston

82
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,078
For there's no man in town
half as manly

83
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,525
Perfect, a pure paragon

84
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,868
You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley

85
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:30,005
And they'll tell you whose team
they prefer to be on

86
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:35,486
No one's been like Gaston

87
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,608
A kingpin like Gaston

88
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,580
No one's got a swell cleft
in his chin like Gaston

89
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,396
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating

90
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,240
Oh, what a guy, that Gaston

91
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,000
Give five hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips

92
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,570
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

93
00:27:56,208 --> 00:28:00,548
No one fights like Gaston

94
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,703
Douses lights like Gaston

95
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,821
In a wrestling match
no one bites like Gaston

96
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:09,275
For there's no one as burly and brawny

97
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,095
As you see, I've got biceps to spare

98
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,425
Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny

99
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:19,637
That's right and every last inch of me's
covered with hair

100
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,662
- No one hits like Gaston
- Matches wits like Gaston

101
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,998
In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston

102
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,751
I'm especially good at expectorating

103
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,559
Ten points for Gaston

104
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,028
When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

105
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,548
Every morning to help me get large

106
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,772
And now that I'm grown
l eat five dozen eggs

107
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:47,232
So I'm roughly the size of a barge

108
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,568
No one shoots like Gaston

109
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,753
Makes those beauts like Gaston

110
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,844
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

111
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,704
l use antlers in all of my decorating

112
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,992
My, what a guy

113
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,470
Gaston

114
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:15,004
Le Fou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking

115
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,030
- A dangerous pastime
- 1 know

116
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,170
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

117
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,080
And his sanity's only so-so

118
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,899
Now, the wheels in my head
have been turning

119
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,939
Since I looked at that loony old man

120
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,583
See, ! promised myself
I'd be married to Belle

121
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,939
And right now I'm evolving a plan

122
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,550
No one plots like Gaston

123
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,578
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

124
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,753
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots
like Gaston

125
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:02,503
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

126
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:07,615
My, what a guy
Gaston

127
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,947
Be our guest

128
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,814
Be our guest

129
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,982
Put our service to the test

130
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,328
Tie your napkin round your neck, cherie
and we provide the rest

131
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:47,096
Soup du jour, hot hors d'ouevres

132
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,298
Why, we only live to serve

133
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,647
Try the gray stuff
It's delicious

134
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,896
Don't believe me?
Ask the dishes

135
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,162
They can sing
They can dance

136
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,581
After all, miss, this is France

137
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,926
And a dinner here is never second-best

138
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,080
Go on and fold your menu

139
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,193
Take a glance
and then you'll be our guest

140
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,786
Be our guest, be our guest

141
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,872
Beef ragout, cheese souffle

142
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,029
Pie and pudding en flambé

143
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,984
We'll prepare and serve with flair
a culinary cabaret

144
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,548
You're alone and you're scared

145
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,644
But the banquet's all prepared

146
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:28,623
No one's gloomy or complaining
while the flatware's entertaining

147
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,129
We tell jokes
1 do tricks

148
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,109
With my fellow candlesticks

149
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:37,004
Und it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet

150
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,415
Come on and lift your glass

151
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,644
You've won your own free pass
to be our guest

152
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,774
If you're stressed
it's fine dining we suggest

153
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,757
Be our guest, be our guest
be our guest

154
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,266
Life is so unnerving

155
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,526
For a servant who's not serving

156
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,790
He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon

157
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:05,113
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

158
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,667
Suddenly those good old days are gone

159
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:15,606
Ten years we've been rusting
needing so much more than dusting

160
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,787
Needing exercise
A chance to use our skills

161
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,716
Most days we just lay around the castle

162
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,290
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and whoopsy daisy

163
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:33,013
It's a guest, it's a guest
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed

164
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,011
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

165
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,178
With dessert she'll want tea

166
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,220
And my dear, that's fine with me

167
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,199
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubblin’, I'll be brewin'

168
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,007
I'll get warm, piping hot

169
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,384
Heaven's sakes, is that a spot?
Clean that

170
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,087
We want the company impressed

171
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,993
We've got a lot to do
Is is one lump or two?

172
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:57,754
For you, our guest

173
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,569
- She's our guest
- She's our guest

174
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,057
She's our guest

175
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,842
No, people. Song's over.
Over here, line up. Not...!

176
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,009
It's been years since we've had
anybody here and we're obsessed

177
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,623
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

178
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,536
While the candlelight's still glowing

179
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,689
Let us help you, we'll keep going

180
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:22,907
Course by course

181
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,291
One by one

182
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,426
Till you shout
"Enough, I'm done!"

183
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:32,166
Then we'll sing you off to sleep
as you digest

184
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,970
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now let's eat up

185
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,484
Be our guest, be our guest

186
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,224
Be our guest

187
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:45,596
Please be our guest

188
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,839
There's something sweet

189
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:15,817
And almost kind

190
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,250
But he was mean
and he was course and unrefined

191
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,487
And now he's dear

192
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,491
And so unsure

193
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:26,834
! wonder why
! didn't see it there before

194
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,728
She glanced this way

195
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,596
I thought I saw

196
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:47,902
And when we touched
she didn't shudder at my paw

197
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,995
No, it can't be

198
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,156
I'll just ignore

199
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,969
But then she's never looked at me
that way before

200
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:03,306
New and a bit alarming

201
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:07,359
Who'd have ever thought

202
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:11,428
That this could be

203
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,334
True

204
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,549
That he's no Prince Charming

205
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,801
But there's something in him

206
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,723
That I simply didn't see

207
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,679
- Well, who'd have thought
- Well, bless my soul

208
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:32,607
- Well, who'd have known
- Well, who, indeed

209
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,356
And who'd have guessed
they'd come together on their own

210
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:38,106
- It's so peculiar
- We'll wait and see

211
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,792
A few days more

212
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,966
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

213
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:49,319
You know, perhaps there is something
there that wasn't there before

214
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:55,025
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

215
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,212
I'l be cooking again

216
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:11,056
Be good-looking again

217
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:14,018
With a mademoiselle on each arm

218
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,998
When I'm human again

219
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:18,944
Only human again

220
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:22,016
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm

221
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,356
I'l be courting again
Chic and sporting again

222
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:29,897
Which should cause
several husbands alarm

223
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,741
I'l hop down off the shelf
and tout suite be myself

224
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,707
! can't wait to be human again

225
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:42,546
When we're human again,
only human again

226
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,279
When we're knickknacks
and whatnots no more

227
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,607
When we're human again
Good and human again

228
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:53,317
Ah, cherie, won't it all be top drawer?

229
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,537
I'l wear lipstick and rouge

230
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,269
And I won't be so huge

231
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:00,471
Why, I'll easily fit through that door

232
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,644
I'l exude savoir-faire

233
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,556
I'll wear gowns
lil have hair

234
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:07,658
It's my prayer to be human again

235
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:16,145
When we're human again
Only human again

236
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,616
When the world once more
starts making sense

237
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:22,907
- I'd unwind for a change
- Really? That'd be strange

238
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:26,177
Can I help it if I'm tense?

239
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:29,596
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea

240
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,973
Let my early retirement commence

241
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,283
Far from fools made of wax

242
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,892
I'll get down to brass tacks and relax

243
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,361
When I'm human again

244
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:44,936
So sweep the dust from the floor

245
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:48,416
Let's let some light in the room

246
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,924
1 can feel, I can tell
someone might break the spell

247
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,509
Any day now

248
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:59,043
Shine up the brass on the door

249
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:01,693
Alert the dust pail and broom

250
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:03,882
If it all goes as planned

251
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,487
Our time may be at hand
any day now

252
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:12,776
Open the shutters and let in some air

253
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,320
Put these here
and put those over there

254
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:20,160
Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears

255
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,000
And throw them away

256
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,852
We'll be human again

257
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:33,968
Only be human again

258
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,931
When the girl finally sets us all free

259
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:38,924
Cheeks a-bloomin' again

260
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,669
We're assuming again

261
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:44,194
We'll resume our long lost joie de vivre

262
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:47,494
We'll be playin' again
Holidayin' again

263
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,021
And we're prayin' it's ASAP

264
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:54,481
We will push, we will shove
And they'll soon fall in love

265
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,998
And we'll finally be human again

266
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:45,428
We'll be dancing again

267
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,469
We'll be twirling again

268
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:50,904
We'll be whirling around with such ease

269
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:54,024
When we're human again
Only human again

270
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:57,641
We'll go waltzing
those old one-two-threes

271
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,965
We'll be floating again
We'll be gliding again

272
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:04,524
Stepping, striding,
as fine as you please

273
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:07,957
Like a real human does

274
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:11,361
I'll be all that was

275
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:15,585
On the glorious morn
when we're finally reborn

276
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:20,533
And we're all of us human again

277
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,856
Tale as old as time

278
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,798
True as itcan be

279
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:09,360
Barely even friends

280
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:11,943
Then somebody bends

281
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:14,342
Unexpectedly

282
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,577
Just a little change

283
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:24,734
Small, to say the least

284
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,245
Both a little scared

285
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:29,944
Neither one prepared

286
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,950
Beauty and the Beast

287
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,776
Ever just the same

288
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,597
Ever a surprise

289
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,599
Ever as before

290
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,892
Ever just as sure

291
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:54,156
As the sun will rise

292
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:58,822
Tale as old as time

293
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,884
Tune as old as song

294
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,499
Bittersweet and strange

295
01:04:08,912 --> 01:04:11,022
Finding you can change

296
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:13,661
Learning you were wrong

297
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:19,373
Certain as the sun

298
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:23,661
Rising in the east

299
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,167
Tale as old as time

300
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,929
Song as old as rhyme

301
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,991
Beauty and the Beast

302
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,968
Tale as old as time

303
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:41,718
Song as old as rhyme

304
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:47,322
Beauty and the Beast

305
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:07,564
- We're not safe until he's dead
- He'll come stalking us at night

306
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,309
Set to sacrifice our children
to his monstrous appetite

307
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,794
He'll wreak havoc on our village
if we let him wander free

308
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,670
So, it's time to take some action, boys

309
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:23,157
It's time to follow me

310
01:11:25,915 --> 01:11:28,725
Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows

311
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,585
It's a nightmare
but it's one exciting ride

312
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:35,088
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle

313
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:38,521
And there's something
truly terrible inside

314
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:41,605
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones

315
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,721
Massive paws,
killer claws for the feast

316
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:46,838
Hear him roar, see him foam

317
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,826
But we're not coming home
till he’s dead

318
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:51,823
Good and dead

319
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:11,201
Light your torch, mount your horse

320
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,424
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

321
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:16,043
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

322
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:19,092
Through a mist through a wood
Where within a haunted castle

323
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:22,115
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day

324
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:25,907
It's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain

325
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,932
We won't rest tilf
he's good and deceased

326
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,305
Sally forth, tally ho,
grab your sword, grab your bow

327
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:34,092
Praise the Lord and here we go

328
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:57,156
We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us

329
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,510
And this monster is mysterious at least

330
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:03,666
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives

331
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,803
We'll save our village and our lives

332
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,480
We'll kill the Beast

333
01:13:34,043 --> 01:13:35,353
Hearts ablaze, banners high

334
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:36,871
We go marching into battle

335
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:39,833
Unatraid, although
the danger just increased

336
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:43,003
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come, we're 50 strong

337
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,502
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

338
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,602
Let's kill the Beast

339
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,280
Kilf the Beast
Kilf the Beast

340
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,593
Kilf the Beast
Kilf the Beast

341
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,420
Kilf the Beast
Kilf the Beast

342
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:19,317
Kilf the Beast

343
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:49,008
Certain as the sun

344
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,970
Rising in the east

345
01:24:54,356 --> 01:24:56,406
Tale as old as time

346
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,157
Song as old as rhyme

347
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,311
Beauty and the Beast

348
01:25:05,534 --> 01:25:08,143
Tale as old as time

349
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,290
Song as old as rhyme

350
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:16,370
Beauty and the Beast
