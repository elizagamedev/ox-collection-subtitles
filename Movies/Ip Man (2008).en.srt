1
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,785
Fo Shan's citizens were well off
and practiced kung fu as a hobby.

2
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,699
Martial clubs became popular.

3
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,561
turning Fo Shan into a
province renowned for martial arts.

4
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,986
Martial Arts Street in Fo Shan, 1935

5
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,953
Another competitor

6
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,372
Okay, let's start practicing

7
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,078
Come on, ready...

8
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,148
One. . -

9
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,497
Two. . -

10
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,378
One... two...

11
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,353
Sir, a Master Liu is looking for you

12
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,167
May I Know who you are?

13
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,399
I'm the patriarch of the Liu Fist Sect

14
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,614
I just started a martial club in Fo Shan

15
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:23,893
Congratulations

16
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,331
I hear that Master Ip
is a Wing Chun expert

17
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,631
I'd love to practice with you today

18
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,825
Can we do it some other day?

19
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,743
It's not convenient right now

20
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,102
Since I'm already here,

21
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,997
let's just play around for a bit

22
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,033
It's all private.
No one else shall Know who wins

23
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,877
It's not a matter of winning.
I'm having dinner

24
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,833
In that case... I'1]1 wait for you

25
00:03:59,172 --> 00:03:59,692
Master Liu

26
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:01,818
Have you eaten yet?

27
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,280
Please join me

28
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:42,234
You want one?

29
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,540
No, thanks

30
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,060
Is the food all right tonight?

31
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,006
Very good indeed

32
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:58,508
That's good

33
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,368
Very quick

34
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,035
Leave it, Uncle Wang.
Close the door first

35
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:38,717
Master Liu

36
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,251
Please!

37
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,187
Please!

38
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,099
Are you okay?

39
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,243
I'm fine...

40
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:32,855
Let's start again!

41
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,004
Okay. here I come

42
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,096
Touche!

43
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,817
Touche!

44
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:43,519
All touche!

45
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:00,903
Thanks for being lenient. Master Liu

46
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,030
Thanks for teaching me.
I've learnt a lot

47
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,328
The pleasure was all mine

48
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,511
Regarding this private duel,
Master Ip...

49
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,801
I won't tell anyone. Don't worry

50
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,305
Thanks so much. I'm totally grateful

51
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,366
Goodbye

52
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,197
Farewel]

53
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,259
So long

54
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,304
With “Move 1000 Catties with 4 Taels”

55
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,159
Ip pushed Master Liu's whole body away

56
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,895
Isn't “Move 1000 Catties
with 4 Taels” Tai Chi?

57
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,400
I thought Master Ip practiced Wing Chun

58
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,093
Anyway. he pushed him away with one hand

59
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,974
Liu refused to admit defeat

60
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,880
Ip kept chasing after him fiercely!

61
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,900
But Liu remained indignant
after being hit

62
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,306
He jumped at Ip like a hungry dog

63
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,579
These tea leaves are
pretty good and cheap

64
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,272
Thank you
Got to go

65
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,130
Goodbye
Goodbye. see you next time

66
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,079
Who put these here, Uncle Ping?

67
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,845
Your brother

68
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,844
I thought Liu was good
but he's so bad at defence

69
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,846
and was beaten up like a pighead

70
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,835
He co-owns his dad's restaurant.
He's always idle

71
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,110
Ask that kid to serve the customers

72
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,056
Good morning

73
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:30,993
Brother Ip!

74
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:32,948
Is Quan here yet?

75
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,078
He's waiting for you upstairs

76
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,193
Been here long. Quan?

77
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,775
You're always late

78
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,999
I'm busy

79
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,387
Busy with what?

80
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,368
Drinking tea, eating. practicing

81
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:51,667
What else?

82
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:55,901
This tea smells nice

83
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,926
I'm talking about you

84
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,073
Have you ordered yet?

85
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:02,975
I got something to discuss with you

86
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,857
Let's eat first and then we'll talk

87
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,798
This just came out of the oven!
Try it...

88
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,682
Heard that you had
a duel with Master Liu

89
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,457
and had beaten him quickly.
Is that true?

90
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,436
Who told you that, Lin?

91
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,045
My brother

92
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,941
Should've told me earlier.
I'm his disciple now!

93
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,584
But you've been
a disciple of every master

94
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,984
Was the duel private. Brother Ip?

95
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,468
We have things to discuss.
Leave us for now

96
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,474
Then I won't disturb
your private conversation

97
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:52,714
Morning. Master!
Morning

98
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,256
Master

99
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,961
Heard that you were beaten by Ip Man

100
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,803
Everyone in Fo Shan Knows about it now

101
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:58,858
Nonsense! Who told you that?

102
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,396
Yuan at the restaurant

103
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,337
Everything is
costly in Fo Shan these days

104
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:06,876
So what?

105
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,382
That means the economy is
good in Fo Shan

106
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,979
Everybody can afford to spend money

107
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,464
Is that so?

108
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,942
Clothing is the most important
in our daily lives

109
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,483
There will be lots of
demand for future clothing

110
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,462
I‘11 open a cotton mill to
provide cotton for them

111
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:33,795
I want you to be my partner

112
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,458
I don't Know anything about business

113
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,260
But I do

114
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,661
I'm not in need of money

115
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,441
Who's Yuan? Show yourself !

116
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:44,646
I am

117
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,626
You rascal. You ruined my reputation

118
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:52,428
Master...

119
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,579
I must teach you a lesson!
Master---

120
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,708
He's my brother. Let's talk

121
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,414
Calm down. Okay. Master?

122
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,529
Your brother?

123
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,573
He ruined my reputation

124
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,020
He said I was beaten by Ip Man

125
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,231
What's gonna happen to my martial club?

126
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,924
Who will want to be my disciples?

127
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,465
Apologize!

128
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,554
I didn't do anything wrong.
I told the truth!

129
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:13,699
You're bullshitting again! You-:-

130
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,340
Master...

131
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,209
Master Ip is upstairs.
Seek him out if you have guts!

132
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,512
What? Go!

133
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,085
Take it easy. Master...

134
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,540
Master---
Don't be angry. Master

135
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,667
I've been wronged. Master Ip

136
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,294
Master...

137
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,352
Please tell everybody

138
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,616
you've defeated Master Liu in a duel

139
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,720
Master Ip-:-
You got to clear my name

140
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,135
You liar,
why‘re you bothering Brother Ip?

141
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,909
I'm no liar

142
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,097
I saw the duel
when I was picking up my kite

143
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,236
Your kite was cut
and fell into Brother Ip‘s house

144
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,716
You saw the whole duel
between the two masters

145
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,795
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

146
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,450
That's exactly what happened

147
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:10,962
Even if it’s true,

148
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,171
you shouldn't have told everyone

149
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,526
You're not supposed to
admit to certain things

150
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:15,701
What's wrong
with admitting to the truth?

151
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:16,899
That might cause
embarrassment for others

152
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,719
What embarrassment?
I don't Know so much

153
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,195
This is embarrassment !

154
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,120
You don't need to do that, Lin

155
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,505
Why're you laughing?
You think I'm invisible?

156
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,329
Captain... it's no big deal

157
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:35,174
What no big deal?

158
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,148
Leave!

159
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,149
Don't you leave!

160
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,684
Captain, it's no big deal

161
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,328
I saw everything. I'm warning you...

162
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,874
I‘11 nab whoever that
causes trouble on my turf

163
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,087
I didn't cause any trouble

164
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,059
Someone ruined my name.

165
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,592
I'm here to claim justice

166
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,863
What justice? I am justice

167
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,994
You hooligans are fighting all the time

168
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:58,694
What age are we in now?

169
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,549
Still talking about martial arts?

170
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,197
We're talking about arms and guns!

171
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,387
Guns. Got it?

172
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,789
You Know, Captain Li...

173
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:35,861
We martial artists are energetic
Sometimes we might be a bit too loud

174
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,890
But that doesn’t mean
we're not civilized

175
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,699
We're civilized folks.
Please don’t pull the gun

176
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:45,567
Cut me some slack

177
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,743
Lin, set a table for Captain Li.
It's on me

178
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,148
Yes...

179
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,830
Captain Li. this way please

180
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,202
What you looking at? Get lost

181
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,557
Don't look. Don't look...
Get out of the way

182
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,512
Please

183
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,107
Master Liu

184
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,309
As you please

185
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,431
Why so secretive?

186
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,452
I'm really not good at business

187
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:21,191
Take this to set up the mill.
Pay me back if you make a profit

188
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,587
It'1]1 be a while before I can repay you

189
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,686
Take your time

190
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,802
Another request:
take my son as your disciple

191
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,696
There're so many martial club masters.
Ask them

192
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,923
None of them is better than you

193
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:40,732
We're similar

194
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:42,458
Brother Ip

195
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,408
Lin

196
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,124
Brother Quan

197
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,578
I learnt some new moves.
Practice with me

198
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,542
You got so much time.
You found your brother?

199
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,765
Let him be. He'11 come back once
he spent all his money

200
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:56,962
Let's try

201
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,545
Dad. did Uncle Ip agree?

202
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:02,804
Let's go watch over there

203
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,114
You draw very well, Zhun

204
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,136
What new moves have you learnt?
Let's see

205
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,073
Brother Ip. my master says

206
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,025
this move is offense
and defense all in one

207
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,903
Attack while defending.
Defend while attacking

208
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,419
Aren't they the same?

209
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,561
Go away, ignorant kid

210
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,259
This move attacks the midrib

211
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,785
Stop reciting mantra. Hit your target

212
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,212
Mom, I'm done with my drawing

213
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,661
So beautiful. Show it to Dad

214
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,690
OK.

215
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,435
Hit to disperse.
Disperse while hitting

216
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,243
My last move was
“disperse while hitting"...

217
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,755
Dad. look

218
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,043
Wait. I'm not free at the moment

219
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:56,395
You don't get it?
No

220
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,589
Come again if you don't get it

221
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:58,891
Try again

222
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,314
Dad doesn’t want to see it

223
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:09,682
There you go

224
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:10,479
What?

225
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,098
That was “disperse while hitting”

226
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,206
Once more, Master Ip
I couldn't see clearly

227
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:16,978
See? What you wanna see?

228
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,370
You guys fight every day.
Aren't you tired?

229
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,680
You okay. Brother Ip?

230
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,401
Sorry, Mrs Ip

231
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,967
Goodbye. Mrs Ip

232
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,615
I wasn't talking about you

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,810
No. there're things to
take care of at the mill

234
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,306
Yao

235
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,696
I gotta go, Uncle Ip

236
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,088
Okay, see you next time

237
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,449
Bye. Ip

238
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,754
Talk to me if you're not happy
No need to throw a tantrum

239
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,921
Okay. please take a look
at your son's drawing

240
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,691
Spend more time with him
instead of your pals

241
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,563
Let's go inside, okay?

242
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,506
Go

243
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,183
Brother

244
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:49,695
Where's the martial club street?

245
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,619
Ah.

246
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:51,867
Martial club!

247
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:53,502
Go straight ahead

248
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:29,117
One, two...

249
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,082
Which martial club should be
challenge first. Bro?

250
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:34,916
One... two!

251
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,788
One... Back!

252
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,914
You teach martial arts here?

253
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,366
Come in if you wanna learn

254
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,219
Who's the patriarch?

255
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,212
I am

256
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,313
My name is Jin

257
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,185
I come here as Fo Shan
is famous for martial arts

258
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,595
I'd like to practice
with Fo Shan's martial artists

259
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,167
Pratice?

260
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:00,242
Yes!

261
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,714
Provacation rather?

262
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:04,993
I'm obliged

263
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,345
Okay!

264
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,609
Stand aside

265
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,293
See how I‘11 beat these out-of—towners !

266
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,562
Not here. Stand over there

267
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,165
What about it?

268
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,410
Wait and see!

269
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,272
Very good!

270
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:19,851
Where's your master?

271
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:21,453
Here!

272
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,172
You wanna hack me to death?

273
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,468
Our master is not here

274
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,006
Weather is so treacherous
in Fo Shan these days

275
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:58,265
Let me

276
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,651
What are you drawing, Zhun?

277
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:12,647
He's ignoring you.

278
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,488
Spend more time with him

279
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,645
Okay

280
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,091
So early, Lin?

281
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,956
Yes I'm not here to fight.

282
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,075
Just a few words

283
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:44,946
What's the matter?

284
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,228
Some out—of—towners are
provoking all the clubs

285
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,831
Their kung fu is
too good for all the masters

286
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,731
Can you look into that if you can?

287
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,001
That good?

288
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:56,972
Yes

289
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,157
I gotta go. Mrs Ip

290
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,183
Hang in there, Master Liu!

291
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,464
We depend on you. Master Liu!

292
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,038
Damn it

293
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,347
No one in Fo Shan Knows
martial arts at all

294
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,159
I thought everyone
was Wong Fei-hong here

295
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:30,905
It turns out you are just bums

296
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,949
You can't even fight.
let alone defend yourselves

297
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,656
Brothers,
our efforts have not been wasted

298
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:37,825
Nobody in Fo Shan Knows martial arts

299
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,317
We'll be rich this time

300
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,266
Brothers, let's keep it up

301
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,536
We open a club here to
show them our might

302
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,489
We will be No.1 in Fo Shan!

303
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,646
You think you're good
by beating a few nitwits

304
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,796
Wait till you beat the best

305
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,439
Who's the best in Fo Shan?

306
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,092
Ip Man, of course!

307
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:09,908
Go!

308
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,295
Come with us!

309
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,050
See how we shall defeat Ip Man

310
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,879
Dad, there're lots of people outside

311
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:48,627
Sir... they...

312
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,667
Are you Ip Man?

313
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,804
I'm Jin.
Heard that Fo Shan's famous for kung fu

314
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,389
I understand, Master Jin.
I understand

315
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,951
You bring a crowd here
to challenge me to a duel?

316
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,188
Of course

317
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,399
We're opening a club here
to show our might

318
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,666
To open a martial club...

319
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,499
you need a good site.
No need to fight with me Please leave!

320
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,726
Uncle Wang. take Zhun inside

321
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:18,483
Ip Man!

322
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,809
Don't dillydally. Are you scared?

323
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,264
You think our house is a martial club?

324
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,489
Who's going to fight with you? Get lost!

325
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,968
You heard that. I won't fight with you

326
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,479
Please leave immediately

327
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,941
I heard Wing Chun was
invented by a woman

328
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,870
That suits you just right

329
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,096
Are you afraid of your wife, Ip?

330
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,690
No men are afraid of their wives

331
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,686
There're only men
who respect their wives

332
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,326
Don't worry. Mrs Ip.
I won't beat him to death

333
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,005
If you fear he'll] lose.
I‘11 use only one hand

334
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,036
If that's not enough,
I can use no hands at all

335
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,955
Fight with him, Master Ip! Beat him up!

336
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,034
I'm too disappointed by Fo Shan.
Damn it!

337
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:09,891
So many martial artists
but none of them good

338
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:10,982
Shut up!

339
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,096
Don't break my things

340
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:24,625
Get out of my way!

341
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,000
Get out of my way!

342
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:34,696
You rascals

343
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,000
You come at the right time
This place is small.

344
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,112
Please get outside
and close the door on your way out

345
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,168
You have to redeem our honor

346
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,629
Ask them to leave. Hurry up!

347
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:57,861
Hurry up! Get out
Can I just watch?

348
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,546
Hurry up! Get out!

349
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,034
Get out! Get out!

350
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,926
Wing Chun, Ip Man

351
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,456
I really wanna see...

352
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,289
how a man can fight like a woman

353
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,581
Good kung fu does not
depend on age or sex

354
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,113
but on how well you fight.
You will Know later

355
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,002
Please.

356
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,092
I‘11 pay!

357
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:14,489
Good!

358
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:33,344
I‘11 pay!

359
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,482
Dad. Mom said

360
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,997
if you don't start fighting
everything in the house will be broken

361
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,514
Okay

362
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,371
Little rogue

363
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,610
Mind you language

364
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,306
Bro...

365
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:31,346
Bro...

366
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,090
Bro...

367
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,600
You all right. Master Jin?

368
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:42,437
I'm fine!

369
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,986
How about that, Master Jin?
My kung fu isn't too bad, eh?

370
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:14,665
That's enough

371
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,237
My northern boxing has
lost to your southern one

372
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:25,093
No, it’s not a matter of northern
or southern style. The problem is you

373
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:34,949
So who won?

374
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,764
Look how depressed he is.
He must have lost

375
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,501
Get lost! Go back to your hometown!
Get lost. you out—of—towners!

376
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:48,976
Master !

377
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:49,894
Brother Ip!
Master !

378
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:50,891
You fought very well, Ip!

379
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,939
You've redeemed the honor
of our martial clubs

380
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,565
I was just lucky...

381
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,153
Don't be modest.
You are Canton's treasure!

382
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,017
Thank you

383
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,578
Take a look. It's imported

384
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,553
Master Ip. flowers for your wife
Thanks

385
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:07,707
How much, boss?

386
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:08,973
On the house, Master Ip

387
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,093
I can't let you pay. You saved our honor

388
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,340
How can that be?

389
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:13,521
You're running a business
Don't stand on ceremonies .

390
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:14,962
Don't stand on ceremonies .

391
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,660
Okay. next time

392
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,562
Fruits, Master Ip
You're too kind. I can't

393
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:19,976
For the kid
Thank you

394
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,109
Thank you
Please come again. Goodbye

395
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,554
Buddy
Take this

396
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:25,363
Say thank you

397
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,707
Thank you
You're welcome...

398
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,995
Thank you
Farewel]

399
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,344
How are you. Master Ip?
How are you?

400
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,402
How are you. Master Ip?

401
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:32,503
That isn't bad at all

402
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,114
Yes, this is the best in our shop

403
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,937
It's our honor
if it can be placed in your house

404
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:40,495
Thank you

405
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,257
What's the occasion?

406
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,666
Uncle Man. Auntie

407
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:46,891
You plan on opening a martial club...

408
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,968
why didn't you inform me first?

409
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:51,831
When did I say that?

410
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,931
Everybody in Fo Shan Knows about it

411
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,256
Everybody in Fo Shan but me

412
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:58,762
Let me help you, Uncle Man

413
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,454
Master. Madam

414
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,710
Bro

415
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:10,664
You must be the one spreading the rumor

416
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,069
Keep order for me

417
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:15,352
Come. Go yourself

418
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,558
I don't care.
Yao has to be your first disciple

419
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,172
Come on. You've Known me long enough

420
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,444
I don't like having disciples

421
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:25,565
Be quiet

422
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:30,018
Stay in order
Stay in order and hail

423
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:49,996
Master Ip! Master Ip...

424
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,014
On July 7, 1937,
the Marco Polo Incident broke out.

425
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,077
Japan invaded China.
robbing its people of their livelihood

426
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,997
and causing rampant starvation
all over the country.

427
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,381
In October, 1938, Fo Shan was occupied
by the Japanese army

428
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,474
who destroyed factories,
infrastructures and buildings.

429
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:06,211
The population of Fo Shan shrunk from

430
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:07,968
more than 300,000 to just over 70,000.

431
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,956
Only a dozen factories in the whole city
remained in operation still.

432
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,777
Ip's residence was also confiscated and

433
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,816
turned into the headquarters of
the Japanese army.

434
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,721
Ip's family was rendered homeless,
living an abject existence.

435
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,994
Cheng, I'11 step out for a sec.
Will be right back

436
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,780
Wait

437
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,935
It's cold outside. Wear a jacket

438
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:00,491
Zhun

439
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,402
Be careful, Zhun. Don't hurt others

440
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,185
I‘'11 give you more, Master Ip

441
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:33,354
Thank you

442
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,837
The mill may be old
but it's still productive

443
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,260
Fo Shan is very chaotic these days

444
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,769
You left already.
Why did you come back?

445
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,750
Who's going to
feed the workers otherwise?

446
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,587
All my money is invested in this mill

447
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,114
I can’t pay you back for now

448
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,440
Don't worry. I almost forgot

449
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,290
No. I'11 consider you a shareholder then
Let me calculate---

450
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,376
you should have ten percent shares

451
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,067
It's really unnecessary

452
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,365
Stay and help out,
now that you own it too

453
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:43,870
Uncle Ip

454
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,415
Yao

455
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,990
You'11 be helping out?
That's great!

456
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,128
Everyone will be lively
under your leadership

457
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,433
And I can watch you practice Wing Chun

458
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,479
Ip. stay for lunch.
It's lunchtime for the workers

459
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,753
Yes, let’s have lunch together

460
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:58,656
No, thanks

461
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,866
I'm not free. Next time

462
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,390
Goodbye

463
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,125
Dad, why didn't you ask
Uncle Ip to stay?

464
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:18,932
He doesn't like to owe people favors

465
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,709
Dad, you used to practice martial arts,
right?

466
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,238
Why did you stop?

467
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:34,768
I get hungry when I exercise

468
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,100
So I need to exercise less, okay?

469
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:38,862
Got it.

470
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,277
I won't play outside from now on

471
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,957
You'll only stop playing today. Go eat

472
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,049
Hurry up and eat

473
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,134
This congee is a bit too thick

474
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,554
But you need to eat some

475
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:02,633
Come on.

476
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:08,262
Be careful it’s hot

477
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,081
How much rice is left at home?

478
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,410
Don't worry

479
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:30,088
I've pawned everything worth pawning

480
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,059
I am strong.

481
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:34,945
I can look for a job

482
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,720
It's not the end of the world

483
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,529
You look for a job?

484
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,167
I didn't need to work.

485
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,223
But it's different now
There's always a first time

486
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:54,482
We have enough people here
We don't need to hire more. Sorry

487
00:41:58,383 --> 00:41:59,993
Boss, are you hiring?

488
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,661
No

489
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:02,923
Thank you

490
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:10,146
You want to hire me, Boss...

491
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,188
You, you, you... Come up here...

492
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,524
You want to hire me, Boss...

493
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:17,831
Here

494
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,830
You're looking for a job. Master Ip?

495
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,009
Come, come up...

496
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,250
Thank you

497
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,113
Brother Ip!

498
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,289
You can't dress like that to work

499
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,309
I didn't expect to pour coals here

500
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:08,472
How are you. Master Ip?

501
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:10,854
How are you?

502
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,779
How are you. Master Ip?

503
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:18,732
So many martial club masters here?

504
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,197
The boss here used to
practice martial arts too

505
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,377
That's why he likes to
employ martial artists

506
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:28,788
By the way. are you still practicing?

507
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,595
I'd rather used my time to
scrape a living

508
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:35,215
Go that way.

509
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,145
Okay!

510
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,182
I can't finish it all. Help me, okay?

511
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,260
Eat some

512
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:04,847
How're your wife and son?

513
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,283
They're fine. Thank you

514
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:12,004
Did you find your brother?

515
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,660
I couldn't locate him since he left

516
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,229
Don't Know if he’s still alive

517
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,616
I don't even have
the chance to say sorry

518
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,502
What have you lost?

519
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,866
I lost an iron box

520
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:31,879
What iron box?

521
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:33,553
Japanese solders are coming!

522
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:34,638
Dear workers

523
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,675
This is Colonel Sato

524
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,946
He appreciates Chinese martial arts

525
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:03,566
He Knows Fo Shan
is famous for martial arts

526
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,754
He wants to find Chinese martial artists
to fight with the Japanese

527
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,790
Would anyone want to go?

528
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:12,602
Would anyone want to go?

529
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,074
Would anyone want to go?

530
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,019
Master?

531
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,742
You want us to be sandbags?

532
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,620
There's no door. I tell you!

533
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,255
Airhead. Whoever that wins
will get one sack of rice

534
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,874
Whoever that wins
will get one sack of rice

535
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:48,265
I‘11 go!

536
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,870
Lin... Don't get into trouble

537
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,053
I'm going too!

538
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:54,500
Me too!

539
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,835
They took all our rice.

540
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,595
Now I can get them back
The world is fair

541
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,187
Hey-:-

542
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:05,382
Forget it

543
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:07,257
Help me find the iron box

544
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:08,675
Hey-:-

545
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,852
Let's go. It's okay. Come

546
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:15,538
Be careful

547
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,593
Come, let's line up

548
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:18,145
Come, come, come...

549
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,673
Anything else?

550
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,966
No. let's go
Yes!

551
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:54,021
Master?

552
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:57,437
General

553
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,304
Thank you, General!

554
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,500
Good .

555
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,015
Got to beat them all

556
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,588
Let me join in the fun

557
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,756
They're not good enough
for General Miura

558
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:58,997
I‘11 show the Chinese
what Japanese kung fu's like

559
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,501
Find three men to fight with me

560
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:07,269
Give them rice even if they lose

561
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,700
Yes, sir!

562
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,940
I've done you a favor again

563
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:17,479
General Miura will fight
with three of you

564
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,959
You can get rice
whether you win or not

565
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,110
The rice is not important.

566
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:24,354
I just wanna beat them

567
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:26,433
Who will be going?

568
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,274
I will...

569
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:29,776
Let go of me... Stop shouting!

570
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,259
Lin, you and you... The three of you

571
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:34,377
Okay!

572
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,480
You've spit blood. Stop fighting

573
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:37,640
We've lost

574
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:40,975
General. they admitted defeat

575
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:08,954
Your really wanna die?

576
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,488
You asshole!

577
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,535
Lin, how are you? Lin...

578
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,588
Lin...

579
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:51,334
Were you tired today?

580
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,453
Pouring coal is not tiring at all

581
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,268
I saw Lin today

582
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,476
Really? How is he?

583
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:05,799
Not bad

584
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:08,908
I didn't expect to see him again

585
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:35,485
Master Li, Master Hong

586
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,680
Did you see Lin?

587
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,225
Lin? No, I didn't

588
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:42,832
Let's eat first

589
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:04,952
Lots of us received rice yesterday
General Miura was very satisfied.

590
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:06,685
Anybody wants to go today?

591
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,790
Anybody?
Li...

592
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,431
Li... Where's Lin?

593
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,293
Anybody wants to go?

594
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,221
I'm asking you. Where's Lin?

595
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:21,354
I don't Know

596
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,129
Of course you do. You took him away

597
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:28,403
Anybody wants to go?
You'll get rice if you win

598
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:29,582
Me!

599
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,274
If Master Ip is going. I‘11 go too!

600
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:32,247
Me too!

601
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,450
I wanna have a good fight
with the Japanese

602
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,328
Anything else I can do?

603
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,373
No, you can go

604
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:11,474
Thanks

605
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,897
Can I fight three more people?

606
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,316
He said he wanted
to fight three more people

607
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,241
That's it for me...

608
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:58,897
Why did you open fire?

609
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,012
Li! Why did you open fire?

610
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:09,745
Who let you open fire?

611
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:16,889
He took the rice even though he's lost

612
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,384
so... I wanted to teach him a lesson

613
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:26,815
This place is for tournaments only

614
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:40,544
Never open fire here anymore

615
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,909
Got it! Please calm down, General Miura

616
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:55,310
I‘11 arrange the next tournament for you

617
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:00,316
Continue!

618
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,105
Who else wants to fight?

619
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,410
Me!

620
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,078
Li! Open the gate!

621
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,015
Master...
Open the gate!

622
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,332
Tell me, was Lin beaten to death?

623
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,156
Open the gate

624
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:38,575
Master...

625
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:39,665
Open the gate!

626
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:42,799
Please open the gate

627
00:56:58,849 --> 00:56:59,809
I wanna fight ten people!

628
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,201
You crazy? Please don't

629
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:03,856
I wanna fight ten people!

630
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,744
He said he wanted to fight ten people

631
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:22,904
Ten?

632
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,308
Yes

633
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,261
Let's see how good he is

634
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:35,304
Unit 5!

635
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,939
Unit 1, Unit 3, Unit 5 Start!

636
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:45,565
Be careful

637
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,151
Stay back!

638
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,630
Come back again

639
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:46,762
He wants you to come back again

640
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:49,917
I'm not here for the rice

641
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,752
He said... he would come back

642
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:57,750
Hey-:-

643
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,107
What's your name?

644
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:03,866
He wants to Know your name

645
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,890
I'm just a Chinese

646
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:17,719
His name is Ip Man

647
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:54,287
Be careful in the future
I don't Know what Miura might do

648
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:00,913
Lackey!

649
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:03,609
Why am I a lackey?

650
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,281
Their deaths got nothing to do with me.

651
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,614
I'm just an interpreter
I need to scrape a living too!

652
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:10,910
I need to scrape a living!

653
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,421
Scrape a living?

654
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,304
You watch your countrymen get beaten
to death. Where's your dignity?

655
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,758
I don't have any
You do. You have lots of it

656
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,438
If you have the guts, go beat them up!

657
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,450
Beat as many as you can!

658
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,772
I'm an interpreter, not a lackey...

659
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:34,056
I'm a Chinese!

660
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,311
I'm back

661
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:33,472
Daddy

662
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:34,440
You're back?

663
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:37,263
Have you been good?

664
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:38,554
Yes

665
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,146
Good boy

666
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,343
Are you tired today?

667
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:07,326
Go wash your face first

668
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:09,392
You're so good

669
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,846
I realize today I'm useless

670
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,107
I can't do anything

671
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,133
I practiced marital arts before

672
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,024
But so what?

673
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:46,839
This world...

674
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:53,509
is minuscule

675
01:05:57,754 --> 01:05:58,574
I'm so useless

676
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:02,988
I don't care what the world is like

677
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,464
I only Know I‘m very happy now

678
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,569
As long as you, me, and Zhun...

679
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,827
can stay together,
everything will be okay

680
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:23,752
It's essential for
a family to stay together

681
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,032
Get off!

682
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,576
Get off! Get off...

683
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:00,755
Stand over there! On the side!

684
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:02,254
Stand over there! On the side!

685
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:29,207
Who's the boss? Come out!

686
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:34,947
I am

687
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,838
I just took your goods.
You can buy them back

688
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:49,318
Is that okay?

689
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:51,547
I don't have money

690
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:54,807
Don't beat my dad anymore!

691
01:07:57,774 --> 01:07:58,734
Wing Chun?

692
01:08:04,047 --> 01:08:05,037
Damn it! Wing Chun?

693
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:05,835
Don't beat him!

694
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:11,086
Do you have money?

695
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:12,471
I don't

696
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:13,359
Do you?

697
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:16,288
I‘11 keep beating you till you have!

698
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:27,456
The goods haven't been sold---
I don't have money

699
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,839
Uncle Ip! Uncle Ip...

700
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,077
Please save my dad.
He's almost beaten to death

701
01:08:37,846 --> 01:08:38,777
What's the matter. Yao?

702
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:39,645
Auntie

703
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:40,959
Let me go see what happens. It's okay

704
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:54,481
I'm very reasonable

705
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,997
It's fine if you don't have money now
I‘11 give you some time to raise it

706
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,232
As for the goods. I‘'11 keep them for now

707
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:20,596
Master Ip

708
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:25,317
Dad, are you okay?

709
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:27,469
I'm fine. Go help Uncle Fu

710
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:48,243
How can I help?

711
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,830
I thought your martial arts
were impractical

712
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:55,280
Now I Know it's very useful

713
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,079
I should've learnt
some martial arts from you

714
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:01,005
At least I can defend myself

715
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,162
Uncle Ip, please stay
and teach us martial arts

716
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,328
so that we can defend ourselves

717
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:10,799
Master Ip

718
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:14,932
You're such an expert. Please teach us

719
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:17,495
Yes, Master Ip. Please teach us

720
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,310
Yes, Master Ip. Please teach us

721
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:22,434
Yes, Master Ip. Please teach us

722
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:24,556
I'm a businessman

723
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:28,042
I Know nothing other than
running a business

724
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,518
I can't protect them, but you can

725
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,536
In peaceful days,
it's okay if you refused to teach

726
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:40,156
But in bad times now,
shouldn't you do something?

727
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:45,797
Teaching martial arts is very costly

728
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:49,563
You're paying their fees?
You owe me again

729
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,893
Uncle Ip. I'11 be your first disciple

730
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,291
Dad, I wanna be taller

731
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,019
Taller?

732
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,237
Why hasn't Ip Man come back?

733
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:39,464
I... I don't know...

734
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:41,973
Find him

735
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:48,934
I don't Know where he is

736
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:50,815
I don't Know how to find him

737
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,820
How big is Fo Shan?
How difficult can it be to find him?

738
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:59,915
Fo Shan is indeed very big

739
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:06,965
No...

740
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:09,238
Please don't...

741
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,162
I really don't Know where he jis...

742
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:20,064
Useless thing!
Enough!

743
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,760
Asshole!

744
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:30,495
Paper, stone, scissors!

745
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:32,817
You lost
You colluded?

746
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:37,843
Hide wel

747
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:41,011
10, 9, 8. 7, 6---
Zhun

748
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:44,647
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
That way

749
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,945
I'm coming. I'11 find you guys

750
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:52,371
Master

751
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:53,695
What ‘re you here for?

752
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,458
Miura wants you to go back and fight him

753
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:01,732
Go away

754
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:04,625
I can't

755
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:21,066
What are you doing?

756
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,544
What are you doing?
What do you want?

757
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:26,124
What do you want?

758
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:33,090
How pretty!

759
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,099
Shit

760
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:59,616
Let's go. It's not safe here

761
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:20,005
Let's go, Cheng

762
01:15:28,491 --> 01:15:29,251
Li

763
01:15:48,444 --> 01:15:50,584
You're a piece of shit!

764
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,700
How could you let Ip run away?

765
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,170
I'm sorry...

766
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:00,339
Even Colonel Sato could not stop him...

767
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:09,350
I've tried my best already... Sorry

768
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:11,709
Shut up!

769
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,691
Utterly useless!

770
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:17,429
Tell them...

771
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,940
to dig Ip out! This is an order

772
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:24,943
Yes, sir

773
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:40,665
Little Sis

774
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:43,271
Come here::-

775
01:16:45,568 --> 01:16:46,678
Brother, eat something

776
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:56,905
How's the master?

777
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,709
Okay. They are all fine

778
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:06,565
Master

779
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:07,796
Coming

780
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:12,501
Madam

781
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:15,620
See if it fits?

782
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,269
So are you well adapted here?

783
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:21,143
Yes

784
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,050
That's good
I'11 let you Know when the meal is ready

785
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:26,334
Li...

786
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:31,463
I'm fine

787
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:34,852
I really don't Know what to say

788
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:37,913
Thank you

789
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,128
It's okay

790
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:05,108
We better leave Fo Shan
as soon as possible

791
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:08,833
Quan is trying to find a solution for us

792
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,248
Where shall we go?

793
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:11,943
Hong Kong

794
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,982
In fact. it doesn't matter where

795
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,472
I still have some friends in Hong Kong

796
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,163
If something happens to me...

797
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:27,151
What can happen to you?

798
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:29,647
Nothing will happen to you

799
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,125
Are you tired today?

800
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,130
They are here again! Let's scram!

801
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,650
They are here! They are here!

802
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:04,488
Is the money ready?

803
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:05,967
We won't give you money!

804
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,300
What did you say?

805
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,889
I'm not afraid of you!
You can't bully us!

806
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,454
You want me to beat you up?

807
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:27,049
Damn it! Whoever dares to resist-:-
just beat him up!

808
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:16,411
Stop it!

809
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:33,739
No wonder they dare to resist
They've found a bodyguard

810
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:37,427
You spurned me for opening
a club in Fo Shan

811
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:41,118
And today, you wanna mess with me again?

812
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,494
You wanna chase me away?

813
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:46,334
No one wanna chase you away

814
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:50,025
Ip. have you ever been hungry every day?

815
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,290
Everybody is hungry nowadays

816
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:58,758
The first day I came to Fo Shan,
I told myself...

817
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:01,688
I would never be hungry again

818
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,365
I will never be hungry again!
Keep beating!

819
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:14,516
Beat them!

820
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:19,233
Yuan, why you still idling here? Go!

821
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:25,236
Kill them!

822
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:28,866
Kill them!

823
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,019
Go

824
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:43,187
How can we get near him?

825
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:38,853
Let's go!

826
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:43,625
Master, you were so good!

827
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:54,729
Yuan

828
01:23:58,567 --> 01:23:59,087
Stop there!

829
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:08,903
You Know what you're doing?

830
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:10,951
I Know. I'm a robber

831
01:24:12,481 --> 01:24:13,501
You're robbing the Chinese

832
01:24:14,016 --> 01:24:15,826
I'd rather be the bully than the bullied

833
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:17,148
I want everyone to be scared of me!

834
01:24:21,323 --> 01:24:21,753
Your brother asked me to give this---

835
01:24:21,957 --> 01:24:22,917
Don't talk about him!

836
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:29,213
You Know your brother is dead?

837
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:31,779
He's beaten to death by the Japanese

838
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:42,897
He looked for you everywhere
but couldn't find you

839
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:49,742
Everyone needs to choose his own path

840
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,798
Master. That guy told Miura
you're at the cotton mil]

841
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:07,215
Don't go back, ok?

842
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:10,777
I gotta go. Remember. don’t go back

843
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:47,927
Scram! Hurry up!

844
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:51,589
Where's Ip Man?

845
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:55,025
Where's Ip Man? Tell me!

846
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,275
Don't say a word

847
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:02,656
You, come here

848
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:07,024
Where's Ip Man?

849
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:10,478
Tell me!

850
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:11,749
I'm asking you!

851
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:13,893
Hang in there. I‘'11 figure out something

852
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:17,541
Speak !

853
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,843
Speak! Speak up...

854
01:27:20,202 --> 01:27:21,602
I'm here! I'm Ip Man...

855
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,030
I'm here... Li!

856
01:27:23,305 --> 01:27:23,595
Wait! Wait!

857
01:27:23,772 --> 01:27:26,842
Please wait!

858
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:28,308
Please wait!

859
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:31,507
Li, tell Miura the workers are innocent

860
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,580
Ask Miura to release them

861
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,115
I told you not to come back.
Why did you?

862
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,177
Tell him!

863
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:43,161
Sato!

864
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:49,965
He dares to hit me...
Can't we put him to death?

865
01:27:50,532 --> 01:27:51,732
I Know what I'm doing

866
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:53,994
Li
Yes

867
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,330
Since the day
you resisted the Japanese army

868
01:27:58,840 --> 01:27:59,980
you've already been a dead man

869
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:08,245
But you're talented,
you can be useful to us

870
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:15,111
So I‘11 give you one chance to be

871
01:28:16,992 --> 01:28:18,982
loyal to the Japanese Emperor

872
01:28:19,528 --> 01:28:23,038
Teach our army Chinese kung fu

873
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:27,472
That way. we might still spare your life

874
01:28:30,172 --> 01:28:32,951
He wanted you to
teach the Japanese kung fu

875
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:36,553
I won't teach the Japanese

876
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:38,966
You wanna see me fight?

877
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:41,765
1°11 fight with you

878
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:52,818
He said he would think about it

879
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:58,401
He wants to have
a duel with General Miura

880
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:02,232
Take him away!

881
01:29:03,972 --> 01:29:04,762
Take him away!

882
01:29:11,613 --> 01:29:13,513
Quan, take my wife
and kid away from Fo Shan

883
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,580
General, you really wanna fight with Ip?

884
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:31,526
Of course. He's an expert

885
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:34,300
But he doesn't look like...

886
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:37,279
he wants to teach the Imperial Army

887
01:29:37,973 --> 01:29:41,193
He must have other motives
trying to fight with you

888
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:44,797
General, don't fight with him

889
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:48,693
Let me simply shoot him dead

890
01:29:53,455 --> 01:30:02,105
He challenges me to a fight
because he thinks he's better than me

891
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:07,684
If I refuse to accept the challenge

892
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:14,965
but shoot him instead...

893
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,888
isn't that the same as admitting defeat?

894
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:26,285
Fighting with a Chinese

895
01:30:27,222 --> 01:30:30,001
is not just a matter of personal
honor for you

896
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:33,962
It has to do with
the national honor of our Empire

897
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,639
Are you saying I will lose?

898
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:40,462
I only fear for the worst

899
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:42,292
I will win for sure

900
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:45,080
I‘'11 let the whole China Know I've won

901
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:48,781
Yes! I understand!

902
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:30,614
I want you to teach us
instead of killing you

903
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,674
because I appreciate your talent

904
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:41,033
But I don't think Chinese Kung fu
is better than Japanese

905
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:47,255
We will fight in front of everybody

906
01:31:48,103 --> 01:31:50,243
That's why we need a fair tournament

907
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,010
You invaded our country

908
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:56,809
and killed our people

909
01:32:01,049 --> 01:32:02,099
Stop being hypocritical

910
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:07,358
Excuse me

911
01:32:24,406 --> 01:32:26,596
Let go of me! Let me go back!
Let go of my mom...

912
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:29,092
I promised Ip nothing
would happen to you

913
01:32:30,512 --> 01:32:31,272
It's too dangerous to go back

914
01:32:38,987 --> 01:32:40,447
I heard the Japanese
are fighting the Chinese

915
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:41,199
Who's fighting?

916
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:42,059
Ip Man

917
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,370
Look. the whole place is sealed up now

918
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:54,856
In the past---
I wished he could be with me every day

919
01:32:57,605 --> 01:32:59,745
So I always complained about
his practice

920
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:06,830
Every time he had a duel with someone-:--
I would throw a tantrum

921
01:33:10,618 --> 01:33:15,128
I never truly supported him
doing what he liked

922
01:33:17,492 --> 01:33:22,182
Now---
This could be his last duel

923
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,290
I fear there won't be another chance

924
01:33:29,237 --> 01:33:31,897
Why don't you give me this chance?

925
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:34,357
Why?

926
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:45,570
General Miura says--- For the sake of
Sino-Japanese cultural exchange,

927
01:33:46,888 --> 01:33:50,348
he is having a fair tournament
with Master Ip today

928
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:54,179
to share their Knowledge
in a friendly manner,

929
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:56,803
and to bring true peace
between the two countries

930
01:33:57,732 --> 01:33:59,692
Fair tournament? Is it possible?

931
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:04,146
That traitor will surely be
killed by the Japanese

932
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:05,699
That's right

933
01:34:14,716 --> 01:34:17,406
Here comes Master Ip!

01:34:26,928 --> 01:34:30,117
General Miura talked about a tournament

935
01:34:31,566 --> 01:34:33,026
But I don't give a damn!

936
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:38,991
Listen up. If you win

937
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:42,454
I will kill you

938
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,614
Remember this!

939
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:44,605
Yes!

940
01:34:47,582 --> 01:34:48,542
You better let Miura win later

941
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:51,124
Or he won't let you live

942
01:34:53,555 --> 01:34:54,895
It's more important to stay alive

943
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,049
Although martial arts
involves armed forces

944
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:04,740
Chinese martial arts
is Confucian in spirit

01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:09,336

would yourselves

Because you abuse military power

949
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:16,905
You turned it into violence
to oppress others

950
01:35:17,512 --> 01:35:19,532
You don't deserve
to learn Chinese martial arts
