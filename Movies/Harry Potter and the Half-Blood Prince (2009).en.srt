...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle’s walls.

345
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:47,961
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

346
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,550
Just something to think about.

347
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,480

00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,899

That was cheerful.

-So I noticed.

to become an Auror?

357
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:42,014
It was, but I was told I had to
get an “Outstanding” in my O.W.L.

358

was teaching Potions.

359

happy to accept N.E.W.T.s students...

370
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,241

my book yet, and nor has Ron.

375
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,744
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

376
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,797
Any ideas what these might be?

377
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,036
-Yes, Miss...?
-Granger, sir.

378
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:54,515
That one there is Veritaserum.
It’s a truth-telling serum.

379
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,633
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

380
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,033
It’s terribly tricky to make.

381
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,217
And this is Amortentia...

382
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,754
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

383
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,320
It’s rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

384
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,835
For example, I smell...

385
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:20,395
... freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

386
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,989
...-spearmint toothpaste.

387
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,837
SLUGHORN: Now, Amortentia doesn’t create
actual love. That would be impossible.

388
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:33,824
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

389
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:40,466
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

390
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,281
Sir? You haven't told us
what’s in that one.

391

What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

393
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:59,406
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

394
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,455
But it is more commonly referred to as--

395
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:07,531
-Liquid luck.
-Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

396
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,317
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

on page 10 of your books.

a student manage to brew a potion...

404
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,805

You crush it. Don’t cut it.

No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

To make an Unbreakable Vow, it’s--

850
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,954
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore’s judgment.

Yes, I did.

If Dumbledore’s traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

871

Dumbledore wants it.

Well, don’t suppose it’s going
to do him much good now, is it?

1185
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:10,940
My thoughts exactly.

1186
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:16,968
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

l wish you could’ve seen him

Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

Oh, dear.

-Would you like me to say a few words?
-Yes.

1192
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,530
He had a family, I trust?

Oh, yeah.

[SLUGHORN & HAGRID SINGING]

1202
01:48:38,746 --> 01:48:41,936
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1203
01:48:42,549 --> 01:48:45,829
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1204
01:48:46,453 --> 01:48:50,993
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1205
01:48:51,792 --> 01:48:56,332
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1206
01:48:57,131 --> 01:48:58,501
Poof.

1207
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:01,676
-That’s very odd, isn’t it?
-It is, isn’t it?

1208
01:49:02,236 --> 01:49:05,516
But that’s life, 1 suppose.

[HAGRID SNORING]

1212
01:49:29,863 --> 01:49:32,613
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1213
01:49:34,001 --> 01:49:37,751
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1214
01:49:39,206 --> 01:49:41,816
...With just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1215
01:49:42,943 --> 01:49:46,043
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1216
01:49:48,048 --> 01:49:50,188
As I watched, it sank.

1217
01:49:51,985 --> 01:49:54,474
Just before it reached the bottom...

1218
01:49:54,988 --> 01:49:56,278
. it transformed...

1219
01:49:57,858 --> 01:49:59,468
...into a wee fish.

1220
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:03,201
It was beautiful magic.

1221
01:50:04,465 --> 01:50:06,455
Wondrous to behold.

1222
01:50:09,336 --> 01:50:11,766
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1223
01:50:14,475 --> 01:50:15,405
Your mother.

But I can’t help you.

1229
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:41,322
It would ruin me.

The night I got this?

1232
01:50:51,845 --> 01:50:53,275
Because of her.

1233
01:50:54,381 --> 01:50:55,961
Because she sacrificed herself.

1234
01:50:56,617 --> 01:50:58,697
Because she refused to step aside.

1235
01:50:59,153 --> 01:51:01,963
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

RIDDLE:
l was in the library the other night...

1252
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:48,559
...in the Restricted Section...

1253
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:52,919
..and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1254
01:52:54,635 --> 01:52:57,065
It’s called, as 1 understand it...

1255
01:52:58,672 --> 01:52:59,842
a Horcrux.

1256
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:04,275
-l beg your pardon?
-Horcrux.

1257
01:53:05,012 --> 01:53:07,352
l came across the term while reading...

1258
01:53:07,848 --> 01:53:10,508
...and I didn’t fully understand it.

1259
01:53:11,051 --> 01:53:14,971
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom,
but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.

1260
01:53:15,689 --> 01:53:17,059
Which is...

1261
01:53:18,358 --> 01:53:19,998
...why I came to you.

1262
01:53:23,063 --> 01:53:27,983
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1263
01:53:28,835 --> 01:53:31,145
But I don’t understand
how that works, sir.

1264
01:53:34,074 --> 01:53:37,584
One splits one’s soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1265
01:53:38,245 --> 01:53:41,405
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1266
01:53:42,015 --> 01:53:43,005
Protected?

1267
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:46,127
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1268
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:50,098
In other words, you cannot die.

1269
01:53:57,564 --> 01:54:00,344
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1270
01:54:00,901 --> 01:54:03,361

the answer to that, Tom.

1271
01:54:04,938 --> 01:54:06,228

01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:08,110
Yes.

1273
01:54:08,809 --> 01:54:13,119
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1274
01:54:14,614 --> 01:54:18,773

For instance, isn’t seven...?

01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:20,829
Seven?

1276
01:54:21,788 --> 01:54:26,418
Merlin’s beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1277
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:30,537
To rip the soul into seven pieces....

1278
01:54:32,165 --> 01:54:34,825
This is all hypothetical, isn’t it, Tom?
All academic?

1279
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:41,139
Of course, sir.

1280
01:54:44,244 --> 01:54:45,994
It'll be our little secret.

1281
01:54:55,055 --> 01:54:56,165
HARRY:
Sir.

1282
01:55:11,705 --> 01:55:13,545
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1283
01:55:13,974 --> 01:55:16,344
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1284
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:19,563
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1285
01:55:20,113 --> 01:55:21,043
What are they exactly?

1286
01:55:21,348 --> 01:55:24,278
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1287
01:55:27,854 --> 01:55:29,344
A ring, for example.

1288
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:31,480
Or a book.

1289
01:55:32,959 --> 01:55:35,039
-Tom Riddle’s diary.
-It's a Horcrux, yes.

1290
01:55:35,862 --> 01:55:37,702
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1291
01:55:38,131 --> 01:55:40,151
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1292
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,300
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1293
01:55:42,702 --> 01:55:47,092
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
Il had no idea just how powerful.

1294
01:55:47,874 --> 01:55:49,603
-The ring?
-Belonged to Voldemort’s mother.

1295
01:55:50,243 --> 01:55:54,403
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1296
01:55:55,148 --> 01:55:58,548
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux....

1297
01:55:59,186 --> 01:56:00,236
One destroys Voldemort.

1298
01:56:00,554 --> 01:56:03,104
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1299
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:06,492
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1300
01:56:20,841 --> 01:56:22,511
.. leaves traces.

1301
01:56:30,517 --> 01:56:32,357
It’s where you've been going,
isn’t it, sir?

1302
01:56:32,786 --> 01:56:34,776
-When you leave the school?
-Yes.

1303
01:56:35,922 --> 01:56:38,611
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1304
01:56:39,159 --> 01:56:42,759
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1305
01:56:44,798 --> 01:56:48,898
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1306
01:56:53,406 --> 01:56:55,426
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1307
01:56:55,876 --> 01:56:58,186
...that you take too much for granted?

1308
01:56:58,678 --> 01:57:03,098
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don’t want to do this anymore?

1309
01:57:03,884 --> 01:57:05,754
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1310
01:57:06,887 --> 01:57:11,987
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1311
01:57:31,077 --> 01:57:32,507
Oh, Harry.

1312
01:57:35,315 --> 01:57:37,335
You need a shave, my friend.

1313
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:44,140
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1314
01:57:44,824 --> 01:57:48,284
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1315
01:57:50,297 --> 01:57:52,406
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1316
01:57:53,133 --> 01:57:54,443
I'm an old man.

1317
01:57:54,801 --> 01:57:56,291
You still look the same to me, sir.

1318
01:57:57,938 --> 01:58:00,568
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1319
01:58:01,107 --> 01:58:03,917
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1320
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:11,030
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1321
01:58:11,751 --> 01:58:14,821
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1322
01:58:15,422 --> 01:58:17,031
But there is one condition:

1323
01:58:17,424 --> 01:58:20,234
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1324
01:58:21,494 --> 01:58:22,924
Yes, sir.

1325
01:58:23,296 --> 01:58:25,166
You do understand what I’m saying?

1326
01:58:26,032 --> 01:58:28,202
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1327
01:58:28,668 --> 01:58:30,748
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1328
01:58:31,204 --> 01:58:34,683
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1329
01:58:40,347 --> 01:58:41,746
Your word, Harry.

1330
01:58:43,583 --> 01:58:44,893
My word.

1331
01:58:45,852 --> 01:58:47,342
Take my arm.

1332
01:58:48,955 --> 01:58:51,095
Sir, 1 thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1333
01:58:52,025 --> 01:58:55,065
Well, being me has its privileges.

This is the place.

1335
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:46,577
Oh, yes.

1336
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:49,931
This place has known magic.

1337
01:59:58,291 --> 01:59:59,631
-Sir!
-In order to gain passage...

1338
01:59:59,993 --> 02:00:01,223
...Payment must be made.

1339
02:00:01,561 --> 02:00:04,750
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1340
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,380
-You should've let me, sir.
-No, Harry.

1341
02:00:09,069 --> 02:00:11,469
Your blood’s much more precious
than mine.

1342
02:00:33,693 --> 02:00:37,763
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1343
02:00:38,498 --> 02:00:41,397
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1344
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:45,664
Careful.

1345
02:01:09,329 --> 02:01:10,318
There it is.

1346
02:01:11,965 --> 02:01:14,335
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1347
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:38,500
If you would, Harry.

1348
02:02:26,005 --> 02:02:28,115
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1349
02:02:29,042 --> 02:02:30,272
Oh, yes.

1350
02:02:41,521 --> 02:02:42,891
It has to be drunk.

1351
02:02:43,256 --> 02:02:45,746
All of it has to be drunk.

1352
02:02:46,926 --> 02:02:49,856
