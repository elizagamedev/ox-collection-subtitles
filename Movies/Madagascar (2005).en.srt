1
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:18,981
Surprise!

2
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,159
Alex. Do not interrupt me
when I'm daydreaming.

3
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,676
When a zebra's in the zone,
leave him alone.

4
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,572
Come on, Marty. Just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

5
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,862
Hey, man, thanks.

6
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,699
Hey, I got something
stuck in my teeth.

7
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,625
It's driving me crazy.
Can you help me? Please?

8
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,085
You came to the right place, my friend.

9
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,128
Dr. Marty, D.D.S., is in the house.

10
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,994
Please hop on top of my sterilized
examination table, if you may.

11
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,557
- [don't see anything.
- It's on the left.

12
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,030
Oh, sorry.

13
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,501
Okay, just don't talk
with your mouth full.

14
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:05,009
Right here. What the heck
is this doing in there?

15
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,752
Happy birthday!

16
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,104
Aw, hey, thanks, man.

17
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,213
You put it in behind the tooth.
You all right.

18
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,356
These aren't even on the shelf yet.
Here. Check it out.

19
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,872
- Look at that. Ooh! Look at that.
- Look at that. It's snowing.

20
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,697
Ten years old, huh? A decade.

21
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,096
Double digits. The big 1-0.

22
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,035
You don't like it?

23
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,239
- No, no, it's great.
- You hate it.

24
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,895
I should've gotten you the Alex
alarm clock. That's the big seller.

25
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,002
No, no, no.
The present's great, really.

26
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,845
It's just that
another year's come and gone

27
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,004
and I'm still doing
the same old thing.

28
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,580
"Stand over here. Trot over there.
Eat some grass. Walk back over here."

29
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,665
- l see your problem.
- Maybe I should go to law school.

30
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,441
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,510
- How?
- Throw out the old act.

32
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,709
Who knows what you'll do.
Make it up as you go along.

33
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,519
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.
Boom, boom, boom.

34
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,905
- Really?
- You know, make it fresh.

35
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,361
Fresh, huh? Okay.
I could do fresh.

36
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,650
Works for me.

37
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,773
Here come the people, Marty.
I love the people.

38
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,648
It's fun people fun time!

39
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,270
Let's go, Gloria!
Up and at'em. We're open!

40
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,665
What day is it?

41
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,979
It's Friday. Field trip day.

42
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,208
Yes, it's field trip day.
Let's get up and go...

43
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,205
..in ten more minutes.

44
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,239
Come on!

45
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,997
Melman, Melman, Melman!
Melman, Melman, Melman!

46
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,166
Wake up! Rise and shine! It's another
fabulous morning in the Big Apple.

47
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,923
Let's go.

48
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,785
- Not for me. I'm calling in sick.
- What?

49
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,734
I found another brown spot
on my shoulder. Right here. See?

50
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,076
Right there. You see?

51
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,148
Melman, you know
it's all in your head. Hm?

52
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,211
Let's go! Come on!

53
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,888
Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey.

54
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,606
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.

55
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:21,263
Straight out the ground.
Tasty fresh! Freshalicious.

56
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:24,914
Ziploc fresh.

57
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,472
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

58
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,918
the Central Park Zoo
proudly presents:

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,880
Show them the cat. Who's the cat?

60
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,192
The king of New York City.

61
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,761
Alex the lion.

62
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,183
It's showtime.

63
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,700
Roar!

64
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,272
Gather around, people.
Big show about to start.

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,080
Check out the zebra
taking care of biz. That's right.

66
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,267
Just smile and wave, boys.

67
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,246
Smile and wave.

68
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,471
Kowalski, progress report.

69
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,204
We're 500 feet from the main sewer line.

70
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,176
- And the bad news?
- We've broken our last shovel.

71
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,786
Right.

72
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,211
Rico, you're on litter patrol.
We need shovels.

73
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,624
And find more Popsicle sticks.
We don't want to risk another cave-in.

74
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,336
And me, skipper?

75
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,250
I want you to look
cute and cuddly, private.

76
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,777
Today we're going to blow this dump.

77
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,472
Come here. Come here.
Come on, penguin.

78
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,366
Yeah! You don't
see that on Animal Planet.

79
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,366
Ha-ha.

80
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:21,037
Well, show's over, folks.
Thanks for coming.

81
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,631
l hope you thought it was fresh.

82
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,323
I'l be here all week.

83
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,864
In fact, I'll be here
for my whole life.

84
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,305
Three hundred
and sixty-five days a year,

85
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:34,183
including Christmas,
Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa.

86
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,828
Please don't forget
to never spay or neuter your pets.

87
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,864
And tip your cabbie,
because he's broke.

88
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,702
You, quadruped.
Sprechen sie Englisch?

89
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,578
I sprechen.

90
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,626
- What continent is this?
- Manhattan.

91
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,663
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.

92
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,080
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.

93
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,379
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.

94
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,925
What are you guys doing?

95
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,837
We're digging to Antarctica.

96
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,133
Ant-who-tica?

97
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,594
Can you keep a secret,
my monochromatic friend?

98
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,828
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York City?

99
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,859
Of course not. We don't belong here.
It's just not natural.

100
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,447
This is all some kind
of whacked-out conspiracy.

101
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,457
We're going to the
wide-open spaces of Antarctica.

102
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,281
To the wild.

103
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,464
The wild?
You could actually go there?

104
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,165
That sounds great.

105
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,611
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?
Tell me where it is.

106
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,395
You didn't see anything.

107
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,705
Right?

108
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,397
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,135
I'm sorry. No, sir.

110
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,575
For his final appearance of the day,

111
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,712
the king of New York City.

112
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,621
Alex the lion.

113
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,479
Roar!

114
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,175
Thank you. Thank you very much.

115
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,684
You guys are great. You're a
great crowd. Give yourselves a hand.

116
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,217
Thank you. Oh. Thank you.

117
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,087
Oh! Well. Thank you.

118
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,476
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.

119
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,364
Underpants!

120
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,325
Everybody get home safe. Hey!
Check out my Web site.

121
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,065
Twenty-four hour Alex Cam.
Watch me sleep.

122
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,472
This is the life.

123
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,711
That's the spot.

124
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,603
Ohl! I'm in heaven.

125
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,075
- Ooh, it's Marty's birthday.
- Just rip it open.

126
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,254
- What is it?
- Come on. Open it up. What you got?

127
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,851
A thermometer.

128
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,478
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.

129
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,957
l wanted to give you something personal.
That was my first rectal thermometer.

130
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,428
- Mother...
- I'll miss that bad boy.

131
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,247
Get the cake. Melman, come on.

132
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,803
Happy birthday to you

133
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,798
You live in a zoo

134
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,150
You look like a monkey

135
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,992
And you smell like one too

136
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,374
I say.

137
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,790
Aw, well, now, you guys
are just embarrassing me.

138
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,382
And yourselves.

139
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,724
What? We worked
on that all week.

140
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,544
Let's go.
Let's make a wish, babycakes.

141
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,108
- What'd you wish for?
- Nope. Can't tell you that.

142
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,548
Come on. Tell.

143
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,813
No siree.
I'm telling you, it's bad luck.

144
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,245
You want some bad luck,
I'll blab it out.

145
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,091
But if you want to be safe,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

146
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,754
Would you just tell us?
What could happen?

147
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,250
Okay.

148
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:12,255
l wished I could go to the wild!

149
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:13,926
The wild?!

150
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,284
I told you it was bad luck.

151
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,964
The wild? Are you nuts?

152
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,976
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

153
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,970
It's unsanitary.

154
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,950
The penguins are going.
So why can't I?

155
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,739
The penguins are psychotic.

156
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,991
Come on. Just imagine
going back to nature.

157
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,981
Back to your roots.
Clean air, wide-open spaces!

158
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,712
I hear there's
wide-open spaces in Connecticut.

159
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,038
- Connecticut?
- You got to go over to Grand Central.

160
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,385
Then you got to take
the Metro-North train... north?

161
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,571
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

162
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,705
Come on. What would
Connecticut have to offer us?

163
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,795
- Lyme disease.
- Thank you, Melman.

164
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,174
No, I just want...

165
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,095
There's none of this in the wild.

166
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,387
This is a highly
refined type of food thing

167
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,477
that you do not find in the wild.

168
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,609
You ever thought there might
be more to life than steak, Alex?

169
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,592
He didn't mean that, baby.
No, no, no.

170
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,409
Doesn't it bother you guys
that you don't know anything

171
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,876
about life outside this zoo?

172
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,127
- Nuh-uh. Nope.
-Mm-mm.

173
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,541
Well, ! mean, come on.
That's just one subject.

174
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,406
You got a little schmutz
right there on your....

175
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,250
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for the party. It was great.

176
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,948
Really.

177
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,930
What's eating him?

178
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,605
Maybe you should talk to him.
Go over and give him a little pep talk.

179
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,549
Hey, I already gave him
a snow globe. I can't top that.

180
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,960
l can see where this is going.

181
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,617
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

182
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,277
Come on. He's your best friend.

183
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,236
All right, all right. Okay.

184
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,954
- Night, Marty.
- Night, Glo.

185
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,724
What a day.

186
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:54,103
I mean, I tell you, it just doesn't
get any better than this, you know?

187
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,725
Ooh! It just did. Even the star's out.

188
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,803
Not going to find a star
like that in the wild.

189
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,116
Helicopter.

190
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,681
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

191
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,556
Everybody has days when they think the
grass might be greener somewhere else.

192
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,117
Alex.

193
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,439
Look at me.

194
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,294
I'm ten years old.
My life is half over.

195
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,073
And I don't even know
if I'm black with white stripes...

196
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,414
...or white with black stripes.

197
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,425
Marty.

198
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,637
I'm thinking of a song.

199
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,689
Alex. Please. Not now.

200
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,385
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song.
I think you're familiar with it.

201
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,774
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
No, no, no.

202
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm not listening.

203
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,103
Start spreadin' the news

204
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,358
I don't know you.

205
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,936
I'm leaving today

206
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:00,466
- We are a great big part of it
- He's funny. Who is that?

207
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,281
Come on. You know
you know the words.

208
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,517
Two little words.

209
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,896
New York.

210
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,544
New York

211
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,566
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hey, I'm sleeping here!

212
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,629
We're not all nocturnal, you know!

213
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,171
I'll Knock your "turnal" right off, pal.

214
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,517
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?

215
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,379
You mess with him,
you mess with me, Howard.

216
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,015
- You're a bigmouth lion.
- See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.

217
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,552
We make a great team, the two of us.

218
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,241
We sure do. No doubt about it.

219
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,796
So, what are you going to do? Go
running off to the wild by yourself?

220
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,208
- No.
- Good.

221
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,839
You and me. Let's go.

222
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,101
- What?
- The wild.

223
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,332
Come on. You and me together.

224
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,701
It's a straight shot
down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central.

225
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,934
Weill grab a train, we'll head north.

226
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,593
We can be back by morning.
No one will ever know.

227
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,949
You're joking. Right?

228
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:59,224
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course
I'm joking. Give me a break.

229
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,326
Like we're going to get a train.

230
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,502
Don't do that. You really
had me worried there.

231
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,385
Oh, well. 1 guess I'll hit the sack.

232
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,072
Yeah, me too. I'll need
to rest my voice for tomorrow.

233
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,850
It's Seniors' Day, you know.
Have to roar extra loud.

234
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,806
Give them a little jolt. You know?

235
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,121
Good night, AllyAl.

236
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,626
They forgot to turn off
the ambience again.

237
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,875
Don't worry. It's cool.

238
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,334
You know, I got it.

239
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,217
Much better.

240
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,481
Come on, now, baby.

241
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,681
My little filet.

242
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,849
My little filet mignon
with a little fat around the edges.

243
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,742
like that. I like
a little fat on my steak.

244
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:28,063
My sweet, juicy steak.
You are a rare delicacy.

245
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,054
Alex. Alex. Alex!

246
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,597
What? What?

247
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,815
You suck your thumb?

248
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,784
What is it, Melman?

249
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,545
You know how I have
that bladder infection

250
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,605
and I have to get up
every two hours?

251
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,740
I got up to pee and looked over at
Marty's pen, which I usually don't do.

252
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,038
I don't know why, but I did. And...

253
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,650
What? What's going on?

254
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,488
It's Marty. He's gone.

255
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,116
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

256
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,853
How long has he been working on this?

257
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,359
Marty!

258
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,783
Marty!

259
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,538
He wouldn't fit down there.

260
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,370
Marty? Marty! Marty!

261
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,935
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

262
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,506
- Connecticut!
- He wouldn't.

263
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,505
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

264
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,122
I mean, we got to call somebody!

265
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,845
Hello? Get me Missing Animals.
And hurry.

266
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,488
We've got a lost zebra probably on
the way to Connecticut, and we need...

267
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,838
- Hello? Hello?
- Wait a second.

268
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,373
- We can't call the people.
- What the...?

269
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:36,738
They'll be really mad.

270
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,206
It'll get Marty transferred for good.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

271
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,986
Mm-hm, I know that's right.

272
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,478
We got to go after him.
He's not thinking straight.

273
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,474
Let's stop him from making
the biggest mistake of his life.

274
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,410
He's probably out there
lost and cold, confused.

275
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,553
Poor little guy.

276
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:18,727
Come on.

277
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,101
One of us should wait here
in case he comes back.

278
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,307
Not now. This is an intervention.
We all got to go.

279
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,670
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?

280
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,786
- You should take Lexington.
- Melman!

281
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,238
- Okay. "We." We should take Lexington.
- What about Park?

282
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,024
No, Park goes two ways.
You can't time the lights.

283
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,896
l heard Tom Wolfe
is speaking at Lincoln Center.

284
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,834
Well, of course we're
going to throw poo at him.

285
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,103
We should've taken Park.

286
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,084
You sure this is the fastest way
to Grand Central Station?

287
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,377
I don't know!
That's what Melman said.

288
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,075
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

289
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,620
That room has some nifty little
sinks you can wash up in, and look!

290
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,635
Free mints!

291
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,173
This isn't a field trip.

292
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,514
This is an urgent mission to save
Marty from throwing his life away.

293
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,329
Now, where's the train?

294
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,134
Here it comes.

295
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,819
What did Marty say to you?
l asked you to talk to him.

296
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,425
I did! I did! 1 don't understand.
He said, "Let's go."

297
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,562
I said, "Are you crazy?"
He says, "I'm ten years old."

298
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,341
And he has black-and-white stripes,
and so then we sang and...

299
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:42,205
What you got to do is go
straight back down West 42nd.

300
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,612
It's on your left after Vanderbilt.

301
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,820
If you hit the Chrysler Building,
you've gone too far.

302
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,627
Thanks a lot, officer.

303
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,727
Hey! Wait for the light.

304
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:55,994
Freak.

305
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,595
- Did you say "zebra"?
- That's right. A zebra.

306
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,258
Right in front of me.

307
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,839
- Can I shoot it?
- Negative.

308
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,437
Then I'm going to need some backup.

309
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,178
- Aw! Knicks lost again.
- What are you going to do.

310
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,692
Did that say "Grand Central
Station" or "my aunt's constipation"?

311
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,059
This is it.

312
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,398
Grand Central Station.

313
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,781
It's grand and it's central.

314
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,295
Move aside. We have an emergency here.
This is an emergency situation.

315
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:57,253
Hey, hey. Just chill out.
It's not that big of an emergency.

316
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,050
Upstairs, downstairs.

317
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,062
How do you like that?

318
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,678
Lady! What is wrong with you?

319
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,822
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people.

320
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,511
You're a bad kitty.

321
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,051
Dagnabbit! 1 missed the express.

322
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,024
Looks like I'll have
to take the Stamford local.

323
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,994
I got him! I've got him!

324
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,239
He's got him!

325
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,407
He's got him!
He's got him! He's got...

326
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,009
got something for you!

327
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,130
I'm okay. I'm okay.

328
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,526
Whoa! What are
you guys doing here?

329
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:36,202
- lam so glad we found you.
- We were so worried about you.

330
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,719
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

331
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,889
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

332
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,735
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

333
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,568
Because I was wondering...

334
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,530
How could you do this to us?
I thought we were your friends!

335
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,966
What's the big deal?
l was coming back.

336
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,181
Don't ever do this again.
Do you hear me?

337
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,914
- Do you hear him?
- Guys, we're running out of time.

338
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,957
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?

339
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,272
...do this again! Don't you ever,
ever do this again!

340
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,072
Come here.

341
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,763
We've been ratted out, boys.

342
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,505
Hold your fire!

343
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,410
Cute and cuddly, boys.
Cute and cuddly.

344
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,754
If you have any poo, fling it now.

345
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,055
It's the Man.

346
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,286
Good evening, officers.

347
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,457
No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?

348
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:43,043
You're not good with the
“putting words together

349
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,829
and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh."

350
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:49,302
Hey! How you doing?
You know what? Everything's cool.

351
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:53,202
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

352
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,349
My friend went a little crazy.
Happens to everybody.

353
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,465
The city gets to us all.
Went a little cuckoo in the head.

354
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,645
Don't be calling me
cuckoo in the head.

355
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:05,314
Just shush! I will handle this.

356
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:06,961
Ohl! I got him!

357
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,886
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

358
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,028
Would you give a guy a break?

359
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:16,455
Weill take my little friend home and
forget this ever happened. All right?

360
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,143
No harm, no foul, right?

361
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:24,369
Hey, it's cool. It's me,
Alex the lion. From the zoo.

362
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,011
What's the matter with them?

363
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,140
l feel really, really weird.

364
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:47,949
I love you guys.

365
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,588
I love you so much.

366
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,068
Last night's dramatic incident
in Grand Central

367
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,887
is an example of what animal rights
wackos have been shouting for years:

368
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,085
Animals clearly
don't belong in captivity.

369
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,158
They are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

370
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,667
where they will live their lives
in the freedom they desire.

371
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,798
- Hey. Little help?
- He's awake! He's awake!

372
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,880
Do something!

373
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,419
Oh, man.

374
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,860
Oh, my head.

375
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,858
What the...?

376
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,233
Wait. Where? What?

377
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,579
I'm in a box! Oh, no.
No, no! Not the box.

378
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,260
Oh, no, they can't
transfer me. Not me!

379
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,400
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

380
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,570
Darkness creeping in.

381
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,865
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

382
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,081
Walls closing in around me.

383
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,454
So alone. So alone.

384
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,362
- Alex! Alex, are you there?
- Marty?

385
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,656
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
- Oh, Marty! You're here!

386
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,613
- What's going on? You okay?
- This doesn't look good.

387
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,836
- Alex, Marty, is that you?
- Gloria!

388
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,911
- You're here too!
- lam loving the sound of your voice.

389
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,354
- What is going on?
- We're all in crates.

390
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,690
Oh, no!

391
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,187
- Sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

392
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:40,565
Is that Melman?

393
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,173
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

394
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,065
l often doze off
while I'm getting an MRI.

395
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,968
- You're not getting an MRI.
- CAT scan?

396
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,901
No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

397
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,357
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no.
No, no, I can't be transferred.

398
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,134
l have an appointment
with Dr. Goldberg at 5:00.

399
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,863
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

400
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,540
No other zoo could
afford my medical care.

401
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,329
And 1am not going HMO.

402
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,027
Take it easy, Melman.
It's going to be okay.

403
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:12,474
- We are going to be okizay.
- No, we're not going to be okizay.

404
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,975
Now, because of you, we're ruined!

405
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,407
Because of me? fail
to see how this is my fault.

406
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,901
- You're kidding, right, Marty?
- You. You ticked off the people.

407
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,601
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

408
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:28,963
"l don't know who I am. I got to go
find myself in the wild." Oh, please.

409
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,428
I did not ask you
to come after me, did I?

410
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,351
He does have a point.

411
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,346
I did say we should stay at the zoo,
but you guys...

412
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:38,786
Melman, just shut it.

413
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,337
You suggested this idea
to him in the first place.

414
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,903
- Leave Melman out of this.
- Thank you, Gloria.

415
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,799
Besides, it's not my fault
that we were transferred.

416
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,636
Melman, shut it.
Does anybody feel nauseous?

417
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,411
- l feel nauseous.
- Melman, you always feel nauseous.

418
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:00,575
Progress report.

419
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,566
It's an older code, skipper.
I can't make it out.

420
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,891
You, higher mammal.

421
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,485
Can you read?

422
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,506
No. Phil can read, though. Phil.

423
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,753
Ship to Kenya.

424
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,610
Wildlife preserve.

425
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:21,966
Africa!

426
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,954
Africa? That ain't going to fly. Rico.

427
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,260
I was the star
in the greatest city on Earth.

428
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,826
- Guys, listen.
- Aking. Loved by my people.

429
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,562
- Let's be civil.
- And you've ruined everything!

430
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:16,921
"Loved"?

431
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:20,849
If the people loved you, it's only
because they didn't know the real you!

432
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,123
Don't make me come up there.
I'll whoop both of yall.

433
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,879
I thought I knew the real you!

434
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:30,447
Your black-and-white stripes, they
cancel each other out. You're nothing!

435
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,539
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

436
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,680
You're not helping the situation.

437
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,623
Status.

438
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,687
It's no good.
I don't know the codes.

439
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:43,432
Don't give me excuses.
Give me results! Navigation.

440
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,336
All right. Let me think.

441
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,125
And shut him up!

442
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,396
- I did it!
- Let's get this tin can turned around.

443
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,379
Guys?

444
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,558
Oh, no.

445
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,886
Gloria!

446
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,221
Melman!

447
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,465
Marty!

448
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,180
Alex!

449
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:35,803
Marty?!

450
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,475
Alex!

451
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,950
Marty!

452
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,788
No, wait. Come back, Marty!

453
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,039
Don't go.

454
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,256
Marty?

455
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:34,792
Melman?

456
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,434
Gloria?

457
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,520
Marty?!

458
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:43,851
Melman?!

459
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:45,416
Gloria?!

460
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:48,748
Marty!

461
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,719
Melman! Gloria!

462
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,509
Hey, anyone! Hello!

463
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,889
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

464
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,033
Gloria, Melman, Marty.
Marty, Gelman, Gloria. Marty, Melman.

465
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,753
Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. Kelly.

466
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,806
Matt, Katie, Al.

467
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,381
Get me out of this thing.
Somebody. Hello?

468
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,589
Get me out of this thing right now!

469
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,226
Hello? Somebody?

470
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,660
Melman!

471
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,526
Alex? Is that you?

472
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,360
Melman, I got you. Hang on!
Hang on. I got you.

473
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:41,294
Melman! I got you, buddy.

474
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,555
Wait a sec, Melman.
Wait right there.

475
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,989
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you out of the box.

476
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,746
- Relax.
- Alex?

477
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,296
Giraffe, corner pocket!

478
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,746
Here goes nothing!

479
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,858
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hold still!

480
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,590
- Wait, Alex.
- Hold still.

481
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,668
- No, come on.
- Here I come!

482
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,634
Look! Look! Look! Look!

483
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,649
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!

484
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,169
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.

485
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,462
Oh, my...

486
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,900
Gloria!

487
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,216
Gloria!

488
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,836
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.

489
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,115
Gloria!

490
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,613
Alex!

491
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:43,964
- Marty?!
- Marty!

492
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:47,919
Yeah! All right! That's right!

493
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,980
Left! Left! Left. No, no,
your left! Your left! Your left!

494
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:54,962
Right here's good.

495
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,867
I don't have anything on me
right now. I'll have to get you later.

496
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,437
To you too.

497
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,085
Marty!

498
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,523
Marty!

499
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,700
Alex!

500
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,104
Marty!

501
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,765
Alex!

502
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,201
Marty!

503
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,543
All

504
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,817
Marty!

505
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,010
Alex?

506
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,649
Marty!

507
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,862
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.

508
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,141
Martin!

509
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,866
- Hold up!
- I'm going to kill you!

510
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,697
- Come here! Don't run away from me!
- Calm down!

511
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,777
If you keep running,
I'm going to just kill you more!

512
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,428
Oh, look at us.

513
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,649
We're all here together.
Safe and sound.

514
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,876
Yeah, here we are.

515
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,716
Where exactly is "here"?

516
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,217
San Diego.

517
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,850
San Diego?

518
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,484
White sandy beaches,

519
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,409
cleverly simulated natural
environment, wide-open enclosures.

520
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,677
I'm telling you,
this could be the San Diego Zoo.

521
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,993
Complete with fake rocks.

522
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,876
Wow, that looks real.

523
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,880
San Diego? What could
be worse than San Diego?

524
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,215
I don't know.
This place is crackalacking!

525
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,449
Oh, I could hang here.
l could hang here.

526
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,365
- I'll kill you!
- Take it easy!

527
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,069
- Strangle you!
- Calm down.

528
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,062
Then bury you, dig you up,
clone you and kill your clones.

529
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,032
- 20-second timeout.
- I'll never talk to you again.

530
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:45,618
Now, look. We're just
going to find the people,

531
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:49,994
get checked in
and have this mess straightened out.

532
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:54,013
Oh, great.
This is just great. San Diego.

533
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:57,872
Now I'll have to compete
with Shamu and his smug little grin.

534
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,210
I can't top that. Can't top it.

535
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:03,662
I'm ruined! I'm done.
I'm out of the business.

536
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:07,009
It's your fault, Marty!
You've ruined me.

537
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,812
Come on, Alex.
Do you honestly think

538
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,258
l intended all of this to happen?

539
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,191
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Is that what you want?

540
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,484
Okay, I'm...

541
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,109
He just shushed me.

542
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,101
Marty, look, you've got
to be just a little bit more und...

543
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,484
- Don't you shush me.
- Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?

544
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,408
- hear it now.
- Where there's music, there's people.

545
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,111
- Go to the head honcho.
- A sidewalk would be nice.

546
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,870
Yeah, what a dump.

547
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,125
They should call it
the San Di-lame-o Zoo.

548
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:44,041
First they tell you, "We got this great
open plan thing. Let animals run wild."

549
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,903
Next thing, flowers in your hair,
everybody's hugging everybody.

550
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:51,373
This place kind of grows on you.
This way, guys! Come on!

551
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,694
What the...?

552
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,605
Oh, no!

553
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:21,687
Okay, let's make
a good impression on the people.

554
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:24,777
Smiles, everyone.
Let's get it together.

555
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,286
- ls that the best you can do?
- Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.

556
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,807
Well, great. Let's make gas look good.

557
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,964
- Wow!
- It's not people. It's animals.

558
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,578
California animals. Dude.

559
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,485
This is like a Puffy party.

560
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,541
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

561
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,791
- Ya like to
- Move it

562
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,180
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

563
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,230
I like to move it, move it

564
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,299
- Ya like to
- Move it

565
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,544
I like to move it, move it
You like to move it, move it

566
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,541
She like to move it, move it

567
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,163
- He like to
- Move it

568
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,704
All girls all over the world

569
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,964
Original King Julien
‘pon yer case, man

570
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,419
I love how all the girls
that love to move their body

571
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,650
When ya move your body, ya do

572
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,809
Move it nice
and sweet and sassy, all right

573
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,532
What kind of zoo is this?

574
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,734
I just saw 26 blatant
health code violations.

575
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:28,901
I'm loving San Diego.
This place is off the chizain.

576
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,277
Twenty-seven.

577
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,726
Woman, physically fit, physically fit

578
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:37,482
Physically, physically, physically fit
Physically fit, Physically fit

579
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,011
We should've brought chips and dip.

580
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,438
Wait.

581
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,999
Where's Alex? What happened to him?
He was right behind us. Wasn't he?

582
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,460
I don't know where he's at,
but he's missing one heck of a party.

583
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,423
The foosa!

584
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:51,932
The foosa!

585
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,570
The foosa are attacking!
Run for your lives!

586
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,313
- Foosa hungry.
- Foosa eat.

587
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:08,451
l hate spiderwebs.

588
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,486
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

589
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,599
Thanks for waiting up.
Really appreciate it.

590
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,421
Hey, hi. We just got in from New York,
and we're looking for a supervisor.

591
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,895
Because we've been sitting
on that beach back there for hours,

592
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,509
and nobody's even bothered to show up.

593
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,831
I don't know how things
are normally run around here,

594
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,058
but there's been some sort
of major screwup, which is cool.

595
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,911
So if you could point us towards
the administrative offices, we'll...

596
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,317
Well, howdy-do.

597
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,733
Spider! Spider! Spider on my back!

598
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,812
Maurice, did you see that?

599
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,222
He scared the foosa away.

600
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,399
Come on, Gloria. Get it.

601
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,337
Get it! Get it! Get it!

602
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,981
- That's it! Smack it!
- Get it, get it!

603
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,273
Whip it! Whip it good!
Where'd it go?

604
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:08,299
King Julien, what are they?
What are they?!

605
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,240
They are aliens. Savage aliens
from the savage future.

606
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,838
They've come to kill us. And take
our women. And our precious metals.

607
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,700
Get up, Mort. Do not
be near the king's feet, okay?

608
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:27,349
We're hiding. Be quiet,
everyone. Including me.

609
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,352
Who's making that noise?

610
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:30,684
Oh, it's me again.

611
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,862
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!

612
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,104
- Enough! Enough with the stick.
- [ think she got it.

613
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,714
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.

614
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,024
It's okay. It's gone.

615
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,562
They are savages.

616
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,028
Tonight we die.

617
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,970
The feet. I told you...
I told you to... I told every...

618
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,089
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

619
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,235
He did tell you about the feet.

620
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,683
- Wait. I have a plan.
- Really?

621
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,209
l have devised a cunning test

622
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,845
to see whether
these are savage killers.

623
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:11,658
Hi there.

624
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:15,893
You let me handle it.
Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.

625
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,092
Hi there.

626
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,144
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

627
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:32,153
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
- Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay.

628
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,950
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.
Oh, jeez!

629
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,284
- Aw, Alex!
- Oh, you poor little baby.

630
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,984
Did that big mean lion scare you?

631
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:49,276
He did? He's a big,
bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

632
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:52,661
Come on. Mamai'll hold you.
Aww, look at you.

633
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,137
They are so cute
from a reasonable distance.

634
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,386
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

635
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,574
They're just a bunch of pansies.

636
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,131
I don't know.

637
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,912
There's something
about that one with the crazy hairdo

638
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,202
that I find suspicious.

639
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,904
Nonsense, Maurice.

640
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:14,739
Come on, everybody.
Let's go and meet the pansies!

641
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,978
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien XIll,

642
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,678
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,
et cetera. Hooray, everybody.

643
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,308
He's got style.

644
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,530
What is he, like,
king of the guinea pigs?

645
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,134
I think it's a squirrel.

646
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,160
Welcome, giant pansies.

647
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,078
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

648
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,592
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep. Squirrel.

649
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:07,765
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the foosa.

650
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,169
- The "whossa"?
- The foosa.

651
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:14,021
They annoy us by trespassing,
interrupting our parties

652
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,265
- and ripping our limbs off.
- Good.

653
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,197
We're just trying to find out
where the people are, so...

654
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,507
What big teeth you have. Man!

655
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,589
Shame on you, Maurice. Can you not
see that you have insulted the freak?

656
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,930
You must tell me,
who the heck are you?

657
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,913
I'm Alex. The Alex.
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

658
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,354
And just where are you giants from?

659
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,661
We're from New York and...

660
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,419
All hail the New York giants!

661
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,749
New York giants!

662
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,287
Is this some sort of
inbreeding program?

663
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:51,352
Il say we just got to ask these
bozos where the people are.

664
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:54,732
Excuse me. We bozos
have the people, of course.

665
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,956
Hey, the bozos have the people.

666
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:01,476
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

667
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,206
They're up there.

668
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,745
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch, though.

669
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,282
Wow.

670
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,919
So do you have any live people?

671
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:17,904
No. Only dead ones.

672
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,806
l mean, if we had
a lot of live people here,

673
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:24,362
it wouldn't be called
the wild, would it?

674
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,009
The wild?

675
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,957
Whoa. Hold up there
a second, fuzzbucket.

676
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,577
You mean, like,

677
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,857
the "live in a mud hut, wipe
yourself with a leaf" type wild?

678
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,760
- Who wipes?
- Oy vey.

679
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,669
- Oy vey!
- Oy vey, everybody!

680
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,651
Oy vey!

681
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,033
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

682
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,596
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!

683
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,600
- Help!
- What are you doing?!

684
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,868
I'm swimming back to New York.

685
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,865
I know my chances are slim,
but I have to try!

686
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:03,401
- You can't swim!
- l said my chances are slim!

687
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:08,158
Nature! It's all over me!
Get it off! can't see! I can't see!

688
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,118
Il can see!

689
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:16,251
Look. There's obviously
just been a little mistake.

690
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,971
The people didn't
dump us here on purpose.

691
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:23,047
As soon as they realize what happened,
they'll come looking for us, right?

692
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:24,618
Yeah, right.

693
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:28,369
I don't know the words
But we're born free

694
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:32,063
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way.

695
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,819
Well, boys, it's going
to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

696
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,677
Rico.

697
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:54,158
Well, since I'm doomed
to die on this forsaken island,

698
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,745
], Melman Mankiewicz,

699
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,054
being of sound mind
and unsound body,

700
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,221
have divided my estate
equally among the three of you.

701
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,090
Sorry, Alex.

702
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:11,404
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

703
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,713
No, it's not a latrine.

704
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:17,761
It's a grave. You sent Melman
to his grave. Are you happy?

705
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,519
Aw, come on.

706
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,770
This isn't the end.
This is a whole new beginning.

707
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,243
This could be the best that's happened.

708
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,370
No. No. No. No.

709
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:31,642
No. No. No. No. No. No. This is not
the best thing that's happened to us.

710
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:35,692
You abused the power of the birthday
wish and brought bad luck on all of us.

711
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,514
Why'd you tell your wish?
You're not supposed to.

712
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,212
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

713
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:44,676
- You guys made me tell you.
- Oh, okay.

714
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:48,395
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

715
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,403
Look around. There's no fences,
no schedules.

716
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:53,986
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

717
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:56,571
Okay. Okay. I've had enough of this.

718
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:01,294
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

719
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,328
That is the bad side,
where you can prance and skip

720
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:07,799
like a magical pixie horse
and do whatever the heck you want.

721
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:11,779
This is the good side for those who
love New York and care about going home.

722
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,765
- Come on.
- No, no. Back! Back!

723
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,722
You know what? This isn't good.

724
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:20,817
Okay! You all have your side,
and I'll have mine.

725
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:23,932
And if you need me,
I'll be over here,

726
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,808
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

727
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,692
This is the fun side,

728
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,854
where we'll have a great time
surviving until we go home.

729
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:35,724
- A yabbadabbado old time!
- This side's the best.

730
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,227
That side stinks! You're on
the Jersey side of this cesspool!

731
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,690
- Wilma!
- Now what do we do?

732
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:44,173
Don't worry. I have
a plan to get us rescued.

733
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:50,214
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this.

734
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:57,181
Just look at him.
He's helpless without us.

735
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:08,551
Shut up, Spalding.

736
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:16,554
I've been standing
here for hours, man.

737
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,341
How long do I have
to pose like this?

738
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,578
She is finito.

739
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:27,108
I defy any rescue boat
within a million miles

740
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:29,455
to miss this baby.

741
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,470
When the moment is right,
we will ignite the beacon of liberty

742
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:37,331
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!

743
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,485
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

744
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:43,585
- How's the liberty fire going, Melman?
- Great. Idiot.

745
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,337
I heard that.

746
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,876
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

747
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,010
That's wild fire. We're not
using wild fire on Lady Liberty.

748
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:56,091
- Now, rub, Melman.
- I've been doing...

749
00:47:56,507 --> 00:48:00,547
I can't. l can't.
I can't do it. I ju... l can't do it!

750
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,440
Fire.

751
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:05,652
Fire.

752
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,251
Fire! Fire!

753
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:14,511
Oh, my

754
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,186
Fire!

755
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,033
Not yet! No, no! No!

756
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:19,639
Fire!

757
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,157
Melman, hold still!

758
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,846
Jump! Alex, jump!

759
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:26,125
Don't worry,
cats always land on their...

760
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,925
Face? Man,
what kind of cat are you?

761
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,619
You maniac!

762
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,154
You burned it up!

763
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,531
Darn you!

764
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,343
Darn you all to heck!

765
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,993
Can we go to the fun side now?

766
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:55,283
Everybody, calm down.
Come on. Into your chairs.

767
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,193
Everybody, calm down.
Let go of his tail.

768
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,806
Separate those two,
would you, please?

769
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,688
You here, you there. Everyone...

770
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:06,124
Calm down, people, okay?

771
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,294
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

772
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,661
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
Hooray. Let's go.

773
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,518
Now, everybody,

774
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,916
we all have great curiosity
about our guests, the New York giants.

775
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,228
- Yes, Willie?
- like them.

776
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:26,006
I like them. I liked them first.
Before ! even met them I liked them.

777
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:29,874
I liked them right away. You hate
them compared to how much I like them.

778
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,390
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

779
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,644
Now, for as long
as we can remember,

780
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:41,327
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded foosa.

781
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,348
The foosa! The foosa are attacking!

782
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,342
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

783
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,151
Please. Maurice.

784
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,974
Quiet!

785
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:58,919
Come on, y‘all. They're not
attacking us this very instant.

786
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,928
So my genius plan is this:

787
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,511
We will make the New York giants

788
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:09,421
our friends and keep them close.

789
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,740
Then, with Mr. Alex protecting us,

790
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,170
we will be safe
and never have to worry

791
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:19,987
about the dreaded foosa ever again.

792
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:26,296
I thought of that.
I thought of that. Yes. Me. I did.

793
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,257
Hold on, everybody. Hold on.
I'm just thinking now.

794
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,149
I mean, does anyone
wonder why the foosa

795
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,843
were so scared of Mr. Alex?

796
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,102
l mean,
maybe we should be scared too.

797
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,259
What if Mr. Alex
is even worse than the foosa?

798
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,942
I tell you, that dude just
gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

799
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,600
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

800
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:52,259
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

801
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,848
Does anyone else
have the heebie-jeebies?

802
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,424
No? Good. So shut up.

803
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,684
When the New York giants wake up,

804
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:08,073
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise.

805
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:12,154
Now, who would like a cookie?

806
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:41,341
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time.

807
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:44,249
There's room
on the fun side for one more.

808
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,065
No, thanks.

809
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:49,997
Look, I've been thinking.
Maybe if you gave this place a chance,

810
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,204
I don't know, you might
even enjoy yourself.

811
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:56,683
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

812
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:58,851
I just want to go home.

813
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,760
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

814
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,705
It really isn't
the fun side without you.

815
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,303
I know. And then...

816
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,319
- It's him.
- Who is it?

817
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,981
It's the pizza man.
Who the heck do you think it is?

818
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,798
Yes? Can I help you?

819
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:39,128
Can I come to the fun side?

820
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:42,922
Beg your pardon?

821
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,787
You know, I've been kind of a jerk.

822
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:52,158
But I've been thinking
about what you said, and I'm sorry.

823
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,230
Welcome to Casa del Wild.
Take a load off.

824
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,477
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

825
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:14,388
- Alex!
- Mi casa is su casa.

826
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,109
Very impressive.

827
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,057
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house.

828
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,315
This is seawater.

829
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:33,914
Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plumbing's done.

830
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:36,145
Hey, y'all look hungry.

831
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,774
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?

832
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,711
You have food?

833
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,566
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

834
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,403
Seaweed on a stick.

835
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,096
Seaweed?

836
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:53,351
On a stick.
Don't love it till you try it.

837
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,942
That's unbelievable.

838
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,418
- So good.
- Well, thanks.

839
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,264
It does kind of hit the spot,
doesn't it?

840
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,454
Well, maybe it could
use a little lemon.

841
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:21,601
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

842
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,742
Oh, but it does.

843
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:25,968
Check this out.

844
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:34,948
Wow. Would you look at that.

845
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:39,455
It's like billions
and billions of helicopters.

846
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:42,187
It's a shooting star.
Make a wish. Quick!

847
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:45,326
Ooh! How about a thick, juicy steak?

848
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,123
You know what, Alex?

849
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:51,484
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

850
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,261
Thanks, Marty.

851
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,180
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

852
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,767
I think I'm going to
hit the sack too.

853
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,769
Sweet dreams, everyone.

854
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:32,525
Alex.

855
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,192
What are you doing?

856
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:49,192
Twenty-seven, 28, 29.
Thirty black and only 29 white.

857
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,303
Looks like you're black
with white stripes after all.

858
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,056
Dilemma solved. Good night.

859
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:08,062
You see, Maurice,
Mr. Alex was grooming his friend.

860
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,585
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.

861
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:14,649
How can you have the
heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex?

862
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:18,292
Look at him.
He's so cute and plushy.

863
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:21,029
I don't think he was grooming him.

864
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,581
Look more like
he was tasting him to me.

865
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:26,877
Suit yourself, no matter.
I don't care.

866
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:31,011
Soon we will put my
excellent plan to action.

867
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,988
All we have to do is wait

868
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,611
until they are deep in their sleep.

869
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,314
How long is this going to take?!

870
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,356
Well, this sucks!

871
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:18,129
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

872
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,823
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

873
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,319
Rise and shining.

874
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,418
Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex!

875
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,168
Wake up! Alex!

876
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,960
You suck your thumb?

877
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:36,431
Where are we?
What the heck is going on?

878
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,810
Where's the beach?
Take it easy.

879
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,786
- Who built a forest?
- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

880
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,275
While you were asleep,

881
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:47,153
we simply took you
to our little corner of heaven.

882
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:49,721
Welcome to Madagascar.

883
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,317
- Mada-who-ah?
- What?

884
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:54,783
No, not whooha. Ascar.

885
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:04,203
Marty. It's...

886
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,731
Just like my mural back at the zoo.

887
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:10,777
Oh, no, fella, that is
the real deal right there.

888
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:13,165
Look at that, that's not a bad view.

889
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,919
That's the thing that you were always
looking at, but it's actually there.

890
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,517
- That's the real version of...
- How about once around the park?

891
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:24,028
Let's get our blood pumping,
lungs breathing this fresh air.

892
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,731
Who's with me?!

893
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,139
Naw. I don't think I could...
You're it!

894
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,905
Hey! Want to play around?

895
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,392
Got you there!

896
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,810
Come here!

897
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,395
You're it.

898
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:39,013
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

899
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,200
Okay, Marty, I'm it.

900
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:44,776
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

901
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:47,345
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

902
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,394
l haven't eaten in two days.

903
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,443
My blood sugar's real low.
I just don't have the energy.

904
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,536
I don't think that's your problem.

905
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,201
First of all, that's not
how you run in the wild.

906
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,364
Let's go. Put the rubber to the road!

907
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,386
You just have
to let out that inner lion.

908
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,725
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

909
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,988
You are, that's who.
Come on! Here we go!

910
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:10,905
That's it. Let's build up
some steam! You the cat.

911
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:12,714
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

912
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,383
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

913
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,810
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

914
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:21,951
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

915
00:59:23,794 --> 00:59:25,374
I'm the cat!

916
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,691
Surprise!

917
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:41,717
You're it. You're it!

918
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,998
Can't juke the cat. Cat's too quick.

919
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:51,940
l feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

920
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,250
- Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

921
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,136
Man! I feel different.

922
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,436
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

923
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:13,208
Kind of charged up or something.

924
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:16,003
- Like you said, baby, it's...
- Crackalacking.

925
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:20,313
- Ain't that right, Melman?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

926
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,923
I'm in heaven.

927
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:29,528
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend
and the foosas are nowhere to be seen.

928
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,743
It could be said
that my plan is working

929
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:36,063
in a very good working kind of way.

930
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:39,283
Alex. You got to try some of this.

931
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,474
I feel good.
Feel like a king again.

932
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:45,628
King?

933
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,156
You should see his act.

934
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:51,255
Come on, Alex, why don't you
show him some of your act.

935
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:54,265
Oh. No, I really
don't think I could... Okay.

936
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,554
Ladies and gentlemen.
Primates of all ages.

937
01:00:58,054 --> 01:00:59,924
The wild proudly presents:

938
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,513
The king.

939
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,218
Alex the lion!

940
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:06,672
E flat, fellas.

941
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:18,673
Yeah! The king is in the house!

942
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:22,475
See, if he is the king, then where
is his crown? I've got a crown.

943
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,763
Got a very nice one.
And it's here on my head.

944
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,946
Look at it. Have I got it on?

945
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,237
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

946
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,560
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

947
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,995
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

948
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:49,884
Break out the wave!

949
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,833
Excuse me.

950
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:21,129
You're biting my butt.

951
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:25,877
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

952
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,918
- What did you do?
- You just bit me!

953
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,147
No. I didn't. Did I?

954
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:33,852
You kind of did.

955
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,987
What the heck is wrong with you?

956
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:39,098
Why'd you bite me?

957
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,782
- Man, it's because you are his dinner.
- What?!

958
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:44,182
- Excuse me?
- That's dumb.

959
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:48,447
Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple
bite on the buttocks among friends?

960
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,705
Here, give me a nibble.

961
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:54,251
The party is over, Julien.
Your brilliant plan has failed.

962
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,321
What are you talking about?

963
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,129
Your friend here is what we call

964
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:01,155
a deluxe-model hunting
and eating machine.

965
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,310
And he eats steak...

966
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,903
. which is you.

967
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:08,838
- Get out of here.
- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

968
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:11,029
The plan failed.

969
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:14,191
All is lost! We're all doomed.

970
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:18,877
The foosas will come back and
gobble us with their mouths because...

971
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,609
...we are all steak.

972
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,605
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

973
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,860
Mr. Alex cannot stay here.

974
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:30,012
He belongs with his own kind
on the foosa side of the island.

975
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,277
By the power vested in me,

976
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:35,475
by the law of the jungle,
blah, blah, blah, blah...

977
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:36,965
Be gone!

978
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,669
What? Come on, do! look
like a steak to you?

979
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,163
Yeah!

980
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,934
See, I told you I don't
look like a... Wait. What you say?

981
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,464
Oh, yeah!

982
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:51,417
- He's going savage.
- Run for your lives.

983
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,323
Marty, run!

984
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:15,696
A bull's eye.
Excellent shot, Maurice.

985
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:17,079
Thank you.

986
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:23,702
Marty?

987
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:27,966
I'm so sorry, Marty.

988
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,132
What is wrong with me?

989
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,588
Ow.

990
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:39,520
Oh, no.

991
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,269
What have I done?

992
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,263
It's true. I'm a monster.

993
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,444
I got to get out of here.

994
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:01,241
What have I done?
This is a nightmare.

995
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:03,238
And it's all my fault.

996
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,130
Now, because of me,
we've lost Alex.

997
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:08,016
Well, what are we going to do?

998
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:10,631
Weill find a way to help him.
That's what we'll do.

999
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:11,897
Okay.

1000
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:14,495
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?

1001
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:16,888
We're tough.
We're gritty.

1002
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:18,753
We're adaptable!

1003
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,615
And we are not going
to lay down like a bunch of Melmans.

1004
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,208
No, we're not.

1005
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:25,684
Oh. Gloria.

1006
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:28,659
That was not me, okay?
That was the boat.

1007
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,048
- The boat!
- The boat?

1008
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:34,891
The boat's come back for us!
Come on, guys, we got to flag it down.

1009
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,390
There it is!

1010
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:40,288
- Hey, over here!
- Over here!

1011
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:41,880
Over here! Yo!

1012
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,495
Melman, give me a lift.
Hurry up! Lift me up!

1013
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,124
Help! Help! Help!

1014
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,852
- Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.
- Over here!

1015
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:52,545
- Melman! Steady. This way!
- You have no idea how much this hurts.

1016
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,709
Hey, boat! We're over here!

1017
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:00,772
Look! It's turning! It's coming back!
It's coming back!

1018
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:03,364
Come on! Come on, baby!

1019
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,270
Yes! You guys.

1020
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,569
You flag down that boat.
I'll get Alex.

1021
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,408
Whoa! Hold on there.

1022
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,931
You cannot go back there by yourself.

1023
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,340
Aw, come on. I know Alex.

1024
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:19,123
He hears we're rescued,
he'll snap right out of it.

1025
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:21,669
The people are coming.
They can help us.

1026
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:24,661
Melman's right. The people
will Know what to do.

1027
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,060
Now, we got to flag down that boat.

1028
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,062
Now, this is more like it.

1029
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:51,417
You?! Oh, ma...
Where are the people?

1030
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,594
We killed them and ate their livers.

1031
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,038
Got you, didn't I?

1032
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,610
Just kidding, doll,
the people are fine.

1033
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:02,966
They're on a slow lifeboat to China.

1034
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,452
Hey, I Know you two.

1035
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:09,707
Where's that psychotic lion
and our monochromatic friend?

1036
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,792
Marty? He's righ... Where did
he go? He was right behind us.

1037
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,480
He went back for Alex.
He's going to get himself killed!

1038
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,767
Well, boys, our
monochromatic friend's in danger.

1039
01:09:21,224 --> 01:09:22,894
Looks like we have a job to do.

1040
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,712
Captain's log: Embarking
into hostile environment.

1041
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:29,229
Kowalski. We'll need to win the
hearts and the minds of the natives.

1042
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,002
Rico. We'll need
special tactical equipment.

1043
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,648
We're going to face extreme peril.

1044
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,147
Private probably won't survive.

1045
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:46,767
Alex! Come out, Alex!

1046
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,203
The boat's here! We can go home!

1047
01:09:55,992 --> 01:10:00,472
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1048
01:10:01,264 --> 01:10:05,304
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1049
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,022
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1050
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,719
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1051
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,472
Alex!

1052
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:17,516
Alex!

1053
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,839
Marty?

1054
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:24,394
Snap out of it, Alex. The boat
came back. We can get out of here.

1055
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:28,491
We can go back to civilization, and
everything will be like it used to be.

1056
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,368
Stay back.

1057
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,521
Please.

1058
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,496
I'm a monster.

1059
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,758
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

1060
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,955
We're a team.
You and me, remember?

1061
01:10:50,213 --> 01:10:52,083
I don't want to hurt you.

1062
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:25,353
Alex.

1063
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,458
l ain't leaving without you.

1064
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:46,403
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.

1065
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:50,379
It's a wonderful song.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

1066
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:55,577
Start spreadin' the news

1067
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,490
I'm leaving today

1068
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:05,204
We are a great big part of it

1069
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:11,870
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words.

1070
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,768
Please don't make me
sing this by myself.

1071
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,974
You really don't want
to hear me sing this by myself.

1072
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,224
Uh, Alex? Could you
come out here for a minute?

1073
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,761
Hey, Alex, a little help.

1074
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:31,282
Help me!

1075
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,445
Alex! Help!

1076
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:42,418
Help me! Anybody, help me! Somebody!

1077
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:45,768
Help!

1078
01:12:57,273 --> 01:12:58,673
- Melman?
- That's right, baby.

1079
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:01,613
Run!

1080
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,830
- What's the plan?
- This is the plan.

1081
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,548
- Foosa hungry.
- Foosa eat.

1082
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,777
This is the plan?

1083
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,259
Foosa halt.

1084
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,196
Foosa ooh.

1085
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,930
Foosa aaahh.

1086
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,539
Foosa ooh.

1087
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:26,447
Foosa aaahh.

1088
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,153
Come and get it.

1089
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,338
Foosa.

1090
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,852
- Take that.
- Foosa ow!

1091
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,294
There's too many of them, skipper.

1092
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:50,377
It's been a real pleasure
serving with you boys.

1093
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:58,579
Alex?

1094
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,195
That's my kill.

1095
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,635
Mine.

1096
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:09,003
Alex hungry.

1097
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:11,886
Alex eat.

1098
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,135
It's showtime.

1099
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:33,921
Thanks for not giving up on me.

1100
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:38,601
Man, you almost gave me a heart attack.
You can't just come sneak up on me.

1101
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,800
Just because you're a lion...
Let go of me. Let go of me.

1102
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:45,233
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

1103
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:47,525
Like I said, it's showtime.

1104
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,301
Mine.

1105
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:52,991
My kill.

1106
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,250
They're all mine.

1107
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,361
It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no!

1108
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,413
- Don't eat me!
- He's big and scary!

1109
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:05,722
Fear me! Savagery
beyond comprehension.

1110
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:09,682
- lam far too young to die!
- You're a monster! A monster, I say!

1111
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,428
- And, you!
- Me?

1112
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:21,032
Oh, you want some of this? Ooh!
You better run for your lives.

1113
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,768
- Somebody call a cop!
- He's psychotic!

1114
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,624
This is my territory.
Understand?

1115
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:39,668
I never, ever want
to see you on my turf again.

1116
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:47,746
Boo.

1117
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,420
Yeah! You the cat!

1118
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,379
Got my boy back!

1119
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:58,316
I did it!

1120
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:02,094
Give me some love! The plan worked!
The plan worked! I'm very clever!

1121
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,588
I'm the one, baby! Come on.
Time to robot.

1122
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,962
lam very clever king.

1123
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:10,397
lam super genius.

1124
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,946
lam robot king of the monkey things.

1125
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,435
- Compute, compute.
- So, what's for lunch?

1126
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,941
- Close those eyes.
- Why do I have to?

1127
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,533
- Do it.
- They're closed.

1128
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,418
- Tighter.
- Yes, sir.

1129
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,233
- No peeking.
- They're closed.

1130
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,065
Rico.

1131
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,084
Hai.

1132
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:35,940
Open that hatch.

1133
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:39,246
Fire in the hole. Now chew.

1134
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,642
Chew like you mean it.
Savor it.

1135
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:45,349
- And?
- Well?

1136
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,274
Pretty good, right?

1137
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,679
There's always Plan B.

1138
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,340
This is better than steak.

1139
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,192
love it. I love it!

1140
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:57,228
The kitty loves the fishy.

1141
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:02,329
Well, I propose a toast.

1142
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:05,265
Now, he may be a pain
in the butt at times...

1143
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:07,558
And trust me, I know.

1144
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:10,260
But this cat proved
to me without a doubt

1145
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,799
that his heart
is bigger than his stomach.

1146
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:14,742
- To Alex.
- To Alex.

1147
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:23,641
Enough! Stop it!

1148
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,391
What do you think?
Should we head back to New York?

1149
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:31,034
I don't know. I mean,
this is your dream.

1150
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,163
You sure you want to leave?

1151
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,212
I don't care where we are.

1152
01:17:35,518 --> 01:17:38,418
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

1153
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:40,318
Well, in that case...

1154
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:43,369
Yo. Rico.
I'll take 300 orders to go.

1155
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:44,996
Hai.

1156
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:48,507
But before you leave,
l have an announcement to make.

1157
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,641
So shut up, everyone, please.
Thank you.

1158
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:56,077
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head,

1159
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:58,755
l have decided to thank you

1160
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,508
for bringing peace to our home.

1161
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:03,371
And to make you feel good,

1162
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:06,135
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift.

1163
01:18:06,549 --> 01:18:09,039
No, I couldn't. Really,
I can't take your crown.

1164
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,641
That's okay,
I've got a bigger crown.

1165
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,161
It's got a gecko on it.

1166
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:16,199
Look at him shake.
Go, Stevie, go!

1167
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:17,692
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1168
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,123
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1169
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,839
- So long!
- Bye-bye, now.

1170
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,496
- Arrivederci.
- Bye-bye.

1171
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:26,106
- Toodle-oo!
- See you later, crocodile.

1172
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:29,222
Maurice, my arm is tired.
Wave it for me.

1173
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,429
Faster, you naughty little monkey.

1174
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:35,735
By the time we get back to New York,
it'll be the middle of winter.

1175
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:37,992
So I was just thinking, why rush?

1176
01:18:38,314 --> 01:18:40,894
Maybe we could make
a few side stops along the way.

1177
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:43,427
- Maybe Paris.
- You just read my mind.

1178
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:45,926
- l was thinking Spain.
- Run with the bulls.

1179
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:48,718
- What about Fiji?
- Canada. Can we?

1180
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,764
Cheap meds.

1181
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,430
wouldn't even mind
coming back here sometime.

1182
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,879
- l could do that.
- You could say that again.

1183
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:58,875
- Skipper?
- lalways wanted to go to Australia.

1184
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:02,428
Don't you think we should tell
them that the boat's out of gas?

1185
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:03,928
Nah.

1186
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:07,569
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.
