1
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,241
Yeah!

2
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,136
On the 15th of May, in the jungle of Nool,

3
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,482
in the heat of the day,
in the cool of the pool,

4
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,972
he was splashing,
enjoying the jungle's great joys,

5
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,796
when Horton the Elephant
heard a small noise.

6
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,883
-Horton!
-Horton!

7
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,881
Good morning, class. Are you ready?

8
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,991
-Yeah!
-Jump on board!

9
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,737
Look out below!

10
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,539
Tommy's on board. Katie, you there?

11
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,078
Okay.

12
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,459
There it is.

13
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,451
This is one of the jungle's most
amazing creatures, the leaf bug.

14
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:29,165
In order to protect itself from predators,
it disguises itself as a leaf.

15
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,474
This one's got quite a grip.
Come on, little buddy.

16
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,255
Don't be shy.

17
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,200
I guess I was mistaken, kids.

18
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,692
There are obviously no leaf bugs
in this area. Even if...

19
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,712
No, they're on me!

20
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,806
I think I swallowed one!

21
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,075
Tommy! Pull it out!

22
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,793
Uh, okay.

23
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,652
Then humpfing a "humpf"
was a sour Kangaroo,

24
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,770
the type who's convinced
she knows better than you.

25
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,025
She made every law
and enforced every rule

26
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,353
as self-proclaimed
head of the jungle of Neal.

27
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,798
Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?

28
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,433
How many times have I told you that

29
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,561
the jungle is no place
to act like a wild animal.

30
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,962
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric.

31
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,891
And the children are learning
so much from him.

32
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,121
Learning to be a bunch
of harebrained half-wits!

33
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,327
And that's why my Rudy
is pouch-schooled.

34
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,484
So while Kangaree stood there,
-
sneering a sneer...

35
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,620
Horton, that was the best time
I've ever had in my life!

36
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:56,416
What are you gonna show us next?

37
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,061
..once again, the speck floated
right by Horton's ear.

38
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,513
Then he heard it again,
just a very faint yelp,

39
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,136
as if some tiny person
were calling for help.

40
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,372
And you know what he thought?

41
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,250
Why, he thought that
there must be someone

42
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,092
on top of that small speck of dust!

43
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,561
Or even a family, it just might be so,

44
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,347
a family with children
just starting to grow.

45
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,643
I want to live!

46
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,890
I gotta go. Katie, you're in charge!

47
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,637
Wait!

48
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,705
-Come back!
-Watch it!

49
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,707
One more! One more! One more!

50
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,027
-l hear someone coming!
-Give me those!

51
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,389
-Wait!
-Sound the alarm!

52
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,528
Excuse me. Pardon my stampede!

53
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,651
Sorry, Wickershams! I promise
I'm gonna clean all this up later!

54
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,555
Bring the ammo!

55
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,992
I love the smell of bananas in the morning.

56
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,346
Banana in the hole!

57
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,556
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!

58
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,734
I feel the diplomatic process
is beginning to break down.

59
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,287
There you are! I got you!

60
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,357
Hi, kids!

61
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,484
Wow.

62
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,652
There.

63
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,168
Now you're safe.

64
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,477
I know I heard you say something.
I just know it.

65
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,086
Where are you?

66
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,115
Horton!

67
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,433
Sorry!

68
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:50,035
I just... There was this speck,
and it called out for help.

69
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,010
-And I was...
-The speck called out for help?

70
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,393
Well, not the speck.
I mean, that's ridiculous.

71
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,528
Is that what you thought I meant?
No, the speck can't call out for help.

72
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,972
Come on, get real.

73
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,112
No, there's a tiny person on that speck
that needs my help.

74
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,323
Absurd. There aren't people that small!

75
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,036
Well, maybe they aren't small.

76
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,803
-Maybe we're big.
-Horton.

77
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,079
No, really, think about it.
What if there was someone way out there

78
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,317
looking down on our world right now?

79
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,686
And to them, we're the specks.

80
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,755
And then, maybe someone else
will come along and say,

81
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,181
“Oh, there can't be people that small",
and the first guy would say,

82
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,502
“Are you calling me a liar?”

83
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,111
And the second guy would say,
“If the shoe fits, wear it!"

84
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,680
And now the fists are flying,
and the first guy picks up a brick,

85
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,450
and you might want to zip up the pouch
for this next part.

86
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,459
“All right, fat boy,
you want some of this..."

87
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,834
-Horton!
-What?

88
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,166
There is nothing on that speck.

89
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,566
-But I heard.
-Did you?

90
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,907
Really? Oh, my.

91
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,967
Then how come I don't hear anything?

92
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,367
Well...

93
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:04,413
If you can't see, hear or feel something,

94
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,494
it doesn't exist.

95
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,496
And believing in tiny, imaginary people

96
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:13,666
is just not something we do or tolerate,

97
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,030
here in the jungle of Nool.

98
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,269
Really? Because I bet if I really tried,
I could find somebody who'd believe

99
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,406
-what I've been saying.
-You will do nothing of the sort.

100
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:27,169
You will not breathe a word of this lie
to anyone else, especially the children.

101
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:31,231
I do not want you poisoning their minds
with this nonsense.

102
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,885
Our community has standards, Horton.

103
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,901
If you want to remain a part of it,
l recommend you follow them.

104
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,467
Have a nice day.

105
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,306
All right, then,
I'll take that under advisement.

106
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,276
Certainly appreciate your input.

107
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,144
I don't understand. I know I heard you.

108
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,184
It was as plain as the nose on my face.

109
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,590
That's it. Maybe you can't hear me.

110
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:08,537
Of course! Your ears must be tiny.
I need to speak up.

111
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,401
Hello!

112
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,214
Now some people out there,
l think l know whe,

113
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,304
may find they agree
with that sour Kangaroo.

114
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,247
"There can't really be people
as small as a mite."

115
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,937
Well, there can, and there are,
because Horton was right.

116
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,673
Hello!

117
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,207
That single "hello" traveled
all the way down

118
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:51,327
to the speck, through the clouds,
until it found a small town.

119
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,291
A town known as Whoville,
for there lived the Whos,

120
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,678
feeling happy and safe,
knowing only good news,

121
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,285
unaware that their world
was a speck ona clover,

122
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,479
unaware that the sweet life
they knew might be over.

123
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,234
-Over!
-Under!

124
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,890
The Mayor of Whoville,
aman named McDedd,

125
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,526
was devoted and fair and a little bit odd.

126
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,157
The Mayor and his wife,
they had children to spare,

127
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,680
96 daughters, some here and some there.

128
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,398
96 girls to love, 96 girls to teach,

129
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,846
but the Mayor had only
a few seconds for each.

130
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,784
Daddy, I got better than best
on my Who-story test.

131
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,110
Who-story. l remember it well.

132
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,782
That's one of my girls.

133
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,887
-Hildy's been using my hairbrush!
-Holly's been using my hairbrush!

134
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,841
Look! Over there!

135
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,457
There. All better.

136
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:09,031
Can I please have a Who-phone, Dad?
Everyone else in my class has one.

137
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,229
Oh, really? Everyone?

138
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:15,950
I will think about it.

139
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,069
Daddy, look! Daddy, look!

140
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,129
Toof.

141
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,087
It's a "T-H", sweetheart. It's "tooth."

142
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,029
In Whoville tradition, unlike yours or mine,

143
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,812
the Mayor's oldest is next
in the Mayoral line.

144
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,355
And whe was the oldest?
To lead and stand tall?

145
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,526
lt was JoJo, his son,
the smallest Whe of all.

146
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:42,494
So, JoJo, what's shaking?
What's happening? What's the word?

147
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,333
Now, to you or to me, it's abundantly clear

148
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,449
that JoJo did not want his father’s career.

149
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,260
But the Mayor pressed forward,
completely deluded,

150
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,857
while JoJo just sat there in silence
and broeded.

151
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,334
Oh, JoJo!

152
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,723
-Hey, why does he get more time?
-That's not fair.

153
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,307
Son! Hey!

154
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,858
And why didn't he speak?

155
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,340
Well, 1 think that the lad was afraid
if he did, he might let down his dad.

156
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,955
You know what's awesome?

157
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,931
This is awesome.

158
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,239
Just look at the men and women
hanging on these walls.

159
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:30,111
You, my boy, are part of a family legacy
that spans centuries.

160
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,471
You know what?
Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville,

161
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,183
and your great-grandmother, that's right,

162
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,461
all the way down to your

163
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,962
great-great-great-great-not-so-great-

164
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,366
great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-

165
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,319
grandfather.

166
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,853
Someday I hope to join them.

167
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,616
Be one of the greats.

168
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,824
I tell you, JoJo, there is nothing
like being Mayor.

169
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,876
I get to sign resolutions,
approve ordinances, submit budgets,

170
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,604
and in the Edible Parade, I'm the one
sitting on top of the giant meatball.

171
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,254
Someday, that can be you, too, JoJo.

172
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:29,324
Someday you'll be the one wearing
the Mayoral Crest.

173
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,490
You just... You just need to...

174
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,939
You know what I mean?

175
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,855
Okay. Good chat.

176
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,064
I'm glad that we had this talk

177
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,239
that I'm continuing now by myself. Good.

178
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,074
There. That ought to be comfy.

179
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,163
Nothing wrong with this, Morton.
Nothing wrong with this.

180
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,273
Just you, me and the speck,
shooting the breeze.

181
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,849
We're a club. We're a group.
We can take a vote on the issues.

182
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:22,014
We can be a secret society that controls
the balance of power in the world.

183
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:23,872
-Horton.
-And no one else can join,

184
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,106
unless they wear funny hats.

185
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,141
Listen, Horton!

186
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,643
The Chair recognizes Brother Morton.

187
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,159
lam really happy you found
this speck and all,

188
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:41,177
but you might want to think
about keeping it to yourself.

189
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,435
What? Why?

190
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,827
Well, you're talking to a clover.
That doesn't look good.

191
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,560
You know what doesn't look good?

192
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,722
You talking about the speck
like the speck isn't even there.

193
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,795
The speck never said anything bad
about you.

194
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,942
But, hey! Good luck
with your illusion of superiority.

195
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,401
You know, the speck can think anything
it wants about me. It's a speck.

196
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,944
I see what's going on here.

197
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:14,457
Morton, no matter how tight
the speck and I get,

198
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,580
the speck could never replace you.

199
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,077
I'm only sad that I would have
to explain that, at this point.

200
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,854
Well, that's awesome, Horton.
That really helps.

201
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,405
Just try to keep this to yourself.

202
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,011
I'll see you later. Try.

203
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,586
Hey, Horton! What you got there?

204
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,264
What? Nothing!

205
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,729
We're not doing anything.

206
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,072
-We're totally alone.
-Who's "we"?

207
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,544
“We"? What? "We"? Did I say that?
I just... Oh.

208
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,425
No, I would never say that,
because that would imply that

209
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,953
I was with someone, and not alone.

210
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,985
Okay, seriously, you can't tell anybody.
I mean it.

211
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,845
If anybody finds out about this,
it could be very, very bad.

212
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,735
I'm not sure why.

213
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,919
We won't tell anyone.

214
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,407
And if we do,
we'll tell them not to tell anyone.

215
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,603
Perfect!

216
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,339
Okay, I'm taking a bath, right,

217
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,441
‘cause my skin gets kind of dry
and a little bit ashy.

218
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,200
While Horton came clean about
the speck that he'd found

219
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,566
and how he had saved it
when it nearly drowned,

220
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,488
the Mayor set off on his morning commute

221
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,647
and noticed things weren't quite
the same on his route.

222
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:35,013
But please don't blame Horton, for he
didn't know that a small bump above...

223
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,398
..and I dove in the water like this!

224
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,118
.. was a big bump below.

225
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,901
Hey, Joe, don't work too hard.

226
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:48,061
These luxury condos,
they don't build themselves.

227
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,161
Hey, look at that!
I guess they do build themselves.

228
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,777
Okay, that happened.

229
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,644
Now, the Mayor knew it was his job
to convey the unusual things

230
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,276
that he'd noticed that day,
but there was one problem.

231
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,424
Though his will was strong...

232
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,416
-You're late.
-Thank you, Miss Yelp.

233
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,848
. nothing in Whoeville
had ever gone wrong.

234
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,285
We have all that we need.
We need all that we've got.

235
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,419
We like it in Whoville. We like it a lot!

236
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,430
We're all very busy with
the Who-Centennial coming up,

237
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,370
so let's bring this meeting to order.

238
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,480
Mr. Mayor, I presume you
have some good news for us.

239
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,650
Well, it's news.

240
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,990
I don't know if we need to go labeling it
“good" or "bad" or anything like that.

241
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:47,215
The thing is, I have noticed
some odd goings-on in Whoville lately.

242
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,500
Good "odd goings-on"?

243
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,272
Well, you know, tremors,
clouds swirling in the sky.

244
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,372
And it seems to me, just to be safe,

245
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,245
we might want to consider
postponing the Who-Centennial.

246
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,038
Consider what?

247
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,936
Postponing the Who-Centennial.

248
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,212
What? Speak up, man!

249
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,285
Postponing the Who-Centennial! All right?

250
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,709
We are about to celebrate 100 years
of Whoville happiness and harmony,

251
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,331
and you want to postpone the celebration?

252
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,070
Well, what if Whoville’s not safe?

253
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,968
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville,

254
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:46,391
never has and never will,
you blathering boob!

255
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,114
The Who-Centennial will proceed
as planned!

256
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,518
The Mayor was merely being an idiot.

257
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,648
It will be all smiles from now on.

258
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:06,698
That hurt!

259
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,964
Girl, got 15,000 friends already.

260
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,040
What? What do you mean,
it don't look like me?

261
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,408
That looks just like me 10 years ago.
Wait a minute. Hold on for a second.

262
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,941
Treats me like an idiot. 1 am not an idiot.

263
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,466
Do I look like an idiot?

264
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,853
-You don't want me to answer that.
-l am not an idiot.

265
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,080
Has the nerve to call me a boob?
I would never call somebody a boob.

266
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,441
He's a boob! Look at you.

267
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,320
Yuck!

268
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,355
Look at your face.

269
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:48,414
And I bet you don't look so good
with a stapler in your head!

270
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,588
Whoa! Whoa.

271
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,920
-Thank you, Miss Yelp.
-You're welcome.

272
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:09,791
Hello?

273
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:13,371
Who said that? Back off! I'll punch you!

274
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,536
Hello?

275
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,900
Hello.

276
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,581
Who's there?

277
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,257
This is the Mayor.

278
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,962
The Mayor? The Mayor!

279
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,898
I'm talking to the Mayor!

280
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,996
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
I knew there was life on this speck.

281
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,516
“This speck"? What speck?

282
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:57,081
Well, I don't exactly know
how to tell you this, but...

283
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,867
You're living on a speck.

284
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:05,317
Well, l hate to disagree with you,
O voice from the drainpipe,

285
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,701
but I live in Whoville.

286
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,284
Well, then, Whoville's a speck.

287
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:11,553
Right.

288
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,247
Okay, seriously, who is this?

289
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,364
Is this Burt from accounting?

290
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,210
No. This is Horton. I'm an elephant.

291
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,576
Okay, “Horton.”

292
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,089
Fake name. Where are you?

293
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:31,128
Well, from where you're standing,
f guess I'm in the sky.

294
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,781
Compared to you, I'm enormous.

295
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,296
Which is saying something,
because I've slimmed down quite a bit.

296
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,794
I swim.

297
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:42,204
Your whole world fits on a flower
in my world.

298
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,418
Oh, man, this is even pushing it
for you, Burt.

299
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,601
Don't believe me? Watch what happens
when I put you in the shade.

300
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,021
This is absolutely impossible...

301
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,417
Dark.

302
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,495
Light.

303
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,154
Dark.

304
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,875
Light. Dark, light, dark, light,
dark, light, dark.

305
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,520
Light!

306
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,469
Don't you see?

307
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:08,941
We're in the middle of some kind of
- -
amazing cosmic convergence.

308
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:13,802
Two vastly different worlds,
miraculously crossing paths!

309
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,806
Mine, colossal! Yours, miniscule.

310
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,649
Yet somehow we've managed
to make contact.

311
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,822
if you think about it, it's pretty amazing.

312
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,999
Is everything okay down there?

313
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,206
I don't know. You tell me.
You're the one holding the speck.

314
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,724
I'm the one holding the speck.

315
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,787
I'm the one holding the speck.

316
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:42,446
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.

317
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,436
Hold, please!

318
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,937
What did all of this mean?
The Mayor hadn't a clue.

319
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,140
So he ran to the office of Dr. Larue,
the brainiest brain on the staff at Whe U.

320
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,032
Dr. Larue!

321
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,611
This is crazy.

322
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,270
Mr. Mayor.

323
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,167
How may I be of assistance?

324
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,662
I don't know. Hey, you know,
I was just wondering

325
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:13,231
if our world were, say, a tiny speck
floating through space,

326
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,779
how would we know?

327
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,533
Well, why would you ask
something like that?

328
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,658
No reason. No reason at all.
I don't even remember.

329
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,962
Yes, 1 do. You know what?

330
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,021
Some guy was talking to me.

331
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,816
Not an elephant in the sky.
A guy on the ground.

332
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,306
There would be several ramifications.

333
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,304
Good ramifications?

334
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,734
A tiny speck?

335
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,357
Yeah. Tiny speck.

336
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,158
Floating around.

337
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:44,101
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors,
dramatic changes in the weather,

338
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:48,813
and if we didn't eventually achieve
some sort of stability,

339
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,451
our world would be destroyed!

340
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,349
Destroyed? Destroyed. Oh, destroyed.

341
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,610
Horton!

342
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,102
No, this is Benny.

343
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,302
Horton is busy right now.

344
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,425
No. I'm joking.

345
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,040
That's me.

346
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,196
We're doomed.

347
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:19,071
Listen, Horton, turns out
I need your help a little bit.

348
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,665
Apparently, if that speck
keeps moving around,

349
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,417
our whole world could be obliterated.

350
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,820
Sol need you to find us Whos
a safer, more stable home,

351
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,486
and fast.

352
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,496
No problem, Mr. Mayor. Let's see...

353
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,569
Wow, that's a nice view.

354
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,304
Hello. Is everything okay?

355
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,313
What's going on up there?

356
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,962
This entire jungle is a house of death!

357
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,349
Oh, wait. There's a good spot.

358
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,839
And it's then Horten saw
at the top of Mount Nool,

359
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,175
a small cave that looked peaceful
and quiet and coal,

360
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,362
where a sunflower grew proud and tall
from the ground.

361
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:30,472
There, he knew every Whe would be safe,
would be sound.

362
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,043
I found it, Mayor. The perfect place.

363
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,500
Right up there,

364
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,689
-on the top of Mount Neal.
-Mr. Mayor?

365
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,809
l wish you could...

366
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:43,848
Shiny.

367
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,727
The Who-Centennial Committee
is waiting for you

368
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,879
to look over the giant meatball
for the Edible Parade.

369
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,826
And then you're due at the dentist
for your Who-root canal.

370
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:57,963
You know, sticking "Who" in front
of everything doesn't make it hurt less.

371
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,244
Just wastes time!

372
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,156
I don't want to go.

373
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,369
Listen, Horton, I've gotta go.

374
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,547
Apparently, there's a problem
with the giant meatball.

375
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:13,013
You just take care of that meatball, sir,
and leave the freaking out to me.

376
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,341
So then Horton began
his long, perilous trek,

377
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,665
determined to save the small world
on the speck.

378
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,249
Horton was faithful and stalwart and kind.

379
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:24,959
I got you.

380
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,904
He was a brave here...

381
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,106
I'll protect you!

382
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,540
.at least in his mind.

383
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,088
We must become invisible. Travel silently.

384
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,001
For there are forces
that would seek to destroy us.

385
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,403
So you think you can sneak up
on me, huh?

386
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,485
It is clear that you are no match
for my technique.

387
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:56,177
I see you have mastered the way of the
snapping branch. Watch me tumble!

388
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,570
Morton Mouse, go!

389
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,418
You are fast, Horton,
but the Kangaroo has monkeys.

390
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,214
I will make monkeys of these monkeys.
It is their destiny.

391
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,187
More clover!

392
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,769
Horton is the greatest hero of them all!

393
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,115
-Horton!
-Morton!

394
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,253
Go!

395
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,746
But Mount Nool is that way.

396
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,023
To the top of Mount Nool!
As fast as lightning! Away, I go.

397
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,341
Sorry, little fellow.

398
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,844
You'll be fine. Just think healing thoughts.

399
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,521
-Horton! Look!
-Horton! Look, look, look!

400
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,619
We've all got our own clovers
with worlds on them!

401
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,098
Yeah.

402
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,665
In my world, everyone's a pony,

403
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,927
and they all eat rainbows
and poop butterflies.

404
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,119
That's beautiful, Katie.

405
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,379
In a really weird way.

406
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,254
My world is called Jessica-land,
and everyone worships Queen Jessica

407
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,221
because Jessica is so beautiful.

408
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,996
Jessica, that was awesome.

409
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,427
-Rudy!
-Mom, be careful!

410
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,848
My best friend Thidwick lives on that.

411
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,656
Rudy, no one lives on this.
It's not possible.

412
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,041
That Horton is a menace.

413
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,253
Mom, Mom! Please, you're so weird.
Don't do this to me.

414
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,965
Honey, go to your room.

415
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,370
Horton!

416
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,154
It's good!

417
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,075
What do you think you're doing?

418
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:37,737
You guys with worlds are in trouble!

419
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,693
-Have you forgotten what we discussed?
-Oh, no. I'm an elephant,

420
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,357
and elephants never forget.
It's a curse, really.

421
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,380
l remember I was on my head,
and you said “Humpf,"

422
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,108
and I looked up, and you said,
“What are you doing?"

423
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,490
And I said the thing about the speck.

424
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,554
Then you pulled my ears
and you poked me in the forehead...

425
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,633
-Horton!
-Well, you did.

426
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,675
Give me that clover, Horton. Now!

427
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,513
No.

428
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,151
No?

429
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,644
Yeah.

430
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,675
Are you sure you want to fight
this fight, Horton?

431
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:14,267
Because I promise you
it will get very ugly, very fast.

432
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,046
And you need to ask yourself,

433
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:20,429
“Dol really want
to put myself through all this?

434
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,722
“For a clover?”

435
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,688
Take it from me, Horton.

436
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,246
You don't.

437
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,308
So hand it over!

438
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,590
No! I can't give it to you.

439
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,286
There are people on this speck.

440
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,110
Granted, they're very small people,

441
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,917
but a person's a person,
no matter how small.

442
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:50,144
You just crossed the line, Horton,
and I'm gonna make you pay.

443
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,642
That Horton is a menace.

444
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,347
He has those kids using
their imaginations.

445
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,513
It's sick.

446
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,864
All right, gotta get this speck
up to the top of Mount Nool, ASAP,

447
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:11,622
whatever that means. Probably,
“Act Swiftly, Awesome Pachyderm.”

448
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,254
I mean, how hard can that be?

449
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,448
It's just a straight plummet
to certain death.

450
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,477
This looks kind of precarious.

451
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,811
Well, no need to worry.

452
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,161
Obviously, when they build a bridge
like this,

453
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,819
they take into account
that elephants will be crossing here.

454
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:43,521
All right. Feels good.
I'll just get the feel of it!

455
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,024
That's true.

456
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,774
Oh, God.

457
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,622
Hello. And how are we today, Mr. Mayor?

458
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,357
Say, "Ah."

459
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,283
Rinse, please.

460
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,625
I think a few of these boards could
stand to be replaced.

461
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,319
I just need to think light.
I'm light as a feather.

462
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,417
I'm light as a feather!

463
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,136
Heavy feather.

464
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,181
Okay, this will just pinch a little.

465
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:15,357
I'm lighter than a feather.
What's lighter than a feather?

466
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,708
Air! There's nothing lighter.
So it stands to reason

467
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,969
that the more air I have,

468
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,856
the lighter I'll be.

469
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:15,475
Next, please.

470
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,364
All right, that was absolutely terrifying.

471
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,590
If I just pull myself up!

472
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,974
Try not to panic.

473
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,350
That could've been a disaster.

474
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:55,236
Wow. I feel really good right now.
Maybe it's my new sense of purpose.

475
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,511
All right.

476
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,125
Hey, JoJo! I need your help.
Can you help me?

477
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:30,064
Okay, great. Okay.
First, ! need you to go to the girls' room.

478
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,735
Take down Hanna's china doll collection
and then...

479
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,080
Stop looking at my arm.

480
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,632
Put away Holly's light bulb collection,
and then...

481
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,707
You know what? Just take care of
anything that might break or shatter.

482
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,955
Okay, take a good long look.

483
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,371
Got it? Thanks, JoJo!

484
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,071
Here. And... Take that. And...

485
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,297
Hi. You're home late.

486
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:12,639
Sorry, hon. I was just having some
dental work done on my arm.

487
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,324
So, what was...

488
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:15,552
Ned!

489
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,049
What are you doing?

490
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,671
What do you mean?

491
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,719
Well, I'm no detective, Ned,
but you are hanging from the chandelier.

492
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,135
I just thought it might look better

493
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,303
somewhere it can't fall on us
and crush us in our sleep.

494
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,932
What is going on?

495
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:37,841
Hey, hon,

496
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,928
did you ever get the feeling
that you were being watched?

497
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,900
Yeah, sure. I suppose.

498
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,120
And then you get the feeling that
maybe that thing watching you is

499
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:56,623
a giant elephant?

500
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,319
And you know how
you get that weird feeling

501
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,375
that your world is actually a tiny speck?

502
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:09,328
And that the elephant that I talked about
earlier is carrying it around on a flower.

503
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:13,908
And you realize that if you tell anybody,
they'd think you were crazy.

504
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:18,625
But you still feel a responsibility
to keep everyone safe.

505
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,461
You know that feeling?

506
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,194
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.

507
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,473
Do you know that feeling?

508
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:31,932
No.

509
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:37,578
Yawn. Wow. I am beat.
Time to hit the hay, I guess.

510
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,346
Sweetheart, I know
you're under a lot of stress,

511
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:46,167
and if you're seeing elephants
and flowers, then fine.

512
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,511
Just don't tell anyone else
that story, okay?

513
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,591
And remember,
it's not the end of the world.

514
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,910
“The end of the world.”

515
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,022
Horton to Mayor. Horton to Mayor.
Come in, Mayor. Over.

516
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:04,821
Horton?

517
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,158
I get terrible reception here.

518
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,920
How about this?
If l get up real close, can you read me?

519
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,397
Yep! Roger that.

520
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,719
Are we at that safe place yet?

521
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,228
Almost. I'm pretty sure
the worst part's over.

522
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,341
This is your elephant speaking.

523
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,730
Just sit back, enjoy the ride, and
we'll have you to Mount Nool in no time.

524
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,997
No, you can't have ice cream for breakfast.

525
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,202
-Please.
-Please.

526
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:33,487
Who's that?

527
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,048
Is there someone else there?

528
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,236
Well, that's my wife and kids.

529
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,949
You have a family.

530
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:44,774
I do, indeed. A beautiful wife,
96 daughters, and one son.

531
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,123
Oh, busy guy.

532
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,975
And we all share one bathroom.
You know how that is.

533
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,565
Yeah. Don't I know it.

534
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,961
Bathroom?

535
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,540
-Ned!
-What?

536
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,984
Sweetheart, you know
you're on the roof, right?

537
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,458
-Please, Mom.
-What's that?

538
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,746
No, you need to go to bed.
Daddy's having a breakdown.

539
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,035
Ned, what are you up to now?

540
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:09,301
I was just about to put the kids to bed
when I got off the roof.

541
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,296
And that's what happened. Right.

542
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,797
-Daddy?
-Yes.

543
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,499
-Can I have a glass of water?
-Of course.

544
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,298
-Me, too.
-Me, three.

545
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:39,196
Me, 28.

546
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:40,424
Okay.

547
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,247
Hey, JoJo!

548
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,246
A lot of liquid. A lot of liquid.
Just the person I wanted to see.

549
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:57,130
Yeah, I realize that we have not
been seeing eye-to-eye lately,

550
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,522
and most of it is my fault.

551
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:00,757
It's true.

552
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,542
You know what I've been trying to do?

553
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,400
I have been trying to impose
my vision of your future on you.

554
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,612
Let me make this perfectly clear.

555
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:13,981
JoJo, you can be whatever
kind of Mayor you want to be.

556
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,889
Hands-on, strong and silent,
outspoken, it's up to you.

557
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,159
Well, good. I feel so much better.

558
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,156
lam expecting big things from you,
young man. Big things.

559
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,327
All right. Good night.

560
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,352
Good stuff. Good talk.

561
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,128
Then JoJo snuck out,
feeling lonely and sad,

562
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,155
and tragically misunderstood by his dad.

563
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:09,368
And where was he going
at such a late hour?

564
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,006
Up te Whoville's abandoned
Star-Studying Tower,

565
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:19,671
a place where the boy felt contented, free.

566
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,748
A place he could be what he wanted te be.

567
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,979
And what was inside there,
I'd say if 1 could.

568
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:31,696
But up above, the Kangaroo
was up to ne goed.

569
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,118
Can I come out now, Mom?

570
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,134
No, Rudy. Stay in your room.

571
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,361
-But, Mom...
-Stay inside.

572
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,948
Mr. Vladikoff?

573
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:13,283
Eating. Go.

574
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,281
Yes, l realize you're busy,
but I need your help.

575
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:19,466
It's Horton.

576
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,127
He's become obsessed with a clover.

577
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,663
And he actually thinks
there are little people on it.

578
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:30,375
I want that clover destroyed.

579
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,488
Sure. What a big deal this is for you, bro.

580
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:39,703
I'd do it myself, but being a lady,
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

581
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,502
But I hear you have no problem with that.

582
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:46,212
No.

583
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,314
No problem. Easy peazy.

584
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:53,261
But I will only do this for a price.

585
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,227
In exchange for a brand new pair of...

586
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:58,315
No.

587
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,800
This little kangaroo.

588
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,549
-Mom!
-Quiet, Rudy. Mommy's thinking it over.

589
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,558
Well, thanks, but on second thought,

590
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:13,955
I think I'm going to have
the Wickersham brothers

591
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,565
take care of this for me.

592
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,370
Yeah, of course, Wickersham.
I mean, they're a classy operation.

593
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,453
You know, they do... Wait! No!
You can't go with Wickersham!

594
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:25,583
No, no, no, the Wickershams would
be perfect for this job.

595
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:29,297
But they're monkeys! Is not scary!

596
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,144
Thanks, anyway. Maybe next time.

597
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,694
Wait!

598
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,999
Here is what I will do to precious clover.

599
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,372
I will take it, I will crush it,

600
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,339
and I will devour it.

601
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,119
Bigger than it look.

602
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:54,621
One second.

603
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:57,931
Holy moly.

604
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,483
Hang on.

605
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,481
Then I regurgitate it.

606
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,080
Then I'm going to devour it second time!

607
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:11,524
So, two times devoured.

608
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:16,136
Sounds nice, but I think
I'll talk to the Wickershams.

609
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:17,968
Wait!

610
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:20,833
Here is best part.

611
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:24,898
I do all gratis.

612
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,879
That's free, bro.

613
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,450
What do you think?

614
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,426
Deal.

615
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:38,092
Yes! Score. Thanking you.
You won't regret.

616
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:15,558
Mayor!

617
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,279
Mayor!

618
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,468
Open up, Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

619
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:24,713
It's snowing! In the summer!

620
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,084
Yes. Yes, it is.

621
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,356
It's a dramatic change in the weather,

622
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:36,972
as if we were a speck,
floating through space.

623
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:40,611
I don't know how you knew,
but somehow you did,

624
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:45,585
and Whoville is headed for disaster.

625
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:48,194
Horton.

626
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:49,435
What?

627
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:51,314
Nothing. I'm on it.

628
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,332
It's up to us to save
the people of Whoville.

629
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,199
You're small, but there are a lot of you!

630
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:03,583
That's it.

631
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,009
Okay, anybody else?

632
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,012
Good.

633
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:14,235
No, no. No enjoyment. This is not fun.
It is a sign of doom!

634
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:18,071
Aw, sweetie, that's...

635
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,619
No, no, no! Danger! Danger!

636
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,683
Stop having fun immediately!

637
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:28,157
This is dangerous! Okay!

638
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:32,192
Stop it!

639
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,037
Horton!

640
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,693
Hey, Mayor.

641
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:52,906
We're in big trouble down here.

642
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:55,597
It's happening!
It's snowing in the middle of summer.

643
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,413
It's the end of the world!

644
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:04,132
Hold on, Mayor.
I think I know what your problem is.

645
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,038
There. That better?

646
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,366
That seems to have worked.

647
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,134
Do I smell peanuts?

648
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:27,795
Yeah, they're my favorite snack,
but they tend to linger.

649
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,000
Finwick, no!

650
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:39,411
Hang on, Mr. Mayor.
I may have to put up a fight.

651
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,870
A frightened elephant can be
very dangerous!

652
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,623
All right!
You've called down the thunder, buddy!

653
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:50,197
You hungry for trouble? I'm an
“All you can eat" salad bar! Take a bite!

654
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,178
I hate running.

655
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,633
Morton!

656
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,887
Don't do that.

657
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,350
Horton!

658
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,832
Horton! There you are!

659
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:06,395
We got trouble! Wait, stay, wait!
Did you hear that?

660
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:11,381
No, I'm here, okay. Listen. No! Go!
Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.

661
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,606
She's telling everyone that
you should be kicked out of Nool.

662
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,448
She said that?
I thought we were her friends.

663
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:19,725
Word is she's gone to Vlad!

664
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,986
Vlad? Vlad? I know two Vlads.

665
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:27,004
Is it the bad Vlad
or the bunny Vlad that makes the cookies?

666
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:30,695
Yeah, Horton, she's sending you
a bunny with cookies.

667
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:33,782
I think we can assume it's the bad Vlad.

668
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,511
Yeah, that's a good call.

669
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:40,219
So unless you're cool
with giant, razor-sharp claws

670
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,191
ripping the flesh off your body,
I'd get rid of the clover!

671
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,345
I can't! promised the Mayor.

672
00:49:48,252 --> 00:49:50,422
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant,

673
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,071
and an elephant's faithful, 100%.

674
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:58,061
Please. For me, just this once.
Be faithful 99% of the time.

675
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:02,662
I've never gotten 99% on anything,
and I think I'm awesome! So, come on!

676
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,577
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant.

677
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,475
I'm not gonna say it.

678
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,470
You can do that all day,
it's not happening.

679
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:14,681
An elephant's faithful, 100%.

680
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:19,011
That's right. That's my code, my motto.
But thanks for the warning.

681
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,716
Motto. Okay.

682
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,692
But watch the skies.

683
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,831
Keep watching the skies!

684
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,755
Mayor, you need to get
everyone underground.

685
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:34,998
Now!

686
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,553
1 don't want to sound the alarm,

687
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,648
but there's a good possibility
we may be attacked

688
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,580
-by a giant carnivorous bird.
-What?

689
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,970
There's a small chance it could be a bunny
with cookies, but ! wouldn't count on it.

690
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,806
They are formidable.

691
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,830
Mayor? Are you there?

692
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,180
Yeah. No. That's a great idea. It's just...

693
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:59,309
In order to get everyone mobilized,
I'd need the okay of the City Council,

694
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:02,174
and they never listen to me.

695
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:04,373
I've been called a boob,

696
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,398
several times. I can't do it!

697
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,230
You have to talk to them, Mayor!
Okay. Listen.

698
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,312
Bad Vlad!

699
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:14,743
Bad Vlad!

700
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:16,906
Bad Vlad!

701
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,371
That is definitely not a bunny.

702
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:38,241
Lost him. Meant to lose him,
and I lost him. Good.

703
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,591
Is this tree for real? Come on!

704
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,499
Hang on, Whoville!
This is gonna get rough!

705
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,872
Now you're going to get it!

706
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,970
Get ready for the best!

707
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,328
Leave me alone!

708
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:15,802
Horton!

709
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,261
I just know he's gonna
jump out somewhere.

710
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,596
Hello.

711
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:52,495
Chess mate.

712
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:55,484
Now it's time for me to take clover

713
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:58,273
and crush all the little people on it,
who are saying...

714
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,702
Sorry. This is where we get off.

715
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:07,136
Right in the beak!

716
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,087
Cool line. Usually I can't think
of those things till later.

717
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,673
-Mayor?
-Horton.

718
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,221
Are you okay?

719
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:25,343
Well, more or less. What happened?
The bird?

720
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:29,506
Yeah, it attacked me.
Mayor, your people are in danger.

721
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,245
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

722
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,413
I'm going to go out there
and tell them what is going on.

723
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,814
Perfect. Now, quick. Get going.

724
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:46,989
Hey! Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!

725
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:50,194
-My basement's in the attic.
-The Science Museum is history.

726
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:54,031
-The lost and found is missing.
-What's going on, Mr. Mayor?

727
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,648
I'm declaring a state of emergency!

728
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,630
Don't worry! Don't worry!

729
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:02,354
The Mayor is just being a moron.

730
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:05,733
No, wait! Whoville is in terrible danger!

731
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,673
Everyone needs to get down to the
underground storage area immediately.

732
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,917
Fine! Fine!

733
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,529
Let's do this democratically.

734
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:18,823
Who wants the joy and glory and festivity

735
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:22,573
of the Who-Centennial
to proceed as planned?

736
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,037
Yeah!

737
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,543
And who, like the Mayor,

738
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:32,249
thinks it would be better
to spend the Who-Centennial

739
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:35,763
in an underground storage area?

740
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,150
Yeah!

741
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,643
Wait! You've gotta listen to me!

742
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:44,609
Our whole world could explode!

743
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,196
Much more quickly!

744
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,484
And our world wouldn't make that noise.

745
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,806
The people have spoken, Mr. Mayor.

746
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:03,116
You're finished. No one believes you.

747
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,537
No one supports you.

748
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:09,411
Horton believes me.

749
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,850
Horton?

750
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,919
Who's Horton?

751
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:19,451
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky!

752
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:21,918
Don't bother looking, he's invisible.

753
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,552
And he's the one risking his life
to get Whoville,

754
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:30,249
which, by the way,
is a speck on a clover, to safety!

755
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,662
I can prove it!

756
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:46,537
Horton's voice comes out of this horn.

757
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,415
Horton!

758
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,620
I have all the Whos
gathered in town square!

759
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,787
Let them know you're there!

760
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,153
Gee. This is kind of
a high-pressure situation, then.

761
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,067
Wow. l am really drawing a blank here.

762
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:10,606
I know!

763
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,048
Horton!

764
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,573
Horton, we're waiting!

765
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,533
Time to show everyone that you exist,

766
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:25,692
and by extension, what a non-boob I am.

767
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,266
Wait!

768
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:38,831
Everyone, look at the wind.
What do you think that that means?

769
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,657
It means...

770
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:44,332
It means, obviously...

771
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:48,282
Let the kite-flying race begin!

772
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,526
What a burn on you, Horton!

773
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,576
Brain freeze.

774
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:18,285
Give me back my speck!

775
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,442
Not this time, guy.

776
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:32,197
lam so sorry that I let you down,
but this... This is bigger than me.

777
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:35,723
Get the family together
and get somewhere safe.

778
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:39,207
I will! l believe you.

779
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,605
I've got you now, elephant.

780
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,090
No, no, no!

781
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,323
Oh, no!

782
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,322
Mayor?

783
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:35,481
Anybody there?

784
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:37,927
Hello?

785
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:40,286
Anyone?

786
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,968
But clover by clover by clover, he found

787
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:47,437
that the one he sought for
was just not around.

788
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:49,939
Mayor?

789
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:53,118
Hello?

790
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:56,482
And by noon, poor Horton,
more dead than alive,

791
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:00,773
had picked, searched and piled up 9,005.

792
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:03,469
Hello?

793
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:06,078
Sorry to bother you,

794
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:07,673
nobody.

795
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:12,651
Knock, knock.

796
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,347
This is where you'd say, "Who's there?"

797
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:20,658
if there were any Whos there.

798
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:24,856
Get it? "Whos there.”

799
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:32,321
All day he looked, looked on and on,

800
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,216
until his hope was almost gone.

801
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,630
No, no, no! Please, no!

802
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:42,698
This isn't fair!

803
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,717
But, wait, could this one be the one?

804
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,547
Was all his searching finally done?

805
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,383
Ah, yes, for this was the hour.

806
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,659
Horton had found them
on the three millionth flower.

807
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,266
Mayor! Mayor!

808
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,298
I found you!

809
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:07,533
Mayor?

810
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,374
Are you there?

811
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:10,843
Mayor?

812
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,085
Mayor.

813
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,950
Mayor, are you there?

814
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:29,448
Mayor!

815
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:36,489
Mayor?

816
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,449
Mayor?

817
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:45,543
Mayor!

818
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,810
No, this is Floyd.

819
01:01:57,414 --> 01:01:59,024
Can I take a message?

820
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:05,872
Mayor! You're okay!

821
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,368
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!

822
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:16,321
Sorry.

823
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,846
lt must have been rough down there.
l can't believe found you.

824
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,243
You really had me worried.

825
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,556
Say! The Mayor was right!

826
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,962
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

827
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,031
Okay, I'm all right, and so are you.

828
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,730
Citizens of Whoville!

829
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:44,814
I'd like you to meet our friend Horton.

830
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:51,198
He's going to help us!

831
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:54,990
I've got this.

832
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:57,194
This is the Chairman...

833
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,500
Idiot!

834
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,318
You're finished in this town!
Is that understood? Finished.

835
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,147
You boob!

836
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,580
I'm just joking.

837
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:12,348
Good one.

838
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,395
Horton, this is my wife Sally.

839
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:15,864
You exist!

840
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,236
This means my husband isn't crazy.

841
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,998
Hooray!

842
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:24,017
And a few of my daughters,
Haley, Holly, Hooly, Hilda and Hedy.

843
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,654
-Hi!
-Hi!

844
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:28,969
And here is Miss Yelp, my loyal assistant.

845
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:31,816
-And here's Dr. Larue.
-You saved us!

846
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,498
And Burt from accounting,

847
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:36,143
and Mrs. MeGillicuddy, and Mr. Farfoogan

848
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,245
from the Clugan Farfoogans,

849
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,098
and the old man in the bathtub.

850
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,933
Let's not overwhelm the poor fellow.

851
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,768
He's never gonna remember
all these names.

852
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:46,634
Well, I'll try my best.

853
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,944
Sally, Chairman,

854
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,257
Haley, Hooly, Holly, Hilda,
Hedy, Miss Yelp,

855
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:55,174
Dr. Larue, Burt from accounting,
Mrs. McGillicuddy, Mr. Farfoogan

856
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:59,258
of the Clugan Farfoogans,
and wasn't there an old guy in a shower?

857
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,009
Bathtub.

858
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,077
-Yeah!
-We're all here, Horton,

859
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:07,264
and we all believe in you.

860
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,291
Wow. That's awesome.

861
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:13,102
And it's a responsibility
I do not take lightly.

862
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:17,210
I promise you a future
that is safe, sound and stable.

863
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:22,446
We will create a world where every Who
is endowed with three inalienable rights,

864
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,593
to be determined at a later date.

865
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:30,509
And we will put a speck on Mount Nool
before the end of this decade.

866
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:40,751
This elephant is crazy! Oh, my goodness.

867
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:44,461
I gotta tell everybody.
I need to get to the Kangaroo.

868
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,587
Wait till they find out about...

869
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:51,291
You should have been seeing me.
I really let elephant have it.

870
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:55,978
I chase him, I torment him, I break him
into million little elephant pieces.

871
01:04:57,127 --> 01:05:00,527
It was thing of beauty, really.
My best work. Classic Vlad.

872
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,087
And the clover?

873
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:05,667
Clover is finished!
No way in million years Horton find it.

874
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:09,516
Read my beak. Clover is gone forever.

875
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,788
I just saw Horton,
and he is still talking to that clover!

876
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,213
Idiot!

877
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:28,584
Whoa! Come on, I'm your bro!
It's me you're talking to. We have history!

878
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,616
Come on, let's not forget,
I did this for free!

879
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,743
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?

880
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,477
There once was a time
when people were people

881
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,720
and specks were specks.

882
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:47,313
Well, l say, “If you can't see it,
hear it or feel it,

883
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,457
“it doesn't exist!"

884
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:53,127
Our way of life is under attack!

885
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:56,620
And who is leading that attack? Horton!

886
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:59,462
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

887
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,936
Wait a minute!
This is Horton we're talking about.

888
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,935
You all know him, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

889
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:09,111
Except for that fly city he sat on.
But he didn't do that on purpose.

890
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,099
Shut up, mouse!

891
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:15,572
That's weird. My brownies are burning.
I gotta go!

892
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:22,007
Are we going to let troublemakers like
Horton poison the minds of our children?

893
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:24,325
Not the children!

894
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:29,311
When Horton tells our children
about worlds beyond the jungle,

895
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,946
he makes them question authority!

896
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,862
Which leads to defiance!
Which leads to anarchy!

897
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,616
Yeah! Horton must pay!

898
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:40,317
It's that speck!

899
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:42,203
We have to do something!

900
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:43,702
For the children!

901
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,163
For the children!

902
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:49,741
Are we going to let him
get away with this?

903
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,186
No!

904
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,195
Let's go!

905
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:21,037
Morton! I told you! 100%!

906
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,127
Horton!

907
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,483
Morton, pick up your feet! Jeez.

908
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,215
It's not me!

909
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,689
I see. It's an angry mob. Sorry, Morton.

910
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:35,359
I thought it was you
that was making all the...

911
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:36,982
But it's...

912
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:38,717
Oh, darn.

913
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,700
Run, Horton!

914
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,102
There he is!

915
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:46,725
Let's rope him!

916
01:07:46,963 --> 01:07:48,393
Let's cage him!

917
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:52,625
No! No! No!

918
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:57,935
Stop!

919
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,476
Hey, fellas. Good to see you,

920
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,071
all at once.

921
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:04,803
You look really great as a horde.

922
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,831
Horton, Horton, Horton,

923
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,400
look at the mess
you've created for yourself.

924
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:14,234
All this hullabaloo over a silly little flower.

925
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,598
It's a speck.

926
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:21,450
Right. mean, it's silly, really,
all this talk of roping you,

927
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:25,971
and caging you, and, well,
we don't need to go into the details.

928
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:31,082
The point is, this angry mob,
all the trouble you're in,

929
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:33,587
it can all go away.

930
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:38,669
-Really?
-Of course.

931
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:43,992
All you have to do is admit to everyone
that there are no little people

932
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,296
living on that speck.

933
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,643
That you were wrong and I was right.

934
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:55,764
You do that and things can go right back
to the way they were.

935
01:08:57,033 --> 01:09:02,573
But if you don't, you're going to
have to pay the price.

936
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:13,354
So, I just have to say it isn't true?

937
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:22,484
Go ahead. Rope me, cage me.
Do whatever you want.

938
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:25,176
But there are people on this speck.

939
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:29,478
And they have a Mayor, who has
96 daughters and one son named JoJo,

940
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,788
who all share a bathroom,
whatever that is,

941
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:37,604
and even though you can't hear
or see them at all,

942
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:41,037
a person's a person, no matter how small.

943
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:50,941
That was beautiful, Horton.

944
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,394
Rope him! Cage him!

945
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:57,443
And burn that speck
in a pot of boiling Beezlenut oil!

946
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,144
They don't believe we're here.

947
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:06,366
We've got to make some noise!

948
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:08,696
We are here! We are here! We are here!

949
01:10:09,072 --> 01:10:10,942
We are here! We are here! We are here!

950
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:12,704
We are here! We are here! We are here!

951
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,235
Come on!

952
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,164
-Everybody!
-We are here! We are here! We are here!

953
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,510
We are here! We are here! We are here!

954
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:31,801
This will teach you not to make up stories
about people on specks!

955
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,475
Listen! There they are!

956
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:40,277
-Rope him.
-Cage him!

957
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,530
It's not working.

958
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,212
I can hear you,
but their ears aren't strong enough.

959
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:47,068
We need to be louder!

960
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,093
Get every Who to make noise! Everyone!

961
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,740
We are here! We are here! We are here!

962
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,153
JoJo! Where are you going?

963
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,306
We need every voice! JoJo!

964
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:07,002
You need to make some noise down there,
or we'll all be destroyed!

965
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:11,384
The Mayor grabbed a tom-tom
and started to smack it,

966
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,934
and all over Whoville,
they whooped up a racket.

967
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:20,848
They rattled tin kettles!
They beat on brass pans!

968
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,467
On garbage pail tops
and old cranberry cans!

969
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,455
They blew on bazookas
and blasted great teats.

970
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:29,903
On clarinets, oompahs,
and boompahs, and flutes!

971
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,172
There!

972
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:37,619
Can they hear us now?

973
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:41,957
Listen, please.
It's the most beautiful thing ever.

974
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:44,172
I don't hear nothing!

975
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,147
I don't think so. But keep trying.

976
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,281
I'll never give in!

977
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:58,244
Are you sure that every Who down
in Whoville is trying?

978
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:07,048
We are here! We are here!

979
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,663
Where's JoJo?

980
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:11,035
Probably at the old observatory.

981
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:26,483
Hey! There's a limit!

982
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,536
That's not supposed to stretch that far!

983
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:47,565
JoJo!

984
01:12:48,231 --> 01:12:49,571
You built this?

985
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,318
We are here! We are here! We are here!

986
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:46,569
We are here! We are here! We are here!

987
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:51,651
We are here! We are here! We are here!

988
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,704
You're making a mistake.

989
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:04,236
But, Mom!

990
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,963
This doesn't concern you, sweetie.
Back in your pouch!

991
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,619
Everybody! Don't stop!

992
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,730
Keep going! This is gonna do it!

993
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,932
We are here! We are here! We are here!

994
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:25,547
Can they hear?

995
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:26,755
No!

996
01:14:35,538 --> 01:14:38,727
No matter what happens,
I couldn't ask for a better son.

997
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:44,305
Hey, JoJo!

998
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,047
Come on! Keep going!

999
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:53,648
No!

1000
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,988
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1001
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:07,062
No!

1002
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,786
Yopp!

1003
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:26,747
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1004
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,197
I hear it! I hear it!

1005
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:31,943
They are there!

1006
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:36,354
And that Yopp,
that one small extra Yopp put it over,

1007
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,523
and all the Whe noises
burst out of the clover.

1008
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:41,515
-l hear it!
-Me, too!

1009
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:45,963
Rudy. Give me that! Come...

1010
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:51,708
Rudy. Get back in the pouch. Now!

1011
01:15:54,817 --> 01:15:55,987
No, Mom.

1012
01:15:58,254 --> 01:16:00,214
Wickershams! Get that clover!

1013
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:05,932
Anybody! Take it from him!

1014
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:20,117
You did it, Mayor. You did it.

1015
01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:23,014
We did it!

1016
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:27,655
Yeah!

1017
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,928
Well done, son.

1018
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:36,981
All right, Mayor!

1019
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:39,970
Dad, you're one of the greats!

1020
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,773
Whoa. Easy, everyone! Easy!

1021
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:49,961
Hi, Vlad.

1022
01:16:54,043 --> 01:16:55,883
Well, ! shouldn't, but...

1023
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,800
Oh, man, that is nice touch.

1024
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:31,853
lam a mess with this, right?
Emotional! Here come the waterslide.

1025
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:36,043
There's so many people to thank.

1026
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,935
The good people of Nool,

1027
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,090
who put me in a cage
and poked me with sticks.

1028
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:41,442
That was me!

1029
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,469
My buddy Morton, for being the only one
who stood by me.

1030
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:45,947
Well, not right by me.

1031
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:49,415
He hid in the bushes,
sending me good thoughts. He's small.

1032
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:51,952
Dude, you are a warrior poet.

1033
01:17:52,568 --> 01:17:55,908
And most of all, I'd like to thank
the Mayor of Whoville,

1034
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:57,748
whe believed in me from the beginning.

1035
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,170
Horton, we're going to miss you.

1036
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:05,402
What are we gonna do
without you, Horton?

1037
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:08,565
Don't worry. I'll always be around.

1038
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,679
And even as I wander

1039
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:15,292
I'm keeping you in sight

1040
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,831
You're a candle in the window

1041
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,007
On a cold, dark winter's night

1042
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,532
Beautiful metaphor.

1043
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:23,784
And I'm getting closer

1044
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:28,322
Than ever thought I might

1045
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:31,365
That's a little high for me.

1046
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:36,250
Baby, l can't fight this feeling anymore

1047
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:42,013
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1048
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:45,742
And if l have to crawl upen your floor

1049
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:47,295
Crawl upon the floor

1050
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:48,785
Come crashing through your door

1051
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:50,138
Crashing through your door

1052
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,322
Baby, l can't fight this feeling anymore

1053
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:59,686
lean't fight this feeling anymore

1054
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:08,416
And so all ended well,
for both Horton and Whos,

1055
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:12,038
and for all in the jungle, even kangaroos.

1056
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:15,384
So let that be a lesson, to one and to all.

1057
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:19,891
A person's a person,
ne matter how small.

1058
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:40,317
And can't fight this feeling anymore

1059
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:42,438
Yeah, I like this. Faster, more up-tempo.

1060
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,438
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1061
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:47,631
lean't fight this feeling

1062
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:50,763
It's time to bring my ship into your shore

1063
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,150
That's a metaphor!

1064
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:53,344
And throw away the oar

1065
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:54,515
Another metaphor!

1066
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:56,333
And buy an engine

1067
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:01,277
‘Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore

1068
01:20:01,697 --> 01:20:03,397
From the weight of my trunk to my toes

1069
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:06,219
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1070
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:08,858
Well, you shouldn't be fighting anything.
Enjoy yourself.

1071
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:12,018
If l have to crawl across the floor

1072
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:14,848
-Now, break down your stupid door
-Crashing through your door

1073
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:17,733
Baby, l can't fight this feeling anymore

1074
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,320
On an empty stomach

1075
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,538
lean't fight this feeling

1076
01:20:21,884 --> 01:20:23,814
lean't fight this feeling

1077
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:29,652
I'm just saying words.

1078
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,030
That felt so good. Cathartic!

1079
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:36,177
What?
