00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,935
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

509
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,964
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

510
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,057
The infinite staircase.

511
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,272
See?

512
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:20,547
Paradox.

513
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,082
So a closed loop like that...

514
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,140
.. Will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

515
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,420
But how big do these levels have to be?

516
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,575
It could be anything
from the floor of a building to an entire city.

517
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:34,149
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

518
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:35,962
-A maze?
-Right, a maze.

519
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:37,471
And the better the maze....

520
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,175
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

521
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:41,782
Exactly.

522
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,797
-My subconscious seems polite enough.
-Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

523
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,961
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

524
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,320
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

525
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,028
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

526
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,530
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

527
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:58,949
Why?

528
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,217
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

529
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,946
-His ex-wife?
-No, not his ex.

530
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,175
-They're still together?
-No.

531
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,110
No, she's dead.

532
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,670
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

533
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:19,833
What was she like in real life?

534
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,018
She was lovely.

To formulate compounds for a job?

00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,895
And to go into the field with us.

00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,251
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

539
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,973
Well, we'd need you there to tailor

542

Three.

543
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,237
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

544
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:56,324
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

545
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,321
A powerful sedative.

546
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,412

-Five.

Then, when we take him

should feed that right back to him.

Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

-...is stressed, to say the least.
-Can we run with that?

672
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:36,156
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

673
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,807
No, because I think positive emotion

01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:08,713
-They just wanna ransom us.
-l heard them.

1009
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,541
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

1010
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,472
All right. What is in the safe?

1011
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:16,771
Something for you.

1012
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:21,183
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

1013
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:25,115
-A will.
-Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

1014
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:26,741
That's an alternate.

1015
01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:29,143
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

1016
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,908
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

1017
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:35,651
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

1018
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:38,442
Destroying my whole inheritance?

1019
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:43,188
-Why would he suggest such a thing?
-l just don't know.

1020
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:48,178
He loved you, Robert.

1021
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,415

In his own way.

1023
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,229
At the end...

1024
01:14:56,559 --> 01:14:58,609
.. he called me in to his deathbed.

1025
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:01,005
He could barely speak.

1026
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:06,018
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

1027
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:10,468
He pulled me close.

1028
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,182
And I could only make out...

1029
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:17,572
..one word.

1030
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,179
"Disappointed."

1032
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:30,108
When were you in limbo?

01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:34,897
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

1034

-But they don't know the truth.
-Truth? What truth?

1035
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:41,697
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

1036
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,941
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

1037
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:48,719
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

1038
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:50,758
... we're also going deeper into you.

1039
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:54,684
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

1040
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:00,378
We were working together.

1041
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,943
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

1042
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:05,702
I kept pushing things.

1043
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:09,248
l wanted to go deeper and deeper.
l wanted to go further.

1044
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:14,478
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

1045
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,637
..that we could get trapped so deep...

1046
01:16:18,808 --> 01:16:21,708
..that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

1047
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,931
...we lost sight of what was real.

1048
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,570
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

1049
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,274
We did that for years.

1050
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:40,391
We built our own world.

1051
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,487
How long were you stuck there?

1052
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,707
Something like 50 years.

1053
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:51,392
Jesus.

1054
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:55,013
How could you stand it?

1055
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:57,744
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

1056
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:00,907
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

1057
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:05,320
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

1058
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,250
And what about for her?

1059
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:14,323
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

1060
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:20,798
A truth that she had once known,
but chose fo forget.

1061
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,562
Limbo became her reality.

1062
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:29,790
What happened when you woke up?

1063
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:33,766
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

1064
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:39,233
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

1065
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,999
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

1066
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,818
Eventually, she told me the truth.

1067
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:51,491
She was possessed by an idea.

1068
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:57,077
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

1069
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:01,078
That our world wasn't real.

1070
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:06,061
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

1071
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:09,196
.. that in order to get back home...

1072
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,299
...we had to kill ourselves.

1073
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:22,201
-What about your children?
-She thought they were projections...

1074
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:25,428
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

1075

MAL: I'm their mother!
COBB: Calm down.

1076
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:28,946
Il can tell the difference.

01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,321
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

1078
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:33,264
You don't know you're dreaming!

1079
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:35,572
COBB: She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

1080
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:39,381
..no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

1081

She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

with a plan on our anniversary.

-Sweetheart, what are you doing?
-Join me.

Just step back inside now, come on.

1085
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:29,894
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1086
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,089
No, I'm not.

Now, you listen to me.

If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

Now, just step back inside.

1090
01:19:41,677 --> 01:19:44,076
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1091
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,280

-Okay.

All right?

01:20:01,397 --> 01:20:05,847
-I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
-No, honey.

1097
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:10,066
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1098

Take a second, think about our children.

1099
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,062
Think about James.

1100
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:17,441
Think about Phillipa, now.

they'll take them away anyway.

1102
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:23,816
-What does that mean?
-I filed a letter with our attorney...

for my safety.

-l love you, Dom.

Why did--? Why would you do this to me?

I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

-Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
-A train that will take you far away.

Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.
