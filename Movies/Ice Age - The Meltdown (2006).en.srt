1
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,774
This global warming is killing me.

2
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,636
This is too hot, the Ice Age was too cold.

3
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,827
What would it take to make you happy?

4
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,632
This I like.

5
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,475
Oh, no, you won't catch me.

6
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,757
No running, James. Camp rules.

7
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,226
Make me, sloth.

8
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,421
Make me, sir. It's all about respect.

9
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,356
Water ball.

10
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,988
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.
Hector, no, no, no, you can't pee-pee there.

11
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,246
OK, there is fine.
Ashley, stop picking your...

12
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,068
Pifiata!

13
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:34,178
Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds.

14
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,341
OK.

15
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,953
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth.
- Mine.

16
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,096
- Mine.
- Mine.

17
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,163
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.

18
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,635
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!

19
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,483
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
could torture the sloth?

20
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,393
Manny, don't squash their creativity.

21
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,233
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammals-jammals.

22
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,673
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

23
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,670
Look, l opened my camp.
“Campo del Sid.” It means Camp of Sid.

24
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,745
Congratulations.
You're now an idiot in two languages.

25
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:23,386
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These little guys love me. Right, Billy?

26
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,014
Don't make me eat you.

27
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,198
They kid. That's why they're called kids.

28
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,003
I told you, Sid.
You're not qualified to run a camp.

29
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,963
What do qualifications
have to do with childcare?

30
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,349
Besides, these kids look up to me.
I'm a role model to them.

31
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,515
I can see that.

32
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,828
You guys never think I can do anything,
but I'm an equal member of this herd.

33
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,399
I made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.

34
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,787
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.

35
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,180
- Hey, let's play pin-the-tail-on-the-mammoth.
- Yeah!

36
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,608
Sid!

37
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,617
I can do stuff.

38
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,633
Won't give me their stupid respect.

39
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,006
I'll show ‘em.

40
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:24,342
And so, in the end,
the little burro reached his mommy.

41
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,748
And they lived happily ever after.

42
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,904
- Good job.
- Question.

43
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,300
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?

44
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,226
Because... because he wanted
to be with his family.

45
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,727
He should go with the girl burro.
That's a better love story.

46
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,394
OK, well, when you tell your burro story,
that's what he'll do.

47
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,368
Burro is a demeaning name.
Technically, it's called a wild ass.

48
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,042
Fine. The wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother.

49
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,388
See, that's why I called it a burro.

50
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,344
Could the burro have a grazing problem?
Then he'd be more relatable.

51
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,079
- Boring.
- It's not believable.

52
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,711
- Do burros eat their young?
- It's not a good ending.

53
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,116
Sometimes I throw up.

54
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:18,017
They lived happily ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.

55
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,097
One big, happy family.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

56
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,982
Where's your big, happy family?

57
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,803
Then the hungry tiger ate the pesky little kids.

58
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,509
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?

59
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,112
- 1 thought...
- Story time's over. The end.

60
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,425
- Run for your lives!
- Where's everybody going?

61
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,584
- The world's coming to an end.
- What are you talking about?

62
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,933
Fast Tony - he says the world's gonna flood.

63
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,804
Folks, I hold in my hand a device so powerful,

64
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,247
- it can actually pull air right out of the sky.
- Yeah, right.

65
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,854
Gather round, gather round.

66
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,403
Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am?

67
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,032
So you can't breathe underwater?

68
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,468
My assistant here will demonstrate.

69
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,011
Hey, I can smell the ocean.

70
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,260
What are you doing? I can't sell that now.

71
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,277
You suck air through your mouth, you moron.

72
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:22,376
Through its design and sturdy construction,
you'll have plenty of air for eons to come.

73
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,426
Of course, results may vary.

74
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,472
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?

75
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,462
I'm trying to make a living here, pal.

76
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,900
It's my weather forecast. The five-day outlook
calls for intense flooding

77
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,765
followed by the end of the world.

78
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,611
And a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week.

79
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:49,278
Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape.

80
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,968
Are you making an offer?
I mean, no, I would not.

81
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,821
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting.

82
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,283
You see this ground, it's covered in ice.

83
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,779
A thousand years ago, it was covered in ice.

84
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,572
A thousand years from now, it will still be ice.

85
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:08,787
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing,

86
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,281
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?

87
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,352
- What are you talking about?
- About you being the last of your kind.

88
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,443
Your breath smells like ants.

89
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,712
Be that as it may, when's the last time
you saw another mammoth?

90
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,113
Don't pay any attention to him.

91
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,067
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.

92
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,376
- What about the dinosaurs?
- The dinosaurs got cocky and made enemies.

93
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,877
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.

94
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,007
Please tell me that's not our idiot.

95
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:49,151
OK, I'm gonna jump on the count of three.

96
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,674
One,

97
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,706
two...

98
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,968
Sid, don't move a muscle. We're coming up.

99
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,985
Jump! Jump! Jump!

100
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,213
Jump! Jump! Jump!

101
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,875
Sorry.

102
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,416
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...

103
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,311
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.

104
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,290
No. I'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator

105
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,703
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.

106
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,963
The only respect you'll get
is respect for the dead.

107
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,050
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.

108
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,497
- But I've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!

109
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,200
Hey, watch it.

110
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:43,689
I can't breathe.
I think I just coughed up my spleen.

111
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,871
- Diego, retract the claws, please.
- Right. Sorry.

112
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,430
If l didn't know you better, Diego,
I'd think you were afraid of the water.

113
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,284
OK, OK. Good thing I know you better.

114
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,099
Guys.

115
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,271
Fast Tony was right.

116
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,954
Everything is melting.

117
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,746
It's all gonna flood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.

118
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,920
Maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures.

119
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,943
- That's genius, Sid.
- Call me Squid.

120
00:11:55,782 --> 00:12:00,562
This whole thing's a piece of junk.
I can't believe I live here.

121
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,031
What?

122
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:14,248
Forget reeds. I present you with this
revolutionary gizmo we call bark.

123
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:19,593
- It's so buoyant, it actually floats.
- I'll show you something that floats.

124
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,069
All right, it's your funeral.

125
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,392
See? This is exactly what I'm talking about.

126
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,268
Giants balls of furry lava
the size of mammoths raining from the sky.

127
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,256
Go suck air through a reed.

128
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:47,582
- Listen to him. He's right about the flood.
- 1am? I mean, yes, l am.

129
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:52,373
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a flood. Why should we listen to you?

130
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:58,305
Because we saw what's up there. The dam's
gonna break. The entire valley's gonna flood.

131
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,817
Flood's real, all right. And it's coming fast.

132
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,041
Look around. You're in a bowl.

133
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,202
Bowl's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.

134
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,839
- What are we gonna do?
- Unless you make it to the end of the valley.

135
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,929
There's a boat. It can save you.

136
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,945
- 1 don't see anything.
- But

137
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,420
y'all better hurry.

138
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:31,784
Ground's melting,
walls tumbling, rocks crumbling.

139
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,072
Survive that and you'll be racing the water,

140
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:39,324
‘cause in three days’ time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fields.

141
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,669
Boom!

142
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,265
There is some good news, though.

143
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,468
The more of you die,

144
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,544
the better I eat.

145
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,137
I didn't say it was good news for you.

146
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,050
He must have been
areal pleasure to have in class.

147
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,997
Dam.

148
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,503
All right, you heard the scary vulture.
Let's move out.

149
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,325
Manny, you really think there's a boat?

150
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,897
I don't know, but in a few days,
this place is gonna be underwater.

151
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,040
If there's any hope, it's that way.

152
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,001
Manny, let's go.

153
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,935
Overturned glyptodont in the far right lane.
Traffic backed up as far as the eye can see.

154
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,730
And it looks like there might be a fatality.

155
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,983
I call the dark meat.

156
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,793
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.

157
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,442
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.

158
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:52,216
Well, I'm not leaving.
I was born in this hole and I'll die in this hole.

159
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,162
Do we have to bring this crap?

160
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:07,252
- I'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.

161
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,776
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.

162
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,562
Manny, I just heard you're going extinct.

163
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,452
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.

164
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,809
- I'm not going extinct.
- Kids, look. The last mammoth.

165
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,220
Well, you probably won't see
another one of those again.

166
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,767
See?

167
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,178
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?

168
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,210
Stu. Come on, Stu.

169
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,996
Let's blow this ice-cube stand.

170
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,233
Stu.

171
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:29,634
Folks, be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home.

172
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,066
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.

173
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,474
Stop singing, Sid.

174
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,151
Sid, I'm going to fall on you again
and this time I will kill you.

175
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,477
OK, someone doesn't like the classics.

176
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,422
What if you're right?

177
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,501
What if l am the last mammoth?

178
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,720
But Manny, look at the bright side,
you have us.

179
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,210
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.

180
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,006
- Mammoths?
- 1 knew I couldn't be the last one.

181
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,590
I felt it in my gut.

182
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,314
Extinct? Come on.

183
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,876
He's up by a couple of fifths, ahead by a tusk.

184
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,803
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.

185
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,560
Sorry. My stomach hates me.

186
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,973
Well, don't that put the "stink" in extinction?

187
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,929
Nasty.

188
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,729
Manny.

189
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,103
I need to be alone for a while.

190
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,949
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.

191
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,819
One truly is the loneliest number.

192
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,699
These work great.

193
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,442
Cool.

194
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,181
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- I'll get ‘em.

195
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,553
- Which end is up?
- I'd hide that face too.

196
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,450
- Hey, ugly.
- 1 gotta sit on that.

197
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,928
Gotcha.

198
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,567
OK, I'm going in.

199
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,723
- Sid.
- What?

200
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,655
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.

201
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,494
- felt some breeze in that one.
- Smile.

202
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,895
- Out of my way.
- Hello.

203
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,504
Over here.

204
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,941
- Surrender?
- Never.

205
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:42,717
Cool.

206
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,871
Smoke them.

207
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:56,487
If anyone asks, there were 50 of ‘em
and they were rattlesnakes.

208
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,466
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.

209
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,103
Miscreants?

210
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,502
Diego, they're possums.

211
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,971
Retreat.

212
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,488
I guess it's just you and me now.

213
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,287
I knew it. I knew I wasn't the only one.

214
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,390
Everyone falls out of the tree now and then.
They just don't admit it.

215
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,341
Wait. What?

216
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,976
Some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches.

217
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,975
It's not like we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.

218
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:11,266
And you were in the tree because...?

219
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,840
I was looking for my brothers.
They are always in trouble.

220
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,571
Brothers? You mean there's more?

221
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,707
Sure.

222
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,569
- There's lots of us.
- Where?

223
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,652
Everywhere.
Under rocks. In holes in the ground.

224
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,942
Usually we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.

225
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,332
Help! Help!

226
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,421
Help!

227
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:42,751
Well, shave me down and call me a mole rat.
You found another mammoth.

228
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:46,599
Where? Wait a minute.
I thought mammoths were extinct.

229
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:52,907
- What are you looking at me for?
- 1 don't know. Because you're a mammoth.

230
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,539
Me? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not a mammoth. I'm a possum.

231
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,673
Right. Good one. I'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.

232
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,043
And my other friend, the platypus.

233
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,590
Why do I gotta be the platypus?
Make him the platypus.

234
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:11,037
- This guy giving you trouble, sis?
- Sis?

235
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,960
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.

236
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:21,182
I don't think her tree
goes all the way to the top branch.

237
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,718
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.

238
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,118
Hey, she should come with us.

239
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,740
Are you insane? No way.

240
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,500
OK.

241
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:36,335
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.

242
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,972
- I'd rather be road kill.
- That can be arranged.

243
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:44,512
Funny. Let me have a little word
with my brothers.

244
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,774
Ellie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.

245
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,143
Look, we'll never make it in time
if we only travel at night.

246
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:55,486
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?

247
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:58,756
Why did you invite them?

248
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,893
‘Cause you might be
the only two mammoths left on Earth.

249
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:06,171
- He has a point.
- Sorry, when did I join this dating service?

250
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:10,485
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you.

251
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,090
If you treat us nicely.

252
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,749
See that? That's the total opposite of nice.

253
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,481
Maybe we'll have a snack
before we hit the road.

254
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,657
You want a piece of us? Let's go.

255
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,724
Banzai!

256
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,126
- 1 got ‘em.
- Back! Back!

257
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,870
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.

258
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,433
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now traveling together.

259
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:45,247
And like it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy family.

260
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,291
I'll be the daddy, Ellie will be the mommy.

261
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:52,167
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.

262
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,141
Now, let's move it before the ground falls out
from under our feet.

263
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,262
I thought fat guys were supposed to be jolly.

264
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:03,375
I'm not fat. It's this fur, it makes me look big.

265
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,535
- It's poofy.
- OK.

266
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,859
He's fat.

267
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:46,962
Escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds

268
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,023
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.

269
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,227
You, ma‘am, you look
like a big, fat, hairy beast.

270
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,337
How would you like to lose a ton or two?

271
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,177
Would I ever.

272
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:04,635
Don't listen to him, Vera.
You're already thin as a twig.

273
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:09,764
l also have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my blind friend.

274
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,468
We'll never make it at this pace.

275
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:45,687
Ellie, it's OK, you can
lose the camouflage. You're safe.

276
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,870
OK. Safe? Please.

277
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,104
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.

278
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,360
- What you got?
- Perimeter all clear.

279
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:58,059
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...

280
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,377
- Guys.
- All clear.

281
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,699
Hawk!

282
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:19,208
- What are you doing?
- Playing dead.

283
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,585
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because I'm a mammoth.

284
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,208
But you'd do it for treats, right?

285
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,356
Is he gone?

286
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,780
You're safe. Get up.

287
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,093
Man.

288
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:40,208
If you weren't here, that hawk would have
swooped down and snatched me for dinner.

289
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,151
That's how cousin Wilton went.

290
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,638
Boy, I really feel for you. I do.

291
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,797
I can't even imagine what it'd be like
to be the last one of your species.

292
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:57,292
- I'm not the last one.
- You brave, brave soul.

293
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,526
That's right. Don't give up hope.

294
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,211
Ellie.

295
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,056
Look at our footprints.

296
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,432
They're the same shape.

297
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,642
Well, how do I know
those aren't your footprints?

298
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,855
Well, then,

299
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,200
look at our shadows.

300
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,569
We match.

301
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,287
You're right. They're the same.

302
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,588
You must be part possum.

303
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,810
You wish.

304
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,951
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you.

305
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,041
We gotta catch up with the others.

306
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,806
Hey. Knock it off.

307
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,964
Cry me ariver, blubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.

308
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,308
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.

309
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,668
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,

310
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:17,163
but it's strong enough to hold
a ten-ton mammoth and a nine-ton possum.

311
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,965
Mammal overboard!

312
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:59,825
Ellie, get up. If you play dead, you'll be dead.

313
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,132
Look at me.

314
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,644
Diego.

315
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,167
Diego.

316
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,811
Come on, Diego. Come on.

317
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,024
This may sting a little.

318
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,861
- What in the animal kingdom was that?
- 1 don't know.

319
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,722
From now on, land - safe, water - not safe.

320
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,829
That was the bravest thing I've ever seen.

321
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,819
- It was nothing. I...
- It's not a compliment.

322
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,048
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.

323
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,984
- Yeah, we're spineless.
- Lily-livered.

324
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,430
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.

325
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,544
Maybe you should run away more.

326
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,033
Good point. Thanks for the advice.

327
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,136
Happy to help.

328
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:21,265
Do you believe her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you should run away more."

329
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,643
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.

330
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,085
You like her.

331
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:31,411
-I do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

332
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,406
- And so is yours.
- What secret?

333
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,206
You know, the one where you can't swim.

334
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,949
- That's ridiculous.
- Fine. But we're living in a melting world.

335
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:45,428
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or later.

336
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,193
Almost there.

337
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,490
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.

338
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,599
Let's roll.

339
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,120
Wait for me.

340
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,435
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

341
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,549
So you think she's the girl for me?

342
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,753
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

343
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,519
She completes you.

344
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,351
Yeah.

345
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:28,396
Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?

346
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,037
-No.
- Come on.

347
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,096
- You expect to impress with that attitude?
- 1 don't want to impress.

348
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:38,147
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?

349
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,813
Because that's what she is.
I don't care if she thinks she's a possum.

350
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:46,173
- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.

351
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,141
Tell that to the bullfrog,
chicken hawk or turtledove.

352
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:54,811
He's never gonna let up on you.
It'll be easier on all of us if you just go with it.

353
00:36:57,182 --> 00:37:01,432
- So what do you want me to do?
- Pull the tree and shoot me into the pond.

354
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:06,067
- 1 don't know.
- If you're too lame to do it, we can get Ellie.

355
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,151
No, no, no. No, I can do it. I can do it.

356
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

357
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,846
- Have you done this before?
- Only a million times.

358
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,634
Farther, farther, farther.

359
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,620
Perfect. Fire!

360
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,154
Yeah! I can fly!

361
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,942
Crash!

362
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,275
Crash! Crash!

363
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,941
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?

364
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,941
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?

365
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,357
- He said he could do it.
- And you listened to him?

366
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,797
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the light.

367
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,203
Can I help in any way here?

368
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,153
You've done enough.

369
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,886
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't leave me.

370
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,594
Who's gonna watch my back?

371
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,113
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?

372
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:16,374
Who's gonna roll in that dung patch with me?

373
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,691
Dung patch?

374
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:23,187
- Wait. My legs. I can stand.
- He can stand.

375
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:27,115
-lcan run.
- He can run. It's a miracle.

376
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,389
Hallelujah!

377
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:40,334
What can I say? They're boys.
They make my life a little adventure.

378
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,859
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.

379
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,222
Not the face.

380
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,252
Ellie, Ellie, me too.

381
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,504
She's not half bad.

382
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,111
Crazy and confused, but sweet.

383
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,361
So?

384
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,338
So what's holding you back?

385
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,803
My family.

386
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,872
You can have that again, you know.

387
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,161
No, Sid, I can't.

388
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,831
OK, OK, but think about it.
I mean, if you let this chance go,

389
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:34,755
you're letting your whole species go
and that's just... that’s just selfish.

390
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,966
I think I'm starting to get through to him.

391
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,207
- Wait, wait. I got you.
- Slowpoke.

392
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:57,054
- Need help?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.

393
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,999
- You're stuck.
- lam not.

394
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,738
All right, then, let's go.

395
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,192
I can't.

396
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,500
I'm stuck.

397
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,843
Don't you think that
picking them up like this would be easier?

398
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,424
Ellie?

399
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:56,252
I know this place.

400
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,921
You know, deep down, I knew I was different.

401
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:10,644
I was a little bigger
than the other possum kids.

402
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,412
OK, a lot bigger.

403
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:19,033
Now I understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appealing.

404
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:24,817
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,

405
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,683
- you know.
- What?

406
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,033
Attractive.

407
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:37,031
- Really?
- Sure.

408
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:40,352
What about me is attractive?

409
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:44,637
I don't know.

410
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,946
Well, there's your

411
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,496
butt.

412
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:53,636
What about it?

413
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,868
It's

414
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,189
big.

415
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:00,406
You're just saying that.

416
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,869
No, no, no, I mean it.

417
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:08,088
It's huge. Biggest darn butt I've ever seen.

418
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,289
That is really sweet.

419
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:13,705
What a crazy day.

420
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:18,711
This morning I woke up a possum
and now I'm a mammoth.

421
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,929
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap
with Ellie today.

422
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,382
Sure did.

423
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:15,015
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. Splash.

424
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:18,712
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.

425
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,050
1 wouldn't know. Sabers don't feel fear.

426
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:26,493
Come on, all animals feel fear.
It's what separates us from, say, rocks.

427
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,337
Rocks have no fear.

428
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,790
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?

429
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:37,571
It may surprise you to know
that I, too, have experienced fear.

430
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,839
No. You?

431
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,350
Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems,

432
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:47,743
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise "kill" us.

433
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:50,935
- l wonder why?
- Jealousy, mostly.

434
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,952
But the point is that fear is natural.

435
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,689
Fear is for prey.

436
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:01,332
Well, then, you're letting
the water make you its prey.

437
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,312
Just jump in and trust your instincts.

438
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,256
You know, most animals can swim as babies.

439
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,929
And for a tiger, it's like
crawling on your belly to stalk helpless prey.

440
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:19,286
But faster, OK?
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick.

441
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:22,564
I'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick.

442
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,587
Il look back over my shoulder
to see if I'm being followed.

443
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,060
And I'm breathing.

444
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,432
And I'm stalking and I'm stalking and I'm...

445
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,150
- I'm falling.
- Correction. You're sinking.

446
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:39,945
Kind of like a rock.

447
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,519
Hey, do we do any special tricks
like roll over?

448
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,622
Or do we just throw our weight around?

449
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,618
Whoops. Sorry.

450
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,183
I don't know my own strength yet.

451
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:59,442
Ellie, do you realize that now
we have a chance to save our species?

452
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:04,144
- Really? How are we gonna do that?
- Well, you know...

453
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:06,452
Did you just...?

454
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:10,121
I'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?

455
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,934
I wasn't saying... Not right now. In time.

456
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,998
- 1 was just saying that it's our responsibility.
- What?

457
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,051
All right, that came out wrong. I...

458
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,305
You're very pretty, but we just met...

459
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,594
Responsibility?
Just doing your duty? Is that it?

460
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,611
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species.

461
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:36,215
I got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.

462
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:50,287
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.

463
00:48:55,966 --> 00:49:00,746
OK, let's go. We traveled with you all day,
now you're coming with us at night.

464
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:03,372
But we can't see at night.

465
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,667
Then enjoy the flood.

466
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,380
I can't even look at him.

467
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,529
Pervert.

468
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,908
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.

469
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:47,484
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.

470
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,903
I thought we could walk together.

471
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,599
Crash, ask the mammoth why he thinks that.

472
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,892
She said she thinks you're a jerk
and to go away.

473
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,112
She didn't say...

474
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,928
Look, maybe if we spend more time...

475
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,908
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right now.

476
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:12,782
- She said go jump in a lake.
- And possums rule.

477
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:16,163
- 1 can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medal?

478
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,125
Stop moving.

479
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,364
Thank you.

480
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:45,116
Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks.

481
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,022
Now!

482
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,817
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge.

483
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:06,787
- Funny. Now what's your real plan?
- Just do it.

484
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:09,078
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.

485
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,450
- Bye, Ellie.
- Go now.

486
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,423
I'm sorry if what I said before offended you.

487
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:22,163
What do you mean "if" it offended me?

488
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,921
That it offended her!

489
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,772
I mean that, that it offended you.

490
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,359
- You just overreacted, that's all.
- What?

491
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,279
- Take it back.
- There are other lives at stake here.

492
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:40,746
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.

493
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,618
- It was a misunderstanding.
- It was insensitive.

494
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,524
- Apologize.
- Why me? She overreacted.

495
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,957
- Just apologize.
-No.

496
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,886
- Do it.
- OK, I'm sorry.

497
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,569
What?

498
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:56,031
- He's right. I overreacted.
- You mean...

499
00:51:56,413 --> 00:52:00,423
Not another word or I'll come down there
and push you over myself.

500
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:03,971
I got it. I got it.

501
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:06,105
I got it.

502
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,256
Manny, Ellie, run! Run!

503
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,501
I guess we finally
did something right together.

504
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:35,404
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here.

505
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:58,763
- Remember the good old days?
- Which good old days?

506
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,279
You know. Yesterday, last week.

507
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,580
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.

508
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,598
Yep. Those were the good days.

509
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:14,937
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.

510
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,699
- We should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

511
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:22,452
Tomorrow's the day
the vulture said we're all going to die.

512
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,881
Wait a minute.

513
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,434
Can I help you?

514
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,020
Now, that's what I call respect.

515
00:54:58,595 --> 00:54:59,794
Nice.

516
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,719
Somebody here likes Sid.

517
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:13,183
Who is your decorator?
I mean, this is fabulous.

518
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:21,058
Fire King.

519
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:32,514
Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time
someone recognized my true potential.

520
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,197
Let there be fire.

521
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,658
If only the guys could see me now.

522
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,509
This is either really good or really bad.

523
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:55,932
No, no, no.

524
00:56:56,146 --> 00:57:01,386
Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King? A thousand
years’ bad juju for killing Fire King.

525
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,875
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,

526
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:07,402
melting ice built up over thousands of years.

527
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:11,357
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can look for a solution.

528
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,239
We have one - sacrifice the Fire King.

529
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:17,241
- Well, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.

530
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,185
No! No!

531
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,600
Bad juju!

532
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,330
Water? Water!

533
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:13,261
- Crash, I told you not to drink before bed.
- 1 didn't do this. At least, not all of it.

534
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:17,044
- What's happening?
- We overslept. We need to move.

535
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:21,567
What if we're the last creatures left alive?
We'll have to repopulate the Earth.

536
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:25,129
How? Everyone's either a dude or our sister.

537
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,993
Hi. Hey, Manny.

538
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:32,016
Wow. What a night.
You'll never guess what happened.

539
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,632
You were sleepwalking.

540
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:38,172
No, no, no.
l was kidnapped by a tribe of mini sloths.

541
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,551
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.

542
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:45,799
I mean, sure, they tossed me into
a flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.

543
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,900
You were dreaming. Come on,
the water's rising faster than we're moving.

544
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm telling you, I was kidnapped.
l was worshiped. Guys.

545
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,449
Fine.

546
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:07,937
Can we slow down a little? I'm dying here.

547
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,652
It was just a figure of speech.

548
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:23,326
They just sit there, watching us.

549
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,380
I wish I knew what they were thinking.

550
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,476
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.

551
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:10,915
- Sid!
- What? It's catchy.

552
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,899
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.

553
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:57,223
It's just a little hot water and steam.
How bad could it be?

554
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:07,750
I just did something involuntary and messy.

555
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:11,009
OK, come on.

556
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,695
Manny. Get back. It's a minefield out there.

557
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,678
There's only one way to go. Straight through.

558
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:21,611
Straight through? We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.

559
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:25,072
- We'll head back and go around.
- There's no time.

560
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:27,882
The dam will burst before we make it.
We'll drown.

561
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:30,448
If we go through this, we get blown to bits.

562
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:32,513
- We go forward.
- We go back.

563
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:35,035
- Forward.
- Back.

564
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,408
- Can I say something?
-No.

565
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:42,034
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- Well, I guess that proves it.

566
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,442
lam a mammoth.

567
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:49,133
- Come on.
- Fine.

568
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,559
I don't know. Drowning sounds like
a much gentler way to go.

569
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:56,226
Blown to bits sounds so sudden.

570
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:10,034
He's going to get himself killed.
Manny, wait.

571
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,037
Manny.

572
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,667
Kids, look, the last mammoth.

573
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:40,161
I just heard you're going extinct.

574
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:43,676
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're a jerk.

575
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,616
Where's your big, happy family?

576
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,303
What's wrong with you?

577
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:51,833
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!

578
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,679
That way.

579
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:45,813
Do not leave your children unattended.
All unattended children will be eaten.

580
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,470
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.

581
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:54,659
- Have you seen a mammoth?
-No.

582
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,741
Possum? About 11 foot tall?

583
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:02,816
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- I sure have. Big as life.

584
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,139
- Where?
- I'm looking at him.

585
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,428
Not me.

586
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:09,701
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.

587
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:13,779
- 1 don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's already on board.

588
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:29,113
Hurry, this way. Come on.

589
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,874
- There it is.
- Ellie! Help!

590
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:46,307
Come on, come on, run!

591
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,459
Push.

592
01:06:57,413 --> 01:07:00,433
- You guys gotta go.
- We're not leaving you.

593
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,057
- I'm not asking.
- Ellie, no.

594
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:08,355
Ellie, don't worry. We're going for help.

595
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,337
Stay here.

596
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:28,538
- Help us.
- Help! Somebody help.

597
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:30,888
Manny.

598
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,281
Manny.

599
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:40,033
- Manny.
- It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.

600
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,343
Ellie.

601
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,368
Manny.

602
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:50,729
- Help!
- I'll save you.

603
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,585
Great. Who's gonna save him?

604
01:09:00,502 --> 01:09:02,343
You really need to brush.

605
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:11,097
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.

606
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:15,051
Come on, ‘fraidy cat. Come on.

607
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,877
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

608
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,531
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.

609
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,760
lam not your prey. I am not your prey.

610
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,202
lam not your prey.

611
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,739
Attack the water. Stalking the prey.

612
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:55,281
Claw, kick. Even babies can do it. Come on.

613
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:59,302
Claw, kick, claw, kick.

614
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,612
Hey. I'm stalking the prey.

615
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,621
Eddie.

616
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:28,034
You did it, buddy. You kicked water's butt.

617
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:31,611
Nothing to it.
Most animals can swim as babies, you know.

618
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:34,965
Yeah, but not tigers. I left that part out.

619
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,243
There he is.

620
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:55,793
Ellie, hold on to me.

621
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:30,124
Manny, Manny, behind you.

622
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,173
There they are.

623
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,333
They made it.

624
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:25,762
We thought we'd never see you again.

625
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:37,351
We're gonna live.

626
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,840
We're gonna die.

627
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:42,190
- Well, I'm not leaving.
- Grandpa, let go of the boat. The flood's over.

628
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:47,235
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

629
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:51,517
Stu. We made it. We're gonna live.

630
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:54,108
Well, lam anyway.

631
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,501
I'm thinking about starting a swim school.

632
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:02,069
Sid's Squids.

633
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:10,049
All hail Fire King.

634
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,228
Hi.

635
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:26,527
Fire King avert flood.
Join us, O great and noble flaming one.

636
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:34,183
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quality offer.

637
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:39,654
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.

638
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:46,546
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that holds us together.

639
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:53,340
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.

640
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:57,306
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.

641
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:00,400
That doesn't mean "want to touch."

642
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:08,262
Don't ask.

643
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:11,578
We're not the last ones anymore.

644
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:18,646
You're not coming?

645
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,958
You wanna go with them?

646
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,202
lam a mammoth.

647
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:25,849
I should probably be with a mammoth.

648
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:28,432
Don't you think?

649
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:30,561
Yeah, unless...

650
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,398
Unless?

651
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:38,235
Unless I...

652
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,480
I just wanna say...

653
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:46,777
I need to tell you...

654
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:52,324
Il hope you find everything you're looking for.

655
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:57,922
You too.

656
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:37,668
Manny, you've come a long way since we met
and I'll take full credit for that,

657
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:42,837
but you need to let go of the past
so you can have a future.

658
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:50,098
- Go after her.
- It's OK.

659
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,349
We'll always be here for you.

660
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:57,760
-I'll keep in touch.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.

661
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,640
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.

662
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:09,831
Our Manny's growing up.

663
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,359
Ellie! Ellie!

664
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:19,737
Manny.

665
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:25,059
Ellie, l don't want us
to be together because we have to.

666
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:27,938
I want us to be together because we want to.

667
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,230
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.

668
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:36,421
- What do you say?
- Manny, I thought you were going...

669
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:43,120
You're possum enough for me.

670
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:02,786
Well, it's just you and me now.
Two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

671
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:05,982
Fine. But I'm not gonna carry you.

672
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:10,465
- I still have my pride, you know.
- Come on, buddy, for old time's sake.

673
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:13,295
I'll carry him.

674
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,724
- But your herd's leaving.
- We are now.

675
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:19,457
Shotgun!

676
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,317
Manny, who do you like better? Me or Diego?

677
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,620
- Diego. It's not even close.
- Told you.

678
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,640
Manny, you can't choose between your kids.

679
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,750
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.

680
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:38,826
If l had a dog and my dog had a kid
and the dog's kid had a pet, that would be Sid.

681
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:41,815
- Can I have a dog, Manny?
-No.

682
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:44,784
- Ellie, can I have a dog?
- Of course you can, sweetie.

683
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:48,277
Ellie, we have to be consistent with him.

684
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:10,036
I saved you, little buddy.

685
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:26,238
Calm down.
I saved you, little buddy. Remember?
