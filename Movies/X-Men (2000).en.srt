1
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,606
Mutation: it is the key to our evolution.

2
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:31,166
it has enabled us to evolve
into the dominant species on the planet.

3
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:35,979
This process normally takes
thousands and thousands of years.

4
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,543
But every few hundred millennia,
evolution leaps forward.

5
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,531
Niagara Falls, up the Canadian Rockies,

6
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,628
and then it's only
a few hundred miles to Anchorage.

7
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,610
- Won't it be cold?
- That's the point, stupid.

8
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,870
Otherwise it wouldn't be an adventure.

9
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,810
And when are you gonna do this?

10
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,648
I don't know.

11
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:51,085
After high school. Before college.

12
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,625
- Marie!
- [ don't know what happened.

13
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,468
- David?
- I don't know... l just touched him.

14
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,655
- [didn’t mean...
- Call an ambulance!

15
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,698
We only touched. Just get away from me!

16
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:51,174
- Will you call an ambulance?
- Don't touch me!

17
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:57,876
We are now seeing the beginnings
of another stage of human evolution.

18
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:03,585
These mutations manifest at puberty, often
triggered by periods of emotional stress.

19
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,270
Thank you, Miss Grey.
It was quite educational.

20
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,647
However, it fails to address the issue
that is the focus of this hearing.

21
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,585
Three words: are mutants dangerous?

22
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:21,249
That's unfair, Senator Kelly. The wrong
person driving a car can be dangerous.

23
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,332
- We do license people to drive.
- Yes, but not to live.

24
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:30,966
Senator, mutants who've come forward
and revealed themselves publicly

25
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,855
have been met with fear,
hostility, even violence.

26
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,602
It is because of that hostility

27
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,724
that I am urging the Senate
to vote against mutant registration.

28
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,299
- To force mutants to expose themselves...
- Expose themselves?

29
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:50,006
What do mutants have to hide that makes
them so afraid to identify themselves?

30
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,400
- I didn't say they were hiding.
- Let me show you what is being hidden.

31
00:06:55,081 --> 00:07:00,121
I have here a list of names of identified
mutants living right here in the United States.

32
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,234
- Senator Kelly...
- Agirl in Illinois who walks through walls.

33
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,871
What's to stop her from walking
into a bank vault? Or into the White House?

34
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:14,312
Or into their houses? And there are even
rumors of mutants so powerful

35
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,851
that they can enter our minds
and control our thoughts,

36
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,541
taking away our God-given free will.

37
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:25,074
The American people deserve the right
to decide whether they want their children

38
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,259
to be in school with mutants.
To be taught by mutants.

39
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:36,274
Ladies and gentlemen,
the truth is that mutants are very real.

40
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,111
And they are among us.
We must know who they are,

41
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,396
and, above all,
we must know what they can do.

42
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,436
Eric.

43
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,878
What are you doing here?

44
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,983
Why do you ask questions to which
you already know the answers?

45
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:25,444
- Don't give up on them, Eric.
- What would you have me do, Charles?

46
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,099
I've heard these arguments before.

47
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,302
It was a long time ago.
Mankind has evolved since then.

48
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,156
Yes... Into us.

49
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,860
Are you sneaking around in here, Charles?
Whatever are you looking for?

50
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,709
I'm looking for hope.

51
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:04,632
I will bring you hope, old friend.
And [ask only one thing in return.

52
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,524
Don't get in my way.

53
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,276
We are the future, Charles, not them.
They no longer matter.

54
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,747
This is it.

55
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:45,795
Where are we? I thought you said you were
gonna take me as far as Laughlin City.

56
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,236
This is Laughlin City.

57
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,280
Gentlemen, in all my years
I've never seen anything like this.

58
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,459
Are you gonna let this man
walk away with your money?

59
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,271
No!

60
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,055
lll fight him!

61
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,479
Ladies and gentlemen,

62
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,748
-
our savior.

63
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,346
Don't hit him in the balls.

64
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,665
- You said anything goes.
- Anything goes, but he'll take it personal.

65
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,665
You idiot!

66
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:21,849
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight's winner and still King of the Cage,

67
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,829
the Wolverine.

68
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,340
You want something new, honey?
Or are you sticking with water?

69
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,744
I'll have a beer.

70
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:23,266
Ellis island, once the arrival point
for American immigrants,

71
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,750
is opening its doors again.

72
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,752
Preparations are nearly completed
for the United Nations World Summit.

73
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:36,366
The event promises to be the largest
single gathering of world leaders in history.

74
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:42,073
Leaders will discuss issues ranging from
the world's economy and weapons treaties,

75
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,781
to the mutant phenomenon
and its impact on our world stage.

76
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,747
American legislators contend
that debate over mutant issues

77
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:56,087
should be the primary focus of what is,
on the surface at least, a diplomatic affair.

78
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,336
- You owe me some money.
- Stu, let's not do this.

79
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,317
No man takes a beating like that
without a mark to show for it.

80
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,877
- Come on, this isn't worth it.
- [know what you are.

81
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,794
You lost your money.
You keep this up, you lose something else.

82
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,777
Look out!

83
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,604
Get outta my bar, freak.

84
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:23,565
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm sorry. I needed a ride.

85
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,353
- [thought you might help me.
- Get out.

86
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,531
- Where am I supposed to go?
- [don't know.

87
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,772
- You don't know or you don't care?
- Pick one.

88
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,853
- I saved your life.
- No, you didn't.

89
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,151
You don't have anything to eat, do you?

90
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,829
I'm Rogue.

91
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,997
Were you in the army?
Doesn't that mean you were in the army?

92
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,351
- Wow.
- What?

93
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,930
- Suddenly my life isn't bad.
- If you prefer the road...

94
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,433
No. It looks great.

95
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,320
It looks cosy.

96
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,069
Put your hands on the heater.

97
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,453
- I'm not gonna hurt you, kid.
- It's nothing personal.

98
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,923
It's just when people touch my skin,
something happens.

99
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,050
What?

100
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,749
I don't know. They just get hurt.

101
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,419
Fair enough.

102
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,339
When they come out, does it hurt?

103
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,155
Every time.

104
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,175
So what kind of a name is Rogue?

105
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,685
I don't know.
What kind of a name is Wolverine?

106
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,097
My name's Logan.

107
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,767
Marie.

108
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:02,775
- You should wear your seat belt.
- Look, kid, I don't need advice on...

109
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,595
You all right?

110
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,801
- Kid, are you all right?
- I'm stuck!

111
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,469
Weren't you meant to bring someone back?

112
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,402
- What happened?
- They knew.

113
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,183
Charles...

114
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:45,451
- Where is the mutant now?
- With them.

115
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,558
I have made the first move.
That is all they know.

116
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,460
Come, the UN summit is approaching.
Time for our little test.

117
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,093
Where's he going?

118
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,889
Where are you going?

119
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,940
Over here.

120
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,638
- Where are you going?
- This way.

121
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,874
He's over there.

122
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,483
Let go! What's your hurry?

123
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,724
Over here.

124
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,416
Good morning, Logan.

125
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:01,082
So, I'd like your definitions of weak and
strong anthropic principles on Wednesday.

126
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,614
That'll be all.

127
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,402
- Bye, Professor.
- Bye, Kitty.

128
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,029
Physics.

129
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,502
I'm Charles Xavier.
Would you like some breakfast?

130
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,361
- Where am I?
- Westchester, New York.

131
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,159
You were attacked. My people
brought you here for medical attention.

132
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,428
- [don't need medical attention.
- Yes, of course.

133
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,722
- Where's the girl?
- Rogue's here. She's fine.

134
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,104
Really?

135
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:47,151
Logan, I'd like you to meet Ororo Monroe,
also called Storm.

136
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,603
This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops.

137
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,163
They saved your life.

138
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,930
I believe you've already met Dr Jean Grey.

139
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,973
You're in my school for the gifted. For
mutants. You'll be safe here from Magneto.

140
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,482
- What's a magneto?
- A very powerful mutant.

141
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:13,225
Who believes a war is brewing
between mutants and the rest of humanity.

142
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,242
I've been following his activities
for some time.

143
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,838
The man who attacked you
is an associate of his called Sabretooth.

144
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:21,995
Sabretooth?

145
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,635
Storm.

146
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,399
What do they call you? Wheels?

147
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,416
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

148
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,648
And Cyclops, right?

149
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,271
You wanna get outta my way?

150
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,603
Logan, it's been almost 15 years, hasn't it?

151
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,518
Living from day to day,
moving from place to place

152
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,535
with no memory of who or what you are.

153
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,035
Shut up.

154
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:59,991
Give me a chance.
I may be able to help you find some answers.

155
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,897
- How do you know?
- You're not the only one with gifts.

156
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,447
- Where are you going?
- Where's he going?

157
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,676
Over here.

158
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,766
What is this place?

159
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:22,233
Anonymity is a mutant's first defense
against the world's hostility.

160
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,225
No powers!

161
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:29,521
To the public,
we're merely a school for gifted youngsters.

162
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:33,582
Cyclops, Storm and Jean
were some of my first students.

163
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:37,555
I protected them,
taught them to control their powers

164
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,256
and, in time, teach others to do the same.

165
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,808
The students are mostly runaways -
frightened, alone.

166
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,737
Some with gifts so extreme they're a danger
to themselves and those around them.

167
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,963
Like your friend Rogue.

168
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,528
Incapable of physical human contact,
probably for the rest of her life.

169
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:02,723
And yet here she is with others her own age,
learning, being accepted,

170
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,265
not feared.

171
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,231
- John.
- Sorry.

172
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,654
I'm Bobby.

173
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,060
- What's your name?
- Rogue.

174
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,992
- What'll happen to her?
- That's up to her.

175
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:34,014
Rejoin the world as an educated
young woman, or stay on to teach others.

176
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,956
To become, what the children
have affectionately called "X-Men."

177
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,664
Welcome to Mutant High.

178
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,798
But the school is merely our public face.

179
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,271
The lower levels, however,
are an entirely different matter.

180
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,438
When I was a boy I discovered I had
the power to control people's minds.

181
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,421
Make them think or do whatever I wanted.

182
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,473
When I was 17
I met a young man named Eric Lensherr.

183
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:11,151
He, too, had an unusual power. He could
create magnetic fields and control metal.

184
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:17,290
Believing that humanity would never
accept us, he grew angry and vengeful.

185
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,900
He became Magneto.

186
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,385
There are mutants out there
with incredible powers, Logan.

187
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,952
And many who do not share
my respect for mankind.

188
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,162
If no one is equipped to oppose them,
humanity's days could be over.

189
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,740
I'll make a deal with you.

190
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,712
Give me 48 hours to find out
what Magneto wants with you,

191
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,866
and I give you my word
that I will use all my power

192
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,948
to help you piece together what you've lost,
and what you're looking for.

193
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:21,789
Senator, you favor gun registration, yes?
Some of these so-called children

194
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,797
possess more than 10 times
the destructive force of any handgun.

195
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:31,216
No, I don't see a difference.
All I see are weapons in our schools.

196
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,387
Well, that's fair enough. All right.

197
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,480
So?

198
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,998
It's gonna be close.
A vote this loaded is always close.

199
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,322
What about the UN summit?
The world will be watching.

200
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,745
- Maybe you could use it to your advantage.
- We're Americans, Henry.

201
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,603
Let the rest of the damn world
deal with mutants in their own way.

202
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,934
You know this situation? These mutants?

203
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:01,447
People like this Jean Grey?
If it were up to me, I'd lock 'em all away.

204
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,625
It's a war.

205
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,781
It's the reason people like me exist.

206
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,561
Where the hell are we?

207
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,487
Pilot!

208
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:37,715
People like you are the reason
I was afraid to go to school as a child.

209
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,344
I'm sorry.

210
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,216
- For what?
- If hurt you.

211
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,540
So... couldn't wait
to get my shirt off again, huh?

212
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,231
The metal is an alloy
called adamantium.

213
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,680
Supposedly indestructible. It's been
surgically grafted to his entire skeleton.

214
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,286
How could he have survived
a procedure like that?

215
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:04,203
His mutation. He has uncharted regenerative
capability which enables him to heal rapidly.

216
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,243
This also makes his age
impossible to determine.

217
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,129
He could very well be older than you,
Professor.

218
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,214
- Who did this to him?
- He doesn't know.

219
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,654
Nor does he remember anything
about his life before it happened.

220
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:23,303
Experimentation on mutants.
It's not unheard of.

221
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:27,312
But I've never seen anything like this before.

222
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,948
What does Magneto want with him?

223
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,595
I'm not entirely sure it's him Magneto wants.

224
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,250
Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator.

225
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,553
Just like you.

226
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,138
Who are you people? Where's Henry?

227
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,831
Mr Guyrich has been dead
for some time, Senator.

228
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,551
But I've had Mystique here keep you
company. She takes so many shapes.

229
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:24,226
Whatever you do to me, you'll make me right.

230
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:28,163
Every word I've spoken will be confirmed.

231
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:36,230
Are you a God-fearing man, Senator?
It's such a strange phrase.

232
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:39,618
I've always thought of God as a teacher.

233
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:43,275
As a bringer of light,
wisdom and understanding.

234
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,797
You see,
I think what you really are afraid of is me.

235
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,084
Me and my kind.
The brotherhood of mutants.

236
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:01,110
It's not so surprising, really. Mankind has
always feared what it doesn't understand.

237
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:08,142
Well, don't fear God, Senator,
and certainly don't fear me.

238
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,325
Not any more.

239
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:18,726
- What do you intend to do to me?
- Let's just say God works too slowly.

240
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,109
I think you'll be comfortable here.

241
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,991
- Where's your room?
- With Scott, down the hall.

242
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,257
Is that your gift? Putting up with that guy?

243
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,020
Actually I'm telekinetic.
I can move things with my mind.

244
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,301
Really? What kinds of things?

245
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,345
All kinds of things.

246
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,531
- l also have telepathic ability.
- Like your professor?

247
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:04,441
Nowhere near that powerful.
But he's teaching me to develop it.

248
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,970
I'm sure he is.

249
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,870
- So read my mind.
- I'd rather not.

250
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,165
- Come on. You afraid you might like it?
- [ doubt it.

251
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,939
What do you see?

252
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,031
Scott.

253
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,914
Good night, Logan.

254
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,628
You gonna tell me
to stay away from your girl?

255
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,673
If l had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl.

256
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,810
Then I guess you've got nothing
to worry about, do you... Cyclops?

257
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,231
It must just burn you up
that a boy like me saved your life, huh?

258
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,045
You oughta be careful.
I might not be there next time.

259
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,726
And Logan, stay away from my girl.

260
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,948
Logan?

261
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,727
Logan. Logan, wake up.

262
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,996
Help me!

263
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,895
Somebody, help!

264
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,963
Scott, grab a pillow.

265
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,911
It was an accident.

266
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,550
- Logan?
- What happened?

267
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,911
- Is she all right?
- She'll be all right.

268
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,492
- What did she do to me?
- When Rogue touches someone,

269
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,412
she takes their energy, their life force.

270
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,875
In the case of mutants,
she absorbs their gifts for a while.

271
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,638
In your case, your ability to heal.

272
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:05,318
- It felt like she almost killed me.
- If she'd held out any longer, she could have.

273
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:03,207
How are we feeling, Senator?
Advanced, I hope.

274
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:23,082
What the hell have you done to me?

275
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:27,048
Senator, this is pointless.
Where would you go?

276
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,852
Who would take you in now you're one of us?

277
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,748
Tommy, let it go. Tommy, please let it go.

278
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,902
I'm telling Mommy.

279
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,002
Is that a mutant?

280
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,350
«UN summit. With the leaders
of over 200 nations attending,

281
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,904
the Secret Service has transformed
Ellis Island into a veritable Fort Knox

282
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:09,555
for tomorrow night's opening gala.
Ellis Island rests less than one mile from...

283
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,693
Rogue.

284
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,865
Bobby.

285
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:20,857
Rogue, what did you do? They say
you're stealing other mutants' powers.

286
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:23,406
No. I borrowed his power.

287
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:27,958
You never use your power
against another mutant.

288
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,479
I had no choice.

289
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:35,592
- No, you have to understand...
- If l were you I'd get myself outta here.

290
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,672
- What do you mean?
- Listen, the students are freaked.

291
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:46,506
Professor Xavier's furious.
I don't know what he'll do with you.

292
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,900
I think it'll be easier on your own.

293
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,766
You should go.

294
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:26,386
What are you looking for, Eric?
It's strange.

295
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:31,334
There are more powerful mutants out there.
Why should this one be so important to him?

296
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,193
- Maybe it's his way with people.
- You don't like him.

297
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,960
- How could you tell?
- Well, !am psychic, you know.

298
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,542
- Where is she?
- Who?

299
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,957
Rogue.

300
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,669
She's gone.

301
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,522
Welcome, Professor.

302
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:59,127
Welcome to Cerebro.

303
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:06,948
This certainly is a big, round room.

304
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,361
The brain waves of mutants
are different from average humans.

305
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:15,505
This device amplifies my power, allowing me
to locate mutants across great distances.

306
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:20,314
- That's how I intend to find Rogue.
- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto?

307
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:25,025
I've been trying, but he's found
some way to shield himself from it.

308
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,466
How would he know how to do that?

309
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,100
Because he helped me build it.

310
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,482
Now if you'll excuse me...

311
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,971
Have you ever...?

312
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,153
Used Cerebro?

313
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,352
No.

314
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:58,434
It takes a degree of control and...
for someone like me, it's...

315
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,540
Dangerous.

316
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,192
«how boarding at track 4.

317
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,079
- She's at the station.
- Where is it?

318
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:52,358
A few miles west of here. You can't leave the
mansion. It's the opportunity Magneto needs.

319
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,390
- Listen, I'm the reason she took off.
- We had a deal.

320
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,407
She's all right. She's just upset.

321
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,810
Storm, Cyclops, find her.
See if you can talk to her.

322
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:15,367
- What?
- Where's my motorcycle?

323
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,413
Hey, kid.

324
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,850
I'm sorry about last night.

325
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,534
Me, too.

326
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:18,404
You running again?

327
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,447
I heard the professor was mad at me.

328
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,913
- Who told you that?
- A boy at school.

329
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:31,094
- When's the last time you saw her?
- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.

330
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:38,826
You look around,
I'll check with the ticket agent.

331
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,603
Welcome, Professor.

332
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:23,836
- You think I should go back.
- [ think you should follow your instincts.

333
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:34,683
The first boy I ever kissed
ended up in acoma for three weeks.

334
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:39,825
I can still feel him inside my head.

335
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:44,475
And it's the same with you.

336
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,382
There's not many people
that'll understand what you're going through.

337
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,786
But I think this guy Xavier's one of them.

338
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,524
He seems to genuinely wanna help you.

339
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:26,218
And that's a rare thing.

340
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,759
For people like us.

341
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,237
OK, so...

342
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:46,383
What do you say?
Give these geeks one more shot?

343
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,042
Come on, I'll take care of you.

344
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:55,657
- You promise?
- Yeah.

345
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,891
Yeah, I promise.

346
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,848
Come along now. I told you not to...

347
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:20,948
She's about 17, my height,
has brown hair and she...

348
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,273
Scream for me.

349
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,723
Quit playing around.

350
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,564
You must be Wolverine.

351
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:09,125
That remarkable metal doesn't run through
your entire body, does it?

352
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,610
Stop!

353
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:23,538
Stop it!

354
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,511
- What the hell do you want with me?
- You? My dear boy!

355
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,539
Whoever said I wanted you?

356
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,423
Young people!

357
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,680
All right, hold it. Hold it right there.

358
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:13,073
Stay where you are,
put your hands over your heads. Now.

359
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:47,325
You Homo sapiens and your guns.

360
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,355
- That's enough, Eric.
- Let them go.

361
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,846
Why not come out where I can see you,
Charles?

362
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,316
What do you want her for?

363
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:11,282
Can't you read my mind?

364
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,676
What now? Save the girl?

365
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,480
You'll have to kill me, Charles.
And what will that accomplish?

366
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:25,471
Let them pass that law and they'll have you
in chains with a number on your forehead.

367
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,440
- It won't be that way.
- Then kill me and find out.

368
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,346
No? Then release me.

369
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,384
Fine.

370
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,468
Care to press your luck, Charles?

371
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,809
I don't think I can stop them all.

372
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:28,384
Still unwilling to make sacrifices.
That's what makes you weak.

373
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,981
Goodbye, Charles.

374
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,370
- You said he wanted me.
- [made a terrible mistake.

375
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,170
His helmet was somehow designed
to block my telepathy.

376
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,892
Couldn't see what he was after
till it was too late.

377
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,275
- Where are you going?
- To find her.

378
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,330
- How?
- The traditional way: look.

379
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,424
- Logan, you can't do this alone.
- Who'll help me? You?

380
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:41,321
- So far, you've all done a bang-up job.
- Then help us. Fight with us.

381
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:44,442
Fight with you? Join the team? Be an X-Man?

382
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:47,355
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're a mutant.

383
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,284
The world is full of people
that hate and fear you

384
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:55,134
and you're wasting your time trying
to protect them. I got better things to do.

385
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,936
You know, Magneto's right.
There's a war coming.

386
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:02,969
- Are you sure you're on the right side?
- At least I've chosen a side.

387
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,404
I'm looking for Dr Jean Grey.

388
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,187
Senator Kelly.

389
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:29,593
I'm Professor Charles Xavier.

390
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:33,823
I was afraid if 1 went to hospital,
they would...

391
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:36,281
Treat you like a mutant?

392
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:42,149
We're not what you think. Not all of us.

393
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:45,982
Tell it to the ones who did this to me.

394
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:52,571
Senator...

395
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,697
I want you to try and relax.

396
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,337
I'm not going to hurt you.

397
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,175
Welcome to the future.

398
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:03,368
Brother.

399
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:12,936
The machine emits radiation that triggers
mutation in ordinary human beings.

400
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:17,140
But the mutation is unnatural.
Kelly's body is rejecting it.

401
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:21,614
- His cells began to break down immediately.
- What effect does it have on mutants?

402
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:27,031
There appears to be none. But I fear
it will harm any normal person exposed to it.

403
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:31,187
- So what does Magneto want with Rogue?
- [don't know.

404
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:39,085
Wait a second. You said this machine
draws its power from Magneto.

405
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:44,656
- And that it weakened him.
- Yes. In fact, it nearly killed him.

406
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:50,718
He's going to transfer his power to Rogue
and use her to power the machine.

407
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,257
Is somebody there?

408
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,581
Yes. I'm here.

409
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:04,915
Please don't leave me.

410
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,808
I don't want to be alone.

411
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,111
All right.

412
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,859
Do you hate normal people?

413
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:28,994
Sometimes.

414
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,930
Why?

415
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:37,736
I suppose...

416
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:41,299
I'm afraid of them.

417
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,683
Well,

418
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:51,166
I think you've got one less person...
to be afraid of.

419
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:18,817
Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet.
I'm gonna find Rogue. Get Logan a uniform.

420
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:22,109
Wait a minute.
He's not coming with us, is he?

421
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,792
- Yes.
- Sorry, but he'll endanger the mission and...

422
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:29,029
I wasn't the one who gave the station
a new sunroof, pal.

423
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,029
No, you were the one
who stabbed Rogue in the chest.

424
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:35,229
Why don't you take your little mission
and stick it up...

425
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,915
Senator Kelly is dead.

426
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,830
I'm going to find her.

427
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:45,958
Settle this.

428
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:25,607
I'm sorry.

429
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,666
You can still hear me... can't you?

430
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:05,344
You've taught me everything in my life
that was ever worth knowing.

431
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:08,112
And if anything happens...

432
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,504
I'll take care of them.

433
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,986
Jean?

434
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,651
Jean.

435
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,053
No!

436
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,692
Jean?

437
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,797
Jean.

438
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:54,966
Answer me. Please.

439
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,489
I know where Magneto's going.

440
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:20,448
Magnificent, isn't she?

441
01:07:21,905 --> 01:07:26,325
- I've seen it.
- I first saw her in 1949.

442
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:31,650
America was going to be
the land of tolerance. Of peace.

443
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,043
Are you going to kill me?

444
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,910
Yes.

445
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:49,756
- Why?
- Because there is no land of tolerance.

446
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:53,796
There is no peace, not here or anywhere else.

447
01:07:55,638 --> 01:08:00,388
Whole families destroyed simply because
they were born different from those in power.

448
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:05,657
Well, after tonight,
the world's powerful will be just like us.

449
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,786
They will return home as brothers.

450
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:11,399
As mutants.

451
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:13,958
Our cause will be theirs.

452
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:18,075
Your sacrifice will mean our survival.

453
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:25,800
I'll understand
if that comes as small consolation.

454
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,018
Put her in the machine.

455
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,819
I'll raise it.

456
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,499
Magneto is here - Liberty Island.

457
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:44,171
Presumably his objective is to mutate the
world leaders at the summit on Ellis Island.

458
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:48,714
He doesn't know his machine kills,
and judging from what the professor saw,

459
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:54,432
if Magneto gave Rogue enough power,
he could wipe out everyone in New York City.

460
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:58,453
All right. We insert here
at the George Washington Bridge.

461
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:03,548
Come around the bank, just off of Manhattan,
land on the far side of Liberty Island. Here.

462
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,176
What about harbor patrol? Radar?

463
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:09,919
If they have anything that can pick up our jet,
they deserve to catch us.

464
01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:27,573
You actually go outside in these things?

465
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:31,286
What would you prefer? Yellow spandex?

466
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:39,611
Whoa.

467
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:24,165
There's the bridge.
I'm takin’ her down.

468
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,174
Storm. Some cover, please.

469
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:55,625
Toad, Mystique, stay sharp. We're not alone.

470
01:10:56,285 --> 01:11:00,825
And you stay here. Once I've given my power
to the girl, I'll be temporarily weakened.

471
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,731
You'll be my only defense.

472
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:12,947
Sounds like a storm's comin’.

473
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:30,711
- Sorry.
- You call that a landing?

474
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,816
The torch.

475
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:57,349
.the proceedings. The first dignitaries
started to arrive about an hour ago,

476
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,607
greeted with a garden-party atmosphere
designed to entertain them

477
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:04,441
as the others traversed the rigid security.

478
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:32,659
- There's someone here.
- Where?

479
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:36,593
- [ don't know. Keep your eye open.
- Logan...

480
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,273
Damn it.

481
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:52,127
- Anything?
- There's someone here. I just can't see 'em.

482
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:06,684
Wait!

483
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:15,822
Back up. Back up.

484
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:34,245
Jean!

485
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,018
Oh, God.

486
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:39,029
Don't move.

487
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:58,325
Don't you people ever die?

488
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:35,694
Do you know what happens to a toad
when it's struck by lightning?

489
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:44,857
The same thing
that happens to everything else.

490
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:01,959
Logan, is that you?

491
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:16,292
The other one ain't far away.

492
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:20,609
- Come on. We have to regroup.
- [ know, but there's a problem.

493
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:26,596
You're not part of the group.

494
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:49,978
It's me.

495
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:52,439
- Prove it.
- You're a dick.

496
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,643
OK.

497
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:20,713
- Everybody get out of here.
- What is it?

498
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,009
I can't move.

499
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:46,436
My brothers. Welcome.

500
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:51,467
And you, just point those claws
of yours in a safer direction.

501
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:07,771
You better close your eyes.

502
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:12,822
Storm, fry 'em.

503
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:19,665
A bolt of lightning into a huge copper
conductor. I thought you lived at a school.

504
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:29,364
For those of you not familiar
with the historical significance...

505
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,186
Mystique?

506
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:40,613
- Mystique.
- I've seen Senator Kelly.

507
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:46,603
So, the good senator survived his fall.
And the swim to shore.

508
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,699
He's become even more powerful
than I imagined.

509
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:52,462
- He's dead.
- It's true.

510
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:56,521
I saw him die.
Like those people down there will die.

511
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:00,349
Are you sure you saw what you saw?

512
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:04,583
1 would also like to thank the
President of the United States of America

513
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:10,277
for hosting this event under the lights
of the great city of New York.

514
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:21,807
Why do none of you understand
what I'm trying to do?

515
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:27,251
Those people down there control our fate
and the fate of every other mutant.

516
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:31,258
Well,

517
01:20:31,727 --> 01:20:33,947
soon our fate will be theirs.

518
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:37,266
Help! Please help me!

519
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:43,267
You're so full of shit. If you're really
so righteous, it'd be you in that thing.

520
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:49,205
Help! Somebody help me!

521
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,274
Please!

522
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:08,968
Somebody please help me!

523
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:16,826
Somebody! Help me...

524
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,500
Logan!

525
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:29,138
- I'm sorry, my dear.
- Don't do this.

526
01:22:42,024 --> 01:22:43,774
This is mine.

527
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:48,829
You owe me a scream.

528
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,974
Hey, bub, I'm not finished with you yet.

529
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:02,505
- Jean.
- Scott, when I tell you, open your eyes.

530
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:03,821
- No.
- Trust me.

531
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:06,326
You drop something?

532
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:12,358
Now!

533
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:28,602
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

534
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:33,514
- Gotta get her outta there. Can you hit it?
- The rings are moving too fast.

535
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,632
- Shoot it.
- I'll kill her! Storm, can you get me up?

536
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:39,949
- l can't control it like that.
- Then let me go.

537
01:24:42,044 --> 01:24:46,494
If I don't make it,
at least you can still blast the damn thing.

538
01:24:47,983 --> 01:24:51,493
All right, do it.
Jean, use your power. Try to steady him.

539
01:24:53,622 --> 01:24:55,402
Hang on to something.

540
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:52,492
Scott, wait!

541
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:24,260
- Jean, I have to!
- Just wait!

542
01:26:26,448 --> 01:26:28,668
I have a shot.

543
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:30,757
I'm taking it.

544
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:13,369
Come on...

545
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:47,339
This one's alive. Let's get him outta here.

546
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:17,222
Welcome back. I knew you'd find your way.

547
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,603
I had you to guide me.

548
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:25,164
How did we do?

549
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:55,395
That tickles.

550
01:29:55,824 --> 01:29:57,574
Hey.

551
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:02,646
How are you feeling?

552
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,844
Fantastic.

553
01:30:06,368 --> 01:30:08,588
That was a brave thing you did.

554
01:30:10,305 --> 01:30:12,585
- Did it work?
- Yeah.

555
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:19,053
She's fine. She took on a few of your
more charming personality traits for a while.

556
01:30:20,849 --> 01:30:22,989
But we lived through it.

557
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:28,166
I think she's a little taken with you.

558
01:30:28,657 --> 01:30:32,577
Well, you can tell her
my heart belongs to someone else.

559
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:39,923
You know, you and I...

560
01:30:40,335 --> 01:30:42,085
How's the professor?

561
01:30:44,306 --> 01:30:46,236
He's good.

562
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:48,425
Good.

563
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:57,191
There's an abandoned military compound
at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies

564
01:30:57,886 --> 01:31:01,456
close to where we found you.
There's not much left but...

565
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:04,263
you might find some answers.

566
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:10,241
- Thank you.
- Are you going to say goodbye to them?

567
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:16,085
The Mutant Registration Act
Jost its main proponent

568
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:19,034
with the reversal of Senator Robert Kelly

569
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:23,411
who until now had provided the loudest
voice in the cry for mutant registration.

570
01:31:24,112 --> 01:31:29,272
1 was wrong in this particular issue and!
hope, in time, l may be forgiven. Thank you.

571
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,811
The Mutant Registration Act
continues to draw support...

572
01:31:33,355 --> 01:31:35,105
Mystique.

573
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:38,237
Son of a bitch.

574
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:45,395
«from many parents' rights groups
who feel threatened by unidentified mutants.

575
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:51,941
In a related story, the body of Senator Kelly's
aide, Henry Guyrich, was found today.

576
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:57,624
Preliminary coroner's reports seem to
indicate that Guyrich was mauled by a bear.

577
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:07,993
- You running again?
- Not really.

578
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:12,397
I have some things to take care of up north.

579
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:20,159
I kinda like it.

580
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:26,612
I don't want you to go.

581
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,361
I'll be back for this.

582
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,812
Doesn't it ever wake you in the night,

583
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:27,654
the feeling that some day they will pass
that foolish law, or one just like it,

584
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,246
and come for you?

585
01:33:30,672 --> 01:33:33,132
And your children?

586
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:39,237
It does indeed.

587
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:45,931
What do you do when you wake up to that?

588
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:52,464
I feel a swell of pity for the poor soul who
comes to that school looking for trouble.

589
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:03,686
Why do you come here, Charles?

590
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:07,174
Why do you ask questions
to which you already know the answers?

591
01:34:07,742 --> 01:34:11,522
Oh, yes. Your continuing search for hope.

592
01:34:22,724 --> 01:34:26,064
You know this plastic prison of theirs
won't hold me forever.

593
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:31,474
The war is still coming, Charles,
and I intend to fight it.

594
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:35,260
By any means necessary.

595
01:34:35,803 --> 01:34:38,413
And I will always be there.

596
01:34:39,908 --> 01:34:42,048
Old friend.

597
