1
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,593
The world is changed.

2
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,796
! feel it in the water.

3
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,522
! feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,104
! smell it in the air.

5
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,518
Much that once was...

6
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,320
. AS lost

7
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,879
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,971
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.

9
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,376
Three were given fo the Elves.

10
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:18,115
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

11
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,456
Seven to the Dwarf-lords:

12
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:26,352
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:28,434
And nine...

14
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,449
..nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...

15
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,395
... who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:41,567
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will fo govern each race.

17
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,484
But they were ail of them deceived.

18
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,950
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,207
!n the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

20
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:58,001
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...

21
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,482
...f0 control all others.

22
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:04,401
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

23
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,782
..and his will fo dominate all life.

24
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,693
One Ring fo rule them all.

25
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,462
One by one...

26
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,970
...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell fo the power of the Ring.

27
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,405
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:29,378
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,220
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

30
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,365
Victory was near.

31
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,009
But the power of the Ring...

32
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,292
... could not be undone.

33
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,791
It was in this moment...

34
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,333
... when all hope had faded...

35
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,426
...that Isifdur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:26,704
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

37
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,277
The Ring passed fo Isildur...

38
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,497
... who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,585
But the hearts of Men...

40
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,240
..are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,857
And the Ring of Power
has a will of ifs own.

42
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,373
It betrayed Isildur fo his death.

43
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,472
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

44
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,193
... were lost.

45
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,276
History became legend...

46
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,499
.. legend became myth.

47
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,471
And for
two and a half thousand years...

48
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:24,271
...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.

49
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,818
Until, when chance came...

50
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,579
.. if ensnared a new bearer.

51
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,613
My precious.

52
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,661
The Ring came fo the creature
Gollum...

53
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,633
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

54
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,931
And there it consumed him.

55
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,260
It came to me.

56
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,616
My own. My love. My own.

57
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,455
My precious.

58
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,650
The Ring brought fo Gollum
unnatural long life.

59
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,637
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

60
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:15,348
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.

61
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,982
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

62
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,136
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

63
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,142
... whispers of a nameless fear.

64
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,585
And the Ring of Power perceived...

65
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,649
... Its time had now come.

66
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,737
It abandoned Gollum.

67
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,684
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.

68
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,109
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

69
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:48,808
What's this?

70
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,435
A Hobbit.

71
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,210
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

72
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,297
A ring.

73
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,354
Lost!

74
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,306
My precious is lost!

75
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,977
For the time will soon come...

76
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:11,033
... when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

77
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,287
Down from the door where it began

78
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,902
And must follow if i can

79
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,997
The road goes ever on and on

80
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,758
Down from the door where it began

81
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,688
Now far ahead the road has gone

82
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,260
-And ! must follow if! can
-You're late.

83
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:11,361
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

84
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,662
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

85
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,268
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

86
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,832
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

87
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,260
What news of the outside world?
Tell me everything.

88
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,132
Everything? You're far too eager
and curious for a Hobbit.

89
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,051
Most unnatural.

90
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,021
Well, what can I tell you?

91
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,270
Life in the wide world goes on
much as it has this past Age.

92
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,258
Full of its own comings and goings.

93
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,327
Scarcely aware of the existence
of Hobbits.

94
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,601
For which I am very thankful.

95
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,628
It's Gandalfl

96
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,739
The long-expected party.

97
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,735
How is the old rascal?

98
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,167
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

99
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,406
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

100
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,470
Well, that should please him.

101
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,965
-Half the Shire's been invited.
-Gracious me.

102
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,065
-He's up to something.
-Oh, really?

103
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,266
All right, then. Keep your secrets.

104
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,869
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

105
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,028
Indeed.

106
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,256
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

107
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:04,291
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

108
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:08,338
All l did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

109
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,608
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

110
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,150
Oh, really?

111
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,723
Gandalf! Gandalfl

112
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,179
Fireworks, Gandalfl

113
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,742
-Gandalfl
-Fireworks, Gandalfl

114
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,617
Gandalf?

115
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,832
-I'm glad you're back.
-So am I, dear boy.

116
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,040
Soaml.

117
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,391
No, thank you!

118
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:43,226
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

119
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,003
And what about very old friends?

120
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,130
Gandalf?

121
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,046
-Bilbo Baggins.
-My dear Gandalfl

122
00:11:56,683 --> 00:12:01,103
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

123
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,239
You haven't aged a day.

124
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,895
Come on, come in!

125
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,414
Welcome, welcome.

126
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,124
Oh, here we are.

127
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,281
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

128
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,084
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

129
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,318
Very good year. Almost as old as ! am.

130
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,906
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

131
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,968
Just tea, thank you.

132
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,164
l was expecting you sometime
last week.

133
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,468
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

134
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:57,706
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

135
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,444
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

136
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,478
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

137
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:10,163
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

138
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,347
I've just found some sponge cake.

139
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,732
I could make you some eggs
if you'd--

140
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,074
-Just tea, thank you.
-Oh, right.

141
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,528
-You don't mind if ! eat, do you?
-No, not at all.

142
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,581
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

143
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,380
I'm not at home!

144
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,952
l've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

145
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,249
...never giving me a moment's peace.

146
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,814
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalfl

147
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:46,432
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

148
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,640
-So you mean to go through with your plan?
-Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

149
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,287
All the arrangements are made.

150
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,005
Oh, thank you.

151
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,483
Frodo suspects something.

152
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,082
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

153
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,855
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

154
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,198
You will tell him, won't you?

155
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,194
-Yes, yes.
-He's very fond of you.

156
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,023
I know.

157
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,510
He'd probably come with me
if l asked him.

158
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,547
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

159
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,579
The woods, the fields.

160
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,117
Little rivers.

161
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,245
lam old, Gandalf.

162
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:44,576
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

163
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,607
feel thin.

164
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,613
Sort of stretched...

165
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,026
.. like butter scraped
over too much bread.

166
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,529
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

167
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,077
And don't expect I shall return.

168
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,486
In fact, ! mean not to.

169
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:16,182
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

170
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,313
Gandalf, my old friend...

171
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,293
... this will be a night to remember.

172
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:03,355
Hello, hello.

173
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,299
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

174
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,055
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

175
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,110
-[ think I'll just have another ale.
-Oh, no, you don't.

176
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,191
Go on!

177
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,166
So there I was...

178
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:36,162
..at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

179
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,613
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

180
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,145
.. about how they were
going to cook us.

181
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:46,054
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

182
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,810
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

183
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,607
.. that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

184
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,268
..and turned them all to stone!

185
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,016
Quickly.

186
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,137
Up they go!

187
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,317
No, the big one.

188
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,454
-Done!
-You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

189
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,204
-It is in the ground.
-Outside!

190
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,009
This was your idea.

191
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,233
Watch out for the dragon!

192
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,632
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

193
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,615
-That was good.
-Let's get another one.

194
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,340
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

195
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,738
I might've Known.

196
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,652
Speech, Bilbo!

197
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,012
Speech!

198
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,194
Speech!

199
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,677
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

200
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,683
... looks and Brandybucks...

201
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,345
..Grubbs, Chubbs...

202
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:46,758
... Hornblowers...

203
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,520
...Bolgers...

204
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,466
...Bracegirdles...

205
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,144
-...and Proudfoots.
-Proudfeet!

206
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,419
Today is my 111th birthday!

207
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,914
Happy birthday!

208
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:07,092
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

209
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,363
.. such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

210
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,051
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

211
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:18,627
..and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

212
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,245
I have things to do.

213
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,812
I've put this off far too long.

214
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,376
I regret to announce this is the end!

215
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,041
I'm going now.

216
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,843
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

217
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,645
Goodbye.

218
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,813
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

219
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

220
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:42,393
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

221
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,111
It was just a bit of fun.

222
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,861
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

223
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,815
-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
-Two eyes.

224
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,793
As often as I can spare them.

225
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,073
-I'm leaving everything to him.
-What about this ring of yours?

226
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,589
-ls that staying too?
-Yes, yes.

227
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,030
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

228
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,198
No. Wait, it's...

229
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,444
... here in my pocket.

230
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:25,208
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

231
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,356
Yet, after all, why not?

232
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:36,638
-Why shouldn't I keep it?
-[ think you should leave the ring behind.

233
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,560
Is that so hard?

234
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,202
Well, no.

235
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,076
And yes.

236
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,933
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

237
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,092
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

238
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,201
-There's no need to get angry.
-Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

239
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,763
It's mine.

240
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,356
My own.

241
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,498
-My precious.
-Precious?

242
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,713
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

243
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,546
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

244
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,465
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

245
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,521
-You want it for yourself!
-Bilbo Baggins!

246
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,794
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

247
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,762
lam not trying to rob you.

248
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,741
I'm trying to help you.

249
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,354
All your long years,
we've been friends.

250
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,034
Trust me as you once did.

251
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,779
Let it go.

252
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,275
You're right, Gandalf.

253
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,985
The ring must go to Frodo.

254
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,256
It's late. The road is long.

255
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,007
Yes, it is time.

256
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,815
The ring is still in your pocket.

257
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,522
I've thought up an ending for my book:

258
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:58,953
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

259
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,732
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

260
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,436
Goodbye, Gandalf.

261
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,663
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

262
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,544
The road goes ever on and on

263
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,497
Until our next meeting.

264
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:58,581
It's mine. My own.

265
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:02,188
My precious.

266
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,418
Riddles in the dark.

267
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,298
Bilbo!

268
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,978
Bilbo!

269
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,420
My precious.

270
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,343
Precious.

271
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,005
He's gone, hasn't he?

272
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,780
He talked for so long about leaving...

273
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,760
...[ didn't think he'd really do it.

274
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,237
Gandalf?

275
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,234
Bilbo's ring.

276
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,860
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

277
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:53,069
He's left you Bag End.

278
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,276
Along with all his possessions.

279
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,282
The ring is yours now.

280
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,296
-Put it somewhere out of sight.
-Where are you going?

281
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,891
-There are some things that I must see to.
-What things?

282
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:15,116
-Questions. Questions that need answering.
-You've only just arrived.

283
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,822
I don't understand.

284
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:23,381
Neither do I.

285
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,802
Keep it secret.

286
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,833
Keep it safe.

287
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,924
Shire!

288
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:11,214
Baggins!

289
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,725
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

290
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:07,151
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

291
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:11,106
..and the finding
of the Ring of Power."

292
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,669
"It has come fo me.

293
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,135
The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

294
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:23,786
All those who follow in my bloodline
Shall be bound to ifs fate...

295
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,743
.. for I will risk
no hurt fo the Ring.

296
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,610
It is precious fo me...

297
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,120
.. though I buy it with great pain.

298
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:41,273
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

299
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,250
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

300
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,595
A secret now
that only fire can tell."

301
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,188
Shire.

302
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,479
Baggins.

303
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,788
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

304
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,301
That way.

305
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,589
-Good night.
-Good night.

306
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,826
Good night, Sam.

307
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,334
Is it secret? Is it safe?

308
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,415
What are you doing?

309
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,540
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

310
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,080
It's quite cool.

311
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,281
What can you see?

312
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,378
Can you see anything?

313
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,640
Nothing.

314
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,205
There's nothing.

315
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:47,835
Wait.

316
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,110
There are markings.

317
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,860
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

318
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,681
There are few who can.

319
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:06,811
The language is that of Mordor,
which will not utter here.

320
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:08,936
Mordor!

321
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,084
In the common tongue, it says:

322
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,639
"One Ring to rule them all...

323
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,357
...One Ring to find them...

324
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,773
...One Ring to bring them all...

325
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,972
..and in the darkness bind them."

326
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,763
This is the One Ring...

327
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:31,849
.. forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

328
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:36,231
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

329
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,746
Bilbo found it.

330
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,229
-In Gollum's cave.
-Yes.

331
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,647
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

332
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,399
... prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

333
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,350
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

334
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,221
The Ring has awoken.

335
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:01,057
It's heard its master's call.

336
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,020
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

337
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,035
No, Frodo.

338
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,132
The spirit of Sauron endured.

339
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:22,456
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

340
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,305
Sauron has returned.

341
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,318
His Orcs have multiplied.

342
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,320
His fortress at Barad-ddr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

343
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:37,208
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

344
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,799
He is seeking it.

345
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,658
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

346
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,729
For the Ring yearns above all else...

347
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:50,285
.. to return to the hand
of its master.

348
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,452
They are one...

349
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,624
.. the Ring and the Dark Lord.

350
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,091
Frodo...

351
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,476
..he must never find it.

352
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:00,701
All right.

353
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,959
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

354
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,994
No one Knows it's here, do they?

355
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,075
Do they, Gandalf?

356
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:19,281
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

357
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,559
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

358
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,004
But the enemy found him first.

359
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,209
! don't know how long
they tortured him.

360
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:34,629
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

361
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,283
Shire!

362
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,149
Baggins!

363
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,160
Shire.

364
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,106
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

365
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,182
Who goes there?

366
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,145
Take it, Gandalfl

367
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,596
-Take it!
-No, Frodo.

368
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,011
-You must take it!
-You cannot offer me this ring!

369
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,430
-I'm giving it to you!
-Don't tempt me, Frodo!

370
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,268
I dare not take it.

371
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,044
Not even to keep it safe.

372
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,194
Understand, Frodo...

373
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,337
... would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

374
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:23,199
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

375
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:27,076
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.

376
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,701
No, it can't.

377
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,507
What must I do?

378
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:42,444
-You must leave. And leave quickly.
-Where? Where do ! go?

379
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,951
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

380
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,578
Bree.

381
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,348
-What about you?
-I'll be waiting for you...

382
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,059
..at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

383
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,838
-And the Ring will be safe there?
-I don't know, Frodo.

384
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,225
I don't have any answers.

385
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:05,792
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

386
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,545
He'll Know what to do.

387
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,961
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

388
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,680
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

389
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,580
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

390
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,428
I can cut across country
easily enough.

391
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,493
My dear Frodo.

392
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,615
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

393
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,711
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

394
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,344
And yet, after a hundred years...

395
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,614
.. they can still surprise you.

396
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,644
Get down.

397
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:56,154
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

398
00:35:56,755 --> 00:36:00,655
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

399
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,529
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

400
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,515
-l heard raised voices.
-What did you hear? Speak!

401
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,022
Nothing important.

402
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,299
That is, l heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--

403
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,194
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

404
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,906
No?

405
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,301
Perhaps not.

406
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,705
I've thought of a better use for you.

407
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:31,517
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

408
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,318
Be careful, both of you.

409
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,290
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

410
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,447
Birds, beasts.

411
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,178
Is it safe?

412
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,305
Never put it on...

413
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,662
.. for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

414
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,567
Always remember, Frodo...

415
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,059
.. the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

416
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,685
It wants to be found.

417
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,422
This is it.

418
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,897
This is what?

419
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,307
If ltake one more step...

420
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:51,466
.. it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

421
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,497
Come on, Sam.

422
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,723
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

423
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,826
-"It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
-"Going out your door.

424
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:16,357
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

425
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:20,721
... there's no Knowing where
you might be swept off fo."

426
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,247
Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.

427
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,253
The hour grows fate.

428
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,788
And Gandalf the Grey
rides to isengard...

429
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,571
... seeking my counsel.

430
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,528
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

431
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,316
My old friend.

432
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,144
Saruman.

433
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,807
-You are sure of this?
-Beyond any doubt.

434
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,004
So the Ring of Power has been found.

435
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,263
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

436
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,700
-Under my very nose.
-Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

437
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,560
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

438
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:31,489
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

439
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,527
Time?

440
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,952
What time do you think we have?

441
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,142
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

442
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,739
He cannot yet take physical form...

443
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,582
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

444
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:52,035
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

445
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:58,430
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

446
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:03,415
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

447
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:09,332
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

448
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,525
The Eye of Sauron.

449
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,227
He is gathering all evil to him.

450
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:20,027
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army
great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

451
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,062
You know this?

452
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,198
How?

453
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,417
I have seen it.

454
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,869
A palantir is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

455
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:33,273
Why?

456
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,332
Why should we fear to use it?

457
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:42,784
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

458
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,284
We do not know who else
may be watching.

459
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,680
The hour is later than you think.

460
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,263
Sauron's forces are already moving.

461
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,218
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

462
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,778
The Nine?

463
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,749
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

464
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,665
... disguised as riders in black.

465
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,678
-They've reached the Shire?
-They will find the Ring.

466
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,704
And kill the one who carries it.

467
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,830
Frodo!

468
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,490
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

469
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,252
There are none who can.

470
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,498
Against the power of Mordor...

471
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,311
.. there can be no victory.

472
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,388
We must join with him, Gandalf.

473
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,156
We must join with Sauron.

474
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,421
It would be wise, my friend.

475
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,491
Tell me...

476
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:02,723
.. friend...

477
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,865
.. when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

478
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,455
I gave you the chance...

479
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,138
...of aiding me willingly...

480
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:57,301
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

481
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,375
Mr. Frodo?

482
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,747
Frodo? Frodo!

483
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:29,214
-l thought I'd lost you.
-What are you talking about?

484
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,437
-It's just something Gandalf said.
-What did he say?

485
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,073
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And don't mean to.

486
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,972
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

487
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:45,292
Frodo.

488
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,645
-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
-Hello, Frodo.

489
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,356
Get off him.

490
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,317
Come on, Frodo.

491
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:53,336
What's the meaning of this?

492
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,718
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

493
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,078
You get back here!

494
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,511
Get out of my field!

495
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:05,363
You know what's gonna happen
when I catch up with you?

496
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,520
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

497
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,035
And some cabbages.

498
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,928
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

499
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:17,021
-And then the mushrooms the week before.
-Yes, Pippin. My point is...

500
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,622
.. he's clearly overreacting.

501
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,401
Run!

502
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:37,296
Oh, that was close.

503
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,459
I think I've broken something.

504
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,927
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

505
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:48,602
What? That was just a detour.
A shortcut.

506
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,209
-Shortcut to what?
-Mushrooms!

507
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,508
That's mine.

508
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,865
That's nice, Merry.

509
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,387
Here's a nice one, Sam.

510
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,058
I think we should get off the road.

511
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:21,785
Get off the road!

512
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:23,462
Quick!

513
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,644
Be quiet!

514
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,035
What was that?

515
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,279
Anything?

516
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,495
Nothing.

517
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,397
What is going on?

518
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,583
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

519
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,386
Get down!

520
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:53,432
I have to leave the Shire.

521
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:56,822
Sam and! must get to Bree.

522
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,534
Right.

523
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,004
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

524
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:11,758
Run!

525
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,874
This way! Follow me!

526
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:19,625
Run!

527
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,630
Get the rope, Sam!

528
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:38,821
Frodo!

529
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:40,977
Run, Frodo!

530
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,445
Gol
-Hurry!

531
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,063
Frodo, come on!

532
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,103
-Come on! Faster!
-Jump!

533
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,959
-How far to the nearest crossing?
-The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

534
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,369
Come on.

535
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:37,792
-What do you want?
-We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

536
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,232
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

537
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,738
-What business brings you to Bree?
-We wish to stay at the inn.

538
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,129
Our business is our own.

539
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,774
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

540
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:55,477
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

541
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,480
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

542
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,896
Can't be too careful.

543
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:23,958
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

544
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:49,875
Excuse me.

545
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,788
Good evening, little masters.

546
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:57,474
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

547
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,862
Mister...?

548
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,202
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

549
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:06,945
-Undernhill, yes.
-We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

550
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,211
-Can you tell him we've arrived?
-Gandalf?

551
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,551
Gandalf.

552
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,060
Oh, yes...

553
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:17,316
...l remember. Elderly chap.

554
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,518
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

555
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,855
Not seen him for six months.

556
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,027
What do we do now?

557
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,505
Sam...

558
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,470
.. he'll be here. He'll come.

559
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,275
Get out of my way!

560
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,368
What's that?

561
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,964
This, my friend, is a pint.

562
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,906
It comes in pints?

563
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,729
-I'm getting one.
-You got a whole half already!

564
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,856
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

565
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,173
Excuse me.

566
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,796
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

567
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:24,207
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

568
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:28,942
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

569
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:32,965
Strider.

570
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,003
Baggins.

571
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,176
Baggins.

572
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,674
Baggins? Sure, I Know a Baggins.

573
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,273
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

574
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,509
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

575
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,020
..and my third cousin, twice removed....

576
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,380
-Pippin!
-Steady on, Frodo.

577
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,334
You cannot hide.

578
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,263
I see you.

579
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,743
There is no life...

580
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,204
.. in the void.

581
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:10,956
Only...

582
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:13,359
... death.

583
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:23,836
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

584
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:29,969
What do you want?

585
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,107
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

586
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,430
-l carry nothing.
-Indeed.

587
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,296
I can avoid being seen if! wish...

588
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:42,089
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

589
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,326
-Who are you?
-Are you frightened?

590
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:47,787
Yes.

591
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:51,545
Not nearly frightened enough.
I Know what hunts you.

592
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:58,243
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

593
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:03,794
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

594
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:07,048
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

595
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:08,334
They're coming.

596
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,198
What are they?

597
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,428
They were once Men.

598
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,857
Great kings of Men.

599
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:42,076
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

600
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,816
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

601
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,339
One by one, falling into darkness.

602
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,130
Now they are slaves to his will.

603
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:56,334
They are the Nazg(l.

604
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,147
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

605
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,440
At all times they feel...

606
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,515
... the presence of the Ring...

607
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:07,901
... drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

608
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,045
-Where are you taking us?
-Into the Wild.

609
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:28,081
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

610
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,732
We have no choice but to trust him.

611
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:35,269
-But where is he leading us?
-To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

612
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,721
-To the house of Elrond.
-Did you hear that? Rivendell.

613
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:42,153
Were going to see the Elves.

614
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,196
-Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
-What about breakfast?

615
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,285
-You've already had it.
-We've had one, yes.

616
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,748
What about second breakfast?

617
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:16,203
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

618
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:21,393
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

619
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,892
-He knows about them, doesn't he?
-l wouldn't count on it.

620
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,138
Pippin!

621
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:40,413
The power of isengard
is at your command...

622
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:45,018
... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

623
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:53,962
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

624
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:04,123
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

625
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,841
We have work to do.

626
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:53,853
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

627
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,431
Rip them all down.

628
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:26,667
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sal.

629
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:31,035
We shall rest here tonight.

630
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,059
These are for you.
Keep them close.

631
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,880
I'm going to have a look around.

632
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,251
Stay here.

633
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,948
My tomato's burst.

634
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:00,031
Could ! have some bacon?

635
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,187
Want a tomato, Sam?

636
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:06,042
-What are you doing?!
-Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

637
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,036
-We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
-Put it out, you fools!

638
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:13,076
-Put it out!
-That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

639
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,567
Gol

640
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,494
Back, you devils!

641
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,268
Frodo!

642
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,268
Oh, Sam.

643
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,263
Strider!

644
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:34,962
-Help him, Strider.
-He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

645
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:41,480
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

646
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:47,553
Hurry!

647
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:51,364
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

648
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,725
Hold on, Frodo.

649
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:54,946
Gandalfl

650
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,234
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

651
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:09,007
Is he going to die?

652
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:13,705
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

653
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:22,742
-They're close.
-Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

654
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:24,696
-Athelas?
-Kingsfoil.

655
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,004
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

656
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:29,119
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

657
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,613
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

658
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:13,792
Frodo.

659
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,480
Who is she?

660
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:34,923
Frodo.

661
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:38,417
-She's an Elf.
-He's fading.

662
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:43,080
He's not going to last.

663
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:45,893
We must get him to my father.

664
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:49,473
-I've been looking for you for two days.
-Where are you taking him?

665
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:55,385
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

666
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:04,975
What are they saying?

667
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,649
I do not fear them.

668
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:23,988
Arwen...

669
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:27,170
...fide hard. Don't look back.

670
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:36,412
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

671
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:34,054
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

672
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,574
If you want him, come and claim him.

673
01:12:31,781 --> 01:12:33,951
No. No!

674
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,543
Frodo, no.

675
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,042
Frodo, don't give in.

676
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,275
Not now.

677
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:57,628
What grace is given me...

678
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:00,188
...let it pass to him.

679
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,509
Let him be spared.

680
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,192
Save him.

681
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:22,434
-Where am I?
-You are in the house of Elrond.

682
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:29,209
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

683
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:35,251
-Gandalfl
-Yes, l'm here.

684
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:40,076
And you're lucky to be here too.

685
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:44,690
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

686
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:48,988
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

687
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,322
What happened, Gandalf?

688
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:05,253
-Why didn't you meet us?
-lam sorry, Frodo.

689
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,166
I was delayed.

690
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,972
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

691
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:25,660
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

692
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,932
Embrace the power of the Ring...

693
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,082
...or embrace your own destruction!

694
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:38,100
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

695
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:42,284
Only one who can bend it to his will.

696
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,139
And he does not share power.

697
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:04,827
So you have chosen death.

698
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,684
Gandalf? What is it?

699
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:21,696
Nothing, Frodo.

700
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,251
Frodo!

701
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,964
-Sam.
-Bless you, you're awake!

702
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,857
Sam has hardly left your side.

703
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:33,324
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

704
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:38,442
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

705
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:43,733
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

706
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:35,154
-Bilbo!
-Hello, Frodo, my lad.

707
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,214
Bilbo.

708
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:43,968
"There and Back Again:

709
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,860
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

710
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,372
-This is wonderful.
-I meant to go back...

711
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:57,483
.. wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

712
01:16:58,414 --> 01:17:00,404
... visit Lake-town...

713
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:03,873
...8ee the Lonely Mountain again.

714
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:09,060
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

715
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,320
I miss the Shire.

716
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:28,479
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

717
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:32,571
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

718
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:39,141
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

719
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:47,603
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

720
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:51,155
My dear boy.

721
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:59,017
-Now, what have ! forgotten?
-Packed already?

722
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:01,822
No harm in being prepared.

723
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:04,498
-l thought you wanted to see the Elves.
-l do.

724
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:07,567
-More than anything.
-I did.

725
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:09,787
It's just...

726
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,099
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

727
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,842
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

728
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:20,393
..8eeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

729
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,486
Off home.

730
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,619
You are right, Sam.

731
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,470
We did what we set out to do.

732
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,630
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

733
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:43,016
lam ready to go home.

734
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,996
His strength returns.

735
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:51,765
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

736
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,948
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

737
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:58,714
.. the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

738
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:02,268
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

739
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:07,651
-We can ask no more of Frodo.
-Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

740
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:12,610
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

741
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,845
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

742
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:19,225
Our list of allies grows thin.

743
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:22,816
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

744
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,549
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

745
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:29,366
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

746
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:33,975
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

747
01:19:34,737 --> 01:19:36,847
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

748
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:41,139
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

749
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:45,714
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

750
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:51,041
Gandalf...

751
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:54,738
.. the Ring cannot stay here.

752
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:17,416
This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.

753
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:20,416
They must decide now how fo end it

754
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,950
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

755
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:29,215
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

756
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:34,338
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

757
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:39,058
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

758
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:41,255
Men?

759
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:45,178
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

760
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:49,674
The blood of Numencr is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

761
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:53,599
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

762
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,648
l was there, Gandalf.

763
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:59,041
! was there 3000 years ago...

764
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:08,268
... when Isildur took the Ring.

765
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:12,164
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

766
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,420
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

767
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:22,531
led Isifdur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

768
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:26,312
... where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

769
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:29,202
Cast it into the fire!

770
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:38,059
-Destroy it!
-No.

771
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:41,762
Isildur!

772
01:21:42,498 --> 01:21:46,628
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

773
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:55,060
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

774
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:59,645
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

775
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:04,565
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
-There is one who could unite them.

776
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:08,284
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

777
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:13,736
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

778
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:16,266
He has chosen exile.

779
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,981
The shards of Narsil.

780
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:59,708
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

781
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,105
It's still sharp.

782
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:17,013
But no more than a broken heirloom.

783
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,909
Why do you fear the past?

784
01:23:48,156 --> 01:23:52,876
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

785
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:56,749
You are not bound to his fate.

786
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:01,129
The same blood flows in my veins.

787
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,860
The same weakness.

788
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:12,342
Your time will come.

789
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:16,815
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

790
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,206
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

791
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:16,933
.. forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

792
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,410
And to that I hold.

793
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:24,009
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

794
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:28,053
.. than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

795
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:40,339
I choose a mortal life.

796
01:25:42,104 --> 01:25:45,854
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I will...

797
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:51,800
.. like my heart.

798
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:11,079
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

799
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:15,213
.. you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

800
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:20,614
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

801
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,510
You will unite, or you will fall.

802
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,930
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

803
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,389
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

804
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,360
So it is true.

805
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:07,639
-The doom of Man.
-Itis a gift.

806
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,197
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

807
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:14,197
Why not use this Ring?

808
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:17,426
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

809
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:21,566
... kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

810
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,227
..are your lands kept safe.

811
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:30,111
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

812
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:34,189
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

813
01:27:35,217 --> 01:27:38,817
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

814
01:27:39,521 --> 01:27:42,621
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

815
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:45,108
This is no mere Ranger.

816
01:27:46,328 --> 01:27:49,548
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

817
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:53,045
You owe him your allegiance.

818
01:27:57,506 --> 01:27:59,176
Aragorn.

819
01:28:01,143 --> 01:28:03,573
This is Isildur's heir?

820
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,711
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

821
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:18,414
Gondor has no king.

822
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,149
Gondor needs no king.

823
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:32,257
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

824
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:36,777
You have only one choice.

825
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,465
The Ring must be destroyed.

826
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,300
What are we waiting for?

827
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:02,344
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Gldin...

828
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:06,594
...by any craft that we here possess.

829
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:11,276
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

830
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:15,383
Only there can it be unmade.

831
01:29:16,952 --> 01:29:19,232
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

832
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:24,114
..and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

833
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,474
One of you...

834
01:29:29,231 --> 01:29:31,130
...must do this.

835
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:37,552
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

836
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:42,129
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

837
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:47,011
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

838
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:51,499
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

839
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,564
It is a barren wasteland...

840
01:29:55,023 --> 01:29:58,183
..fiddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

841
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:02,197
The very air you breathe
iS a poisonous fume.

842
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:06,643
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

843
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:11,318
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

844
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,320
And suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

845
01:30:14,843 --> 01:30:18,943
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

846
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:24,348
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elfl

847
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:29,192
Never trust an Elfl

848
01:30:30,692 --> 01:30:35,792
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

849
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:39,381
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

850
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,450
I will take it.

851
01:31:02,691 --> 01:31:04,911
I will take it.

852
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:13,722
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

853
01:31:22,177 --> 01:31:23,286
Though...

854
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:28,164
.... do not know the way.

855
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:34,232
[ will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

856
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:37,916
..as long as it is yours to bear.

857
01:31:39,461 --> 01:31:42,121
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

858
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:44,431
.L will,

859
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,856
You have my sword.

860
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,750
And you have my bow.

861
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:56,799
And my ax.

862
01:32:04,052 --> 01:32:06,712
You carry the fates
of us alll, little one.

863
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:12,310
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

864
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,364
.. then Gondor will see it done.

865
01:32:18,233 --> 01:32:22,423
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
-It is hardly possible to separate you...

866
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:27,514
... even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

867
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:30,346
We're coming too!

868
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:35,077
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

869
01:32:35,617 --> 01:32:38,607
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

870
01:32:39,354 --> 01:32:40,494
woe
Mission.

871
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:42,165
Quest.

872
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:43,661
Thing.

873
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:48,063
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

874
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:51,630
Nine companions.

875
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:55,248
So be it.

876
01:32:55,837 --> 01:32:58,497
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

877
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:01,027
Great!

878
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:03,469
Where are we going?

879
01:33:13,822 --> 01:33:14,842
My old sword!

880
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:16,723
Sting.

881
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:18,145
Here, take it. Take it.

882
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:27,232
-It's so light.
-Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

883
01:33:28,369 --> 01:33:32,029
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

884
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:36,780
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

885
01:33:37,579 --> 01:33:39,749
Here's a pretty thing.

886
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:41,588
Mithril.

887
01:33:42,517 --> 01:33:46,387
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

888
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,992
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

889
01:33:58,433 --> 01:34:00,163
My old ring.

890
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:05,096
I should very much like...

891
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:09,313
...to hold it again, one last time.

892
01:34:27,228 --> 01:34:30,418
I'm sorry ! brought this upon you,
my boy.

893
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:34,802
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

894
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:42,527
I'm sorry for everything.

895
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:59,490
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

896
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:03,531
if our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

897
01:36:04,192 --> 01:36:07,322
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

898
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:11,302
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

899
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:14,491
Move your feet.

900
01:36:14,836 --> 01:36:16,006
-You look good, Pippin.
-Thanks.

901
01:36:16,371 --> 01:36:17,631
Faster!

902
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:22,480
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

903
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,544
.. I'd say we were taking
the long way ‘round.

904
01:36:26,414 --> 01:36:29,103
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

905
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:33,578
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

906
01:36:34,222 --> 01:36:38,911
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

907
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:49,756
Sorry!

908
01:36:50,605 --> 01:36:51,915
Get him!

909
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:55,744
-For the Shire!
-Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

910
01:36:56,277 --> 01:36:57,647
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

911
01:36:58,346 --> 01:37:00,566
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

912
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:03,514
It's moving fast.

913
01:37:04,085 --> 01:37:05,985
Against the wind.

914
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:08,858
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!

915
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:11,754
-Hurry!
-Take cover!

916
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,046
Spies of Saruman.

917
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:50,899
The passage south is being watched.

918
01:37:52,433 --> 01:37:55,363
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

919
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:09,869
Frodo!

920
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:31,056
Boromir.

921
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:35,259
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

922
01:38:35,977 --> 01:38:38,727
..over so small a thing.

923
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:44,080
Such a little thing.

924
01:38:44,519 --> 01:38:45,809
Boromir!

925
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:48,927
Give the Ring to Frodo.

926
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,830
As you wish.

927
01:39:01,803 --> 01:39:03,583
I care not.

928
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:43,370
So, Gandalf, you tried
to lead them over Caradhras.

929
01:39:44,178 --> 01:39:48,188
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

930
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:52,693
lf the mountain defeats you...

931
01:39:53,254 --> 01:39:57,154
... Will you risk
a more dangerous road?

932
01:40:10,071 --> 01:40:12,621
There is a fell voice on the air.

933
01:40:14,075 --> 01:40:15,385
It's Saruman!

934
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:28,619
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

935
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:31,000
No!

936
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:39,268
We must get off the mountain!

937
01:41:39,961 --> 01:41:43,801
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

938
01:41:44,532 --> 01:41:47,492
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

939
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:51,352
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

940
01:41:52,006 --> 01:41:54,526
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

941
01:41:56,711 --> 01:41:59,991
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

942
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:05,598
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

943
01:42:07,021 --> 01:42:11,300
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dim:

944
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:16,260
Shadow and flame.

945
01:42:20,034 --> 01:42:22,433
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

946
01:42:28,109 --> 01:42:29,569
Frodo?

947
01:42:32,847 --> 01:42:35,367
We will go through the mines.

948
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:37,857
So be it.

949
01:42:46,527 --> 01:42:47,727
The walls...

950
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:50,402
...0f Moria.

951
01:42:59,407 --> 01:43:02,277
Well, let's see.

952
01:43:02,877 --> 01:43:04,077
Ithildin.

953
01:43:04,912 --> 01:43:07,872
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

954
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:25,898
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

955
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:31,071
-Speak, friend, and enter."
-What do you suppose that means?

956
01:43:31,839 --> 01:43:35,999
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

957
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:09,992
Mines are no place for a pony.

958
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:14,114
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.

959
01:44:15,816 --> 01:44:18,246
Go on, Bill. Go on.

960
01:44:19,153 --> 01:44:22,253
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

961
01:44:29,463 --> 01:44:31,742
Do not disturb the water.

962
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:33,936
Oh, it's useless.

963
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:48,746
It's a riddle.

964
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:54,536
"Speak ‘friend! and enter."

965
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:57,839
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

966
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:00,740
Melion.

967
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:23,259
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

968
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:29,328
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

969
01:45:31,559 --> 01:45:34,249
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

970
01:45:34,962 --> 01:45:37,102
And they call it a mine.

971
01:45:37,598 --> 01:45:39,298
A mine!

972
01:45:40,601 --> 01:45:43,531
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

973
01:45:50,077 --> 01:45:51,447
No...

974
01:45:52,947 --> 01:45:54,347
No!

975
01:45:57,218 --> 01:45:58,558
Goblins.

976
01:46:02,623 --> 01:46:06,402
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

977
01:46:07,962 --> 01:46:10,242
Now, get out of here. Get out!

978
01:46:13,334 --> 01:46:15,443
-Frodo!
-Help!

979
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:17,335
Strider!

980
01:46:17,738 --> 01:46:20,198
-Help!
-Get off him!

981
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:21,611
Aragorn!

982
01:46:32,186 --> 01:46:33,036
Frodo!

983
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:00,430
Into the mines!

984
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:03,591
-Legolas!
-Into the cave!

985
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:09,805
Run!

986
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:30,111
We now have but one choice.

987
01:47:30,744 --> 01:47:35,023
We must face the long dark of Moria.

988
01:47:35,883 --> 01:47:37,612
Be on your guard.

989
01:47:38,052 --> 01:47:41,072
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

990
01:47:41,689 --> 01:47:44,789
...in the deep places of the world.

991
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:56,627
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

992
01:47:57,304 --> 01:48:00,614
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

993
01:48:25,532 --> 01:48:27,022
Pippin.

994
01:48:47,621 --> 01:48:50,201
have no memory of this place.

995
01:48:52,626 --> 01:48:53,886
-Are we lost?
-No.

996
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:56,481
-[ think we are.
-Gandalfs thinking.

997
01:48:56,997 --> 01:48:58,287
-Merry?
-What?

998
01:48:58,665 --> 01:49:00,275
I'm hungry.

999
01:49:11,879 --> 01:49:15,779
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.

1000
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:20,180
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.

1001
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:24,548
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-diir?
-Escaped...

1002
01:49:25,793 --> 01:49:27,223
...of was set loose.

1003
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:38,110
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1004
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:41,189
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1005
01:49:41,809 --> 01:49:44,329
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1006
01:49:44,912 --> 01:49:45,962
Pity?

1007
01:49:47,181 --> 01:49:49,760
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1008
01:49:51,018 --> 01:49:55,588
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1009
01:49:57,691 --> 01:49:59,861
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1010
01:50:02,563 --> 01:50:06,043
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1011
01:50:06,733 --> 01:50:09,313
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1012
01:50:10,237 --> 01:50:15,427
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1013
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:19,497
... before this is over.

1014
01:50:21,348 --> 01:50:24,748
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1015
01:50:31,892 --> 01:50:34,791
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1016
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:38,440
[ wish none of this had happened.

1017
01:50:38,899 --> 01:50:43,319
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1018
01:50:44,705 --> 01:50:49,535
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1019
01:50:51,745 --> 01:50:55,255
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1020
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:58,320
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1021
01:50:59,086 --> 01:51:02,836
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1022
01:51:03,557 --> 01:51:06,337
And that is an encouraging thought.

1023
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:13,298
It's that way.

1024
01:51:13,734 --> 01:51:15,724
-He's remembered.
-No.

1025
01:51:16,203 --> 01:51:19,543
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1026
01:51:20,207 --> 01:51:24,807
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1027
01:51:40,294 --> 01:51:43,954
Let me risk a little more light.

1028
01:51:49,069 --> 01:51:50,909
Behold...

1029
01:51:51,572 --> 01:51:56,202
.. the great realm
and Dwart-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1030
01:51:59,313 --> 01:52:02,273
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1031
01:52:27,641 --> 01:52:29,130
Gimli!

1032
01:52:36,783 --> 01:52:38,183
No!

1033
01:52:41,021 --> 01:52:43,800
Oh, no.

1034
01:52:45,993 --> 01:52:47,103
No.

1035
01:52:54,568 --> 01:52:56,318
"Here lies Balin...

1036
01:52:57,004 --> 01:52:58,754
..80n of Fundin...

1037
01:52:59,306 --> 01:53:01,556
...Lord of Moria."

1038
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:04,433
He is dead, then.

1039
01:53:06,413 --> 01:53:07,873
It's as I feared.

1040
01:53:26,366 --> 01:53:28,916
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1041
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:33,599
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1042
01:53:35,275 --> 01:53:37,554
We have barred the gates...

1043
01:53:38,578 --> 01:53:40,748
...but cannot hold them for long.

1044
01:53:41,248 --> 01:53:43,708
The ground shakes.

1045
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:45,824
Drums...

1046
01:53:46,453 --> 01:53:49,413
.. drums in the deep.

1047
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,139
We cannot get out.

1048
01:53:57,431 --> 01:54:00,710
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1049
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:05,116
We cannot get out.

1050
01:54:08,442 --> 01:54:10,112
They are coming."

1051
01:54:53,453 --> 01:54:55,093
Fool of a Took!

1052
01:54:55,689 --> 01:54:59,029
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1053
01:55:25,352 --> 01:55:26,842
Frodo!

1054
01:55:29,356 --> 01:55:30,616
Orcs.

1055
01:55:37,831 --> 01:55:39,581
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1056
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,650
They have a cave-troll.

1057
01:56:04,658 --> 01:56:05,648
Let them come!

1058
01:56:06,326 --> 01:56:09,426
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1059
01:58:00,307 --> 01:58:02,737
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1060
01:58:07,847 --> 01:58:09,337
Frodo!

1061
01:58:43,183 --> 01:58:44,823
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1062
01:58:46,052 --> 01:58:47,692
Frodo!

1063
01:59:33,066 --> 01:59:34,706
Frodo!

1064
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:36,368
Oh, no.

1065
02:00:44,904 --> 02:00:46,604
He's alive.

1066
02:00:49,275 --> 02:00:51,905
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1067
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:54,409
You should be dead.

1068
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:57,084
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1069
02:00:57,617 --> 02:01:01,717
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1070
02:01:08,194 --> 02:01:09,094
Mithril.

1071
02:01:12,031 --> 02:01:14,311
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1072
02:01:20,673 --> 02:01:22,343
To the Bridge of Knazad-dim!

1073
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:39,050
This way!

1074
02:02:49,629 --> 02:02:52,239
What is this new devilry?

1075
02:03:08,648 --> 02:03:11,078
A Balrog.

1076
02:03:11,784 --> 02:03:14,504
A demon of the ancient world.

1077
02:03:17,123 --> 02:03:19,232
This foe is beyond any of you.

1078
02:03:20,693 --> 02:03:22,063
Run!

1079
02:03:29,636 --> 02:03:30,926
Quickly!

1080
02:03:47,754 --> 02:03:48,894
Gandalf.

1081
02:03:49,656 --> 02:03:51,056
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1082
02:03:52,692 --> 02:03:54,882
The bridge is near.

1083
02:03:57,230 --> 02:04:00,799
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1084
02:04:30,430 --> 02:04:31,980
Gandalfl

1085
02:04:50,483 --> 02:04:51,533
Merry! Pippin!

1086
02:05:02,762 --> 02:05:04,102
Sam!

1087
02:05:07,033 --> 02:05:09,873
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1088
02:05:13,306 --> 02:05:14,566
Not the beard!

1089
02:05:27,987 --> 02:05:29,687
Steady.

1090
02:05:31,991 --> 02:05:33,451
Hold on!

1091
02:05:54,747 --> 02:05:55,767
Hang on!

1092
02:06:06,659 --> 02:06:08,209
Lean forward!

1093
02:06:11,431 --> 02:06:12,330
Steady.

1094
02:06:13,766 --> 02:06:14,786
Come on!

1095
02:06:15,134 --> 02:06:16,444
Now!

1096
02:06:33,853 --> 02:06:35,463
Over the bridge!

1097
02:06:35,888 --> 02:06:37,288
Fly!

1098
02:07:22,068 --> 02:07:23,878
You cannot pass!

1099
02:07:24,337 --> 02:07:25,707
Gandalfl

1100
02:07:30,176 --> 02:07:34,486
lam a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1101
02:07:36,082 --> 02:07:39,422
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Uddin!

1102
02:07:49,829 --> 02:07:51,558
Go back to the Shadow.

1103
02:07:59,639 --> 02:08:03,509
You shall not pass!

1104
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:34,634
-No! No!
-Gandalfl

1105
02:08:42,815 --> 02:08:44,955
Fly, you fools!

1106
02:08:49,388 --> 02:08:51,288
No!

1107
02:08:57,697 --> 02:08:59,597
Aragorn!

1108
02:09:57,156 --> 02:09:59,616
Legolas, get them up.

1109
02:10:04,063 --> 02:10:05,703
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1110
02:10:06,132 --> 02:10:09,321
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1111
02:10:09,969 --> 02:10:12,899
We must reach the woods of Lothldrien.

1112
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:17,110
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1113
02:10:19,045 --> 02:10:20,975
On your feet, Sam.

1114
02:10:21,614 --> 02:10:22,904
Frodo?

1115
02:10:25,151 --> 02:10:26,641
Frodo!

1116
02:11:19,338 --> 02:11:21,558
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1117
02:11:22,641 --> 02:11:26,271
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1118
02:11:27,012 --> 02:11:29,201
An Elf-witch...

1119
02:11:30,082 --> 02:11:32,602
...Of terrible power.

1120
02:11:33,519 --> 02:11:35,449
All who look upon her...

1121
02:11:35,921 --> 02:11:37,501
.. fall under her spell.

1122
02:11:37,923 --> 02:11:39,063
Frodo!

1123
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:43,270
And are never seen again.

1124
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:47,679
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1125
02:11:48,434 --> 02:11:51,714
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

1126
02:11:52,371 --> 02:11:53,891
Mr. Frodo?

1127
02:11:59,445 --> 02:12:04,275
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1128
02:12:05,184 --> 02:12:09,164
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1129
02:12:17,396 --> 02:12:21,436
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1130
02:12:31,277 --> 02:12:34,997
Aragorn, these woods are perilous.
We should go back.

1131
02:12:35,748 --> 02:12:40,937
You have entered the realm of the Lady
of the Wood. You cannot go back.

1132
02:12:44,056 --> 02:12:47,125
Come. She is waiting.

1133
02:13:54,627 --> 02:13:58,497
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1134
02:13:59,298 --> 02:14:00,818
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1135
02:14:01,233 --> 02:14:04,663
For l much desire to speak with him.

1136
02:14:06,772 --> 02:14:09,582
He has fallen into Shadow.

1137
02:14:14,847 --> 02:14:17,507
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1138
02:14:18,751 --> 02:14:21,361
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1139
02:14:22,121 --> 02:14:24,611
.. to the ruin of all.

1140
02:14:38,704 --> 02:14:42,744
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1141
02:14:46,645 --> 02:14:50,715
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1142
02:14:51,884 --> 02:14:54,954
.. for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1143
02:14:57,890 --> 02:14:59,590
Tonight, you will sleep....

1144
02:14:59,959 --> 02:15:02,919
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1145
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:06,410
...one who has seen the Eye!

1146
02:15:21,447 --> 02:15:23,587
A lament for Gandalf.

1147
02:15:25,818 --> 02:15:27,868
What do they say about him?

1148
02:15:28,354 --> 02:15:32,864
I have not the heart to tell you.
For me, the grief is still too near.

1149
02:15:36,195 --> 02:15:38,184
Take some rest.

1150
02:15:38,931 --> 02:15:41,271
These borders are well-protected.

1151
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:44,050
[ will find no rest here.

1152
02:15:47,172 --> 02:15:49,802
I heard her voice inside my head.

1153
02:15:50,442 --> 02:15:53,692
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1154
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:59,160
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1155
02:16:01,186 --> 02:16:03,675
But I cannot see it.

1156
02:16:05,324 --> 02:16:07,513
It is long since we had any hope.

1157
02:16:18,070 --> 02:16:19,940
My father is a noble man.

1158
02:16:20,939 --> 02:16:22,869
But his rule is failing...

1159
02:16:26,311 --> 02:16:28,590
..and our people lose faith.

1160
02:16:30,582 --> 02:16:33,482
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1161
02:16:34,085 --> 02:16:37,186
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1162
02:16:40,692 --> 02:16:43,123
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1163
02:16:44,096 --> 02:16:46,026
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1164
02:16:46,498 --> 02:16:49,688
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1165
02:16:50,803 --> 02:16:53,873
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1166
02:16:57,175 --> 02:16:59,135
Have you ever been called home...

1167
02:16:59,645 --> 02:17:02,775
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1168
02:17:04,148 --> 02:17:06,759
I have seen the White City...

1169
02:17:07,585 --> 02:17:08,786
.. long ago.

1170
02:17:09,922 --> 02:17:14,262
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1171
02:17:15,827 --> 02:17:18,407
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1172
02:17:19,198 --> 02:17:22,128
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1173
02:18:29,735 --> 02:18:31,985
Will you look into the mirror?

1174
02:18:32,504 --> 02:18:33,844
What willl see?

1175
02:18:37,009 --> 02:18:39,058
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1176
02:18:40,279 --> 02:18:41,859
For the mirror...

1177
02:18:42,314 --> 02:18:44,504
.. shows many things.

1178
02:18:47,852 --> 02:18:49,963
Things that were...

1179
02:18:50,455 --> 02:18:52,705
... things that are...

1180
02:18:53,791 --> 02:18:55,521
..and some things...

1181
02:18:59,331 --> 02:19:02,201
.. that have not yet come to pass.

1182
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:27,740
I Know what it is you saw.

1183
02:20:30,522 --> 02:20:32,692
For it is also in my mind.

1184
02:20:34,793 --> 02:20:38,363
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1185
02:20:41,233 --> 02:20:45,513
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1186
02:20:46,738 --> 02:20:49,637
He will try to take the Ring.

1187
02:20:50,242 --> 02:20:51,992
You know of whom ! speak.

1188
02:20:53,278 --> 02:20:57,348
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1189
02:20:59,451 --> 02:21:01,530
If you ask it of me...

1190
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:04,910
...f will give you the One Ring.

1191
02:21:06,325 --> 02:21:08,225
You Offer it to me freely.

1192
02:21:13,098 --> 02:21:16,558
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1193
02:21:23,408 --> 02:21:26,278
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1194
02:21:27,179 --> 02:21:30,519
..not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1195
02:21:31,616 --> 02:21:34,246
Treacherous as the sea!

1196
02:21:35,153 --> 02:21:39,463
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1197
02:21:40,525 --> 02:21:42,635
All shall love me...

1198
02:21:43,128 --> 02:21:45,618
..and despair.

1199
02:22:00,012 --> 02:22:03,822
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1200
02:22:04,616 --> 02:22:06,786
..and go into the West...

1201
02:22:07,285 --> 02:22:11,205
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.

1202
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:18,990
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1203
02:22:20,432 --> 02:22:21,742
.. I$ to be alone.

1204
02:22:22,534 --> 02:22:25,554
This task was appointed to you.

1205
02:22:26,471 --> 02:22:29,280
And if you do not find a way...

1206
02:22:30,542 --> 02:22:32,292
...No one will.

1207
02:22:32,978 --> 02:22:35,697
Then I know what I must do.

1208
02:22:36,815 --> 02:22:37,715
It's just...

1209
02:22:41,119 --> 02:22:43,109
.. I'm afraid to do it.

1210
02:22:46,858 --> 02:22:51,368
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1211
02:22:54,533 --> 02:22:57,403
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1212
02:22:58,170 --> 02:23:00,690
You do not Know pain.
You do not Know fear.

1213
02:23:01,239 --> 02:23:03,849
You will taste Man-flesh!

1214
02:23:09,247 --> 02:23:12,347
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1215
02:23:13,151 --> 02:23:16,841
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1216
02:23:19,157 --> 02:23:20,296
Kill the others.

1217
02:23:48,386 --> 02:23:51,196
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1218
02:23:51,623 --> 02:23:54,752
I give you the light of Earendil...

1219
02:23:55,794 --> 02:23:57,984
...our most beloved star.

1220
02:24:09,774 --> 02:24:13,784
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1221
02:24:14,546 --> 02:24:18,026
... when all other lights go out.

1222
02:25:57,582 --> 02:25:58,872
Frodo.

1223
02:26:00,719 --> 02:26:02,149
The Argonath.

1224
02:26:05,657 --> 02:26:09,087
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1225
02:26:10,295 --> 02:26:11,995
My kin.

1226
02:27:31,209 --> 02:27:33,169
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1227
02:27:33,478 --> 02:27:35,877
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1228
02:27:36,414 --> 02:27:39,314
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

1229
02:27:40,285 --> 02:27:43,655
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Mull...

1230
02:27:44,322 --> 02:27:47,162
..an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1231
02:27:47,592 --> 02:27:50,312
And after that, it gets even better.

1232
02:27:51,262 --> 02:27:55,602
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1233
02:27:56,401 --> 02:27:57,481
That is our road.

1234
02:27:59,337 --> 02:28:02,087
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1235
02:28:02,507 --> 02:28:04,177
Recover my--

1236
02:28:07,445 --> 02:28:09,145
-We should leave now.
-No.

1237
02:28:09,581 --> 02:28:13,501
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1238
02:28:14,252 --> 02:28:17,122
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1239
02:28:17,756 --> 02:28:21,266
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1240
02:28:22,427 --> 02:28:25,997
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1241
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:32,960
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1242
02:28:34,072 --> 02:28:35,412
Where's Frodo?

1243
02:29:01,399 --> 02:29:03,099
None of us should wander alone.

1244
02:29:04,536 --> 02:29:06,406
You, least of all.

1245
02:29:07,038 --> 02:29:09,178
So much depends on you.

1246
02:29:10,542 --> 02:29:12,242
Frodo?

1247
02:29:19,451 --> 02:29:21,821
I Know why you seek solitude.

1248
02:29:22,754 --> 02:29:25,884
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1249
02:29:27,125 --> 02:29:29,815
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1250
02:29:31,596 --> 02:29:34,086
There are other ways, Frodo.

1251
02:29:34,466 --> 02:29:37,976
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

1252
02:29:38,503 --> 02:29:41,983
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1253
02:29:42,507 --> 02:29:45,226
Warning? Against what?

1254
02:29:45,977 --> 02:29:47,847
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1255
02:29:48,313 --> 02:29:51,353
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1256
02:29:52,183 --> 02:29:55,523
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

1257
02:29:57,555 --> 02:30:00,655
l ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1258
02:30:02,494 --> 02:30:04,274
-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

1259
02:30:05,763 --> 02:30:09,163
-Why do you recoil? ! am no thief.
-You are not yourself.

1260
02:30:11,402 --> 02:30:14,182
What chance do you think you have?

1261
02:30:14,806 --> 02:30:19,056
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1262
02:30:19,677 --> 02:30:23,077
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1263
02:30:25,550 --> 02:30:27,330
You fool!

1264
02:30:27,819 --> 02:30:31,299
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1265
02:30:32,190 --> 02:30:34,500
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1266
02:30:35,193 --> 02:30:36,303
-Give it to me!
-No!

1267
02:30:36,661 --> 02:30:38,271
-Give it to me!
-No.

1268
02:30:46,137 --> 02:30:47,947
I see your mind.

1269
02:30:48,406 --> 02:30:51,016
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1270
02:30:51,576 --> 02:30:53,215
You will betray us!

1271
02:30:53,645 --> 02:30:56,305
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1272
02:30:57,315 --> 02:31:00,305
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1273
02:31:07,792 --> 02:31:09,282
Frodo?

1274
02:31:13,631 --> 02:31:15,180
Frodo.

1275
02:31:19,304 --> 02:31:21,114
What have I done?

1276
02:31:21,573 --> 02:31:23,063
Please, Frodo.

1277
02:31:23,474 --> 02:31:25,814
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1278
02:32:14,559 --> 02:32:15,958
Frodo?

1279
02:32:17,428 --> 02:32:20,118
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?

1280
02:32:20,531 --> 02:32:22,261
Stay away!

1281
02:32:22,767 --> 02:32:24,287
Frodo!

1282
02:32:26,604 --> 02:32:30,083
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?

1283
02:32:40,318 --> 02:32:42,338
Would you destroy it?

1284
02:32:47,592 --> 02:32:49,322
Aragorn.

1285
02:32:53,131 --> 02:32:55,180
Aragorn.

1286
02:32:57,268 --> 02:32:58,908
Elessar.

1287
02:33:06,544 --> 02:33:09,644
I would have gone with you to the end.

1288
02:33:10,648 --> 02:33:13,137
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1289
02:33:16,788 --> 02:33:17,988
I know.

1290
02:33:20,591 --> 02:33:25,391
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1291
02:33:29,667 --> 02:33:31,306
Go, Frodo!

1292
02:33:34,539 --> 02:33:35,849
Run.

1293
02:33:36,274 --> 02:33:37,583
Run!

1294
02:34:02,467 --> 02:34:03,957
Mr. Frodo!

1295
02:34:13,411 --> 02:34:14,991
Find the halfling!

1296
02:34:16,647 --> 02:34:19,047
Find the halfling!

1297
02:34:22,687 --> 02:34:24,327
Elendil!

1298
02:34:31,062 --> 02:34:32,402
Aragorn, go!

1299
02:34:54,352 --> 02:34:55,492
Frodo!

1300
02:34:56,220 --> 02:34:57,510
Hide here. Quick!

1301
02:34:58,489 --> 02:34:59,599
Come on!

1302
02:35:02,326 --> 02:35:04,135
What's he doing?

1303
02:35:08,599 --> 02:35:10,349
He's leaving.

1304
02:35:15,373 --> 02:35:17,953
-No!
-Pippin!

1305
02:35:23,247 --> 02:35:25,267
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1306
02:35:26,150 --> 02:35:28,840
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!

1307
02:35:29,487 --> 02:35:31,007
-Over here!
-This way!

1308
02:35:42,133 --> 02:35:44,153
-It's working!
-l know it's working! Run!

1309
02:36:33,684 --> 02:36:36,344
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

1310
02:37:01,512 --> 02:37:02,502
Run!

1311
02:40:22,079 --> 02:40:23,339
No.

1312
02:40:27,485 --> 02:40:30,115
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.

1313
02:40:30,621 --> 02:40:32,371
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1314
02:40:34,525 --> 02:40:35,955
I let Frodo go.

1315
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:39,119
Then you did what I could not.

1316
02:40:40,431 --> 02:40:43,181
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1317
02:40:44,301 --> 02:40:48,020
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

1318
02:40:48,572 --> 02:40:50,742
I did not see it.

1319
02:40:51,242 --> 02:40:54,052
-l have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.

1320
02:40:55,212 --> 02:40:57,142
You fought bravely.

1321
02:40:57,815 --> 02:41:00,035
You have kept your honor.

1322
02:41:00,985 --> 02:41:02,475
Leave it.

1323
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:05,050
It is over.

1324
02:41:05,756 --> 02:41:08,276
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1325
02:41:08,993 --> 02:41:12,063
...but swear to you,
[ will not let the White City fall...

1326
02:41:13,464 --> 02:41:15,834
...nor our people fail.

1327
02:41:17,134 --> 02:41:18,184
Our people.

1328
02:41:22,206 --> 02:41:23,986
Our people.

1329
02:41:46,197 --> 02:41:48,717
I would have followed you, my brother.

1330
02:41:50,634 --> 02:41:52,364
My captain.

1331
02:41:55,239 --> 02:41:56,939
My king.

1332
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:18,870
Be at peace...

1333
02:42:19,396 --> 02:42:21,126
...8on of Gondor.

1334
02:43:00,504 --> 02:43:02,054
Frodo!

1335
02:43:21,992 --> 02:43:24,712
! wish the Ring had never come to me.

1336
02:43:26,363 --> 02:43:28,992
! wish none of this had happened.

1337
02:43:32,369 --> 02:43:34,769
So do all who live
to see such times...

1338
02:43:35,339 --> 02:43:38,359
...but that is not for them to decide.

1339
02:43:39,176 --> 02:43:41,315
All you have to decide...

1340
02:43:41,812 --> 02:43:46,002
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1341
02:44:15,379 --> 02:44:17,189
Frodo, no!

1342
02:44:18,082 --> 02:44:19,072
Frodo!

1343
02:44:20,150 --> 02:44:22,340
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

1344
02:44:26,223 --> 02:44:27,953
Go back, Sam!

1345
02:44:28,692 --> 02:44:31,821
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

1346
02:44:32,463 --> 02:44:34,953
And I'm coming with you!

1347
02:44:35,766 --> 02:44:37,876
You can't swim!

1348
02:44:42,172 --> 02:44:43,512
Sam!

1349
02:44:49,313 --> 02:44:50,483
Sam!

1350
02:45:31,522 --> 02:45:33,922
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1351
02:45:34,591 --> 02:45:38,541
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1352
02:45:40,030 --> 02:45:42,340
And don't mean to.

1353
02:45:43,066 --> 02:45:44,846
I don't mean to.

1354
02:45:46,804 --> 02:45:48,384
Sam.

1355
02:46:03,454 --> 02:46:04,913
Come on.

1356
02:46:34,017 --> 02:46:37,646
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1357
02:46:53,270 --> 02:46:57,490
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1358
02:47:01,411 --> 02:47:05,691
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1359
02:47:18,161 --> 02:47:20,941
Not if we hold true to each other.

1360
02:47:23,033 --> 02:47:26,662
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1361
02:47:28,171 --> 02:47:32,801
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1362
02:47:35,112 --> 02:47:36,862
We travel light.

1363
02:47:37,147 --> 02:47:38,787
Let us hunt some Orc.

1364
02:47:42,085 --> 02:47:43,785
Yes!

1365
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:04,120
Mordor.

1366
02:48:05,075 --> 02:48:07,885
I hope the others find a safer road.

1367
02:48:09,212 --> 02:48:11,612
Strider will look after them.

1368
02:48:12,716 --> 02:48:15,676
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1369
02:48:16,420 --> 02:48:18,670
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1370
02:48:19,022 --> 02:48:20,422
We may.

1371
02:48:22,659 --> 02:48:23,618
Sam...

1372
02:48:27,331 --> 02:48:29,791
...l'm glad you are with me.
