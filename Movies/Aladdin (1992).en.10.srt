1
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:33,634
Oh I come from a land,
From a faraway place

2
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,037
Where the caravan camels roam

3
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,843
Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,445
It's barbaric but hey, it's home

5
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,168
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west

6
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,402
And the sand in the glass is right

7
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,691
Come on down, stop on by,
Hop a carpet and fly

8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,070
To another Arabian night

9
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,851
Arabian nights

10
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,554
Like Arabian days

11
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,438
More often than not
Are hotter than hot

12
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:15,131
In a lot of good ways

13
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,741
Arabian nights

14
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,405
‘Neath Arabian moons

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,515
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,217
Out there on the dunes

17
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,793
Got to keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line

18
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,986
One swing ahead of the sword

19
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,332
I'll steal only what I can't afford

20
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,702
One jump ahead of the lawman

21
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,823
That's all, and that's no joke

22
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,783
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

23
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,212
- Riffraff
- Street rat

24
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,228
- Scoundrel
- Take that

25
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:44,097
Just a little snack, guys

26
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,123
Rip him open, take it back, guys

27
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,308
1 can take a hint, got to face the facts

28
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,243
- You're my only friend, Abu
- Who?

29
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,878
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom

30
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,719
He's become a one-man rise in crime

31
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,556
I'd blame parents,
Except he hasn't go ‘em

32
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:08,064
Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got time

33
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,707
One jump ahead of the slowpokes,
One skip ahead of my doom

34
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,892
Next time, going to use a nom de plume

35
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,092
One jump ahead of the hit men,
One hit ahead of the flock

36
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,319
[ think I'll take a stroll
Around the block

37
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,200
Let's not be too hasty

38
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,318
Still ! think he's rather tasty

39
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,781
Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat,
Otherwise we'd get along

40
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,712
Wrong

41
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,072
One jump ahead of the hoof beats
One hop ahead of the hump

42
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,008
One trick ahead of disaster,
They're quick but I'm much faster

43
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,719
Here goes, better throw my hand in,
Wish me happy landing

44
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,489
Alf got to do is jump!

45
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,571
Riffraff, street rat

46
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,207
! don't buy that

47
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,630
If only they'd look closer

48
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,131
Would they see a poor boy?

49
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,238
No siree

50
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,431
They‘d find out

51
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:51,175
There's so much more to me

52
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,491
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves

53
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,823
Scheherazade had a thousand tales

54
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,419
But, master, you're in luck
‘Cause up your sleeves

55
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,884
You got a brand of magic never fails

56
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,381
You got some power in your corner now

57
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,084
Some heavy ammunition in your camp

58
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,380
You got some punch, pizzazz,
Yahoo and how

59
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,295
See, all you got to do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say

60
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,618
Mr. Aladdin, sir,
What will your pleasure be?

61
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,363
Let me take your order, jot it down

62
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,714

Yes, sir, we pride ourselves on service

00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,379
You're the boss, the king, the shah

68
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,822
Say what you wish,
It's yours, true dish

69
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,988
How ‘bout a little more baklava?

70
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:07,258
Have some of column A,
Try all of column B

71
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,692
I'm in the mood to help you, dude

72
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,361
You ain't never had a friend like me

73
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,816
Can your friends do this?

74
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,245
Can your friends do that?

75
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,743
Can your friends pull this

76
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,217
Out their little hat?

77
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,746
Can your friends go...

78
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,722
Hey, looky here

79
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,228
Can your friends go
Abracadabra, let her rip

80
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,731
And then make the sucker disappear?

81
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,366
So don't just sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed

82
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,566
I'm here to answer
Alf your midnight prayers

83
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,791

You ain't never had a friend

93
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,635
Like me

94
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:42,332
Make way for Prince Ali

95
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:47,661
Say hey, it's Prince Ali

96
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,177
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar

97
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:53,685
Hey you, let us through,
It's a bright new star

98
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:57,984
Oh come, be the first
On your block to meet his eye

99
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,636
Make way, here he comes,
Ring bells, bang the drums

100
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,649
You're going to love this guy

101
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,421
Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa

102
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:13,533
Genuflect, show some respect,
Down on one knee

103
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:16,328
Now try your best to stay calm

104
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,467
Brush up your Sunday salaam

105
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,299
Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie

106
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:27,520
Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa

107
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:32,422
Strong as ten regular men definitely

108
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,880
He faced the galloping hordes

109
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,226
A hundred bad guys with swords

110
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:41,085
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

111
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:44,975
He's got 75 golden camels

112
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:49,285
Purple peacocks he's got 53

113
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:55,491
When it comes to exotic-type mammals

114
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:57,703
Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you

115
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,105
It's a world-class menagerie

116
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:04,304
Prince Ali, handsome is he, Ali Ababwa

117
00:50:04,902 --> 00:50:08,742
That physique, how can! speak?
Weak at the knees

118
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,530
Well, get on out in that square

119
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,549
Adjust your veil and prepare

120
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,974
To gawk and grovel
And stare at Prince Ali

121
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:22,656
He's got 95 white Persian monkeys

122
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:27,236
To view them he charges no fee

123
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,848
He's got slaves,
He's got servants and flunkeys

124
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,788
Proud to work for him,
They bow to his whim, love serving him

125
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,567
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali

126
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:40,792
Prince Ali

127
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:46,508
Prince Ali, amorous he, Ali Ababwa

128
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:51,821
Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see

129
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,006
And that, good people, is why

130
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,305
He got dolled up and dropped by

131
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,234
With 60 elephants, llamas galore

132
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,302
With his bears and lions,
A brass band and more

133
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,323
With his 40 fakirs,
His cooks, his bakers

134
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:03,886
His birds that warble on key

135
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:05,968
Make way

136
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:09,867
For Prince Ali

137
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,471
} can show you the world

138
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:01,781
Shining, shimmering, splendid

139
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:07,649
Tell me, Princess, now when
Did you last let your heart decide?

140
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:13,587
! can open your eyes

141
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,117
Take you wonder by wonder

142
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,054
Over, sideways and under

143
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:23,834
On a magic-carpet ride

144
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:27,768
A whole new world

145
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:31,585
A new fantastic point of view

146
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:36,209
No one to tell us no or where to go

147
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,277
Or say we're only dreaming

148
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:42,993
A whole new world

149
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,090
A dazzling place I never knew

150
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:51,467
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear

151
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:55,932
That now I'm in
A whole new world with you

152
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,723
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

153
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:03,547
Unbelievable sights

154
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:07,234
Indescribable feeling

155
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,374
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

156
00:59:10,814 --> 00:59:13,564
Through an endless diamond sky

157
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:17,357
- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes

158
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:21,317
- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better

159
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,908
I'm like a shooting star

160
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:25,961
I've come so far

161
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:30,423
- 1 can't go back to where I used to be
- A whole new world

162
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:34,498
- Every turn a surprise
- With new horizons to pursue

163
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,148
Every moment red-letter

164
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:41,017
I'll chase them anywhere,
There's time to spare

165
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:46,378
Let me share this
Whole new world with you

166
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,458
A whole new world

167
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:55,904
That's where we'll be

168
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,895
- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place

169
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,680
For you and me
