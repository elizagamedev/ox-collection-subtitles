1
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,920
Will!

2
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,369
- Why is this happening?
- [don't know.

3
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,950
You look beautiful.

4
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,587
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

5
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,957
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!

6
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,497
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

7
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,878
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

8
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,430
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

9
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:58,233
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

10
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,592
In fact. ldo. Mr. Mercer?
a

11
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,444
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

12
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,935
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- Is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

13
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,733
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?

14
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,320
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

15
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:27,466
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.

16
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,941
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?

17
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,557
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

18
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,220
That wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.

19
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,803
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

20
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,359
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

21
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,347
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

22
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,630
The charge is "conspiring to set free

23
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,377
"a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

24
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,270
"and condemned to death.
a
for which the...”

25
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,024
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

26
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,724
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

27
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,930
Captain.

28
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,667
Captain Jack Sparrow.

29
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,620
Captain Jack Sparrow.

30
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,981
Yes, [ thought you might.

31
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:24,656
Fifteen men on a dead man’s chest

32
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,645
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

33
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:35,023
Drink and the devil
had done for the rest

34
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,842
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

35
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,902
Prisoners. come on!
a

36
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,020
Sorry, mate.

37
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,186
Mind if we make a little side trip?

38
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,461
I didn't think so.

39
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,380
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,

40
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,703
were overcome.

41
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
You got what you went in for, then?

42
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,945
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

43
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,423
were expecting something
a bit more shiny,

44
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,626
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

45
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,460
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.

46
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,216
- And the hurricane.
- Aye.

47
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:34,656
Allin all, it seems some time
a
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

48
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,139
- Shiny.
- Aye. shiny.

49
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,377
Is that how you're all feeling?

50
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:47,416
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

51
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,238
Walk the plank.

52
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,197
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.

53
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,599
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

54
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,311
- You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.

55
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,654
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.

56
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,685
Itis a drawing of a key.

57
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,107
Gentlemen,
a

58
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,106
what do keys do?

59
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,012
Keys

60
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,390
unlock things?

61
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,116
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

62
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,520
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

63
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,447
No.

64
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,652
If we con't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

65
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,622
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

66
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:55,084
which we don't have. without first
a
having found the key what unlocks it?

67
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,752
So we're going after this key.

68
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,141
You're not making any sense at all.

69
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,705
Any more questions?

70
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,230
So do we have a heading?

71
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,497
A heading.

72
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,951
Set sail ina

73
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,954
general

74
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,630
that-way direction.

75
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,978
Captain?

76
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:28,387
Come on, snap to and make sail.
You know how this works. Go on.

77
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,519
Have you noticed lately

78
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,944
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

79
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,039
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

80
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,108
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

81
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,952
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

82
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,920
Lord Beckett.
a
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

83
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,356
Those won't be necessary.

84
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,595
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

85
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,964
We wish for you to act as our agent

86
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,919
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

87
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,604
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?

88
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,573
We've had dealings in the past.

89
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,050
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

90
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,680
What mark did he leave on you?

91
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,912
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

92
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,286
I would like you to go to him

93
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:52,625
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

94
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,653
Recover. At the point of a sword?

95
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,339
Bargain.

96
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,731
Letters of marque.

97
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,514
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.

98
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,654
Jack will be free.
a
a privateer in the employ of England.

99
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:20,125
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

100
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,620
Freedom.

101
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,773
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

102
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,923
The world is shrinking,

103
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,262
the blank edges of the map filled in.

104
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,189
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

105
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,159
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

106
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,086
You and your fiancée
face the hangman's noose.

107
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:47,326
- So you get Jack and the Black Pearl.
- The Black Pearl?

108
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:51,664
- The property you want that he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.

109
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:55,845
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable.
a

110
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,576
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

111
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,396
A compass?

112
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,689
You know it.

113
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:10,162
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

114
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,139
Why is the rum always gone?

115
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,246
That's why.

116
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,325
As you were, gents.

117
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,442
Time's run out. Jack.
a

118
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,476
Bootstrap.

119
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,768
Bill Turner.

120
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,889
You look good, Jack.

121
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,878
Is this a dream?

122
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,450
No.

123
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,878
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.
a

124
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,390
You got the Pear! back, I see.

125
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,773
l had some help retrieving the Peari,
by the way.

126
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,565
Your son.

127
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,113
William?

128
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,290
He ended up a pirate after all.

129
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,897
And to what clo I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

130
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,353
He sent me.

131
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,298
Davy Jones.

132
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,143
So it's you, then.

133
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,930
He shanghaied you
into service. eh?
a

134
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,184
I chose it.

135
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:10,896
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

136
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,531
I stood up for you.

137
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,464
Everything went wrong after that.

138
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,769
They strapped me to a cannon.
l ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

139
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,004
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

140
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,647
Unable to move.

141
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,010
Unable to die. Jack.
a

142
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:38,286
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, would take it.

143
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,562
would trade anything for it.

144
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,750
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

145
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,553
You made a deal with him too, Jack.
a

146
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,289
He raised the Pear!
from the depths for you.

147
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,494
13 years, you've been her captain.

148
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,521
- Technically...
- Jack.

149
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,963
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

150
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,787
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

151
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,970
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

152
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,706
The Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...

153
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,148
Then it's the locker for you!

154
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,344
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

155
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,617
and drag the Pear! back to the depths
and you along with it.

156
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:24,116
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

157
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,318
l already told you, Jack.

158
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,539
Your time is up.

159
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,505
It comes now.
a

160
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:39,517
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

161
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:52,145
On deck, all hands!
a
Make fast the bunt gasket!

162
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,661
On deck! Scurry!

163
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,024
Scurry! l want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

164
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,992
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

165
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,443
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

166
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,990
- Do we have a heading?
- Run! Land.

167
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,786
- Which port?
- l didn't say “port,” I said "land." Any land.

168
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,456
- Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- No. no!
a

169
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,936
Leave it!

170
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,992
Run.

171
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,875
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!

172
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,293
dack?

173
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:54,369
For the love of mother and child. Jack.
oe
what's coming after us?

174
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,657
Nothing.

175
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,999
- Here, now, you can't be here.
- [ think you'll find he can.

176
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,877
Mr. Swann!

177
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,962
Governor Swann. still.
a

178
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,159
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

179
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,817
Jack's compass?
What coes Beckett want with that?

180
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,991
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

181
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,818
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

182
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,424
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

183
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,191
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?

184
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,597
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow

185
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,406
does not mean
he would do the same for anyone else.

186
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,970
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

187
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,172
I have faith in you.

188
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,838
Both of you.

189
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,062
Where will you find him?

190
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:03,625
Tortuga. I'll start there
and I won't stop searching till I find him.

191
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,657
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

192
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,040
- Properly?
- Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

193
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,085
If it weren't for these bars.
a
I'd have you already.

194
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,035
- I'll wait for you.
- Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

195
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,969
Captain Jack Sparrow?

196
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,141
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

197
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,144
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk. with a smile on his face.
a

198
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:52,521
Sure as the tide.
a
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

199
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,899
Jack Sparrow?

200
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,031
l haven't seen him in a month.

201
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,696
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

202
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,448
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

203
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,199
but there’s an island
just south of the straits

204
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,090
where I trade spice for

205
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,403
delicious long pork.

206
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,876
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.

207
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,494
A ship with black sails.

208
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,924
My brother will take you ashore.

209
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,575
- What's wrong? The beach is there.
- C'est trop dangereux.

210
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:47,043
- What?
- C'est trop dangereux. je vous l'avais dit.

211
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,717
Bon voyage. monsieur.

212
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,158
Jack!

213
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,287
Jack Sparrow!

214
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,195
Marty!

215
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,831
Cotton!

216
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,734
Anybody?

217
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,786
A familiar face.

218
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,610
Don't eat me.

219
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,556
- I'm not going to eat you.
- Don't eat me.

220
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,249
No. Don't eat me.

221
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,262
Gibbs.

222
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,524
Come on! Let's go!

223
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,490
Come on! Who wants it?

224
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,604
I can do this all day!

225
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,623
dack?

226
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,998
Jack Sparrow!

227
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,639
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.

228
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,433
Jack, it's me.
a

229
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:07,909
Will Turner.

230
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,730
Tell them to let me down!

231
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,868
.eensy-weensy.

232
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,092
.eunuchy. Snip, snip.

233
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,153
Eunuchy.

234
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,408
Jack, the compass.
That's alll need.

235
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:41,491
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for helping you.

236
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,990
She faces the gallows!

237
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,496
Savvy?

238
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,132
Save me.

239
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,333
Jack, what did you tell them?

240
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,473
No!

241
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,186
What about Elizabeth?

242
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:10,935
Jack!

243
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,889
That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.

244
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:20,115
- We don't bite.
- Go on. We won't bite you.

245
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,457
Come quickly.

246
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,721
- Tell me what's happening.
- Our name still has some standing.

247
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:32,148
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.

248
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,524
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

249
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,669
We cannot count on William Turner.

250
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,774
- Come!
- He's better than you give him credit for.

251
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:43,272
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only -

252
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,849
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

253
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,725
Even if Will succeeds.
a

254
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:53,336
do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

255
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:58,046
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

256
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,130
- A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
- Then there is nothing left for you here.

257
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,763
Wait inside.

258
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,883
Captain?

259
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,387
Captain.

260
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,521
Evening, Governor.

261
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,631
Shame, that.
a

262
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,819
He was carrying this.

263
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,552
It's a letter to the king.

264
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,004
- It's from you.
- No...

265
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,590
Elizabeth.

266
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,676
What are you doing?

267
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,858
- Where is she?
- Who?

268
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:13,612
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

269
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,213
as your father believes.

270
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,636
Then what is?

271
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,901
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

272
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:28,028
l expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.

273
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,550
- I'm here to negotiate.
- I'm listening.

274
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,499
I'm listening intently.

275
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,820
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.

276
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:45,346
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.

277
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,391
Or else I would not still be here.

278
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:52,394
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

279
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:56,245
- It will do you no good.
- Do explain.

280
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:00,958
l have been to the Isla de Muerta.
l have seen the treasure myself.

281
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,420
- There is something you need to know.
-lsee.

282
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,698
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

283
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,927
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

284
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,191
But you mustn't worry.

285
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:19,011
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

286
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,681
My desires are not so provincial.

287
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:26,478
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.

288
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,803
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

289
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:39,082
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.

290
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,645
So I did.

291
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,865
A marriage interrupted

292
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,822
or fate intervenes?

293
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,787
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

294
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,480
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Really?

295
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:00,293
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom. then,
ee

296
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,930
I'll still want that compass.

297
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,526
Consider that in your calculations.

298
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,282
I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.

299
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,129
And I say it was me being clever.

300
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,980
Ain't that right, poochie?

301
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:41,059
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine
Providence what inspired you to be clever?

302
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,540
Anyways, l ain't stealing no ship.

303
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:48,535
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?

304
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:53,317
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

305
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,322
- You know you can't read.
- It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

306
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:02,686
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...

307
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,716
Look.

308
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,808
There it is.

309
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,549
What's got into him?

310
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,744
Must have seen a catfish.

311
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,083
Stupid mongrel!

312
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,951
Come on!

313
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,030
- It's ours for the taking.
- Tide’s coming in. That should help.

314
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,075
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

315
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,188
There's the truth of it!

316
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,557
Suppose we better save it
as Soon as we can.
a

317
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,837
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

318
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,639
Amen to that.

319
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,936
Thank you.

320
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,938
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

321
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,578
Aye. the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief.
a

322
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,197
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

323
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,431
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

324
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:11,774
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,

325
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:17,897
and they intend to do him the honor
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

326
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,440
They'll roast him and eat him.

327
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,384
Where's the rest of the crew?

328
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,682
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

329
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,476
The feast is about to begin.

330
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,279
Jack's life will end

331
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,668
when the drums stop.

332
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:46,002
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then. can we?
a

333
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,100
No, no. Oi! No, no.
re

334
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,246
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

335
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,599
lam Chief. Want big fire.

336
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,835
Come on.

337
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:04,476
Tout de suite.
Come on. More wood.

338
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,161
Bugger.

339
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,990
A little seasoning, eh?

340
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,469
Well done.

341
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,973
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!

342
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:30,138
Come on. men!
a
It ll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!

343
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,152
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

344
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,608
About six would do.

345
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,044
Oh, dear.
a

346
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,043
- Hurry!
- Come on!

347
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,249
Come on! Is that all you got?

348
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:03,406
Wait. Stop.

349
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,939
Stop.

350
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,743
- What are they doing?
- Stop.

351
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,266
Snake!

352
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,541
Move!

353
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,888
Well, go on, go get them.

354
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,689
No, no. Oi! No, no!
re

355
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,765
Not good.

356
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,216
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

357
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,054
Roll the cage!

358
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,426
Come on!

359
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,600
- Lift the cage! Hurry!
- Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.

360
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,567
Run!

361
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,916
This way, lads!

362
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,081
Take cover!

363
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,817
Stop it!

364
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,360
Bugger.

365
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,466
Haul loose the mooring line!

366
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,854
The mooring line!

367
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:53,451
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

368
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,871
- Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!

369
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,675
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

370
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:03,051
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

371
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:05,738
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

372
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,697
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?

373
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,170
l won't leave without him.

374
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:23,225
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!

375
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,920
Make ready to cast off!

376
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,996
Good doggy.

377
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:02,237
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day you almost...

378
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:08,067
Captain Jack Sparrow.

379
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,790
Let's get away from this island
and head out to open sea.

380
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,221
Yes to the first. Yes to the second. but
a
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

381
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,716
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

382
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,828
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.

383
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:50,035
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

384
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,173
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

385
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:01,023
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?

386
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:03,649
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.

387
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:08,424
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one’s mistakes.

388
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,418
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

389
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:15,057
I must trace it for her freedom.

390
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,018
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain.

391
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:23,108
We have a need to travel upriver.

392
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,624
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

393
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,464
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?

394
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:34,365
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

395
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,239
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

396
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,499
William.
a

397
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:42,585
I shall trade you the compass

398
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,547
if you will help me

399
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,742
to find this.

400
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,871
- You want me to find this?
- No.

401
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,455
You want you to find this,

402
00:45:56,821 --> 00:46:00,421
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

403
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:06,945
and’or locating in your discovering a way
to save your dolly belle, ol’ what's-her-face.

404
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,287
Savvy?

405
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,419
This is going to save Elizabeth?

406
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,731
How much cdo you know
about Davy Jones?

407
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,746
Not much.

408
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:26,645
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

409
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,647
What's all this?

410
00:46:56,547 --> 00:47:00,997
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

411
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:04,619
It's not like that. sir.
a
This ship is haunted.

412
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,573
Is it, now? And you?

413
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:11,555
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

414
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,319
All the men, they can feel it.

415
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:18,009
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage. I figure it,

416
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,556
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.

417
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:23,185
A virgin too, likely as not.

418
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,564
And that bodles ill by all accounts.

419
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,890
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

420
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,004
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

421
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:37,017
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.

422
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,578
Enough! Enough!

423
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:43,704
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

424
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,135
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

425
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,498
A young woman, by the look of it.

426
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:52,144
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

427
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,936
Oh, and she's probably naked.

428
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,512
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

429
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,985
Well, if you believe such things,

430
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:33,235
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones -

431
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:37,683
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

432
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,505
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

433
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,487
The kraken.

434
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:51,452
They say the stench of its breath is like...

435
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:55,096
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

436
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,839
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

437
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,644
If you believe such things.

438
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,584
And the key will spare him that?

439
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,046
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

440
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,740
Bad enough even to go visit

441
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,883
her.

442
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:19,862
Her?

443
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,907
Aye.

444
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,441
No worries. mates.
a
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

445
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:04,445
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

446
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,052
Were. Have been.

447
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:09,406
Before.

448
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,237
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

449
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,866
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

450
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,200
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

451
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:19,752
Mind the boat.

452
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,718
Mind the boat.

453
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,698
Jack Sparrow.

454
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,008
Tia Dalma.

455
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:45,111
l always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

456
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,047
You...

457
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,028
You have a touch of

458
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,381
destiny about you,

459
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,561
William Turner.

460
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:06,455
You know me?

461
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,107
You want to know me.

462
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,570
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.

463
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:17,454
- [ thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

464
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:19,875
- Come.
- Come.

465
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:27,763
What service may I do you?

466
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,499
- You know I demand payment.
- [brought payment.

467
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,344
Look.

468
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,900
An undead monkey.

469
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,166
Top that.

470
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:51,832
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

471
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,962
The payment is fair.

472
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:57,076
We're looking for this.

473
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:02,343
And what it goes to.

474
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:08,284
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

475
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:11,946
Maybe. Why?

476
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:18,752
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

477
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,923
Or do you know,

478
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,732
but are loath to claim it as your own?

479
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,751
Your key go to a chest.

480
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:34,591
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

481
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,769
- What is inside?
- Gold?

482
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:41,818
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

483
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:45,143
Nothing bad, I hope?

484
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,816
You know of Davy Jones,

485
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:50,603
yes?

486
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:53,328
A man of the sea.

487
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,757
A great sailor,

488
00:52:56,106 --> 00:53:00,526
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

489
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:03,875
What vexes all men?

490
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,939
What indeed?

491
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:10,596
- The sea.
- Sums.

492
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,551
The dichotomy of good and evil.

493
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,045
A woman.

494
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,987
A woman.

495
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:20,072
He fell in love.

496
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:23,027
No, no. no. no.
a
heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

497
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:26,947
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

498
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,584
See, it was a woman
a

499
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,400
as changing and harsh

500
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,799
and untamable as the sea.

501
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,420
Him never stopped loving her.

502
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:43,002
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

503
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:46,054
but not enough to cause him to die.

504
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:52,075
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

505
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,426
Him heart.

506
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,602
Literally or figuratively?

507
00:53:56,934 --> 00:54:00,914
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

508
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,322
Could he?

509
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:08,967
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

510
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,270
And so

511
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,917
him carve out him heart.
a

512
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,978
lock it away in a chest
and hicle the chest from the world.

513
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,264
The key

514
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:26,573
he keep with him at all times.

515
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:31,011
- You knew this.
- [did not. I didn't know where the key was.

516
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:35,285
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,

517
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:38,303
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

518
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,229
Let me see your hand.

519
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,315
The black spot!

520
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,761
- The black spot!
- Black spot!

521
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,352
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

522
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,843
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

523
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,839
My little beauty, where are you?

524
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,446
Such a long time in such a mess.

525
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:24,439
Davy Jones cannot make port.

526
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:27,785
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

527
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:31,599
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

528
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,312
and so you will carry land with you.

529
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,624
Dirt.

530
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,200
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

531
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:55,533
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

532
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:58,563
If you don't want it, give it back.

533
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:02,203
- No.
- Then it helps.

534
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:09,215
It seems we have a need to find
the Flying Dutchman.

535
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:16,306
A touch of destiny.

536
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:34,475
That's the Flying Dutchman?

537
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,213
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

538
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,680
Do not underestimate her.

539
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:47,303
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

540
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,975
l row over, search the ship
until find your bloody key.

541
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:53,555
And if there are crewmen?

542
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,901
I cut down anyone in my path.

543
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,560
l like it. Simple, easy to remember.

544
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,647
Your chariot awaits you, Sire.

545
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:12,561
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

546
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,790
- It might save your life.
- Bon voyage!

547
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:23,518
Douse the lamps.

548
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,442
Sailor.

549
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,930
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!

550
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,429
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

551
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,188
There's no use.
You've run aground.

552
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:15,790
No.

553
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:17,926
Beneath us.

554
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:21,169
Foul breath.

555
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:16,534
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

556
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:35,262
Get back! Get back!

557
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:10,554
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

558
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,905
Do you fear death?

559
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:36,946
Do you fear that dark abyss?

560
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,892
All your deeds laid bare.

561
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,770
All your sins punished.

562
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,194
I can offer you

563
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,750
an escape.

564
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:55,806
Don't listen to him!

565
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,458
Do you not fear death?

566
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,550
I'll take my chances, sir.

567
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:15,076
To the depths.

568
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,624
Cruel blackguard!

569
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:24,846
Life is cruel.

570
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,479
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

571
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:32,159
l offer you a choice.

572
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:35,022
Join my crew

573
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,475
and postpone the judgment.

574
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,232
One hundred years before the mast.

575
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,667
Will ye serve?

576
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,455
I will serve.

577
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,153
You are neither dead nor dying.

578
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,962
What is your purpose here?

579
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,872
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

580
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,296
What is your purpose here?

581
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,546
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.

582
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:25,186
Did he. now?
a

583
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,615
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

584
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,419
You have a debt to pay.

585
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:51,852
You've been captain of the Black Pear!
for 13 years.

586
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:54,205
That was our agreement.

587
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:57,937
Technically l was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

588
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:01,817
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

589
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:05,212
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

590
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,962
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

591
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,817
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.

592
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,477
One soul is not equal to another.

593
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:23,334
We've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

594
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,480
Price?

595
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,875
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

596
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,419
One hundred souls.

597
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:41,233
Three days.

598
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:45,381
You're a diamond. mate. Send me back
a
the boy. I'll get started right off.

599
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,672
l keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

600
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,495
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

601
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,581
Have you not met Will Turner?

602
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,420
He's noble, heroic.
a
a terrific soprano.

603
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,949
Worth at least four.

604
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:04,261
Maybe three and a half.

605
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:07,972
And did l happen to mention

606
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,581
he’s in love?

607
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:14,025
With a girl.

608
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,557
Due to be married.

609
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,670
Betrothed.

610
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:24,019
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

611
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:28,971
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony. Eh?

612
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:37,783
Il keep the boy. 99 souls.

613
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,810
But I wonder, Sparrow,

614
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,171
can you live with this?

615
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:47,547
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend.
a

616
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:52,424
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

617
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:58,039
Yep. I'm good with it.

618
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,235
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean ink.

619
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:08,269
Three days.

620
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,009
Three days.

621
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:25,462
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye.

622
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:28,199
I feel sullied and unusual.

623
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:33,691
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

624
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:39,764
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.

625
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,320
Tortuga.

626
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:44,962
Tortuga.

627
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,302
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

628
01:05:52,816 --> 01:05:55,685
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

629
01:05:56,152 --> 01:06:00,022
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

630
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:04,577
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.

631
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,471
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

632
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:12,664
An honest sailor is what lam. l make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.

633
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:15,707
Sir!

634
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,482
She wants you to do something.

635
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:47,241
She's trying to give a sign.

636
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,135
Over there! Look for a sign!

637
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,149
Look, there! There it is!
a

638
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,135
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.

639
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:11,245
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

640
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:16,174
- That would be a bad sign.
- What's that over there?

641
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:37,924
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pear!?

642
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,348
I've never sailed a day in me life.

643
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:43,500
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

644
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,980
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!

645
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,803
My wife ran off with my dog

646
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,757
and I'm drunk for a month

647
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:54,976
and I don't give an ass rat's

648
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,035
if l live or die.

649
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:00,000
- Perfect. Next!
- [Know what I want. [ Know what I want...

650
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:04,106
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow’s nest for you.

651
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,577
- [Know what I want.
- Next!

652
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:11,866
Ever since I was a little lad.
a
I've always wanted to sail the seas forever.

653
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:15,022
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

654
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:17,445
Thanks very much.

655
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:22,334
- How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us four.

656
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,362
And what's your story?

657
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:30,894
My story.

658
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:35,754
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

659
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:39,635
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

660
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,669
The pursuit cost me my crew,

661
01:08:43,086 --> 01:08:45,426
soe
my commission,

662
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:47,721
and my life.

663
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:57,279
- Commodore?
- No, not anymore. Weren't you listening?

664
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,120
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

665
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:08,187
I would have.
a
if not for the hurricane.

666
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,071
Lord.

667
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,093
You didn't try to sail through it?

668
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:14,665
So, dol make your crew

669
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:16,801
or not?

670
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:20,314
You haven't said where you're going.

671
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:22,533
Somewhere nice?!

672
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,966
So, am I worthy to serve

673
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,788
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

674
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,590
Or should I just kill you now?

675
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:43,040
You're hired.

676
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,889
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

677
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,580
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

678
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,950
- Time to go.
- Aye!

679
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:52,597
Thanks, mate.
a

680
01:10:58,521 --> 01:11:00,221
Carry on.

681
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:10,014
Come on. then! Who wants some?
a

682
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,499
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

683
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:16,053
Come on. who's first?
a

684
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:22,045
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

685
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,508
James Norrington.

686
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,428
What has the world done to you?

687
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,929
Heave!

688
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,372
Heave!

689
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,095
Heave!

690
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:33,251
Heave!

691
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:37,570
- Heave!
- Heave!

692
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:44,433
Secure the mast tackle. Mr. Turner!
a

693
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,830
Set to it!

694
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,921
- Step aside.
- Hey! Mind yourself!

695
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,817
Let go, boy!

696
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,646
No.

697
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,200
Haul that weevil to his feet.

698
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,171
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!

699
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:30,147
- No!
- Impeding me in my duties?

700
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,210
- You'll share the punishment.
- I'll take it all.

701
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,853
Will you, now?

702
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:41,813
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

703
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,884
My son.

704
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:55,079
He's my son.

705
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:09,509
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

706
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:13,409
Five lashes be owed. I believe it is.
a

707
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,977
No. No, I won't!
a

708
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:23,817
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.

709
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:29,373
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.

710
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:35,978
No.

711
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:38,089
- Bosun!
- No!

712
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,591
You had it easy, boy!

713
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:28,668
- Will.
- [don't need your help.

714
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:36,362
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh
from bone, with every swing.

715
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:41,558
So I'm to understand
what you dic was an act of compassion?

716
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:44,108
Yes.

717
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:55,501
100 years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,

718
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:59,684
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.

719
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:05,527
Once you've sworn an oath
to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

720
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:08,845
Not until your debt is paid.

721
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,468
I've sworn no oath.

722
01:16:13,436 --> 01:16:15,366
You must get away.

723
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,541
Not until I find this.

724
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:22,113
The key.

725
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:31,661
The dead man's chest.

726
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:34,992
What clo you know of this?

727
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:39,483
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

728
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:42,879
No, don't stab the heart.
a

729
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:47,812
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

730
01:16:48,504 --> 01:16:52,284
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

731
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:55,459
So the captain has the key?

732
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:59,442
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

733
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,612
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.

734
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,732
Captain Sparrow!

735
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:10,193
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

736
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:12,899
I'm here to find the man I love.

737
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:18,240
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

738
01:17:19,902 --> 01:17:23,562
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

739
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,340
Elizabeth.

740
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,714
Hicle the rum.

741
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,657
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.

742
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,769
- [happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

743
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:39,225
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

744
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:42,818
Darling, l am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but

745
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:49,415
through unfortunate circumstances
that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

746
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:54,462
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.

747
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:57,771
Davy Jones?

748
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:01,525
Oh, please.

749
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:05,082
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?

750
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:08,437
- You look awful. What are you doing here?
- You hired me.

751
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:10,907
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

752
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,803
- You smell funny.
- Jack!

753
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:17,020
All l want is to find Will.

754
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:24,649
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?

755
01:18:26,135 --> 01:18:28,215
Of course.

756
01:18:28,571 --> 01:18:32,321
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.

757
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:36,875
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well.
a

758
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:40,282
- there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.
a

759
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:42,799
A chest of unknown size and origin.

760
01:18:43,152 --> 01:18:47,492
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

761
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,131
And whoever possesses that chest

762
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:54,937
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants.
a

763
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:59,837
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

764
01:19:00,536 --> 01:19:03,666
You don't actually believe him, do you?

765
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:10,861
How would we find it?

766
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:14,955
With this.

767
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,801
My compass is unique.

768
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,527
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken."

769
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:26,825
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

770
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:32,054
Where cles it point?

771
01:19:32,468 --> 01:19:36,718
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

772
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:41,836
Jack.

773
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:47,256
- Are you telling the truth?
- Every word, love.

774
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,953
And what you want most in this world

775
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,460
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

776
01:19:56,125 --> 01:20:00,465
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

777
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,725
- Mr. Gibbs!
- Cap'n.

778
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,071
- We have our heading.
- Finally!

779
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:25,457
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

780
01:20:26,088 --> 01:20:27,838
Miss Swann.

781
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,346
Welcome to the crew.
a
former commodore.

782
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:44,679
There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one’s place in it.

783
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:47,711
l assure you, these are not necessary.

784
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:52,059
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

785
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:55,750
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on Tortuga,

786
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:59,761
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

787
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,902
and other fugitives from justice.

788
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,965
"Justice"? Hardly.

789
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:10,330
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.

790
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:15,723
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

791
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:19,852
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

792
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:25,679
I find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board.

793
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,327
What clo you want from me?

794
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,430
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

795
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,020
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

796
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:41,775
To you, you mean.

797
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:48,131
Shall l remove these shackles?

798
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:54,663
Do what you can for my daughter.

799
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:05,710
So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

800
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:09,758
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

801
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,651
I wager ten years.

802
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:21,982
I'll match ten years.

803
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:24,792
Agreed.

804
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:30,410
Wondering how it's played?

805
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:32,483
- Lunderstand.
- Liar!

806
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:37,671
It's a game of deception. But your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.

807
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:41,443
- What are they wagering?
- The only thing we have.

808
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,940
Years of service.

809
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:50,081
- So any crew member can be challenged?
- Aye. Anyone.

810
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,865
I challenge Davy Jones.

811
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:18,471
l accept, mate.

812
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:35,262
- The stakes?
- My soul. An eternity of servitude.

813
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,941
No!

814
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:41,722
Against?

815
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:45,102
I want this.

816
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:01,843
- How clo you know of the key?
- That's not part of the game, is it?

817
01:24:05,641 --> 01:24:07,920
You can still walk away.

818
01:24:32,935 --> 01:24:35,655
- What's this?
- I'min. Matching his wager.

819
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:38,684
No! Don't do this.

820
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:43,403
The die is cast.

821
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:46,532
I bid three twos.

822
01:24:46,982 --> 01:24:48,882
It's your bid, Captain.

823
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:58,087
Four fours.

824
01:25:07,536 --> 01:25:10,346
Four fives.

825
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:12,295
Six threes.

826
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,929
Seven fives.

827
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:51,261
Eight fives.

828
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:59,321
Welcome to the crew. lad.
a

829
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:04,553
Twelve fives.

830
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,650
Twelve fives.

831
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:09,388
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

832
01:26:11,066 --> 01:26:14,226
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

833
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:22,385
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

834
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:28,602
Master Turner.
a
feel free to go ashore

835
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:33,199
the very next time we make port!

836
01:26:41,163 --> 01:26:44,263
Fool. Why did you do that?

837
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:48,194
I couldn't let you lose.

838
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,937
It was never about winning or losing.

839
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:54,935
The key.

840
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:59,328
You just wanted to know where it was.

841
01:27:19,301 --> 01:27:21,581
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

842
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,717
Captain's orders.

843
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:20,099
Here. Take this. too.
a

844
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,346
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

845
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:28,063
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

846
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,190
It was not a fate l ever wanted for you.

847
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:39,588
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

848
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:45,558
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

849
01:29:47,249 --> 01:29:51,059
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

850
01:29:53,288 --> 01:29:55,657
You owe me nothing, Will.

851
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,956
Now go.

852
01:29:59,361 --> 01:30:01,731
They'll know you helped me.

853
01:30:03,465 --> 01:30:05,215
What more can they do to me?

854
01:30:11,273 --> 01:30:13,263
I take this with a promise.

855
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:15,748
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

856
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:19,510
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

857
01:30:21,483 --> 01:30:23,533
I will not abandon you.

858
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:28,704
I promise.

859
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:45,074
- Beckett?
- Yes, they're signed.

860
01:30:45,407 --> 01:30:48,977
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

861
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:52,824
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

862
01:30:53,682 --> 01:30:56,992
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

863
01:30:57,519 --> 01:30:59,769
Of course.

864
01:31:00,155 --> 01:31:03,465
- He wants the chest.
- Yes, he did say something about a chest.

865
01:31:03,992 --> 01:31:07,182
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

866
01:31:07,696 --> 01:31:11,006
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

867
01:31:11,533 --> 01:31:14,753
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

868
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:18,140
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

869
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:20,505
Brace the foreyard!

870
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,712
Might l enquire
as to how you came by these?

871
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:25,879
- Persuasion.
- Friendly?

872
01:31:26,181 --> 01:31:27,611
Decidedly not.

873
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:32,772
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one
with the prize - full pardon.

874
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:35,510
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

875
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:38,317
"and the East India Trading Company.”

876
01:31:38,727 --> 01:31:40,777
As if l could be bought
for such a low price.

877
01:31:41,129 --> 01:31:43,318
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No.

878
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:45,778
Persuade me.

879
01:31:46,134 --> 01:31:49,444
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

880
01:31:52,307 --> 01:31:55,557
As l said, persuade me.

881
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:12,461
It's a curious thing.

882
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:18,808
There was a time I would have wanted you
to look like that while thinking about me.

883
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:21,677
- [don't know what you mean.
- [ think you do.

884
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:24,527
Don't be absurd.
I trust him. that's all.
a

885
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31,564
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancé

886
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:35,452
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?

887
01:33:00,475 --> 01:33:03,345
Strange to come upon a longboat
so far out in open water.

888
01:33:03,812 --> 01:33:06,832
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

889
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:10,065
And what are we running from?

890
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,716
That dress. Where did you get it?

891
01:33:18,126 --> 01:33:19,616
It was found aboard the ship.

892
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:23,874
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

893
01:33:24,499 --> 01:33:27,539
- That's foolish.
- Yes. Exceedingly foolish.

894
01:33:28,036 --> 01:33:33,306
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga,”

895
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:35,889
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

896
01:33:36,211 --> 01:33:38,961
Off the books, of course.
a

897
01:33:39,414 --> 01:33:42,754
l imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

898
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,834
- Why do you ask?
- Captain! A ship's been spotted.

899
01:33:46,254 --> 01:33:48,744
- Colors?
- She isn't flying any.

900
01:33:49,157 --> 01:33:50,907
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

901
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:05,767
You will watch this.

902
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:16,011
Let no joyful voice be heard!

903
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,296
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

904
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:28,998
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake

905
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,066
the kraken.

906
01:34:33,735 --> 01:34:35,195
No!

907
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,570
I've doomed us all.

908
01:34:55,323 --> 01:34:57,813
It's the Flying Dutchman!

909
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:05,234
Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

910
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,790
Must have hit a reef.

911
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:18,433
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.

912
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,950
- Free the rudder!
- Hard to port!

913
01:35:29,624 --> 01:35:32,693
- Kraken!
- Kraken!

914
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:49,218
Here it is! Take it!

915
01:35:49,644 --> 01:35:51,394
Take it!

916
01:38:03,578 --> 01:38:07,588
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.

917
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:10,406
lam the sea.

918
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:17,224
You need time alone with your thoughts.

919
01:38:17,692 --> 01:38:19,942
- Brig!
- What of the survivors?

920
01:38:25,767 --> 01:38:28,757
There are no survivors.

921
01:38:49,323 --> 01:38:53,103
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

922
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:55,744
Get me there first.
a
or there'll be the devil to pay.

923
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:57,706
"First"?

924
01:38:57,999 --> 01:39:00,809
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

925
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:03,049
Who told him of the key?

926
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:08,307
Jack Sparrow.

927
01:39:26,928 --> 01:39:32,907
My intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.

928
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:36,791
I just thought I'd be married by now.

929
01:39:37,271 --> 01:39:39,321
I'm so ready to be married.

930
01:39:47,215 --> 01:39:48,995
You know...

931
01:39:50,885 --> 01:39:55,635
Lizzie, l am captain of a ship,

932
01:39:56,357 --> 01:40:03,827
and being captain of a ship, I could in fact
perform a "marr-i-age” right here.

933
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:07,041
Right on this deck.

934
01:40:07,401 --> 01:40:09,130
Right now.

935
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:15,027
No, thank you.

936
01:40:15,376 --> 01:40:16,746
Why not?

937
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:20,291
We are very much alike, you and I.
land you. Us.

938
01:40:20,815 --> 01:40:24,684
Except for a sense of honor
and decency and a moral center.

939
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,830
And personal hygiene.

940
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:31,610
Trifles.

941
01:40:31,959 --> 01:40:34,209
You will come over to my side. I know it.

942
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:39,255
- You seem very certain.
- One word, love. Curiosity.

943
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:41,397
You long for freedom.

944
01:40:41,669 --> 01:40:44,389
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

945
01:40:44,839 --> 01:40:47,529
To act on selfish impulse.

946
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:50,435
You want to see what it's like.

947
01:40:50,845 --> 01:40:54,745
One day, you won't be able to resist.

948
01:40:55,816 --> 01:40:58,096
Why doesn't your compass work?

949
01:41:00,021 --> 01:41:02,741
My compass works fine.

950
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:05,104
Because you and I are alike,

951
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,913
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

952
01:41:08,696 --> 01:41:11,686
- To do the right thing.
- Llove those moments.

953
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:14,617
l like to wave at them as they pass by.

954
01:41:14,969 --> 01:41:19,859
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.

955
01:41:20,608 --> 01:41:23,418
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

956
01:41:23,878 --> 01:41:26,157
That you're a good man.

957
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:28,736
All evidence to the contrary.

958
01:41:29,116 --> 01:41:31,806
I have faith in you.

959
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:34,803
- Want to know why?
- Do tell. dearie.
a

960
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:39,588
Curiosity.

961
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:42,637
You're going to want it.

962
01:41:43,064 --> 01:41:46,464
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

963
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:50,232
You won't be able to resist.

964
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:56,442
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

965
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:02,273
I do want to know what it tastes like.

966
01:42:02,717 --> 01:42:04,297
But, seeing as you're a good man,

967
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:08,455
l know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honor.

968
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:19,168
I'm proud of you, Jack.

969
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,990
Land. ho!
a

970
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:29,088
Il want my jar of clirt.

971
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:33,391
- You're pulling too fast.
- You're pulling too slow.

972
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:38,324
- We don't want the kraken to catch us.
- I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

973
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:42,920
And I don't think it's "kracken” anyways.
l always heard it said "krayken.”

974
01:42:43,524 --> 01:42:44,954
With a long a?

975
01:42:45,226 --> 01:42:48,656
No, no. no. no, no. no. no. "Krocken”
ce
is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

976
01:42:49,196 --> 01:42:50,746
and "kracken” is closer to that.

977
01:42:51,032 --> 01:42:54,072
We ain't Scandinavians. are we?
a
"Krayken.”

978
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:56,968
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

979
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,165
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

980
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:05,531
Don't touch my dirt.

981
01:43:41,716 --> 01:43:46,286
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.

982
01:43:51,092 --> 01:43:54,052
Yes, it does. You're sitting on it.

983
01:43:55,329 --> 01:43:56,818
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

984
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:07,199
- "Guard the boat!” "Mind the tide!”
- [could join the circus.

985
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:09,038
Mind if l shine your shoes, sir?

986
01:44:13,647 --> 01:44:17,807
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

987
01:44:18,452 --> 01:44:20,202
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

988
01:44:20,521 --> 01:44:23,481
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

989
01:44:25,493 --> 01:44:28,123
- Down, then!
a
- Down!

990
01:45:38,199 --> 01:45:40,009
It's real.

991
01:45:41,235 --> 01:45:43,075
You actually were telling the truth.

992
01:45:43,404 --> 01:45:46,534
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

993
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:49,561
With good reason!

994
01:45:49,977 --> 01:45:52,166
Will!

995
01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:55,856
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

996
01:46:02,423 --> 01:46:04,293
How did you get here?

997
01:46:04,625 --> 01:46:08,105
Sea turtles. mate.
a
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

998
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:10,332
Not so easy, is it?

999
01:46:10,631 --> 01:46:12,941
- But l do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

1000
01:46:13,334 --> 01:46:16,994
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

1001
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:19,351
- What?
- What?

1002
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:22,987
..l was reunited with my father.

1003
01:46:23,444 --> 01:46:25,404
Well, you're welcome, then.

1004
01:46:26,146 --> 01:46:29,545
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

1005
01:46:30,084 --> 01:46:31,394
Pretty much.

1006
01:46:31,652 --> 01:46:33,762
Time and ticle, love.
a

1007
01:46:34,121 --> 01:46:36,081
Oi! What are you doing?

1008
01:46:37,458 --> 01:46:39,538
I'm going to kill Jones.

1009
01:46:40,828 --> 01:46:42,878
Can't let you do that, William.

1010
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:48,559
‘Cause if Jones is dead. who's to call
a
his terrible beastie off the hunt. eh?
a

1011
01:46:55,342 --> 01:46:58,241
Now, if you please.

1012
01:46:59,313 --> 01:47:01,563
The key.

1013
01:47:04,051 --> 01:47:06,421
l keep the promises I make, Jack.

1014
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,750
l intend to free my father.
l hope you're here to see it.

1015
01:47:10,224 --> 01:47:13,444
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

1016
01:47:13,961 --> 01:47:17,121
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1017
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:21,909
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

1018
01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:25,249
I deliver it, l get my life back.

1019
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:28,547
The dark sicle of ambition.

1020
01:47:28,809 --> 01:47:32,119
I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

1021
01:47:36,884 --> 01:47:38,224
Stop it!

1022
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:46,435
Will!

1023
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:50,378
- Guard the chest!
- No!

1024
01:47:50,831 --> 01:47:55,781
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...

1025
01:47:56,537 --> 01:48:00,757
Fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.

1026
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:03,718
That will solve everything! I've had it!

1027
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:08,501
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

1028
01:48:11,752 --> 01:48:16,292
- How'd this go all screwy?
- Well. each wants the chest for hisself.
a

1029
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:19,801
Mr. Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honor,

1030
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:22,450
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin.
a

1031
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:26,490
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

1032
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:30,257
‘twixt him and his twice-cursed
pirate father.

1033
01:48:30,771 --> 01:48:32,521
- Sad.
- This is madness!

1034
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:36,180
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

1035
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:38,410
Terrible temptation.

1036
01:48:38,712 --> 01:48:43,982
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

1037
01:48:50,391 --> 01:48:52,000
Enough!

1038
01:48:58,565 --> 01:49:00,844
The heat!

1039
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,030
Bugger!

1040
01:49:34,468 --> 01:49:36,638
By your leave, Mr. Turner.

1041
01:50:23,884 --> 01:50:26,574
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.

1042
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:21,669
Do excuse me
while I kill the man who ruined my life.

1043
01:51:22,109 --> 01:51:25,649
- Be my guest.
- Let us examine that claim for a moment.

1044
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:31,380
Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

1045
01:51:32,119 --> 01:51:38,098
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

1046
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:42,340
So whose fault is it, really,

1047
01:51:42,729 --> 01:51:46,599
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?

1048
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:48,951
Enough!

1049
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:54,778
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!

1050
01:51:57,211 --> 01:51:58,881
Still rooting for you, mate.

1051
01:52:57,304 --> 01:52:59,764
We got it! We got it! We got it!

1052
01:53:14,454 --> 01:53:17,143
Hello, poppet.

1053
01:53:44,351 --> 01:53:46,050
Come on. run!
a

1054
01:54:29,129 --> 01:54:30,858
- Sword!
- Sword! Sword!

1055
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:36,254
Sword!

1056
01:55:17,277 --> 01:55:19,587
Follow my voice.
Follow my voice.

1057
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:21,969
To the left... no, turn around.
a

1058
01:55:22,315 --> 01:55:24,155
Go to the right.

1059
01:55:24,484 --> 01:55:26,704
No, that's a tree.
a

1060
01:55:27,087 --> 01:55:28,397
Shut it.

1061
01:56:18,104 --> 01:56:20,214
dar of dirt!

1062
01:57:20,634 --> 01:57:22,384
Right.

1063
01:57:55,769 --> 01:57:57,789
We've got it!

1064
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:10,407
Come on. Turner!
a

1065
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:30,940
Leave him lie! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.

1066
01:58:31,905 --> 01:58:34,275
- We're not getting out of this.
- Not with the chest.

1067
01:58:34,674 --> 01:58:36,404
Into the boat.

1068
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:39,290
- You're mad!
- Don't wait for me.

1069
01:58:45,819 --> 01:58:49,129
- lsay we respect his final wish.
- Aye!

1070
01:58:58,965 --> 01:59:01,155
Your bravery is wasted.

1071
01:59:02,836 --> 01:59:08,376
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.

1072
01:59:11,077 --> 01:59:12,657
Here you go!

1073
01:59:24,624 --> 01:59:26,233
Pirates!

1074
01:59:44,477 --> 01:59:47,547
- What happened to the chest?
- Norrington took it to draw them off.

1075
01:59:48,415 --> 01:59:51,255
- You're pulling too hare!
- You ain't pulling hard enough!

1076
01:59:52,085 --> 01:59:54,805
- Where's the commodore?
- Fell behind.

1077
01:59:55,255 --> 01:59:57,155
My prayers be with him.

1078
01:59:57,490 --> 01:59:59,240
Best not wallow in our grief.

1079
01:59:59,559 --> 02:00:03,869
The bright side is you're back,
and made it off free and clear.

1080
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:21,829
Lord on high, deliver us.

1081
02:00:25,385 --> 02:00:26,965
I'll handle this, mate.
a

1082
02:00:29,456 --> 02:00:30,916
Oi. fishface!
a

1083
02:00:32,592 --> 02:00:34,871
Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!

1084
02:00:40,467 --> 02:00:42,217
Got it!

1085
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:46,330
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

1086
02:00:46,773 --> 02:00:48,083
Look what I got.

1087
02:00:48,341 --> 02:00:51,061
! got a jar of dirt.
{got a jar of dirt

1088
02:00:51,511 --> 02:00:53,181
And guess what's inside it?

1089
02:00:54,314 --> 02:00:55,624
Enough!

1090
02:01:03,923 --> 02:01:06,322
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard!

1091
02:01:06,726 --> 02:01:09,505
Brace up the foreyard!

1092
02:01:13,032 --> 02:01:14,842
Hard to starboard!

1093
02:01:15,168 --> 02:01:19,508
Send his beloved Pear!
back to the depths.

1094
02:01:32,152 --> 02:01:35,552
She's on us! She's on us!

1095
02:01:37,624 --> 02:01:41,193
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, Captain.

1096
02:02:07,587 --> 02:02:08,927
Make fast!

1097
02:02:10,356 --> 02:02:12,606
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

1098
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:15,392
Come on, girl!

1099
02:02:21,768 --> 02:02:23,938
- She's falling behind!
- Aye. We've got her!

1100
02:02:24,304 --> 02:02:27,554
- We're the faster?
- Against the wind, the Dutchman beats us.

1101
02:02:28,074 --> 02:02:30,244
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

1102
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:32,219
Aye.

1103
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:35,854
We're out of range!

1104
02:02:36,115 --> 02:02:40,245
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

1105
02:02:40,887 --> 02:02:42,937
We're giving up. sir?

1106
02:02:53,333 --> 02:02:55,353
They're giving up!

1107
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:03,577
My father is on that ship.

1108
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:06,099
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.

1109
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:12,599
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.

1110
02:03:23,563 --> 02:03:26,023
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

1111
02:03:27,734 --> 02:03:30,344
We must have hit a reef!

1112
02:03:32,772 --> 02:03:36,342
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!

1113
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:39,570
- What is it?
- The kraken.

1114
02:03:40,313 --> 02:03:42,303
- To arms!
- Load guns! Defend the mast!

1115
02:03:42,649 --> 02:03:46,569
Itll attack the starboard. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!

1116
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:22,860
Easy, boys!

1117
02:04:26,526 --> 02:04:27,456
Will?

1118
02:04:28,094 --> 02:04:30,024
Steady! Steady.

1119
02:04:32,231 --> 02:04:35,271
- Will!
- Hold. Hold.

1120
02:04:35,768 --> 02:04:38,428
I think we've held fire long enough.

1121
02:04:40,006 --> 02:04:42,086
- Will!
- Fire!

1122
02:05:02,495 --> 02:05:05,595
- It ll be back. We have to get off the ship.
- There's no boats.

1123
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:18,280
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

1124
02:05:21,147 --> 02:05:25,097
- Whatever you do, don't miss.
- As soon as you're clear.

1125
02:05:39,832 --> 02:05:43,432
We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!

1126
02:05:44,937 --> 02:05:46,837
Hurry up!

1127
02:05:47,173 --> 02:05:50,303
- There's only six kegs of powder!
- Then load the rum.

1128
02:05:59,619 --> 02:06:02,108
Aye. the rum too!

1129
02:06:30,650 --> 02:06:32,400
Step to!

1130
02:06:36,322 --> 02:06:38,602
You coward.

1131
02:06:43,729 --> 02:06:45,539
Not good.

1132
02:06:53,706 --> 02:06:56,106
- Haul away!
- Heave!

1133
02:06:56,509 --> 02:07:00,319
- Heave like you're being paid for it!
- Put your backs into it!

1134
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:46,760
- L got you! I got you!
- Don't let me go!

1135
02:07:47,226 --> 02:07:49,566
- lL won't let you go!
- Shoot me!

1136
02:07:55,201 --> 02:07:57,861
- Clear?
- Higher! Higher!

1137
02:08:15,121 --> 02:08:16,991
Here! Come on!

1138
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:20,230
Come and get me. I'm over here!

1139
02:08:20,626 --> 02:08:22,436
Come on!

1140
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:50,460
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!
a

1141
02:10:18,210 --> 02:10:19,910
Did we kill it?

1142
02:10:20,212 --> 02:10:23,372
No. We just made it angry.

1143
02:10:24,183 --> 02:10:26,793
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

1144
02:10:29,088 --> 02:10:31,458
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

1145
02:10:34,026 --> 02:10:36,546
Jack. The Pear!.

1146
02:10:38,164 --> 02:10:40,244
She's only a ship, mate.

1147
02:10:40,599 --> 02:10:42,849
He's right.
We have to head for land.

1148
02:10:43,235 --> 02:10:45,955
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

1149
02:10:46,405 --> 02:10:50,474
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the Peari.

1150
02:10:52,945 --> 02:10:54,554
Abandon ship.

1151
02:10:54,847 --> 02:10:56,987
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1152
02:11:14,033 --> 02:11:15,933
Thank you, Jack.

1153
02:11:18,304 --> 02:11:20,704
We're not free yet, love.

1154
02:11:21,107 --> 02:11:23,007
You came back.

1155
02:11:25,845 --> 02:11:28,215
l always knew you were a good man.

1156
02:11:41,527 --> 02:11:44,017
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

1157
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:46,570
Come on, Will. Step to!

1158
02:12:05,951 --> 02:12:08,121
It's after you, not the ship.

1159
02:12:08,487 --> 02:12:11,067
It's not us.

1160
02:12:11,490 --> 02:12:13,950
This is the only way, don't you see?

1161
02:12:17,563 --> 02:12:19,463
I'm not sorry.

1162
02:12:25,337 --> 02:12:27,087
Pirate.

1163
02:12:46,692 --> 02:12:48,652
Where's Jack?

1164
02:12:52,498 --> 02:12:55,958
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

1165
02:13:05,144 --> 02:13:06,754
Go!

1166
02:13:19,758 --> 02:13:21,838
Bugger. Bugger. bugger.

1167
02:13:51,457 --> 02:13:53,327
Come on!

1168
02:13:57,830 --> 02:14:00,230
Just got it. Come on.

1169
02:14:29,662 --> 02:14:31,832
Not so bad.

1170
02:14:43,409 --> 02:14:45,018
Hello, beastie.
a

1171
02:15:34,059 --> 02:15:37,779
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

1172
02:15:39,598 --> 02:15:41,588
The captain goes down with his ship.

1173
02:15:41,934 --> 02:15:45,474
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

1174
02:15:51,243 --> 02:15:53,553
Open the chest.

1175
02:15:55,014 --> 02:15:57,234
Open the chest. I need to see it!

1176
02:16:13,098 --> 02:16:18,368
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

1177
02:16:24,910 --> 02:16:27,340
The last of our ships is returned.

1178
02:16:27,746 --> 02:16:29,886
Is there any news on the chest?

1179
02:16:30,249 --> 02:16:35,228
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adirift at sea.

1180
02:16:35,987 --> 02:16:37,887
He had these.

1181
02:16:45,129 --> 02:16:47,910
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

1182
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:59,408
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

1183
02:16:59,977 --> 02:17:02,287
Do you have the compass?

1184
02:17:02,681 --> 02:17:04,291
Better.

1185
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:13,940
The heart of Davy Jones.

1186
02:18:09,681 --> 02:18:11,871
Against the cold

1187
02:18:12,251 --> 02:18:14,300
and the sorrow.

1188
02:18:24,830 --> 02:18:27,110
It's a shame.

1189
02:18:27,499 --> 02:18:29,669
I know you're thinking that with the Pear!

1190
02:18:30,035 --> 02:18:34,785
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1191
02:18:35,507 --> 02:18:37,906
Doesn't matter now.

1192
02:18:38,309 --> 02:18:40,650
The Pear! is gone,

1193
02:18:41,046 --> 02:18:42,776
along with its captain.

1194
02:18:43,081 --> 02:18:45,011
Aye.

1195
02:18:45,350 --> 02:18:48,830
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

1196
02:18:49,388 --> 02:18:52,108
He fooled us all right till the end,

1197
02:18:52,558 --> 02:18:55,868
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

1198
02:18:59,198 --> 02:19:00,748
To Jack Sparrow.

1199
02:19:01,032 --> 02:19:05,422
- Never another like Captain Jack.
- He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1200
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:08,448
He was a good man.

1201
02:19:29,428 --> 02:19:32,998
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1202
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:38,117
- Elizabeth.
- Would you clo it?

1203
02:19:39,805 --> 02:19:41,855
What would you...

1204
02:19:45,611 --> 02:19:49,071
What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?

1205
02:19:50,716 --> 02:19:54,176
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

1206
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:59,170
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious Pear!?

1207
02:20:05,964 --> 02:20:07,044
