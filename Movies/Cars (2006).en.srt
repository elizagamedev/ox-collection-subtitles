1
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,887
OK... Here we go. Focus.

2
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,300
Speed. lam speed.

3
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,812
One winner, 42 losers.

4
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,465
l eat losers for breakfast.

5
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,146
Breakfast.

6
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,228
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

7
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,807
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

8
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,922
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

9
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:05,694
lam lightning!

10
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,017
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

11
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,488
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready.

12
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,411
Get your antenna balls here!

13
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,166
Go, Lightnin’!

14
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,623
You got that right, slick.

15
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,815
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

16
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,561
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

17
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,765
We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.

18
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,991
Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.

19
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,412
If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

20
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:37,967
Right you are, Darrell.

21
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,175
Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,

22
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,360
heading into the final race
of the season.

23
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,078
And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.

24
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,311
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

25
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,786
have one more victory in him
before retirement?

26
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,125
He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years!

27
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,578
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

28
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,897
And, as always, in the second place
spot we find Chick Hicks.

29
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,713
He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.

30
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,860
Chick thought this was his year, Bob.

31
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,638
His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.

32
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,478
But the last thing he expected was...

33
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,543
But the last thing he expected was...

34
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,944
..Lightning McQueen!

35
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,645
You know, I don't think anybody
expected this.

36
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:14,744
You know, I don't think anybody
expected this.

37
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,197
The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.

38
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,901
But everyone knows him now.

39
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:22,729
Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

40
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,580
The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!

41
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,486
Three cars, one champion!

42
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,324
No, you don't.

43
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,894
What a ride!

44
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,427
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

45
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,113
I love you, Lightning!

46
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,075
Dinoco is all mine.

47
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,481
Trouble, turn three!

48
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,013
- Get through that, McQueen.
- A huge crash behind the leaders!

49
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,879
Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

50
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,291
There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

51
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,130
Not in one piece, that is.

52
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,447
Yeah!

53
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,455
Lightning!

54
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,776
Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

55
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,301
Man, a spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

56
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,537
Yeah! Ka-chow!

57
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,740
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

58
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,076
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

59
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,853
While everyone else heads into the pits,
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

60
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,010
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

61
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,205
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

62
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,133
- McQueen made it through!
- What?

63
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,565
He's not pitting!

64
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,543
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

65
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,547
McQueen's not going into the pits!

66
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,962
The rookie just fired his crew chief.
That's the third one this season!

67
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,489
- He says he likes working alone.
- Go, go, go!

68
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,798
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

69
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,130
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

70
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,720
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

71
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,784
Come on, come on, come on!

72
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,214
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

73
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,913
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- What?

74
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,189
You need tires, you idiot!

75
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,212
Looks like it's all gas-and-go's
for McQueen today.

76
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,957
That's right. No tires again.

77
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,789
That's a short-term gain, long-term
loss, but it's sure workin’ for him.

78
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,467
He obviously
knows somethin’ we don't know.

79
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,069
This is it, Darrell.

80
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,120
One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

81
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,688
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

82
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,128
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

83
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,553
Checkered flag, here I come!

84
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,871
Oh, no! McQueen has blown a tire!

85
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,651
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

86
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,577
You fool!

87
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,135
McQueen's blown a tire!
McQueen's blown a tire!

88
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,837
Go, go, go!

89
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,728
He's lost another tire!

90
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,850
- King and Chick are coming up fast!
- They're entering turn three!

91
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,953
Come on.

92
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,010
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

93
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,452
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

94
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,908
The King and Chick rounding turn four.

95
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,970
Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

96
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,897
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- [don't believe it!

97
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,506
Lightning!

98
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,605
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- [don't believe it!

99
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,084
.. unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

100
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,361
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

101
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,327
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

102
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,902
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

103
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,439
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.

104
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,675
Tell me about it!

105
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,212
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?

106
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,627
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.

107
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,541
! mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?

108
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,783
! wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

109
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,955
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

110
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,187
No, I'm not.
‘Cause I'm a one-man show.

111
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,782
What? Oh, yeah, right.

112
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,834
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.

113
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,239
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

114
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,465
Get outta the shot.

115
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,003
Yo, Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

116
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,149
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

117
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,627
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

118
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,675
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

119
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,765
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

120
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:15,024
How will l ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

121
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,492
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

122
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,378
Oh, whatever.

123
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,433
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

124
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,655
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

125
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,086
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

126
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,648
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

127
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,370
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

128
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,776
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

129
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,014
In your dreams, Thunder.

130
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,026
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin’ about, "Thunder"?

131
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,966
You know, ‘cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

132
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,388
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- l didn't.

133
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,240
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

134
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,809
Right in the lens.

135
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,054
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

136
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,289
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

137
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,918
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

138
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,406
Thank you, King.

139
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,032
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

140
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,639
It's the least I could do.

141
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,714
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

142
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,668
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

143
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,276
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

144
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,422
We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

145
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,078
I love being me.

146
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,207
- OK, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!

147
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,019
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

148
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,802
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

149
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,647
You got more talent in one lug nut

150
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,186
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

151
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,852
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.

152
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,491
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

153
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,597
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

154
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,707
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

155
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,840
and you let them do their job,
like they should.

156
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,896
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- Agood team.

157
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,992
Yeah...

158
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,070
Oh, Lightning!

159
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,247
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

160
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,850
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

161
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,764
Thank you, Mr. The King.

162
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,732
Ladies and gentlemen,

163
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,987
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

164
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,586
A rookie has won the Piston Cup.

165
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,370
Yes!

166
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,155
..we have a three-way tie.

167
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,781
Hey, McQueen,
that must be really embarrassing.

168
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,617
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

169
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,954
Piston Cup officials have determined
that a tiebreaker race

170
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:19,208
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

171
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,836
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

172
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,553
Hey, rook, first one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself.

173
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,683
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

174
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,266
Oh, yeah!

175
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,858
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself."

176
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,665
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

177
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,156
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- [don't want to talk about it.

178
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,150
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

179
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,496
- l parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

180
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,585
Gotta make your personal appearance.

181
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,154
No. No! No, no, no, no!

182
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,716
Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.

183
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,266
And Il use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!

184
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,029
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.

185
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,023
Wow! Look at that shine!

186
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,665
Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!

187
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,300
Ka-chow!

188
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,457
I met this car from Swampscott.

189
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,606
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

190
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,406
You could see his dirty undercarriage.

191
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,703
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

192
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,163
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

193
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,193
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

194
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,093
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

195
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,760
But remember,
all that salt and grime...

196
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,870
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

197
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,918
Hey, look! There he is!

198
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,954
Our almost champ!

199
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,689
Get your rear end in here, kid.

200
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,771
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

201
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,996
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

202
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,141
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

203
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,077
Yes, I know.

204
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,739
"Fred." Fred, thank you.

205
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,291
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

206
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,491
Looking good, Freddie!

207
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,878
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

208
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,465
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

209
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,627
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

210
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,998
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

211
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,982
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

212
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,172
because the track is always lit.

213
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,330
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

214
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,907
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lightning McQueen!

215
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,038
Free Bird!

216
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,270
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

217
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,384
ran a great race today.

218
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,063
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

219
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,289
And an insane amount of luck,

220
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,656
.-you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.

221
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,147
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.

222
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,563
And we're looking forward
to another great year.

223
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,069
Just like this year!

224
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,800
Not on your life.

225
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,464
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

226
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,601
California, here we come!

227
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,444
Dinoco, here we come!

228
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,411
I needed this. Hello?

229
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,754
Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?

230
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,097
Is this Harv,
the world's greatest agent?

231
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,860
It is such an honor
to be your agent

232
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,666
it almost hurts to take ten percent
of your winnings.

233
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:27,819
Merchandising. And ancillary rights in
perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!

234
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,731
! didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.

235
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,100
Thanks, Harv.

236
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,531
Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets
for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.

237
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,418
I'll pass ‘em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.

238
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,568
- You let Harv rock it for you.
- Right. Friends.

239
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,721
Yes, there's...

240
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,278
OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.

241
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,310
So many you can't even narrow it down.
Hey, when you get to town,

242
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,663
you better make time
for your best friend!

243
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,899
Break bread
with your mishpocheh here!

244
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,043
That'd be great!
We should totally...

245
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,030
OK, I gotta jump, kid.
Let me know how it goes. I'm out.

246
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,223
What? A minivan?

247
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:10,145
Come on, you're in the slow lane. This
is Lightning McQueen you're hauling.

248
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,616
Just stopping off
for a quick breather, kid.

249
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,459
- Old Mack needs a rest.
- Absolutely not.

250
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,265
We're driving all night till we
get to California. We agreed to it.

251
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,405
All night? May I remind you
federal DOT regs state...

252
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,686
Come on, I need to get there
before Chick and hang with Dinoco.

253
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,883
All those sleeping trucks.

254
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,601
Hey, kid,
! don't know if can make it

255
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,264
Oh, sure you can, Mack.

256
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,556
Look, it'll be easy.
I'll stay up with you.

257
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,398
- All night?
- All night long.

258
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,653
- Hey, yo, D.J.
- What up?

259
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,619
We got ourselves a nodder.

260
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,044
Pretty music.

261
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,928
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

262
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,625
- Right back at ya!
- Yeah!

263
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,698
- Cops! I missed.
- You going on vacation?

264
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,434
- Oh, no, Snot Rod...
- He's gonna blow!

265
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:48,956
Gesundheit!

266
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,892
One should never drive while drowsy.

267
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,108
Mack!

268
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,342
Mack!

269
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,576
Mack!

270
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,331
Hey, Mack! Mack!

271
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,089
Mack!

272
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,784
Mack, wait for me!

273
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,544
Mack!

274
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,093
Mack! Mack!

275
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,758
Mack! Mack...

276
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,230
..wait up! Mack.

277
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,176
Mack! Mack!

278
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,529
What? You're not Mack.

279
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:27,058
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

280
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,317
Turn on your lights, you moron!

281
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,427
Mack... The Interstate!

282
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,884
Not in my town, you don't.

283
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,120
Oh, no.

284
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,340
Oh, maybe he can help me!

285
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,023
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?

286
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,469
l haven't gone this fast in years.

287
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,305
I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin’.

288
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,768
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

289
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,610
What in the blue blazes?

290
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,228
Crazy hot-rodder.

291
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:23,457
I'm telling you, man,
every third blink is slower.

292
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,867
The sixties weren't good to you,
were they?

293
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,418
What? That's not the Interstate!

294
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,388
No, no, no, no, no, no!

295
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,918
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

296
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,218
- Incoming!
- Whoa, man.

297
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,666
- No!
- Hey!

298
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,005
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

299
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,244
My tires!

300
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:59,528
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

301
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,001
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

302
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,234
We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway

303
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,857
as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,

304
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,760
is arriving at the track.

305
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,971
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?

306
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,270
Lightning, what's your strategy?

307
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,060
What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?

308
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,022
McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.

309
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,968
- McQueen was reported missing.
- .,to race an unprecedented...

310
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,776
Sponsor stated
they have no idea where he is.

311
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,101
l hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

312
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:53,321
1 don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!

313
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,426
Lightning McQueen must be found
at all costs!

314
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,502
They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?

315
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,880
Oh, boy.

316
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,020
Where am I?

317
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,229
Mornin’, sleepin’ beauty!

318
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,846
Boy, was wonderin’
when you was gonna wake up.

319
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,594
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

320
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,564
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

321
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,244
What's going on here? Please!

322
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:23,798
You're funny.

323
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,692
l like you already. My name's Mater.

324
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:29,444
Mater?

325
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,221
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

326
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,544
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

327
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:40,014
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

328
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,419
What?

329
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,810
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

330
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,448
Where are you? Shoot!

331
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,164
You're in Radiator Springs.

332
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,419
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

333
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,418
Oh, great. Just great!

334
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,815
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

335
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,780
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

336
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,934
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

337
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,747
you and me, we go cruisin’,
check out the local scene...

338
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,109
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

339
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,792
- Cool!
- Mater!

340
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,573
What did I tell you
about talkin’ to the accused?

341
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,300
To not to.

342
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:23,458
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

343
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,901
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

344
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,839
"Later, Mater." That's funny!

345
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,685
The Radiator Springs Traffic Court
will come to order!

346
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:37,305
Hey, you scratched my paint!
l oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

347
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,918
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

348
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,209
- Fascist!
- Commie!

349
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,753
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

350
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,698
I gotta get to California, pronto.

351
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,004
Where's your lawyer?

352
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,089
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

353
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:55,065
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

354
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,511
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

355
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,181
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

356
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,842
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

357
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,627
Show-off.

358
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:10,648
- May Doc have mercy on your soul.
- All right,

359
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,112
l wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

360
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,359
l want his hood on a platter!

361
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:19,022
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

362
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:22,727
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

363
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:26,475
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

364
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,331
I'm...

365
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,195
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

366
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,457
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

367
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,401
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

368
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,659
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

369
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,295
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

370
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,017
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

371
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,748
Hey, thanks for comin’,
but we're all set.

372
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,254
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

373
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,316
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

374
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,398
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

375
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,985
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner.

376
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,256
What the...?

377
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,217
- Please!
- know. I get that reaction a lot.

378
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,831
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

379
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,178
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

380
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,318
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

381
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,950
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

382
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,758
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

383
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:25,397
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

384
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,681
Ka-ching!

385
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,921
I'll keep that in mind.

386
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,433
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

387
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,112
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

388
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:37,998
You know her?

389
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,805
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

390
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,102
What?

391
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,899
Nah, I'm just kiddin’.
She just likes me for my body.

392
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,841
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

393
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,835
What do you want, Sally?

394
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,091
Come on, make this guy fix the road.
The town needs this.

395
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:58,323
No. I know his type. Racecar.

396
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,594
That's the last thing this town needs.

397
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,869
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

398
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,950
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

399
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,754
Here she goes again.

400
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,366
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

401
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,955
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

402
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:20,809
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

403
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,969
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

404
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,429
Ignore him.

405
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:28,604
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

406
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,129
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

407
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,943
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

408
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,662
And if no one can get to you?

409
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:39,731
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

410
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,815
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- [have gas.

411
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,218
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

412
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,798
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

413
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,371
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

414
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,622
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

415
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,325
- Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

416
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,201
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

417
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,454
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

418
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,817
Lizzie, the guy left,
like, 15 years ago.

419
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,993
Then why are you
bringing him up, you lemon?

420
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,191
Oh, he can do it.

421
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,849
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

422
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,549
Fix the road!

423
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:18,924
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

424
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,639
Order in the court!

425
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,166
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

426
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,322
- Yeah!
- No!

427
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:30,811
Nice ruling.

428
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,184
lam so not taking you to dinner.

429
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,710
That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

430
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,841
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

431
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,428
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin’ like that.

432
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:46,131
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

433
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,173
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

434
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:55,421
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

435
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,387
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

436
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,733
What? This place is crazy!

437
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,972
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

438
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,938
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

439
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,247
What?

440
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,574
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

441
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:12,482
You gotta be kidding me.

442
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:15,091
You start there where the road begins.

443
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:18,417
You finish down there
where the road ends.

444
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,748
Holy shoot!

445
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,672
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

446
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:29,161
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

447
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,688
Five days?

448
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,482
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

449
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,515
Then if l were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin"!

450
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:39,132
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

451
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,478
Freedom!

452
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,160
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

453
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,704
..and then...
then took the boot off.

454
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,782
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

455
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:14,743
California, here l come! Yeah!

456
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,332
Oh, feel that wind.

457
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,418
Yes!

458
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,567
No. No, no, no.

459
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,143
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

460
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,242
How can I be outta gas?

461
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,531
Boy, we ain't as dumb
as you think we are.

462
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,682
But how did, how did... you...?

463
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,051
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

464
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:39,863
Ka-chow.

465
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,824
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

466
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,143
Hey, Sheriff.

467
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,221
- Why tires here?
- Sono sempre stati qui.

468
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,833
- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.

469
00:35:58,223 --> 00:35:59,893
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

470
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,680
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

471
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,584
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

472
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,397
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

473
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,350
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

474
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,730
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

475
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,166
That's why we made him the judge.

476
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:21,269
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

477
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,046
Now, I'm not one to brag

478
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,181
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

479
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,642
- Man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

480
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,756
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

481
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,928
That ain't nothin’.
I'l clean it for ya.

482
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,712
No, no, no!

483
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,081
That won't be necessary.

484
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:46,335
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

485
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,115
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

486
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,746
Where's he goin'?

487
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,964
He's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin’ his flowers.

488
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,788
I shouldn't put up with this.

489
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,569
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

490
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,645
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

491
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,099
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

492
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,869
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

493
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,771
l have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

494
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,352
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

495
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,541
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

496
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,620
I must scream it to the world!

497
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:24,658
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

498
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,433
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

499
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,422
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

500
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,129
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

501
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,607
Is that what I think it is?

502
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:44,605
Customers.

503
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,869
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

504
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,566
- OK!
- Customers?

505
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,141
It's been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

506
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,937
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

507
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,440
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

508
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,283
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

509
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,549
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

510
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,491
- Honey, please.
- Hello.

511
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,497
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

512
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,912
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

513
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:15,159
How can we help you?

514
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,930
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

515
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,337
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

516
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,941
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

517
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,792
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

518
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:30,896
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

519
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,912
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

520
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,970
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

521
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,058
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

522
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,448
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

523
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,972
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

524
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,374
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

525
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,506
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

526
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:55,243
- Honey, she's got a map.
- [don't need a map! I have the GPS.

527
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,807
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How ‘bout somethin’ to drink?

528
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:02,764
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

529
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,328
No we just topped off.

530
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,942
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

531
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,649
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

532
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,944
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

533
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,199
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

534
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,675
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

535
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,194
Maybe ghost flames!

536
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,736
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

537
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,556
Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

538
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,692
OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

539
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,514
A little somethin’
to remember us by, OK?

540
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,980
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

541
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,379
Il mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

542
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,040
OK! Yes. You bet.

543
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,540
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

544
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,606
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

545
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,955
- [know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

546
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,631
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,317
No, not really. But listen.

548
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,752
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

549
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,486
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

550
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:07,238
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

551
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,770
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

552
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:14,409
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

553
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,726
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

554
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,022
I'm becoming one of them!

555
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,270
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

556
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,356
They'll tell friends.
You'll see.

557
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,768
We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...

558
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,527
- That's good.
- ., after a Piston Cup update.

559
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,359
Still no sign of Lightning McQueen.
Chick Hicks arrived in California

560
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,940
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.

561
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,156
It's just nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

562
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,977
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.

563
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,462
Yeah!

564
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,255
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

565
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,109
Let me get this straight.

566
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,924
l can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

567
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,628
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

568
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,140
I got a road to finish.

569
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,528
- He's done!
- Done?

570
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,684
It's only been an hour.

571
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,909
I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

572
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,913
Say thank you,
and I'll be on my way.

573
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:56,780
- That's all you gotta say.
- I'm the first one on the new road!

574
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,288
It rides purty smooth.

575
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,895
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

576
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,045
Red.

577
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,070
Who do you think you are?

578
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,201
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

579
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,691
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

580
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,345
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

581
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,930
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

582
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:35,703
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

583
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,627
- What?
- Me and you. Is that a joke?

584
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,238
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

585
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,962
If l win, you do the road my way.

586
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:46,703
Doc, what're you doin'?

587
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,875
I don't mean to be rude here,

588
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:52,447
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

589
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,189
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin’ to worry about.

590
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,673
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

591
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,198
Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race.

592
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,531
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

593
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,732
There will be no bumpin’,
no cheatin’, no spittin’,

594
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,375
no bitin’, no road rage, no maimin’,

595
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,219
no oil slickin’, no pushin’, no shovin’,

596
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,618
no backstabbin’, no road-hoggin'’...

597
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,514
..and no lollygaggin’.

598
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,169
Speed. I'm speed.

599
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,624
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

600
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:31,448
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

601
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,370
Peet stop!

602
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,232
The race is only one lap, guys.

603
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,838
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

604
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:43,587
- Lwork solo mio,
- Fine. Race your way.

605
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,756
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

606
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,077
Gentlemen...

607
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,453
..Start your engines!

608
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,652
- jHijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.

609
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:06,727
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

610
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,618
Luigi?

611
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,754
On your mark, get set...

612
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,076
Uno for the money,
due for the show,

613
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:19,428
tre to get ready, and quattro
to... l can't believe it. Go!

614
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:32,788
Doc... the flag means go.

615
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,100
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

616
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:38,974
Doc, what are you doing, man?

617
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:42,507
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

618
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,764
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

619
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:48,647
- Might need a little help.
- OK.

620
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,948
You got your tow cable?

621
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,120
Well, yeah,
l always got my tow cable. Why?

622
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,478
Just in case.

623
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:09,092
No, no, no, no, no!

624
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,550
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

625
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,597
Bad trip, man.

626
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:23,319
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

627
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,871
I'm confused.

628
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,397
You drive like you fix roads.

629
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,536
Lousy! Have fun fishin’, Mater.

630
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,912
I'm startin’ to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

631
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:44,089
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

632
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,278
Il can make a little turn on dirt.

633
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,840
You think?

634
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:55,002
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

635
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,790
Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!

636
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,705
- No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

637
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,265
- That freak juice?
- Pass.

638
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:07,628
Watchin’ him is makin’ me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin’ to drink?

639
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,565
Nah, not me, Flo.

640
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,004
I'm on one of them there special diets.

641
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:16,410
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

642
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,531
"You race like you fix roads."

643
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:24,205
I'll show him. I will show him!

644
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,999
Great! I hate it!

645
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:40,585
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- Music. Sweet music.

646
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,483
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

647
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:11,024
Wow.

648
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,984
Mornin’, Sally!

649
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:17,834
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin’ McQueen done just made!

650
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,316
Yes! Amazing!

651
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,162
Yeah!

652
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:28,432
Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

653
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,263
l haven't seen a road like this
.
In years.

654
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:35,279
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

655
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,783
x
E bellissima! It's beautiful!

656
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:41,402
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

657
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:43,933
Boy, I tell you what.

658
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,651
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

659
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,524
Doc, look at this!

660
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,386
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

661
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,872
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

662
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,983
Guido, look at Luigi!

663
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,463
This is fantastico!

664
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:03,785
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

665
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:08,061
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

666
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,243
That crazy old devil woman.

667
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,503
She's right!

668
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,195
Guido!

669
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,918
That punk actually did a good job.

670
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:27,808
Well, now... where the heck is he?

671
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:37,012
Sheriff!
Is he makin’ another run for it?

672
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,375
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

673
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,931
and asked me if he could
come down here.

674
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,397
All he's tryin’ to do
is make that there turn.

675
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,245
No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

676
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,279
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

677
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:57,278
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

678
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:59,065
I'll keep an eye on him.

679
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,732
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin’ a quart low.

680
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:19,728
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

681
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,524
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

682
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:25,857
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

683
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,400
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

684
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,590
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

685
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:35,756
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

686
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,667
I'll put it simple.

687
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:41,572
If you're goin’ hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin’ right.

688
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,930
Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

689
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,232
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

690
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:53,681
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

691
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,917
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

692
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,672
Turn right to go left.

693
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,287
Oh, that...

694
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:31,796
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

695
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:34,982
You know what? This
crazy thing happened... I went right!

696
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,421
You keep talkin’ to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

697
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:42,363
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin’ to you!

698
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,843
- Oh, Guido, é belfissimo!
- Che cosa?

699
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,390
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

700
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,074
Oh, Lord.

701
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,880
Mater!

702
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,994
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

703
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,230
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

704
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,189
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

705
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,773
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

706
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,248
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin’ road,

707
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,894
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

708
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,150
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

709
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,637
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

710
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:30,766
You make-a such a nice new road.

711
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,428
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

712
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,224
Even though you not a Ferrari.

713
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:39,092
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

714
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,063
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

715
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,848
l like your style, eh?

716
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,334
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

717
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:54,000
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

718
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,851
Would you look at that?

719
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,192
Ramone, Ramone!

720
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,189
Then Luigi make you a new new deal.

721
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,114
No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

722
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:06,744
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

723
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:11,387
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

724
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:14,519
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

725
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,404
Stop! Let me...

726
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,560
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

727
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,754
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

728
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,006
Stop, stop! That's cold!

729
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,670
Help! Please! Stop!

730
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,167
Thanks, Red.

731
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:37,764
What was that for?

732
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,857
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

733
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,500
If you do, you gotta be clean.

734
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,979
‘Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

735
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:45,881
What, I...? I don't get it.

736
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,443
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

737
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,672
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

738
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:56,206
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

739
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,240
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

740
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,888
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

741
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:06,116
- lunderstand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

742
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,393
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- It's newly refurbished.

743
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:13,065
Yeah, it's like a clever little twist.

744
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,020
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

745
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,554
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

746
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:24,426
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

747
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,839
Cone number one, if you want.

748
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:36,023
Hey, do I spy
a little pinstriping tattoo back there?

749
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,435
That's just a...

750
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,149
You saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

751
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,932
Gonna... Yeah.

752
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,276
You know, I once knew this girl Doreen.

753
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:56,976
Good-lookin' girl.

754
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,134
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

755
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,674
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

756
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:07,379
- What are you talking about?
- [don't know.

757
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:11,375
Hey, I know somethin’ we can do tonight,
‘cause I'm in charge of watchin’ you!

758
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:15,609
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

759
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,316
Well, that's all right,
Mr. l Can't Turn On Dirt.

760
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,843
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

761
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,742
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

762
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,657
You know who you're talkin’ to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

763
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,147
I can handle anything.

764
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,810
- Mater, I'm not doin' this.
- Oh, come on. You'll love it!

765
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:38,491
- Tractor-tippin's fun.
- This is ridiculous.

766
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,510
All right, listen.

767
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:44,221
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

768
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,392
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

769
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,348
Mater!

770
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:50,913
Wait, Mater!

771
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,056
OK, here's what you do.

772
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,281
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

773
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,951
And they do the rest. Watch this.

774
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,068
l swear, tractors is so dumb!

775
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,861
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

776
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:30,672
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

777
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,930
I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

778
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,894
Oh, your turn, bud.

779
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,289
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

780
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,608
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

781
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,008
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

782
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,636
That's Frank.

783
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,730
Run!

784
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,860
Here he comes, look out!

785
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,519
Run! He's gonna get ya!

786
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:44,053
Customers!

787
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,099
No, no, no.

788
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,067
Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

789
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,663
- l can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin’ ya!

790
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:03,977
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

791
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:06,247
Oh, yeah... yeah.

792
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,270
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

793
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,529
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

794
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:18,683
- Gettin’ cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

795
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:23,146
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

796
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:27,163
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

797
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,284
Where, where?

798
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,377
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

799
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:34,864
- Yes, you do.
- No way.

800
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,418
- Way.
- Come on, look...

801
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,819
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

802
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,611
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

803
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:42,524
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

804
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,599
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

805
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,261
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

806
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,273
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

807
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:51,492
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

808
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:56,272
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

809
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,833
You just watch
this right here, lover boy.

810
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,869
What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

811
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,103
Mater? Mater!

812
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,765
Mater!

813
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:20,349
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

814
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:32,948
He's nuts.

815
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,428
No need to watch where I'm goin’.

816
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:40,963
Just need to know where I've been.

817
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,994
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

818
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:47,958
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

819
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:51,482
Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race.

820
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:54,922
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

821
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:00,140
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

822
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:02,714
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

823
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,725
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

824
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,299
And when I do,
we're talkin’ big new sponsor,

825
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,266
with private helicopters.

826
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,411
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

827
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:16,748
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

828
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,005
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
l mean other old cars. You know?

829
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:25,299
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

830
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:30,152
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

831
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:34,834
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

832
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,925
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

833
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:39,885
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:43,677
I knew it. l knowed
l made a good choice!

835
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,817
In what?

836
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,643
My best friend.

837
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,838
See you tomorrow, buddy!

838
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,160
McQueen and Sally
parked beneath a tree,

839
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,877
K-i-s-somethin'-somethin-somethin’-t!

840
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,633
Number one. Number one...
Number one!

841
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:20,861
- This is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

842
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:24,422
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

843
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,683
I scared myself
. .
scaring you scaring me.

844
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,736
- [ mean, I wasn't like "scared" scared.
- No, of course not. No.

845
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,587
- l was more...
- loverheard you talkin’ to Mater.

846
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,389
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

847
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,542
Something about a helicopter ride.

848
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,691
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

849
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,767
- Did you mean it?
- What?

850
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:44,846
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

851
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,828
First things first. l gotta
get outta here and make the race.

852
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,150
You know... Mater trusts you.

853
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,991
Yeah, OK.

854
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:59,717
- Did you mean that?
- What?

855
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:05,066
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

856
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,162
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

857
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,716
Yeah, OK. G'night.

858
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,662
Hey, thank you.

859
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,697
What did you just say?

860
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:24,536
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

861
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:28,274
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

862
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:31,942
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

863
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:35,593
- G'night.
- Good night.

864
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:00,000
Will you turn
that disrespectful junk off?

865
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,813
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

866
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:24,189
No!

867
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,437
I gotta get outta here!

868
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,659
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

869
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:41,952
- Hey, what are you doin’?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

870
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,586
I just need my daily gas ration
from the Sheriff.

871
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,859
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.

872
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,531
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

873
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,117
Hope you enjoyed the show!

874
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,590
Whoa, Doc.

875
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:12,658
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

876
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:29,741
What?

877
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:33,527
He has a Piston Cup?

878
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,494
Oh, my gosh.

879
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,860
Three Piston Cups?

880
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,261
Sign says stay out.

881
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,544
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

882
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,653
Il knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

883
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,763
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

884
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,426
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

885
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:14,419
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

886
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:17,841
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

887
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:20,748
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- [ tried that.

888
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,551
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

889
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,973
You look.
All l see is a bunch of empty cups.

890
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:37,288
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

891
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:39,581
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

892
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,709
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
That's your color!

893
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:46,453
- Yellow, baby.
- You smokin’ hot!

894
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:47,906
There he is.

895
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,741
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

896
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,779
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

897
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:59,467
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

898
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,846
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

899
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:05,092
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

900
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:07,372
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

901
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,857
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

902
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,767
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

903
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,355
I think the heat's
startin’ to get to the boy!

904
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,926
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

905
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,299
Yeah, I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

906
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,785
- Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin’ peaked.

907
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,758
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

908
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:30,245
Hey, hey! What are you doin'?

909
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,390
It's OK, Sheriff.
You can trust me, right?

910
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,242
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

911
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,667
I trust him.

912
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,849
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- Adrive?

913
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:43,337
Yeah, a drive.

914
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:46,316
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

915
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:50,198
No. No, we don't.

916
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:15,330
Hey, Stickers! You comin’ or what?

917
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,912
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

918
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,549
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

919
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,881
That's so too much!

920
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,053
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

921
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,169
I don't know.

922
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:45,043
Whoa! Yes.

923
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:37,015
Wow. What is this place?

924
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,374
Wheel Well.

925
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:42,479
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

926
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,037
This place?

927
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:54,665
Yeah, imagine.

928
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,991
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

929
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,034
You know, I don't get you.

930
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:06,139
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

931
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,532
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

932
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:12,531
.an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

933
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:16,239
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

934
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:19,736
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

935
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:23,227
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

936
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,169
And you know what?

937
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:28,644
It never felt... happy.

938
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,447
Yeah. I mean... really?

939
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,416
Yeah. So I left California.

940
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,598
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

941
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,196
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

942
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,235
Well, they all did. And I never left.

943
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:48,366
Yeah. You know, I understand.

944
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:51,134
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

945
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,826
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

946
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,457
I fell in love.

947
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,231
Yep.

948
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,753
- Corvette?
- No.

949
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:15,065
fell in love with this.

950
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:30,696
Whoa. Look at that.

951
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:34,105
Look, they're drivin’ right by.

952
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,353
They don't even know
what they're missing!

953
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,677
Well, it didn't used to be that way.

954
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,600
Oh, yeah?

955
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:46,262
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

956
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:48,740
Really?

957
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:51,308
Yeah. Back then,

958
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:54,227
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

959
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:57,015
How do you mean?

960
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:00,236
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

961
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:04,406
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

962
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,172
- Mornin’!
- Nice day, huh?

963
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,786
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

964
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:15,446
They drove on it to have a great time.

965
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,875
Well, what happened?

966
01:12:52,235 --> 01:12:55,275
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

967
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:25,078
How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

968
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:27,988
I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

969
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:31,617
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

970
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,354
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

971
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,481
l had a great time.

972
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:40,173
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

973
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,043
You're welcome.

974
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:51,795
Hey, listen, listen!

975
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:54,741
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

976
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:57,031
Wha... what?

977
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,418
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

978
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:26,927
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!

979
01:15:27,223 --> 01:15:30,383
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.

980
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,913
- Mater!
- wasn't tractor-tippin'!

981
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,922
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?

982
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,582
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

983
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,664
There's one goin’ this way.

984
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,801
I got it.

985
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,596
Come here, little tractor,
come here.

986
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,934
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

987
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,481
No, no, no, no, come here.

988
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:54,916
What are you doing?

989
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:57,521
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...

990
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,297
.-alone.

991
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,620
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tires?

992
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,831
Come on, Doc, drive.

993
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:43,571
Yeah.

994
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,319
Wow.

995
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:46,994
You're amazing!

996
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:51,264
What are you doin'?

997
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,990
Doc, wait!

998
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:59,212
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.

999
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:05,221
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1000
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,580
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, mean it. You've still got it!

1001
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,661
- I'm askin’ you to leave.
- Come on.

1002
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:13,583
I'm a racecar,
you're a much older racecar,

1003
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,773
but under the hood
you and I are the same.

1004
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,491
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

1005
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:21,808
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

1006
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,203
You think I quit?

1007
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,481
Right.

1008
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:43,727
Your big wreck in '54.

1009
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:46,807
They quit on me.

1010
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:50,286
When I finally got put together,
l went back expecting a big welcome.

1011
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:53,343
You know what they said?
"You're history."

1012
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:56,451
Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

1013
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,628
There was a lot left in me.

1014
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:05,268
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1015
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:10,541
l keep that to remind me
never to go back.

1016
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:15,128
I just never expected
that that world would...

1017
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,514
.. would find me here.

1018
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,166
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Oh, yeah?

1019
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:22,427
No, I'm not.

1020
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:25,995
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?

1021
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:30,568
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

1022
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,760
I didn't think so.

1023
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:39,682
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

1024
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,526
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.

1025
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,259
Oh, like you?
You've been here how long

1026
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:48,542
and your friends
don't even know who you are?

1027
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:51,295
Who's caring about only himself?

1028
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,080
Just finish that road
and get outta here!

1029
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,940
Will you turn that
disrespectful junk off?

1030
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,510
Respect the classics, man.

1031
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:41,434
He's done.

1032
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,510
He must've finished it
while we was all sleepin’.

1033
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,933
Good riddance.

1034
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:56,344
He's gone?

1035
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,245
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.

1036
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,870
- Oh, dude, are you crying?
- No! I'm happy!

1037
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:12,075
I don't have to watch him
every second of the day anymore!

1038
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:14,251
I'm glad he's gone!

1039
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:21,889
What's wrong with Red?

1040
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:25,166
Oh, he's just sad
‘cause you left town

1041
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,427
and went to your big race to win

1042
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:31,060
the Piston Cup that you've
always dreamed about your whole life

1043
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:36,447
and get that big ol’ sponsor and that
fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1044
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,884
Wait a minute!

1045
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,956
I knowed you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1046
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:50,769
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.

1047
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:54,393
Don't worry. I'll give you a
police escort, and we'll make up time.

1048
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:55,930
Thank you, Sheriff.

1049
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:58,015
But you know I can't go just yet.

1050
01:21:58,347 --> 01:21:59,657
Well, why not?

1051
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:04,075
I'm not sure these tires
can get me all the way to California.

1052
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,590
Peet stop?

1053
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:08,657
Yeah, does anybody know
what time Luigi's opens?

1054
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,458
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1055
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:12,068
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1056
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:14,773
Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!

1057
01:22:15,164 --> 01:22:18,764
- Would you look at that!
- Our first real customer in years!

1058
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:22,494
lam filled with tears of ecstasy,

1059
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:26,405
for this is the most
glorious day of my life!

1060
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,452
All right, Luigi, give me
the best set of blackwalls you've got.

1061
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:32,226
No! No, no, no.

1062
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:35,408
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.

1063
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:40,792
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.

1064
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:42,680
But-a this...

1065
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:44,768
Whitewall tires!

1066
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:49,600
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me."

1067
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,879
All right, you're the expert.

1068
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:54,882
Oh, and don't forget the spare.

1069
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,660
- Perfetto. Guido!
- Peet stop!

1070
01:23:10,586 --> 01:23:12,106
What did Luigi tell you?

1071
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:15,427
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1072
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:17,645
No.

1073
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:24,749
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't l heard about it before?

1074
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,084
It's a conspiracy, man!

1075
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,572
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!

1076
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:32,778
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1077
01:23:33,242 --> 01:23:35,112
OK, I'll take a case.

1078
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:02,166
Yeah.

1079
01:24:02,905 --> 01:24:04,245
Ka-chow.

1080
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:07,357
- Here she comes!
- Places, everybody. Hurry!

1081
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,229
Act natural.

1082
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:11,315
- Hi, Sally.
- Buon giorno!

1083
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,156
All right, what's goin' on?

1084
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:15,348
Ladies and gentlecars,

1085
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:19,144
please welcome
the new Lightning McQueen!

1086
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,106
What do you think?

1087
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:24,254
Radiator Springs
looks pretty good on me.

1088
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:26,173
I'll say.

1089
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:29,392
Ka-chow.

1090
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:31,951
You're gonna fit right in
in California.

1091
01:24:33,135 --> 01:24:35,885
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.

1092
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:37,947
Yeah, everybody except one.

1093
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:43,798
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

1094
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,139
Let me say that again.
ls it getting dark out?

1095
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,663
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

1096
01:25:14,743 --> 01:25:16,353
They fixed their neon!

1097
01:25:23,986 --> 01:25:27,206
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby!

1098
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:36,225
Just like in its heyday, right?

1099
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:39,658
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1100
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:08,756
Shall we cruise?

1101
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,047
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1102
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,690
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1103
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:16,744
l remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1104
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,859
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1105
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:22,115
Of course, Mater.

1106
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:33,958
..and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1107
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:38,366
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1108
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,950
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

1109
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,742
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1110
01:26:54,076 --> 01:26:56,096
Good evenin', you two.

1111
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,480
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1112
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:11,563
- ls that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1113
01:27:12,094 --> 01:27:17,074
l haven't had a chance to find out.
But l am going to find out. Hello.

1114
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,143
Not that. That.

1115
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,713
Customers?

1116
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:25,370
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1117
01:27:25,774 --> 01:27:27,824
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1118
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,287
It's the ghostlight!

1119
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,960
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1120
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,440
McQueen, over here!

1121
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:39,115
- Wait, excuse me.
- ls it true you've been in rehab?

1122
01:27:39,521 --> 01:27:41,391
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1123
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:44,123
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1124
01:27:44,526 --> 01:27:45,396
Stickers!

1125
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,494
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1126
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:49,999
We're best buds!
l ain't braggin' or nothin’,

1127
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:53,175
but I was in charge of
huntin' him down if he tried to escape.

1128
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,035
Sally! Sally!

1129
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:57,113
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1130
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:58,959
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1131
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:00,551
Come on, give us some bolt!

1132
01:28:01,543 --> 01:28:05,643
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1133
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,241
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1134
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,306
You are a sight for sore headlights!

1135
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:16,054
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1136
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,327
Mack, I, l can't believe you're here.

1137
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,710
Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?

1138
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:23,282
- ls that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1139
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,780
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1140
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:31,073
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1141
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,553
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1142
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:35,613
- Harv?
- Come on!

1143
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:38,181
- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin’, buddy?

1144
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,920
My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!

1145
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,246
- How do you think I'm doing?
- Lcan explain.

1146
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:47,455
I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!

1147
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:50,745
You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?

1148
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:53,363
That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.

1149
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:55,748
Where are you?
I! can't even find you on my GPS.

1150
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,317
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1151
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:01,513
- You know Route 667 It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.

1152
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,020
Playtime is over, pal.

1153
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:06,608
While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

1154
01:29:07,142 --> 01:29:08,632
- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!

1155
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:12,099
Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.

1156
01:29:12,614 --> 01:29:14,513
- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?

1157
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:18,040
You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

1158
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:21,423
- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!

1159
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:25,400
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1160
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:27,481
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1161
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:29,353
No, wait, Where are you goin’?

1162
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:32,501
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?

1163
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,498
Sally, I... l want you to...

1164
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:42,345
Look, I wish...

1165
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,566
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1166
01:29:50,085 --> 01:29:54,655
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1167
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:01,236
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1168
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:04,536
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1169
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,400
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1170
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:09,762
- 1 know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1171
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:15,067
l hope you find what you're looking for.

1172
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,350
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1173
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:20,519
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1174
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:22,822
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1175
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:31,354
- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?

1176
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,840
- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!

1177
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:36,565
You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.

1178
01:30:36,965 --> 01:30:38,985
You don't belong there, anyway.

1179
01:30:39,334 --> 01:30:41,964
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1180
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:47,100
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin’ in the truck!

1181
01:30:54,516 --> 01:30:56,596
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1182
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:59,062
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1183
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:11,108
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1184
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,950
Best for everyone or best for you?

1185
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:34,280
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1186
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:37,119
Hello, race fans, and welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1187
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:39,605
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1188
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:42,094
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1189
01:32:42,457 --> 01:32:44,297
There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1190
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:47,026
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1191
01:32:47,429 --> 01:32:51,239
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1192
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:54,083
The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1193
01:32:54,469 --> 01:32:57,399
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1194
01:32:57,872 --> 01:33:00,682
You know I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin’.

1195
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:04,392
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1196
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,176
In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1197
01:33:07,482 --> 01:33:09,262
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1198
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:14,126
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1199
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:18,122
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1200
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:21,413
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1201
01:33:21,863 --> 01:33:22,733
He's hot!

1202
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:25,271
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1203
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:28,387
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1204
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:30,767
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1205
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,019
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1206
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,872
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1207
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:40,028
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1208
01:33:40,482 --> 01:33:44,842
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1209
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,950
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1210
01:33:49,491 --> 01:33:50,601
Sorry, pal.

1211
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:54,545
OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1212
01:33:55,864 --> 01:33:58,353
lam speed.

1213
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:01,451
Victory.

1214
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:03,568
One winner, two losers.

1215
01:34:05,907 --> 01:34:10,767
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1216
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:17,967
Hey, Lightnin"! You ready?

1217
01:34:18,286 --> 01:34:20,656
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1218
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,825
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1219
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:39,518
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1220
01:34:39,908 --> 01:34:42,018
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1221
01:34:42,377 --> 01:34:44,457
- itis?
- Not really.

1222
01:35:14,309 --> 01:35:16,919
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1223
01:35:17,445 --> 01:35:19,405
And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1224
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:22,497
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1225
01:35:22,951 --> 01:35:25,061
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1226
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:28,110
Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1227
01:35:29,624 --> 01:35:32,374
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1228
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:36,112
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1229
01:35:36,464 --> 01:35:39,014
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1230
01:35:39,434 --> 01:35:42,064
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1231
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:45,282
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1232
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:54,418
Shoot!

1233
01:35:54,649 --> 01:35:56,989
Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys!
Let's go racin'!

1234
01:36:04,058 --> 01:36:05,428
Come on, you can do it!

1235
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:07,473
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1236
01:36:08,997 --> 01:36:12,157
Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1237
01:36:12,667 --> 01:36:15,097
McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin’ to the inside!

1238
01:36:18,206 --> 01:36:19,576
Chick slammed the door on him!

1239
01:36:19,841 --> 01:36:21,951
Chick's not making it easy on him today.

1240
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:23,770
Man, he lost so much momentum,

1241
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:26,095
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1242
01:36:35,823 --> 01:36:37,633
McQueen spins out in the infield!

1243
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:44,213
Just me and the old man, fellas.

1244
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:46,282
McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1245
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:52,790
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- 1 don't know, Mack.

1246
01:36:53,374 --> 01:36:54,634
I don't think I...

1247
01:36:54,876 --> 01:36:57,276
I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1248
01:36:57,845 --> 01:36:59,185
Doc?

1249
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:04,360
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1250
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:08,062
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1251
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:10,259
You said you'd never come back.

1252
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:13,718
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1253
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:16,778
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1254
01:37:21,102 --> 01:37:24,172
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1255
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:27,541
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1256
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:29,759
Now, get back out there!

1257
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:34,856
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1258
01:37:35,283 --> 01:37:37,303
You're goin’ up
against professional pit crews.

1259
01:37:37,652 --> 01:37:40,432
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1260
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:42,378
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1261
01:37:42,657 --> 01:37:45,647
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1262
01:37:57,772 --> 01:37:59,442
- ls that?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1263
01:37:59,741 --> 01:38:03,051
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1264
01:38:03,578 --> 01:38:05,688
It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1265
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:08,357
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1266
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:11,120
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1267
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:14,449
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1268
01:38:19,494 --> 01:38:21,244
Wow, this is history in the making.

1269
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:24,142
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!

1270
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:25,794
Hey, Doc!

1271
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:29,693
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1272
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:38,601
- McQueen passes them on the inside!
- But he's still nearly a lap down.

1273
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:41,230
Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1274
01:38:41,949 --> 01:38:44,499
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1275
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:46,318
Vai! Vai, vai!

1276
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:49,137
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1277
01:38:49,557 --> 01:38:52,577
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1278
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:56,438
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?

1279
01:38:56,831 --> 01:38:59,611
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1280
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,909
Oh, kid's just tryin’
to be a hero, huh?

1281
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,429
Well, what do you think of this?

1282
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:22,158
Yeah, that's it, kid.

1283
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:26,766
What?

1284
01:39:26,994 --> 01:39:28,574
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1285
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:34,489
I taught him that. Ka-chow!

1286
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:37,302
What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1287
01:39:37,705 --> 01:39:39,225
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1288
01:39:39,507 --> 01:39:42,576
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1289
01:39:48,049 --> 01:39:49,629
Look at that boy go out there!

1290
01:39:58,793 --> 01:40:00,163
No, you don't.

1291
01:40:03,431 --> 01:40:05,181
Doe, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1292
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,520
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1293
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:11,902
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1294
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:16,155
We gotta get him back out there fast

1295
01:40:16,444 --> 01:40:19,024
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1296
01:40:19,447 --> 01:40:21,347
Guido! It's time.

1297
01:40:25,887 --> 01:40:27,937
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1298
01:40:38,099 --> 01:40:38,969
I don't believe it!

1299
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:41,036
That was the fastest pit stop
I've ever seen!

1300
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:43,619
It was a great stop, but he's
still gotta beat that pace car out!

1301
01:40:44,005 --> 01:40:45,495
It's gonna be close.

1302
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:48,245
Yeah, baby!

1303
01:40:49,911 --> 01:40:51,111
He's back in the race!

1304
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:53,483
Peet stop.

1305
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,749
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1306
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:14,786
This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1307
01:41:15,202 --> 01:41:17,222
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1308
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:20,912
A hundred and ninety-nine laps,
and, baby, it all comes down to this!

1309
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:22,552
This is it, kiddo.

1310
01:41:22,777 --> 01:41:24,967
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1311
01:41:25,346 --> 01:41:27,486
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1312
01:41:27,848 --> 01:41:29,077
Go!

1313
01:41:31,953 --> 01:41:32,943
We'll see about that!

1314
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:35,959
McQueen's going inside!

1315
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:41,706
- Chick and The King are loose!
- [think McQueen's out!

1316
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,030
- McQueen saved it!
- He's back on the track!

1317
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:58,050
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1318
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:07,342
Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1319
01:42:07,722 --> 01:42:09,562
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1320
01:42:12,693 --> 01:42:14,833
lam not comin’ in
behind you again, old man.

1321
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:26,403
Oh, no!

1322
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:47,203
Yeah!

1323
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:51,442
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1324
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,070
What's he up to, Doc?

1325
01:43:05,713 --> 01:43:06,913
What are you doin’, kid?

1326
01:43:07,148 --> 01:43:09,988
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1327
01:43:13,554 --> 01:43:16,184
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1328
01:43:16,624 --> 01:43:19,784
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin’.

1329
01:43:20,294 --> 01:43:22,104
It's just an empty cup.

1330
01:43:24,465 --> 01:43:26,715
Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1331
01:43:27,101 --> 01:43:28,471
He's not really pushin’ him.

1332
01:43:28,736 --> 01:43:30,516
He's just givin’ him
a little bump draft.

1333
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:35,577
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1334
01:43:35,976 --> 01:43:37,726
That's what I call racin' right there.

1335
01:43:54,195 --> 01:43:56,884
- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!

1336
01:43:57,331 --> 01:43:59,611
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1337
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,980
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1338
01:44:06,574 --> 01:44:09,594
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1339
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:11,307
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1340
01:44:11,545 --> 01:44:14,155
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin’ about!

1341
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:17,332
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1342
01:44:17,785 --> 01:44:19,745
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1343
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:23,351
Easy with the confetti.
What's goin’ on?

1344
01:44:23,758 --> 01:44:26,657
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1345
01:44:27,128 --> 01:44:28,418
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1346
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:30,103
- Boo!
- Boo!

1347
01:44:30,364 --> 01:44:33,084
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1348
01:44:33,534 --> 01:44:35,374
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1349
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:43,732
- Thanks, Lightnin’.
- You're welcome.

1350
01:44:46,447 --> 01:44:48,587
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1351
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:50,699
You're The King! Yeah!

1352
01:45:01,362 --> 01:45:04,402
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1353
01:45:08,035 --> 01:45:10,345
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1354
01:45:10,871 --> 01:45:12,331
Thanks, Doc.

1355
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:14,844
Hey, Lightnin’.

1356
01:45:15,075 --> 01:45:17,415
How ‘bout comin’ over here
and talk to me a minute?

1357
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:21,306
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1358
01:45:21,749 --> 01:45:24,179
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1359
01:45:29,223 --> 01:45:30,513
But I didn't win.

1360
01:45:30,758 --> 01:45:34,098
Lightnin’, there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin’.

1361
01:45:34,628 --> 01:45:36,878
He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1362
01:45:37,264 --> 01:45:39,844
buzzards used to circle the car!

1363
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:43,022
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1364
01:45:43,304 --> 01:45:46,584
..but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1365
01:45:48,576 --> 01:45:50,096
I'm gonna stick with them.

1366
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:53,067
Well, l sure can respect that.

1367
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:54,534
Still, you know,

1368
01:45:54,748 --> 01:45:58,147
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1369
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:00,906
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1370
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:05,320
Actually, there is one thing.

1371
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:12,096
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin’, by golly!

1372
01:46:17,071 --> 01:46:19,701
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1373
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:25,731
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1374
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:32,169
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1375
01:46:32,653 --> 01:46:33,523
to get tires.

1376
01:46:33,721 --> 01:46:37,410
How ‘bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1377
01:46:37,992 --> 01:46:42,562
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1378
01:46:43,264 --> 01:46:45,284
A real Ferrari!

1379
01:46:45,633 --> 01:46:47,503
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1380
01:46:47,835 --> 01:46:50,875
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1381
01:46:52,606 --> 01:46:57,846
Wow. Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.
Mi dicono che siete fantastici.

1382
01:47:14,862 --> 01:47:16,202
Just passin’ through?

1383
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:18,483
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1384
01:47:18,832 --> 01:47:21,702
- [hear this place is back on the map.
- itis?

1385
01:47:22,169 --> 01:47:25,479
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1386
01:47:26,006 --> 01:47:28,176
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1387
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:31,032
Really? Well, there goes the town.

1388
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:33,634
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1389
01:47:34,014 --> 01:47:37,644
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1390
01:47:38,218 --> 01:47:40,117
blah, blah, blah.

1391
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:43,418
McQueen and Sally
parked beneath the tree,

1392
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:47,927
K-i-s-s-.., i-n-t!

1393
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:50,592
Great timing, Mater!

1394
01:47:50,898 --> 01:47:53,528
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly!

1395
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:57,125
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

1396
01:47:57,471 --> 01:48:00,050
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1397
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,964
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1398
01:48:04,178 --> 01:48:05,638
Nah.

1399
01:48:07,581 --> 01:48:09,481
Yeah! Ka-chow!

1400
01:49:22,022 --> 01:49:24,652
All right, everybody
please keep together now.

1401
01:49:25,092 --> 01:49:29,281
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

1402
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:32,540
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

1403
01:49:32,966 --> 01:49:36,536
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1404
01:49:37,104 --> 01:49:40,144
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1405
01:49:40,641 --> 01:49:43,981
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin’.

1406
01:49:51,018 --> 01:49:53,238
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1407
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:56,309
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.

1408
01:50:00,961 --> 01:50:02,661
Doc! Doc!

1409
01:50:05,132 --> 01:50:07,062
Not all my tricks, rookie!

1410
01:50:23,717 --> 01:50:26,996
Attention!
Kiss the pavement goodbye.

1411
01:50:27,521 --> 01:50:30,541
When I'm finished, you'll have mud
in places you didn't know you had!

1412
01:50:31,024 --> 01:50:34,564
- Yo, I've never been off-road!
- Well, that's gonna change right now!

1413
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:37,679
About face!
Drop and give me 20 miles!

1414
01:50:38,098 --> 01:50:39,848
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1415
01:50:40,167 --> 01:50:42,977
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

1416
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:47,500
Look at this!

1417
01:50:47,708 --> 01:50:49,607
It's my hood! It's my hood!

1418
01:50:49,943 --> 01:50:52,663
l ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

1419
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:56,667
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look?

1420
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:04,400
Oh, dang.

1421
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:12,830
You are a toy car!

1422
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:17,812
You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.

1423
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:20,465
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!

1424
01:51:20,807 --> 01:51:24,496
Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!

1425
01:51:25,078 --> 01:51:27,158
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

1426
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:30,444
Oh, man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,

1427
01:51:30,918 --> 01:51:33,168
I'm tellin’ ya, he's one great actor!

1428
01:51:33,554 --> 01:51:37,654
We're banished, genius! Stuck here
in this wasteland without chains!

1429
01:51:38,292 --> 01:51:41,602
But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!

1430
01:51:42,129 --> 01:51:44,119
You're still not listening!

1431
01:51:46,767 --> 01:51:49,697
Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?

1432
01:51:50,404 --> 01:51:54,034
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!

1433
01:51:54,608 --> 01:51:56,418
Just get in there.
Go! Go, go, go!

1434
01:51:56,743 --> 01:51:57,943
Circus cars?

1435
01:51:58,178 --> 01:52:00,348
How can you be circus cars?

1436
01:52:00,714 --> 01:52:02,934
These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,

1437
01:52:03,317 --> 01:52:05,067
and they're gonna make me rich!

1438
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:06,375
Wait a minute here.

1439
01:52:06,587 --> 01:52:08,757
They're just usin’ the same actor
over and over.

1440
01:52:09,122 --> 01:52:11,372
What kind of a cut-rate production
is this?

1441
01:55:37,531 --> 01:55:41,631
Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we
please ask someone for directions?

1442
01:55:42,269 --> 01:55:45,989
No! There's an on-ramp close!
I know it! I can feel it!
