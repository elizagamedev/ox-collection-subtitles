1
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,224
A piece of eight.

2
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,079
Nine of them, you say.

3
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,321
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

4
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,938
Nine pieces of eight.

5
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,132
What's the significance of that?

6
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,935
Does it matter? Nothing can hold
against the armada.

7
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,184
Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.

8
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,803
Nothing we know of.

9
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,843
Your friend mention where
the Brethren Court are meeting?

10
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,280
He was mum on that, sir.

11
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,527
Then he knows the value of information.

12
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,204
Better keep this between ourselves.

13
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,339
We don't want anyone running off
to Singapore, do we?

14
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,748
Ah, Admiral.

15
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,142
You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

16
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,936
Yes. Something for you there.

17
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,922
Your new station
deserves an old friend.

18
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,262
Not more requisition orders?

19
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,731
No, sir. Execution.

20
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,230
The Brethren know they face extinction.

21
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:30,083
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

22
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,041
No one said anything about cold.

23
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,076
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

24
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,727
Why don't that obay woman
just bring Jack back

25
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,859
the same way
she brought back Barbossa?

26
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,491
Because Barbossa was only dead.

27
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,239
Jack Sparrow is taken,
in body and soul,

28
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:20,952
to a place not of death
but punishment.

29
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,359
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself.

30
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,196
Stretching on forever.

31
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,666
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones’ Locker.

32
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,037
I knew there was a good reason.

33
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,561
Nothing here is set.

34
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,768
They can't be as accurate
as modern charts.

35
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,762
But it leads to more places.

36
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,871
"Over the edge.

37
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,530
Over again."

38
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,707
"Sunrise sets. Flash of green."

39
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:23,447
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

40
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,890
Ever a-gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

41
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,022
l reckon I seen my fair share.

42
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,396
Happens on rare occasion.

43
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,738
The last glimpse of sunset
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

44
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,788
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it,

45
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,108
some claim to have seen it
who ain't, and some say...

46
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:48,238
It signals when a soul comes back
to this world from the dead.

47
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,472
Sorry.

48
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,798
Trust me, young Master Turner,

49
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,907
it's not getting to the land of the dead
that's the problem.

50
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,159
It's getting back.

51
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,032
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

52
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,939
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

53
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,054
Fetch the chest.

54
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,248
And the governor?

55
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,739
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

56
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,373
Does he know?

57
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,094
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

58
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,836
Steady, men.

59
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,990
Go. All of you.

60
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,346
And take that infernal thing with you.

61
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,346
I will not have it on my ship!

62
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,783
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Because I will.

63
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,796
Because it seems to be the only way
to ensure that this ship do

64
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,050
as directed by the Company.

65
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,343
We need prisoners to interrogate,

66
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,327
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

67
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,320
The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.

68
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,138
And its captain is to sail it
as commanded.

69
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,797
I would have thought you learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

70
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,216
This is no longer your world, Jones.

71
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,454
The immaterial has become...

72
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,875
.. immaterial.

73
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,102
How long do we continue not talking?

74
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,882
Once we rescue Jack
everything will be fine.

75
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,537
Then we rescue Jack.

76
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,753
For what we want most...

77
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,149
. there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

78
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,471
Barbossa, ahead.

79
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,356
Aye, we're good and lost now.

80
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,219
Lost?

81
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,727
For certain you have to be lost
to find the places can't be found.

82
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,654
Elseways everyone
would know where it was.

83
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,247
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

84
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,264
To stations!

85
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,430
All hands to stations!

86
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,218
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

87
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,857
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

88
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,276
Blimey.

89
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,703
You've doomed us all.

90
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,767
Don't be so unkind.

91
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,266
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

92
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,941
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

93
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,414
Tie her off.

94
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,347
Hard to port!

95
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,355
Hold on!

96
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,689
Strike your colors,
you blooming cockroaches.

97
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,777
Dead men tell no tales.

98
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,344
My peanut.

99
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,134
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

100
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,236
Aye, Captain. Slacken braces.

101
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,608
Step lively with a will.

102
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,237
Help.

103
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,274
Man the yards, you filthy toads.

104
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,944
Haul the sheets handsomely, boys.
Scandalize and let's heave.

105
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,300
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, Captain.

106
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,730
What say you about the condition
of this tack line?

107
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,589
- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

108
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,586
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

109
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,430
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

110
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,100
Begging your pardon, sir, but perhaps
if you gave a man another chance.

111
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,494
Shall I?

112
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,763
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

113
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,889
We have lost speed and therefore time.

114
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,875
Precious time which cannot be
recovered once lost.

115
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,992
- Do you understand?
- Aye, aye, Captain.

116
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,199
Do you now?

117
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,608
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.

118
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,208
And let this serve as a lesson
to the lot of you.

119
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,478
Doldrum, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

120
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,234
l have no sympathy for any
of you feculent maggots

121
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,676
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

122
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,386
Gentlemen...

123
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,995
..l wash my hands of this weirdness.

124
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,041
No wind.

125
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,423
Of course there's no bloody wind.

126
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,460
My soul I do swear for a breeze.

127
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:33,389
A gust. A whisper.
A tiny, miniature lick.

128
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,430
Yes, sir, know,
but why would he do that?

129
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,185
Because he's a lummox.

130
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,723
We shall have a magnificent garden
party, and you're not invited.

131
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:09,888
Shoo.

132
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,338
Arock.

133
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,582
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

134
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,480
A rope.

135
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,568
This truly is a godforsaken place.

136
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,871
I don't see Jack. I don't see anyone.

137
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,040
He's here.

138
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,322
Davy Jones never once gave up
that what he took.

139
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,005
And does it matter?

140
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,820
We're trapped here by your doing,
no different than Jack.

141
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,873
Witty Jack...

142
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,352
..iS closer than you think.

143
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,185
Impossible.

144
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,436
Boat.

145
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,027
Slap me thrice and hand me
to me mama. It's Jack.

146
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,223
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

147
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,729
- Jack.
- Mr. Gibbs.

148
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,665
- Aye, Captain.
- [ thought so.

149
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,680
l expect you are able to account
for your actions, then.

150
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,000
Sir?

151
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:15,538
There has been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel.

152
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,498
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

153
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,747
You're in Davy Jones’ Locker,
Captain.

154
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,014
I know that.

155
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,840
I know where I am.
And don't think I don't.

156
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,183
Jack Sparrow.

157
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:35,784
Hector.

158
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,008
It's been too long, hasn't it?

159
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,547
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

160
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,553
No, I didn't.

161
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,395
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

162
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,881
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

163
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,546
He thinks we're a hallucination.

164
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,745
William, tell me something.

165
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,741
Have you come because
you need my help

166
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,766
to save a certain distressing damsel...
or rather damsel in distress?

167
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,371
- Either one.
- No.

168
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,910
Then you wouldn't be here,
would you? So you can't be here.

169
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,643
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

170
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,426
Jack.

171
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,610
This is real. We're here.

172
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,046
- "The Locker," you say?
- Aye.

173
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,622
We've come to rescue you.

174
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:38,733
Have you now?

175
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,875
That's very kind of you.

176
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,597
But it would seem that as !
possess a ship and you don't,

177
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:48,457
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

178
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,202
Il see my ship.

179
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,301
Right there.

180
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,106
I can't spot it.

181
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:01,327
Must be a tiny little thing hiding
somewhere behind the Pear!

182
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,327
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

183
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,553
- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.

184
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,943
The song has already been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

185
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,407
Leave you alone and look what happens.
Everything's gone to pot.

186
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,256
Aye. The world needs you back
something fierce.

187
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,765
And you need a crew.

188
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,490
Why should I sail with any of you?

189
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,928
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One succeeded.

190
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,288
She's not told you?

191
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,093
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

192
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,094
As for you...

193
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,622
Now...

194
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,828
..don't tell me you didn't
enjoy it at the time.

195
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,323
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

196
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,176
Don't need you. You scare me.

197
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,388
Gibbs, you can come. Marty...

198
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,345
Cotton. Cotton's parrot
I'm a little iffy,

199
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,378
but at least I'll have
someone to talk to.

200
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:04,993
Who are you?

201
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,454
Tai Huang. These are my men.

202
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,060
Where do your allegiances lie?

203
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,812
With the highest bidder.

204
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,754
l have a ship.

205
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,849
That makes you the highest bidder.

206
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,441
Good man.

207
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,553
Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

208
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,517
Jack.

209
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,877
Which way you going, Jack?

210
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,675
Trim that sail. Slack
windward brace and sheet.

211
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,902
Haul the pennant line.

212
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,892
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

213
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,411
- No, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

214
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,027
- No, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

215
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,066
- Captain gives orders on a ship.
- The captain is giving orders.

216
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,581
- My ship makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

217
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,947
That makes you chartman.

218
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:01,789
Stow it, the both of you!
That's an order! Understand?

219
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,240
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

220
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,697
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

221
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:15,696
Sorry.

222
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,762
I'd vote for you.

223
00:26:58,517 --> 00:26:59,807
You left Jack to the kraken.

224
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,070
He's rescued now. It's done with.

225
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,094
Will, ! had no choice.

226
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:11,325
You chose not to tell me.

227
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,811
I couldn't.

228
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,127
It wasn't your burden to bear.

229
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,863
But I did bear it, didn't I?

230
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,684
I just didn't know what it was.

231
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,080
I thought...

232
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,116
You thought I loved him?

233
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:41,295
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

234
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,010
You can't.

235
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,773
Eerie.

236
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,466
That's downright macabre.

237
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,427
l wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them.

238
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,787
Be disrespectful it would.

239
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,396
They should be in the care
of Davy Jones.

240
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,085
That was the duty him
was charged with...

241
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,365
..by the goddess Calypso.

242
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,463
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

243
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,743
And every ten years,
him could come ashore...

244
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,819
..to be with she who love him.

245
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:11,752
Truly.

246
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,528
But the man has become a monster.

247
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,838
So, he wasn't always... tentacle-y?

248
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:26,901
No.

249
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,746
Him was a man...

250
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:32,956
..Once.

251
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,849
Now his boat's coming.

252
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,758
They're not a threat to us.

253
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,517
Am I right?

254
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,072
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

255
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,421
It's best just let them be.

256
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,225
It's my father. We've made it back.

257
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,717
Father! Here, look here!

258
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,285
Elizabeth.

259
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,585
We're not back.

260
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:32,783
Father!

261
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:36,904
Elizabeth.

262
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,563
Are you dead?

263
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,645
I think lam.

264
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,640
No, you can't be.

265
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,360
There was this chest, you see.

266
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,020
It's odd.

267
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,125
At the time it seemed so important.

268
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,130
Come aboard.

269
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,906
And a heart.

270
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:03,441
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place...

271
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,516
..and you will sail the seas
for eternity.

272
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,673
The Dutchman must have a captain.

273
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,237
Silly thing to die for.

274
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,183
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

275
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:25,263
A touch of destiny.

276
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:29,977
Take the line.

277
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,624
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

278
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,480
The line! Take the line!

279
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,519
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

280
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,252
Please come with us!

281
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,680
I won't leave you!

282
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,933
I'll give your love to your mother.

283
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,205
- L won't let you go.
- Elizabeth.

284
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,329
Is there a way?

285
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,599
Him at peace.

286
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,594
No water.

287
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,720
Why is all but the rum gone?

288
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,191
Rum's gone, too.

289
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:36,351
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

290
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,355
I fear we will sail on trackless seas...

291
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,702
..doomed to roam
the reach between worlds...

292
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,086
.. forever.

293
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,638
And no water forever looks
to be arriving a mite too soon.

294
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,242
Why doesn't he do something?

295
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:55,796
There's no sense to it.

296
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,851
The green flash happens at sunset...

297
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,173
.-not sunrise.

298
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,054
Over the edge.

299
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,837
That's driving me over
the blooming edge.

300
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,530
Sunrises don't set.

301
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,917
"Up is down."

302
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,242
That's just maddeningly unhelpful.

303
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,715
Why are these things never clear?

304
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,337
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What?

305
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,890
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

306
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,903
- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.

307
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,513
That's even more than less
than unhelpful.

308
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,928
Sail the seas for eternity.

309
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:37,711
I love the sea.

310
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,285
What about port?

311
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,481
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

312
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,960
Making port.

313
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,208
Where we can get rum
and salty wenches...

314
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,804
..once every ten years.

315
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,834
- What did he say?
- Once every ten years.

316
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,187
Ten years is a long time, mate.

317
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,283
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

318
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,911
But eternity is longer still.

319
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,504
And how will you be spending it?

320
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,496
Dead... or not?

321
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,783
The immortal Captain Sparrow.

322
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,512
like that.

323
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,259
Come sunset, it won't matter.

324
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,826
Not sunset.

325
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,647
Sundown.

326
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,448
And rise. Up.

327
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,423
What's that?

328
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,087
What is that? I don't know.
What do you think?

329
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,801
- Where?
- There.

330
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:56,964
What is it?

331
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,870
He's rocking the ship.

332
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,776
We're rocking the ship.

333
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,218
Aye.

334
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,819
He's onto it.

335
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:23,827
He's rocking the ship.

336
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,172
We'll tie each other to the mast,
upside down,

337
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,694
so when the boat flips,
we'll be the right way up.

338
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,314
Time it with the swell.

339
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,805
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

340
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,710
Unstow the cargo.

341
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,529
Let it shift.

342
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,709
Now up...

343
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,578
..is down.

344
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,449
This was your idea.

345
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,822
Blessed sweet Westerns!

346
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:35,843
We're back!

347
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,924
It's the sunrise.

348
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,029
Parley?

349
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,453
We need our pistols! Get untied. Hurry!

350
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,429
All right, then!

351
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,450
The Brethren Court is gathering
at Shipwreck Cove.

352
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,077
And Jack, you and I are going,
and there will be no arguing that point.

353
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,054
lis arguing the point.

354
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:27,289
If there's pirates gathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

355
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,785
The pirates are gathering to fight
Beckett, and you're a pirate.

356
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,288
Fight or not, you're not running, Jack.

357
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,008
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down

358
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,157
till there will be none left but you.

359
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:40,674
Quite like the sound of that.

360
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,755
Captain Jack Sparrow...

361
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,541
. the last pirate.

362
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,096
Aye. And you'll be
fighting Jones alone.

363
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,460
How does that figure into your plan?

364
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,278
I'm still working on that.

365
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,671
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate.

366
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,400
Count on that.

367
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:04,261
Wet powder.

368
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,155
Wait!

369
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:10,303
We can still use them as clubs!

370
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,811
Sorry. Effective, though.

371
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,370
There's a freshwater spring
on this island.

372
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,496
We resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

373
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,839
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

374
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,777
I'll not be leaving my ship
in your command.

375
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:31,226
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command?

376
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,147
Temporarily.

377
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,906
Criminy.

378
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,420
Odds bodkins!

379
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,367
Careful! Careful!

380
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,321
You stupid fish!

381
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,693
- Actually, it's a cephalopod.
- Serves you right.

382
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,124
bet people would pay
a shilling to see this.

383
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,907
And a shilling for a sketch
of them sitting atop!

384
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,350
Pintel and Ragetti, kraken slayers.

385
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,623
Still thinking of running, Jack?

386
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,016
Think you can outrun the world?

387
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,008
The problem with being
the last of anything...

388
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,168
..by and by there be none left at all.

389
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,902
Sometimes things come back, mate.

390
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,634
We're living proof, you and me.

391
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,540
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

392
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,948
There's never a guarantee
of coming back.

393
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,331
But passing on, that's dead certain.

394
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,730
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

395
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:30,607
It's our only hope, lad.

396
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,913
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

397
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,174
The world used to be a bigger place.

398
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,160
The world is still the same.

399
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,497
There's just less in it.

400
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,615
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

401
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,244
l know him.

402
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:19,712
He was in Singapore!

403
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,095
Captain!

404
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,708
We got company!

405
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:41,655
He's the captain.

406
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:57,330
Sao Feng, you showing up here
'tis truly a remarkable coincidence.

407
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,174
Jack Sparrow.

408
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,612
You pay me great insult once.

409
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,468
That doesn't sound like me.

410
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,324
Shall we just call it square, then?

411
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:17,464
Release her.

412
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,036
She's not part of the bargain.

413
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,904
And what bargain be that?

414
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,571
You heard Captain Turner.

415
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:28,577
- Release her!
- Captain Turner?

416
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,336
The perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

417
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:34,016
I need the Pear! to free my father.

418
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,595
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.

419
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,489
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

420
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:42,341
It was my burden to bear.

421
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,109
He needs the Peart.

422
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,630
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.

423
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,950
And you felt guilty.

424
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,019
And you and your Brethren Court.

425
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:56,881
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

426
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:07,944
I'm standing over with them.

427
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:11,837
I'm sorry, Jack...

428
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:15,299
..but there is an old friend
who wants to see you first.

429
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,973
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

430
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,206
Here is your chance to find out.

431
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,694
Curious.

432
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,542
Your friends appear to be
quite desperate, Jack.

433
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:42,089
Perhaps they no longer believe
a gathering of squabbling pirates

434
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:44,747
can defeat the Flying Dutchman.

435
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,206
And so despair leads to betrayal.

436
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:52,484
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

437
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:57,694
It's not here, Jack.

438
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,190
- What isn't?
- The heart of Davy Jones.

439
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,940
It's safely aboard the Dutchman

440
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,252
and so unavailable for use as leverage

441
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,817
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

442
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:14,205
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

443
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:16,372
By your death?

444
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:18,544
And yet here you are.

445
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,703
Close your eyes, pretend it's all
a bad dream. That's how I get by.

446
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,745
And if Davy Jones were to learn
of your survival?

447
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,877
My men are crew enough.

448
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,182
Company ship, Company crew.

449
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,139
You agreed. The Black Pear!
was to be mine.

450
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,643
And so it was.

451
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:52,334
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement,

452
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:56,027
one which requires
absolutely nothing from you...

453
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,037
..but information.

454
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,899
Regarding the Brethren Court,
no doubt,

455
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:09,127
in exchange for fair compensation.

456
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,984
Square my debt with Jones...

457
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,201
..and guarantee my freedom.

458
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,759
Of course.

459
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,731
It's just good business.

460
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,390
Were I in a divulgatory mood...

461
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,981
- .. what then might I divulge?
- Everything.

462
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:28,685
Where are they meeting?

463
00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:31,417
Who are the pirate lords?

464
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,473
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

465
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:44,103
Beckett agreed...

466
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:46,825
..the Black Pearl was to be mine.

467
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,451
Lord Beckett won't give up the only
ship that can outrun the Dutchman.

468
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:01,745
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

469
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,370
Because honor is a hard thing
to come by nowadays.

470
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:09,517
There is no honor to remaining
with the losing side.

471
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,710
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

472
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,021
The losing side, you say?

473
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:19,367
They have the Dutchman...
now the Pear!

474
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,671
And what do the Brethren have?

475
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,087
We have... Calypso.

476
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,622
Calypso.

477
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,499
An old legend.

478
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,229
No.

479
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,297
The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

480
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:50,187
Imagine all the powers of the seas

481
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:54,098
brought to bear against our enemy.
l intend to release her.

482
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:57,352
For that I need the Brethren Court.

483
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,547
All the Court.

484
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:05,248
You can keep Barbossa,

485
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:08,469
the belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye.

486
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:11,767
And Turner. Especially Turner.

487
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,186
The rest go with me aboard the Peart.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

488
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:19,466
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

489
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,077
Bloody fair deal, don't you think?

490
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,266
And what becomes of Miss Swann?

491
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:28,604
What interest is she to you?

492
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,812
What are you proposing, Captain?

493
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,768
What be accepted, Captain?

494
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,999
- The girl.
- What?

495
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:44,845
Jack, I've just recalled...

496
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,489
I've got this wonderful compass,

497
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:50,162
which points to whatever I want.

498
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,991
So for what do I need you?

499
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,134
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

500
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:57,323
Out of the question.

501
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,111
It was not a question.

502
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:02,966
Points to the thing you want most.
That is not the Brethren Court, is it?

503
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,344
Then what is, Jack?

504
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,719
Me...

505
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,495
..dead.

506
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:09,696
Done.

507
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:12,247
What? Not done.

508
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,923
You got us into this mess.
If this frees us, done!

509
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:17,143
Damn.

510
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,511
Although, if I kill you,

511
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,723
then I can use the compass
to find Shipwreck Cove, is it...

512
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:28,964
..on my own.

513
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,400
Cut out the middleman, as it were.

514
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,252
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

515
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,721
l have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

516
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,571
Then we have an accord.

517
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,089
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the Cove,

518
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,870
find it a stronghold nigh impregnable...

519
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:51,315
..able to withstand blockade
for years, and then you'd be wishing,

520
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:54,839
"Oh, if only there was someone
l had not killed inside

521
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:58,509
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

522
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:01,507
And you can accomplish all this?

523
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,743
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

524
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,333
Who am I?

525
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,367
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

526
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,404
Done!

527
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:06,072
You're mad.

528
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,330
Thank goodness. If l wasn't,
this would probably never work.

529
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:30,218
And that was without even
a single drop of rum.

530
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:42,549
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cow-hearted codpiece to the brig.

531
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,806
Which ship do we follow?

532
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:51,104
Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Peart.

533
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,759
How soon can we have the ship
ready to pursue?

534
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,352
Do you think he plans it all out

535
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,900
or just makes it up as he goes along?

536
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:12,859
Sorry.

537
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:59,155
By this time tomorrow,
we will arrive at Shipwreck Cove

538
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,002
and you will be free.

539
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:04,857
Calypso.

540
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,450
Excuse me?

541
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,479
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,

542
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,451
out of the many that you have...

543
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,097
..but it is what we call you.

544
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:18,291
We being who?

545
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,500
You confirm it.

546
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,129
Confirm what?

547
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:29,996
You've told me nothing.

548
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,844
The Brethren Court, not I.

549
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,970
The first Brethren Court,

550
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,702
whose decision I would have opposed.

551
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,116
They bound you to human form,

552
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:44,221
so the rule of the seas
would belong to Man, and not...

553
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:45,821
Me.

554
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:53,109
But one such as you should never be
anything less than what you are.

555
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,074
Pretty speech from a captor,

556
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,963
but words whispered through
prison bars lose their charm.

557
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,694
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

558
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,479
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

559
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,380
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

560
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,495
l offer simply my desire.

561
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:20,252
And in return?

562
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:23,285
I would have your gifts...

563
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,259
.-Should you choose to give them.

564
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,046
And if l should choose... not?

565
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,528
Then I will take...

566
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:39,202
.-your fury.

567
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:06,432
Sao Feng.

568
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:08,861
Here.

569
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,770
Please.

570
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,843
With all nine pieces of eight...

571
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,599
..you will be free.

572
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,212
Take it!

573
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,336
You are captain now.

574
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:33,643
Me?

575
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,510
Go in my place...

576
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,562
..to Shipwreck Cove.

577
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,896
Captain, the ship is taken.

578
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:50,297
Forgive me, Calypso.

579
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,593
What did he tell you?

580
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:14,273
He made me captain.

581
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,705
You are not my captain.

582
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:28,243
Elizabeth.

583
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:30,683
James.

584
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,285
Thank God you're alive.

585
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,941
Your father will be overjoyed
to know you're safe.

586
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,531
My father's dead.

587
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,640
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

588
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,467
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

589
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,480
Who among you
do you name as captain?

590
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:54,293
Captain. Her.

591
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:01,126
- Captain.
- Tow the ship.

592
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,772
Put the prisoners in the brig.

593
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:06,932
The captain shall have my quarters.

594
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,625
Thank you, sir.

595
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,460
But I prefer to remain with my crew.

596
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:13,873
Elizabeth.

597
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:15,111
I swear...

598
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,522
- .... did not know.
- Know what?

599
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:21,323
Which side you chose.

600
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,100
Well, now you do.

601
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:37,884
Here.

602
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:41,354
Bootstrap?

603
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:50,363
Bootstrap.

604
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:52,431
Bill Turner?

605
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:54,961
Bootstrap.

606
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:05,870
You know my name.

607
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:11,019
Yes, I know your son.

608
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,460
Will Turner.

609
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,299
William.

610
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,446
He made it. He's alive.

611
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:29,139
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

612
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,315
God's wounds. He's on his way.

613
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:35,964
Yes, Will is alive.

614
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,450
And he wants to help you.

615
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:47,310
He can't help me. He won't come.

616
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:49,975
But you're his father.

617
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,247
I know you.

618
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:54,926
He spoke of you.

619
00:59:57,227 --> 00:59:59,886
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

620
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:02,535
Me?

621
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:05,837
You're Elizabeth.

622
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,654
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

623
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:15,020
If Jones be slain. He who slays him,
must take his place.

624
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,519
Captain. Forever.

625
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,248
The Dutchman must
always have a captain.

626
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,305
And if he saves me...

627
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,328
..he loses you.

628
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,229
I see.

629
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,337
He won't pick me.

630
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,296
I wouldn't pick me.

631
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,203
Tell him not to come.

632
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:52,224
Tell him to stay away.

633
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,897
Tell him it's too late.

634
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,654
I'm already a part of the ship...

635
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:03,272
..and the crew.

636
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:06,799
Bootstrap.

637
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,179
You know my name.

638
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,352
You know my name.

639
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,579
Yes, I know your son.

640
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:20,162
William.

641
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:25,007
He's coming for me.

642
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,272
Wait and see.

643
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:29,525
You'll see.

644
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:32,658
He promised.

645
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:06,725
Sir.

646
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:12,144
A breadcrumb trail.

647
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:14,129
And we're meant to follow.

648
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:16,381
A betrayer among them?

649
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,160
Or a trap?

650
01:02:18,368 --> 01:02:21,528
A gambit by a skilled opponent.

651
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:25,543
Adjust course, Lieutenant.

652
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:27,145
Sir?

653
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,199
We can only hope
to reach our destination

654
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:33,278
before they run out of bodies.

655
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:49,904
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

656
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:52,231
William...

657
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:54,593
..do you notice anything?

658
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:57,603
Rather...

659
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:00,941
..do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

660
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:04,959
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

661
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:06,522
Not as odd as this.

662
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,288
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

663
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:13,084
I said to myself, "Think like Jack."

664
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:15,954
This is what you've arrived at?

665
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:19,249
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust?

666
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,948
Accomplish your own ends?
It's like you don't know me at all.

667
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:29,403
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

668
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:35,006
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

669
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,085
I'm losing her.

670
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:44,514
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

671
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,992
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

672
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,816
If l might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

673
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:56,101
..avoid the choice all together.

674
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:58,179
Change the facts.

675
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:02,043
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

676
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:04,643
Who?

677
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,382
You?

678
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:15,262
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

679
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:18,759
I slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,

680
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,955
your father goes free from his debt,

681
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:23,477
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

682
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,430
You're willing to cut out your heart,
bind yourself to the Dutchman...

683
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,986
- .. forever.
- No, mate.

684
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,973
I'm free forever.

685
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,608
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

686
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:38,419
You have to do the job, though.

687
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,148
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

688
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:43,892
Or end up just like Jones.

689
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,649
I don't have the face for tentacles.

690
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:52,837
But immortal has to count
for something.

691
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:58,387
What's this for?

692
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:00,674
Think like me. It'll come to you.

693
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:16,731
My regards to Davy Jones.

694
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:23,522
l hate him.

695
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,261
Come with me.

696
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:33,956
Quickly.

697
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,353
What are you doing?

698
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:47,762
Choosing a side.

699
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:16,182
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the brethren.

700
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,789
I fear there may be a traitor
among them.

701
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,186
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

702
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:26,332
l had nothing to do
with your father's death.

703
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,155
But that doesn't absolve me
of my other sins.

704
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,258
Come with us.

705
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,923
James, come with me.

706
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:44,823
Who goes there?

707
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:49,913
Go. I will follow.

708
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:52,995
You're lying.

709
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:58,535
Our destinies have been entwined...

710
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,029
..but never joined.

711
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,542
Go, now.

712
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,772
Back to your station, sailor.

713
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,466
No one leaves the ship.

714
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:24,742
Stand down.

715
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,091
That's an order.

716
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:27,649
That's an order.

717
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:31,452
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

718
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,033
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

719
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,587
Steady.

720
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:39,508
Part of the crew, part of the ship.
All hands, prisoner escape!

721
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,308
- Belay that!
- James!

722
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,792
James! No! No!

723
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,452
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

724
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:13,687
Admiral's dead.

725
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,130
- To the captain's command!
- Aye!

726
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:21,990
Back to the ship.

727
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,810
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

728
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,227
I take that as a "no."

729
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,420
Nice sword.

730
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,583
The Dutchman...

731
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:11,157
.iS under my command.

732
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,683
For now.

733
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,085
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

734
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:36,544
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.

735
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:39,595
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the Town of Shipwreck.

736
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,700
You heard him. Step lively.

737
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:46,478
For all that pirates are clever called,
we are an unimaginative lot

738
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:48,625
when it comes to naming things.

739
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:53,382
l once sailed with a geezer,
lost both of his arms, part of his eye.

740
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,126
What'd you call him?

741
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:57,549
Larry.

742
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:03,830
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

743
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:08,453
We agreed on ends only.
The means are mine to decide.

744
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:11,829
Caution, Barbossa.

745
01:10:12,175 --> 01:10:15,515
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

746
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:19,335
Or what it mean if you fail me.

747
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:26,103
Don't you forget why you had
to bring me back.

748
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:29,558
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

749
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,747
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

750
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,660
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

751
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,307
Masters Pintel, Ragetti.

752
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,021
Take this fish wife to the brig.

753
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,493
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

754
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,684
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

755
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,040
Apparently, you can.

756
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,672
I believe you know each other.

757
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:32,668
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner.

758
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:36,089
Not yours. His.

759
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,300
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

760
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,170
Sparrow?

761
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,420
You didn't tell him.

762
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,541
We rescued Jack from the locker
along with the Black Peart.

763
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,142
What else have you not told me?

764
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,829
There's an issue...

765
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,751
..far more troublesome.

766
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:01,771
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

767
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,574
Not a person.

768
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:11,133
A heathen god. One who delights
in cursing men with their wildest dreams

769
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,477
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

770
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:16,391
The world is well rid of her.

771
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,126
Not quite so well, actually.

772
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,779
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

773
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,781
No! They cannot!

774
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,624
The first court promised
to imprison her forever.

775
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:30,504
- That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?

776
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:36,682
l showed them how to bind her.

777
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,757
She could not be trusted.
She gave me no choice.

778
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:44,754
We must act before they release her.

779
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,364
You loved her.

780
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:49,166
She's the one.

781
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:51,396
And then you betrayed her.

782
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:55,321
She pretended to love me.

783
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:58,769
She betrayed me.

784
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,501
And after which betrayal did you
cut out your heart, I wonder.

785
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:11,488
Do not test me.

786
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,474
I hadn't finished that.

787
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,588
You will free my father.

788
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:22,495
And you will guarantee Elizabeth's
safety, along with my own.

789
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,054
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.

790
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,800
We will expect fair value in return.

791
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:32,474
There is only one price I will accept.

792
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:35,122
Calypso murdered.

793
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,267
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.

794
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:44,951
Jack has sailed the Black Pear!
to Shipwreck Cove.

795
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,559
And with you no longer aboard her...

796
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:51,170
.. how do you propose
to lead us there?

797
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,652
What is it you want most?

798
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,644
Look at them all.

799
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:43,035
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

800
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:45,933
And I owe them all money.

801
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,531
As he who issued summons...

802
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:58,490
... convene this,
the fourth Brethren Court.

803
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:06,291
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

804
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:10,812
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow captains.

805
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,388
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

806
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,072
The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso,

807
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:29,989
but when the first court met,
the brethren were to a one skint broke.

808
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,880
- So change the name.
- What?

809
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:37,546
To "nine pieces of what we happen
to have in our pockets at the time"?

810
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:39,997
Oh, yes. That sounds very pirate-y.

811
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,462
Master Ragetti, if you will.

812
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:50,076
I kept it safe for you, just like
you said when you gave it to me.

813
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,386
Aye, you have. But now I need it back.

814
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:57,825
Sparrow?

815
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,880
Might I point out that we are
still short one pirate lord

816
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:10,808
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

817
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:12,827
Sao Feng is dead.

818
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:17,161
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.

819
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:18,796
The plagued ship.

820
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:22,898
He made you captain?
They're giving the bloody title away.

821
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:26,059
Listen. Listen to me.

822
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,195
Our location has been betrayed.

823
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:31,904
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way.

824
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,941
Who is this betrayer?

825
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:35,863
Not likely anyone among us.

826
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,998
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

827
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:41,132
And it matters not how they found us.

828
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,040
The question is, "What will
we do now that they have?"

829
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:45,337
We fight.

830
01:16:49,505 --> 01:16:52,785
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

831
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:55,479
A well-supplied fortress.

832
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:59,685
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

833
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,019
There be a third course.

834
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:07,874
In another age, at this very spot,

835
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,040
the first Brethren Court
captured the sea goddess

836
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:13,334
and bound her in her bones.

837
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,621
That was a mistake.

838
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:21,191
We tamed the seas for ourselves.

839
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:25,218
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

840
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,786
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

841
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:33,609
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

842
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:37,900
but from the sweat of a man's brow
and the strength of his back alone.

843
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,007
You all know this to be true.

844
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:42,627
Gentlemen.

845
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:44,829
Ladies.

846
01:17:49,465 --> 01:17:52,095
We must free Calypso.

847
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,550
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

848
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:07,452
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, shoot
his tongue. Trim that scraggly beard.

849
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,357
Sao Feng would have agreed
with Barbossa.

850
01:18:10,753 --> 01:18:13,063
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be now.

851
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,155
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

852
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,857
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

853
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:21,945
- You threaten me?
- [challenge you.

854
01:18:34,577 --> 01:18:37,327
- This is madness.
- This is politics.

855
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,740
Meanwhile our enemies
bear down upon us.

856
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:42,272
If they not be here already.

857
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:21,515
My sweet.

858
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,027
You come for me.

859
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,140
You were expecting me.

860
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,636
It has been torture.

861
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:33,719
Trapped in this... single form.

862
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:36,963
Cut off from the sea.

863
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:39,216
From all that I love.

864
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:43,442
From you.

865
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:48,199
Ten years I devoted to the duty
you charged me.

866
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,218
Ten years...

867
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,510
..l looked after those who died at sea.

868
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:59,880
And finally, when we could be
together again...

869
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,761
.- you weren't there.

870
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,664
Why weren't you there?

871
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,524
Is my nature.

872
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:19,057
Would you love me
if was anything but what l am?

873
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:23,936
I do not love you.

874
01:20:27,356 --> 01:20:30,106
Many things you were, Davy Jones.

875
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:33,706
But never cruel.

876
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,250
You have corrupted your purpose...

877
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,251
..and so yourself.

878
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:59,199
Calypso.

879
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,705
I will be free.

880
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,925
And when I am,
I will give you my heart.

881
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,940
And we will be together always.

882
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,657
If only you had a heart to give.

883
01:21:23,412 --> 01:21:24,872
Why did you come?

884
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:47,018
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

885
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:50,237
The Brethren Court?

886
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,464
All of them...

887
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,902
. the last thing
they will learn in this life...

888
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,692
.. 1S how cruel I can be.

889
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:08,130
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

890
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:13,176
My heart will always belong to you.

891
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:30,336
It was the first court
what imprisoned Calypso.

892
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:33,213
We should be the ones to set her free.

893
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:37,535
And in her gratitude
she will see fit to grant us boons.

894
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:39,823
Whose boons? Your boons?

895
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:42,432
Utterly deceptive
twaddle-speak, says I.

896
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:45,224
If you have a better alternative,

897
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,377
please, share.

898
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:49,797
Cuttlefish.

899
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:57,030
Let us not, dear friends,

900
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,579
forget our dear friends
the cuttlefish.

901
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:02,275
Flipping glorious little sausages.

902
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:06,505
Penned together they devour
each other without a second thought.

903
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:09,675
Human nature, isn't it? Or fish nature.

904
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:13,598
Yes, we could hole up here
well provisioned and well armed

905
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:16,266
and half of us would be dead
within the month.

906
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:19,665
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

907
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,646
..as my learned colleague

908
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:31,510
so naively suggests,
we can release Calypso...

909
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:35,081
..and we can pray
that she will be merciful.

910
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:37,415
l rather doubt it.

911
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:42,087
Can we in fact pretend she is anything
other than a woman scorned

912
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,044
like which fury hell hath no?

913
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:45,719
We cannot.

914
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,608
We are left with but one option.

915
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:56,598
l agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

916
01:23:58,734 --> 01:23:59,994
. Captain Swann.

917
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:01,772
We must fight.

918
01:24:02,004 --> 01:24:04,754
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

919
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,197
- You have so. Have so.
- Have not. Have not!

920
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,353
- Have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

921
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:14,622
l have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

922
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:18,786
l submit that here now
that is what we all must do.

923
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:22,694
We must fight... to run away.

924
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,185
Aye!

925
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,859
As per the Code,

926
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:31,501
an act of war...
and this be exactly that...

927
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,389
can only be declared
by the pirate king.

928
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:37,113
- You made that up.
- Did l now?

929
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:39,146
I call on Captain Teague.

930
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,751
Keeper of the Code.

931
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:46,271
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

932
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:49,946
Hang the code. Who gives a...

933
01:24:58,594 --> 01:24:59,934
Code is the law.

934
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:13,811
You're in my way, boy.

935
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:25,556
The Code.

936
01:25:25,754 --> 01:25:28,244
As set forth by Morgan
and Bartholomew.

937
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:48,355
That can't... How did...?

938
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:50,047
Sea turtles, mate.

939
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:54,151
Sea turtles.

940
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,216
Barbossa is right.

941
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,021
Hang on a minute.

942
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,190
"It shall be the duties as the king
to declare war,

943
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,690
parley with shared adversaries..."

944
01:26:21,043 --> 01:26:21,913
Fancy that.

945
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,280
There has not been a king
since the first court.

946
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:26,106
That's not likely to change.

947
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:28,191
- Not likely.
- Why not?

948
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,857
The pirate king is elected
by popular vote.

949
01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:33,683
Each pirate only ever votes for hisself.

950
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:35,900
I call for a vote.

951
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:42,779
I vote for Amand the Corsair.

952
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,411
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

953
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:48,704
Sri Sumbhajee votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

954
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:51,355
Mistress Ching.

955
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,070
Gentleman Jocard.

956
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:54,902
Elizabeth Swann.

957
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:57,070
- Barbossa.
- Villanueva!

958
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,269
Elizabeth Swann.

959
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,053
- What?
- 1 know. Curious, isn't it?

960
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:08,221
Vote for me.

961
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:12,536
No!

962
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:15,801
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the Code?

963
01:27:25,107 --> 01:27:26,277
Very well.

964
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:33,911
What say you, Captain Swann,
King of the Brethren Court?

965
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:38,248
Prepare every vessel that floats.

966
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:40,668
At dawn...

967
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,559
..we're at war.

968
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,692
And so...

969
01:27:48,964 --> 01:27:50,924
..we shall go to war.

970
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:05,913
What?

971
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:09,245
You've seen it all, done it all.
You survived.

972
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,171
That's the trick, isn't it?

973
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:12,857
To survive?

974
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:16,428
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

975
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:24,355
The trick is living
with yourself forever.

976
01:28:48,023 --> 01:28:51,213
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

977
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:16,937
Abandon ship.

978
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:28,021
Parley?

979
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:28,059
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

980
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:32,223
Don't blame Turner. He was
merely the tool of your betrayal.

981
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:36,364
If you wish to see its grand
architect, look to your left.

982
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:42,239
My hands are clean in this.

983
01:30:43,338 --> 01:30:44,628
Figuratively.

984
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:47,532
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

985
01:30:47,976 --> 01:30:51,045
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

986
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:53,006
I've been aboard the Dutchman.

987
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:57,165
l understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

988
01:30:57,686 --> 01:31:01,085
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

989
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:08,549
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

990
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:14,442
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

991
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:19,204
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

992
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:23,104
Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

993
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:27,625
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman. As a start.

994
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,090
That debt was paid. With some help.

995
01:31:32,554 --> 01:31:33,954
You escaped.

996
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:36,242
- Technically...
- l propose an exchange.

997
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:40,427
Will leaves with us...

998
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:43,313
..and you can take Jack.

999
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:46,597
Done.

1000
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:48,795
- Undone.
- Done.

1001
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:52,200
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

1002
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:54,017
King.

1003
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:58,701
As you command, your nibs.

1004
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:00,357
Blackguard!

1005
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,230
If you have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

1006
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:13,667
First to the finish, then?

1007
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,800
Do you fear death?

1008
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:41,024
You've no idea.

1009
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,142
Advise your brethren.

1010
01:32:46,461 --> 01:32:48,681
You can fight and all of you will die,

1011
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:50,934
or you can not fight,

1012
01:32:51,266 --> 01:32:53,606
in which case
only most of you will die.

1013
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:56,729
You murdered my father.

1014
01:32:57,806 --> 01:32:59,326
He chose his own fate.

1015
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:03,174
And you have chosen yours.

1016
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,888
We will fight...

1017
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:07,741
..and you will die.

1018
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:13,991
So be it.

1019
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,705
King?

1020
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:24,270
Of the Brethren Court. Courtesy of Jack.

1021
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:27,553
Maybe he really does know
what he's doing.

1022
01:33:34,142 --> 01:33:35,012
Bravo!

1023
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:37,930
You've successfully arrived
aboard the Flying Dutchman

1024
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:39,749
as per the overall scheme.

1025
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:41,684
- Look...
- Oh, yes. Chapeau.

1026
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:44,793
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

1027
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,491
Go away.

1028
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:50,499
- What? Back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

1029
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,920
Stab the heart.

1030
01:33:58,867 --> 01:34:02,937
Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.

1031
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:06,381
We'll use the Black Pearl
as a flagship to lead the attack.

1032
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:09,771
- Will we, now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish.

1033
01:34:10,245 --> 01:34:13,644
- Come on.
- Barbossa, you can't release her.

1034
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,920
We need to give Jack a chance.

1035
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:19,148
Apologies, Your Majesty.

1036
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:22,097
Too long my fate has not been
in me own hands.

1037
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,820
No longer.

1038
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,300
The enemy...

1039
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:33,806
..has opted for oblivion.

1040
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:38,715
Ready the fleet.

1041
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:40,813
To your stations!

1042
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:51,096
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?

1043
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,009
Aye.

1044
01:34:53,288 --> 01:34:56,098
The items brought together, done.

1045
01:34:56,558 --> 01:34:58,198
Items to be burned.

1046
01:34:59,928 --> 01:35:01,568
And someone must speak the words,

1047
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:04,853
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds."

1048
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:06,293
Is that it?

1049
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:10,638
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

1050
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:21,911
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!

1051
01:35:31,793 --> 01:35:33,133
Is that it?

1052
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,564
He didn't say it right.

1053
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,257
You have to say it right.

1054
01:35:53,014 --> 01:35:53,914
Calypso...

1055
01:35:59,354 --> 01:36:01,314
..[ release you
from your human bonds.

1056
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:21,664
Tia Dalma.

1057
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:25,509
Calypso.

1058
01:36:28,383 --> 01:36:31,843
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?

1059
01:36:35,056 --> 01:36:36,866
Who was it that betrayed you?

1060
01:36:37,592 --> 01:36:38,762
Name him.

1061
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:41,721
Davy Jones.

1062
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:57,520
This is it!

1063
01:36:57,779 --> 01:36:59,209
This is it!

1064
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:43,820
Calypso...

1065
01:37:46,094 --> 01:37:48,614
..1 come before you as but a servant...

1066
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:51,410
.. humble and contrite.

1067
01:37:53,634 --> 01:37:55,654
I have fulfilled me vow

1068
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:57,732
and now ask your favor.

1069
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,292
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...

1070
01:38:04,445 --> 01:38:08,365
..but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...

1071
01:38:09,484 --> 01:38:10,414
.
..or mine.

1072
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:09,613
Is that it?

1073
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,610
Why, she's no help at all.

1074
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:19,692
What now?

1075
01:39:20,555 --> 01:39:21,785
Nothing.

1076
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,000
Our final hope has failed us.

1077
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:55,537
- It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.

1078
01:39:55,957 --> 01:39:57,507
We've an armada against us

1079
01:39:57,792 --> 01:39:59,812
and with the Dutchman
there's no chance.

1080
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:02,091
There's only a fool's chance.

1081
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:04,860
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

1082
01:40:05,266 --> 01:40:08,045
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

1083
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:14,844
You're right.

1084
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:21,958
Then what shall we die for?

1085
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:27,213
You will listen to me.

1086
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:29,492
Listen!

1087
01:40:32,593 --> 01:40:34,813
The Brethren will still be
looking here to us...

1088
01:40:35,296 --> 01:40:36,966
..to the Black Pear! to lead.

1089
01:40:37,999 --> 01:40:39,169
And what will they see?

1090
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:42,811
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

1091
01:40:43,271 --> 01:40:44,971
No, they will see free men...

1092
01:40:46,073 --> 01:40:47,303
..and freedom!

1093
01:40:48,009 --> 01:40:50,729
What the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

1094
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:55,657
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do...

1095
01:40:59,186 --> 01:41:00,936
..by the sweat of our brows...

1096
01:41:01,856 --> 01:41:03,465
..the strength of our backs...

1097
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:06,245
..and the courage of our hearts.

1098
01:41:10,097 --> 01:41:11,147
Gentlemen...

1099
01:41:14,335 --> 01:41:15,505
.-hoist the colors.

1100
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:19,145
Hoist the colors.

1101
01:41:19,373 --> 01:41:21,562
- Hoist the colors.
- Hoist the colors!

1102
01:41:21,943 --> 01:41:23,053
Aye.

1103
01:41:23,277 --> 01:41:25,027
The wind's on our side, boys.

1104
01:41:25,346 --> 01:41:26,715
That's all we need!

1105
01:41:29,317 --> 01:41:31,047
Hoist the colors!

1106
01:42:22,937 --> 01:42:24,427
We have a favorable wind, sir.

1107
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:27,186
Oh, so we do.

1108
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,645
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

1109
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:33,229
That should brighten his day.

1110
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:40,238
To arms! We give no quarter!

1111
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:51,831
Calypso.

1112
01:43:18,726 --> 01:43:21,215
Have you noticed
on top of everything it's raining?

1113
01:43:21,629 --> 01:43:22,679
That's a bad sign.

1114
01:43:22,897 --> 01:43:25,887
Man the capstan.
Ready the main topyard.

1115
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:27,657
Keep that powder dry.

1116
01:43:42,249 --> 01:43:43,999
Maelstrom!

1117
01:43:47,455 --> 01:43:48,915
Captain Barbossa!

1118
01:43:50,424 --> 01:43:51,884
We need you at the helm.

1119
01:43:55,196 --> 01:43:56,836
Aye, that be true.

1120
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:03,670
Brace up yards,
you cack-handed deck apes.

1121
01:44:04,839 --> 01:44:07,909
Dying is the day worth living for.

1122
01:44:18,953 --> 01:44:20,563
Veer off!

1123
01:44:20,855 --> 01:44:22,554
She'll not harm us.

1124
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:25,670
Full bore and into the abyss.

1125
01:44:26,694 --> 01:44:27,774
Are you mad?

1126
01:44:28,996 --> 01:44:30,726
You afraid to get wet?

1127
01:44:40,474 --> 01:44:42,144
She's on our stern and gaining.

1128
01:44:43,077 --> 01:44:44,857
More speed!

1129
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:47,789
Haul your wind and hold your water.

1130
01:44:55,422 --> 01:44:57,732
Bow cannons!

1131
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:14,462
Take us out, or they'll overbear us.

1132
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:16,955
Nay. Further in.

1133
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:20,531
We'll cut across to faster waters.

1134
01:45:21,048 --> 01:45:22,657
Prepare to broadside.

1135
01:45:33,427 --> 01:45:35,326
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.

1136
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:38,593
Muster your courage, men. At the ready.

1137
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:43,379
Fill the cannons.

1138
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:48,164
- Think like the whelp.
- Help.

1139
01:45:48,442 --> 01:45:49,582
Think like the whelp.

1140
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:53,440
- Hinges. Hinges. Hinges.
- Think like the whelp.

1141
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:55,214
Half-barrel hinges.

1142
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:56,818
Leverage.

1143
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:03,772
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

1144
01:46:05,793 --> 01:46:08,343
- [miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

1145
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:09,932
Nobody move.

1146
01:46:11,265 --> 01:46:12,605
dropped me brain.

1147
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:25,247
Batten down the hatches!

1148
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:28,824
Stand to your guns.

1149
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:31,793
Midship cannoneers sight the mast.

1150
01:46:36,123 --> 01:46:38,402
Main battery at the ready.

1151
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:44,620
Hold there.

1152
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:47,102
Wait till we're board-and-board.

1153
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:53,529
Fire!

1154
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:55,278
Fire!

1155
01:46:55,476 --> 01:46:57,316
Fire! Fire all!

1156
01:46:59,313 --> 01:47:00,453
Fire!

1157
01:47:04,385 --> 01:47:05,875
Fire!

1158
01:47:15,629 --> 01:47:16,829
Come on, men.

1159
01:47:27,474 --> 01:47:30,694
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

1160
01:47:36,317 --> 01:47:37,987
Halt there, or we'll shoot.

1161
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:41,340
Good one.

1162
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:45,090
I just come to get me effects.

1163
01:47:46,961 --> 01:47:48,391
Admirable though it may be,

1164
01:47:48,662 --> 01:47:50,852
why are you here
when you could be elsewhere?

1165
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:53,281
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

1166
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:56,019
There's no question,

1167
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:59,336
there has been a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.

1168
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,880
- [blame the fish people.
- Oh, so fish people,

1169
01:48:03,377 --> 01:48:05,217
by dint of being fish people,

1170
01:48:05,546 --> 01:48:08,586
automatically aren't as disciplined
as non-fish people?

1171
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:10,893
Seems contributory, I'm suggesting.

1172
01:48:11,218 --> 01:48:15,228
Well, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

1173
01:48:15,856 --> 01:48:18,465
And if there were no chest,
we wouldn't need to guard it.

1174
01:48:27,568 --> 01:48:29,558
Prepare to board!

1175
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:32,175
Cover!

1176
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:12,991
Lookie here, boys.

1177
01:49:13,414 --> 01:49:15,084
A lost bird.

1178
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:18,922
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

1179
01:49:20,821 --> 01:49:22,111
To my great regret.

1180
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:25,157
But...

1181
01:49:27,795 --> 01:49:29,495
...never too late to learn, eh?

1182
01:49:37,671 --> 01:49:38,781
Whoa.

1183
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:48,706
The chest, hand it over.

1184
01:49:49,183 --> 01:49:50,793
I can set you free, mate.

1185
01:49:51,085 --> 01:49:53,425
My freedom was forfeit long ago.

1186
01:50:41,168 --> 01:50:42,098
Elizabeth.

1187
01:50:46,206 --> 01:50:47,666
Elizabeth...

1188
01:50:48,675 --> 01:50:49,815
..Will you marry me?

1189
01:50:51,712 --> 01:50:53,352
I don't think now's the best time.

1190
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:58,420
Now may be the only time.

1191
01:51:04,124 --> 01:51:05,614
I love you.

1192
01:51:11,798 --> 01:51:13,728
I've made my choice. What's yours?

1193
01:51:15,002 --> 01:51:15,932
Barbossa.

1194
01:51:17,804 --> 01:51:18,794
Marry us.

1195
01:51:20,207 --> 01:51:22,517
I'm a little busy at the moment.

1196
01:51:29,016 --> 01:51:30,356
Barbossa, now.

1197
01:51:32,653 --> 01:51:33,733
Fine then.

1198
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,949
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today.

1199
01:51:48,402 --> 01:51:51,332
To nail your gizzards to the mast,
you poxy cur.

1200
01:51:57,444 --> 01:51:59,784
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?

1201
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:02,110
- ldo.
- Great.

1202
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:10,302
Will Turner, do you take me...

1203
01:52:12,559 --> 01:52:13,519
..to be your wife?

1204
01:52:19,266 --> 01:52:20,495
In sickness and in health.

1205
01:52:21,635 --> 01:52:23,385
Health being the less likely.

1206
01:52:31,178 --> 01:52:32,048
Ido.

1207
01:52:34,648 --> 01:52:37,078
As captain, l now pronounce you...

1208
01:52:40,654 --> 01:52:41,734
You may kiss...

1209
01:52:51,265 --> 01:52:52,285
You may kiss...

1210
01:52:57,804 --> 01:52:58,764
Just kiss.

1211
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:39,138
Leave it.

1212
01:53:51,758 --> 01:53:54,098
You can do nothing without the key.

1213
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:55,784
l already have the key.

1214
01:53:57,097 --> 01:53:58,206
No, you don't.

1215
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:00,990
Oh, that key.

1216
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:38,907
No.

1217
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,629
My pistol.

1218
01:55:35,529 --> 01:55:36,639
Turner.

1219
01:55:42,202 --> 01:55:43,492
Fire.

1220
01:55:49,342 --> 01:55:50,331
Thank you, Jack.

1221
01:56:21,508 --> 01:56:22,678
It's me.

1222
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:25,681
It's Will.

1223
01:56:25,879 --> 01:56:27,169
Your son.

1224
01:57:11,725 --> 01:57:12,715
Go.

1225
01:57:31,278 --> 01:57:34,848
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

1226
01:57:35,415 --> 01:57:36,965
That's why I brought this.

1227
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:00,047
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

1228
01:58:09,182 --> 01:58:10,172
Mister...

1229
01:58:11,017 --> 01:58:13,007
..did you forget?

1230
01:58:13,353 --> 01:58:15,983
I'm a heartless wretch.

1231
01:58:34,774 --> 01:58:35,734
Love.

1232
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:39,016
A dreadful bond.

1233
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:41,960
And yet...

1234
01:58:42,182 --> 01:58:44,842
..S0 easily severed.

1235
01:58:45,986 --> 01:58:50,526
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?

1236
01:58:51,224 --> 01:58:52,214
Do you?

1237
01:59:03,203 --> 01:59:06,423
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hands.

1238
01:59:07,907 --> 01:59:11,387
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

1239
01:59:12,412 --> 01:59:14,872
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

1240
01:59:15,982 --> 01:59:17,062
Is it?

1241
01:59:43,476 --> 01:59:44,346
Will.

1242
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:48,358
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.

1243
01:59:54,587 --> 01:59:55,637
William?

1244
01:59:56,589 --> 01:59:57,609
My son.

1245
02:00:10,236 --> 02:00:13,306
Will! Look at me. Look at me!

1246
02:00:17,343 --> 02:00:20,333
You will not forestall my judgment.

1247
02:00:36,930 --> 02:00:38,680
Calypso.

1248
02:00:44,637 --> 02:00:46,746
She's taking us down.

1249
02:00:47,107 --> 02:00:49,277
Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all.

1250
02:01:26,479 --> 02:01:28,789
No. No. No!

1251
02:01:35,088 --> 02:01:37,638
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1252
02:01:39,425 --> 02:01:40,795
Don't leave me.

1253
02:01:43,563 --> 02:01:44,993
I won't leave you.

1254
02:01:55,842 --> 02:01:57,892
The Dutchman must have a captain.

1255
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:01,849
Hold on.

1256
02:02:57,136 --> 02:02:58,476
Thank goodness, Jack.

1257
02:02:58,738 --> 02:03:01,868
The armada is still out there.
Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard

1258
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:06,505
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1259
02:03:07,146 --> 02:03:09,425
I've never actually been
one for tradition.

1260
02:03:14,854 --> 02:03:17,374
Close haul her. Luff the sails
and lay her in irons.

1261
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:20,980
- Belay that. We'll be a sitting duck.
- Belay that "belay that."

1262
02:03:21,494 --> 02:03:24,804
- Captain... If we...
- Belay. Stow. Shut it.

1263
02:03:38,811 --> 02:03:40,710
What are they waiting for?

1264
02:03:41,881 --> 02:03:44,511
He expects us to honor our agreement.

1265
02:03:53,626 --> 02:03:57,436
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

1266
02:04:25,191 --> 02:04:26,561
She survived.

1267
02:04:52,986 --> 02:04:54,296
Ready on the guns.

1268
02:04:56,823 --> 02:04:58,113
Full canvas.

1269
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:01,182
Aye, full canvas.

1270
02:05:25,718 --> 02:05:27,208
Orders, sir.

1271
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:31,680
Sir!

1272
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:34,115
Captain.

1273
02:05:34,394 --> 02:05:36,264
- Fire.
- Fire!

1274
02:05:36,596 --> 02:05:37,646
Fire!

1275
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:40,233
- Fire!
- Fire all!

1276
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:53,350
Orders? Orders, sir?

1277
02:06:06,793 --> 02:06:07,933
What do you command?

1278
02:06:08,795 --> 02:06:09,815
It's just...

1279
02:06:12,165 --> 02:06:13,305
..good business.

1280
02:06:15,501 --> 02:06:16,671
Abandon ship!

1281
02:06:18,271 --> 02:06:20,081
All hands, abandon ship!

1282
02:07:46,526 --> 02:07:48,456
They're turning away.

1283
02:08:01,007 --> 02:08:02,347
Wind in your sails.

1284
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:09,559
Shiver me timbers.

1285
02:08:47,653 --> 02:08:49,203
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain?

1286
02:08:50,523 --> 02:08:53,393
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

1287
02:08:54,193 --> 02:08:55,363
Hooray!

1288
02:08:57,630 --> 02:08:59,000
Now go and get it.

1289
02:09:18,551 --> 02:09:19,631
Orders, sir?

1290
02:09:24,357 --> 02:09:26,577
You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman.

1291
02:09:26,959 --> 02:09:29,039
- You're free.
- Aye.

1292
02:09:30,663 --> 02:09:32,213
That's a fine thing, but...

1293
02:09:34,567 --> 02:09:38,407
..by my reckoning, I still have
a debt that has to be paid.

1294
02:09:39,005 --> 02:09:40,315
If you'll have me.

1295
02:09:44,810 --> 02:09:46,560
On the wheel then, Mr. Turner.

1296
02:09:48,147 --> 02:09:49,577
Aye, Captain Turner.

1297
02:10:04,864 --> 02:10:07,494
This ship has a purpose again.

1298
02:10:07,933 --> 02:10:11,853
And where we are bound,
she cannot come.

1299
02:10:13,372 --> 02:10:14,892
One day ashore.

1300
02:10:15,174 --> 02:10:16,954
Ten years at sea.

1301
02:10:18,544 --> 02:10:20,764
It's a steep price for what's been done.

1302
02:10:23,215 --> 02:10:25,025
Depends on the one day.

1303
02:10:27,887 --> 02:10:30,027
Your chariot awaits, your highness.

1304
02:10:34,393 --> 02:10:36,063
The oars are inside.

1305
02:10:47,907 --> 02:10:49,247
Mrs. Turner.

1306
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:55,960
Good-bye, poppet.

1307
02:11:02,521 --> 02:11:03,451
Jack.

1308
02:11:05,024 --> 02:11:07,654
It would never have
worked out between us.

1309
02:11:10,329 --> 02:11:12,608
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

1310
02:11:16,635 --> 02:11:17,805
Once is quite enough.

1311
02:11:20,272 --> 02:11:21,442
Thank you.

1312
02:11:41,427 --> 02:11:43,067
I'm going to need the other one.

1313
02:12:15,928 --> 02:12:17,008
It's nearly sunset.

1314
02:12:37,116 --> 02:12:38,486
It's always belonged to you.

1315
02:12:44,356 --> 02:12:45,585
Will you keep it safe?

1316
02:12:47,626 --> 02:12:48,676
Yes.

1317
02:12:52,998 --> 02:12:54,018
Yes.

1318
02:13:13,919 --> 02:13:14,849
Will!

1319
02:13:30,269 --> 02:13:31,999
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

1320
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:03,200
Granted it tends to list to port

1321
02:14:03,502 --> 02:14:06,632
and has been, on occasion,
known to frighten young women.

1322
02:14:07,139 --> 02:14:08,479
But I promise you,

1323
02:14:08,741 --> 02:14:10,911
you will not be disappointed.

1324
02:14:12,278 --> 02:14:13,148
Is that it?

1325
02:14:14,213 --> 02:14:15,263
The Black Pearl?

1326
02:14:16,615 --> 02:14:18,195
It's not very big.

1327
02:14:18,484 --> 02:14:19,914
Love, that is a dinghy.

1328
02:14:20,853 --> 02:14:24,803
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and huge-ish

1329
02:14:25,424 --> 02:14:27,414
and... gone.

1330
02:14:28,761 --> 02:14:29,751
Why is it gone?

1331
02:14:30,796 --> 02:14:31,816
Is that it there?

1332
02:14:33,699 --> 02:14:35,009
Yes, there itis.

1333
02:14:35,768 --> 02:14:36,998
Why is it there?

1334
02:14:38,771 --> 02:14:41,931
- It's much larger up close.
- You promised to take us for a ride.

1335
02:14:42,441 --> 02:14:44,021
Il was to be given the first ride.

1336
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:46,090
What? You?

1337
02:14:46,445 --> 02:14:48,934
- Not what he said.
- [ never!

1338
02:14:50,749 --> 02:14:52,089
Mr. Gibbs?

1339
02:14:52,351 --> 02:14:54,630
Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

1340
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:57,190
The ship? We're on the ship.

1341
02:15:00,359 --> 02:15:01,619
Jack!

1342
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:03,880
- The ship's gone!
- Really?

1343
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:09,179
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

1344
02:15:10,235 --> 02:15:11,165
Listen to me.

1345
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:14,390
Yes, I lied to you.
No, I don't love you.

1346
02:15:14,873 --> 02:15:17,713
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

1347
02:15:18,177 --> 02:15:21,076
It is pronounced "egregious."

1348
02:15:21,547 --> 02:15:24,887
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

1349
02:15:25,417 --> 02:15:27,287
All this pales to utter insignificance

1350
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:31,019
in light of the fact that my ship
is once again gone. Savvy?

1351
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:46,925
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

1352
02:15:51,176 --> 02:15:52,786
Tell me, ladies...

1353
02:15:53,078 --> 02:15:55,098
.. what do you know of sea turtles?

1354
02:15:55,514 --> 02:15:57,974
- Sea turtles?
- Let me tell you young ladies...

1355
02:16:10,429 --> 02:16:11,629
You want this?

1356
02:16:14,099 --> 02:16:17,609
That's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy. Yes, you are.

1357
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:20,280
- Yes, you are.
- Sir?

1358
02:16:21,707 --> 02:16:23,817
Some of the men
don't feel entirely settled

1359
02:16:24,176 --> 02:16:26,046
about leaving Captain Jack behind.

1360
02:16:26,378 --> 02:16:27,928
- Again.
- Again.

1361
02:16:28,213 --> 02:16:29,942
Is that so?

1362
02:16:30,249 --> 02:16:33,529
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes

1363
02:16:34,053 --> 02:16:36,333
if we could see that item
you told us about.

1364
02:16:36,722 --> 02:16:37,892
On the charts.

1365
02:16:38,123 --> 02:16:40,082
- Aye.
- With our own eyes.

1366
02:16:40,425 --> 02:16:43,905
To help put an ease to our
burden of guilt, so to speak.

1367
02:16:46,130 --> 02:16:48,501
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

1368
02:16:48,901 --> 02:16:51,360
There's more than one way
to live forever.

1369
02:16:51,770 --> 02:16:54,400
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.

1370
02:17:06,485 --> 02:17:07,975
Sparrow.

1371
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:42,990
We're devils and black sheep
Really bad eggs

1372
02:18:02,941 --> 02:18:04,991
Drink up me hearties
Yo ho

1373
02:26:37,322 --> 02:26:41,862
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate’s life for me

1374
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,750
We pillage, we plunder
We rifle and loot

1375
02:26:45,130 --> 02:26:47,179
Drink up me hearties
Yo ho

1376
02:26:47,532 --> 02:26:49,722
We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot

1377
02:26:50,101 --> 02:26:51,911
Drink up me hearties
Yo ho

1378
02:26:52,237 --> 02:26:54,456
Yo ho, yo ho

1379
02:26:54,839 --> 02:26:57,239
A pirate’s life for me
