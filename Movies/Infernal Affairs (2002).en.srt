00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,677
(Nirvana Sutra) Verse 19:

2
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,417
"The worst of the Eight Hells
is called Continuous Hell."

3
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,967
"It has the meaning of
Continuous Suffering. Thus the name."

4
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,095
I started this gang five years ago
on Tuen Mun island.

5
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,537
Back then we were only selling hashish.

6
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,462
We were full of ambition.

7
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,620
But after only a couple of weeks,

8
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,697
the cops started hunting us down.

9
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,460
Within one year,

10
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,770
six of our brothers died.

11
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,901
But Buddha spared me!

12
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:21,071
"What millions died
that Caesar might be great!"

13
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,846
But I don't believe in destiny.

14
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:31,443
We now have the power
to take fate in our own hands.

15
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,236
You are the youngest brothers in my gang

16
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,714
and you have clean records.

17
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,614
You can be my eyes and ears
in the police force.

18
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,171
OK.

19
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,765
Just never forget...

20
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,631
you're always working for me.

21
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,626
Bottoms up, "officers."

22
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,582
Cadet Yan, when you were debriefed
ten minutes ago,

23
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,521
tell me, how many files were on my desk?

24
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,854
Six, sir. Four beige on the left,
two red ones on the right.

25
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,075
Any observations about me?

26
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,798
Sorry to point this out, but...

27
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,084
you must have been in a hurry,
your socks don't match.

28
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,921
- Cadet Yan, you're dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

29
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,510
You owe me $500.

30
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,757
Here's a down payment.

31
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,441
Yan will be the perfect undercover cop.

32
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,245
(man) You're in cadet school now,
and you'll follow the rules.

33
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,818
You break the rules
and you're out, like him.

34
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,024
Expelled.

35
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,199
Who wants to be like ex-cadet Yan?

36
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,542
Ido.

37
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,293
(cadet school principal) Officer Yan,
your mission is to infiltrate the Triads.

38
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,652
Your records at the cadet school
no longer exist.

39
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,532
Only Superintendent Wong and!
will know your true identity.

40
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,612
This mission is highly dangerous.
Do you understand?

41
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,799
- Yes, sir.
- (siren)

42
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,021
(Yan) This job is killing me.

43
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,004
I'm either harassed by cops
or beaten up by gangsters.

44
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,748
Officer Lau. You're still a rookie.

45
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,274
Why do you think
you should get the promotion?

46
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,664
Just hang on?
How'd you like me to hang you?

47
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,603
l was at the top of my class,
and I'm deeply committed.

48
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,453
lam the best candidate for the job, sir.

49
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,958
Let's go.

50
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,761
Stand over there and say "cheese."

00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,681
- Hello?
- Yeah.

55
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,035
- Can I try this stereo?
- With what speakers?

56
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,522
I don't know. Any recommendations?

57
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,960
Here's a great tube amp from Hong Kong,
only ten grand.

58
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,974
And use this cheap cable. These sound
as good as expensive European amps.

59
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,668
Sweet high notes, crisp middle, deep bass.

60
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,545
In a word: excellent.

61
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,862
Here, take a seat.

(f "Forgotten Time" by Tsai Chin)

63
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,277
Let the sound take you away.

64
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,738
Feel that?

65
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,638
The voice drifts right through you.

66
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,824
Try this cable.

67
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,808
It's even better. Trust me.

68
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,142
(f "Forgotten Time" by Tsai Chin)

69
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,268
- Well?
- Much better.

70
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,893
Do I get a discount if buy the whole set?

71
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,793
Buy the amp here, but not the speakers.

72
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,613
They're cheaper at Cheung Wai's.

73
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:01,041
- Who should I ask for?
- Just tell them Yan sent you.

74
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,541
- Which one's mine?
- The middle copy.

75
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,560
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

76
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,947
- ls Cheung Wai's open yet?
- Sure.

77
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,233
You bastard. l asked you to watch
the store, not send customers away.

78
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,533
Your speakers are overpriced.

79
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,401
How else am I supposed to pay your boss
protection money?

80
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,810
You don't look poor to me.

81
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,606
- Hey, the cable.
- I'll bring it back.

82
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,925
I can't sell it after it's opened.

83
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,027
- Where are you going?
- A funeral.

84
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,357
Yan, you've been busted for assault
three times.

85
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,432
So I'm officially setting you up
with a departmental shrink.

86
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,233
You're much too involved with your role.

87
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,861
You're acting like a real criminal.
Have you forgotten you're a cop?

88
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:30,475
You told me it's only for three years.
But you extend it over and over.

89
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,073
I've been doing this shit for ten years.

90
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,487
You're the deepest agent we've got.

91
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,009
I'm the only one left
who knows your real identity.

92
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,445
I could erase your file
if you'd rather be a gangster.

93
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,351
What do you want me to do?
Never get my hands dirty?

94
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:57,402
That doesn't work for a gangster.
I might as well wear my badge!

95
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,901
- When will Sam place his order?
- Who knows.

96
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,310
- Sometime this week.
- What?

97
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,417
Sometime this week.

98
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:24,706
The Thais are here. Once we get
the drugs, they'll be put in the warehouse.

99
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,045
- Where is that?
- How the hell do I know?

100
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,069
Sam won't tell me that stuff yet.

101
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,834
- Yan, you can retire after this.
- Bullshit. I've heard that one before.

102
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,631
Crap, these lousy mikes again?

103
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,516
How am I supposed to conceal
this outdated piece of shit?

104
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,516
You'll find a way to hide it.

105
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,763
I'll stick it up my ass.

106
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,064
What's this, a camera?

107
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,074
How does it work?

108
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,901
It's real. It's for your birthday.

109
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,809
l hate watches.

110
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,918
- You arrested them?
- Yes.

111
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,234
But if we don't get something soon,
they'll have to be released.

112
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,725
Tea time.

113
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,471
- You want tea, boss?
- With milk, thanks.

114
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,414
(woman) He's been stonewalling us.

115
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,280
(man) We need to get something
before his attorney arrives.

116
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,558
I'm not talking without my lawyer.

117
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,723
lam your attorney.
Have you said anything?

118
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,318
Nothing at all.

119
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:13,420
That's good. You should tell me now
if you mentioned any names.

120
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,814
Brother Mo told me to ask you
if your family needs any help.

121
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,430
Don't get nervous. They can't record
anything while a lawyer is present.

122
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,093
Brother Mo sent you?

123
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,514
Those two kids next door
squealed on the hideout already.

124
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,289
The cops are on their way.

125
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,608
I know Brother Mo
told you not to say anything.

126
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,970
But he needs to be warned.
I don't know his emergency number.

127
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,655
Here.

128
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,268
- What now?
- That's it.

129
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,485
It will set off an alarm. You better be right.

130
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,887
OK. Don't worry.

131
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,722
I'll see if l can bail you out.

132
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,497
Take care.

133
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,399
Remember, don't talk to any of the police.

134
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,029
I won't say a word.

135
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,423
- Fanny!
- Yes?

136
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,671
Here.

137
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,217
- Track this number.
- Sure.

138
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,732
This is Mo's hideout.

139
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,311
711 Cheung Fai Road, second floor.

140
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:09,167
To all cars: 711 Cheung Fai Road,
second floor. OK.

141
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:10,889
(Fanny) Boss.

142
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,563
- All set.
- Smart guy.

143
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,553
- Where's my tea?
- Here.

144
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,682
Thanks.

145
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,208
That was great.
l had no idea you were a lawyer.

146
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,388
(phone rings)

147
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,531
Thanks.

148
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,835
Hello, yes.

149
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,459
Sure, no problem.

150
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,429
Listen up. We're on another case.
Overtime tonight.

151
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,928
(Wong) Our target is a major drug cartel.

152
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:59,307
In one hour they'll be doing a deal
with a Thai seller.

153
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,546
Cash will be handed over
in the building across the street.

154
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,994
But the delivery location of the goods
is still unknown.

155
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,680
CIB will tag the target and tap their phones.

156
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:21,985
We won't take action until our mole
has identified the delivery location.

157
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,212
Let's take a look at our targets.

158
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:32,674
Our principal stars tonight
are Boss Sam, Yan and Del Piero.

159
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:41,014
It's taken a long time to get close,
so we'd better nail them tonight.

160
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,333
OK? Let's go.

161
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,876
Sorry for the short notice.

162
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:06,596
- But we're keeping a tight lid on this one.
- You think he has cops on his payroll?

163
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,049
- He's always a step ahead.
- Hello, Mom?

164
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,378
Pass the phone to Mom.

165
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,672
I can't make it to dinner.

166
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,581
Too bad. It's too late
to cancel with our Thai friends.

167
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,766
- You're so relaxed.
- The calm before the storm and all that.

168
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,146
Sorry.

169
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:58,381
We're monitoring all the area's cell phones.

170
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,260
SP Wong.

171
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,213
- SP Wong, which channel?
- 454870.

172
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,203
Get ready. They're pulling up.

173
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,573
Give me your cell phones.

174
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,154
You two, watch the car.

175
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,243
Wait.

176
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,013
Yan.

177
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,638
Bring the Thais in here.

178
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,407
You two, follow me.

179
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,687
(phone beeps)

180
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,307
- Lau.
- Yes.

181
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,499
- Did Sam's gang make any calls?
- No. They probably changed phones.

182
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,307
Let's scan for any calls
made from this area.

183
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,303
Scanning.

184
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,939
6,500 cell phones are active
in this area right now.

185
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,755
267 cell phones are making calls
on this street alone.

186
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,755
Give me a minute.

187
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,580
- Good work.
- Thank you.

188
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,230
(Fanny, speaking through fixed smile)
They're looking this way.

189
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,704
Are those two watching us?

190
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,986
- Which two?
- Those two.

191
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:27,909
- No one's watching us.
- Those two making out over there.

192
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,811
They're making out.
You think they'd rather watch you?

193
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,907
- Watch the door.
- Yep, we see him.

194
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,784
Boss. They're here.

195
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,541
(Sam) Hey, man!

196
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,423
- What's up?
- How are you?

197
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,928
Cigar?

198
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,643
Any good?

199
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,038
The best.

200
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,193
- You like our weather?
- Very cold.

201
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,739
I knew you'd say that!

202
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,536
(Sam laughs)

203
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,261
Thais can't take the cold.

204
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,664
This is nothing.

205
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,720
A-1.

206
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,272
You got a deal!

207
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,859
(phone rings)

208
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,578
License plate number HN397 is taking off.

209
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:17,308
Repeat. Helen Nelson 397 is taking off.

210
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,042
Should we tail them?

211
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,995
Elephant, follow car number one.

212
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,725
Roger. Follow him.

213
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,399
Piero, you're being tailed.
Lead them in circles.

214
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,297
They know our channel.

215
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,132
Switch to a new one.

216
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,327
Sam, what's going on?

217
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,828
Don't worry. Take it easy.

218
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,624
Take care of the Thais for me.

219
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,334
(phone rings)

220
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,701
Excuse me.

221
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,755
Yes?

222
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,280
Use the walkie-talkies.
We switched channels.

223
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,003
Are you finished?

224
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,724
- 45...
- Shut up!

225
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,367
Piero, are you being tailed?

226
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,705
Keep circling.

227
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,300
Cheung.

228
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,258
Use the old channel to tell them
we're aborting the mission.

229
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,225
Yes, sir.

230
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,906
Elephant, abort. Return to the station.

231
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,637
(man) Roger.

232
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,089
All clear.

233
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,767
What's going on?
Our guys are freezing out there.

234
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,326
What's so funny?

235
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,412
l speak Thai. l know what they're saying.

236
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:10,628
Oh, yeah?

237
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:15,403
Yeah. They're complaining
about their jobs.

238
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,447
What exactly?

239
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,139
Their guys at Lung Koo Ray
are freezing to death.

240
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,610
They think this is cold.

241
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,515
That's right. You're sharp.

242
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,646
(whispering)

243
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,286
(amplified tapping)

244
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,617
Cheung, order all cars to Lung Koo Ray.

245
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,042
Boss, I see them.

246
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,057
Tell Keung to check the goods.
And make sure no one is around.

247
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,626
Not a soul.

248
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:38,137
(over radio) Sam's men are here.
They're checking the goods.

249
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,312
Yo, the coke is all here!

250
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,812
Don't be an idiot.

251
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,449
- Boss.
- [heard.

252
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,268
Tell Keung to shout out
that the cocaine is his.

253
00:27:56,475 --> 00:28:00,695
Keung, the Boss wants you
to shout out the cocaine is yours.

254
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,801
The cocaine is yours.

255
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,385
Take delivery.

256
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,530
(tapping)

257
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,723
They're making the exchange. Get ready.

258
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,188
- We're good.
- Give it to them.

259
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,708
Stand by.

260
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,723
Wait until they step on land.

261
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,330
SEND MESSAGE ALL

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,939
Wait.

266
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,141
THERE'S A MOLE - ABORT.

267
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,473
(dials)

268
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,604
- (Sam) Throw it overboard! Now!

269
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:20,858
Keung, ditch the shit!

270
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,179
Police. Freeze.

271
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,506
(shouting and confusion over the radio)

272
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,013
Hurry! Toss it!

273
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,993
Go! Go!

274
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,326
Dump it all!

275
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,568
We got the men, but lost the goods.
It's all in the water.

276
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,930
Team seven, hold it. Hold it.

277
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,739
Everyone, follow me.

278
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,028
3G
What are you looking at?

279
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,186
Boss, let's...

280
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,462
Police. Police. Don't move.

281
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,460
Sam.

282
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,646
- That looks good.
- Not bad.

283
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,003
Seems you were right.
Your boys were only strolling on the beach.

284
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,067
- So they can go now?
- Sure, anytime.

285
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,320
Or they can join you here for supper.

286
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:05,297
You haven't had us over for some time.
I'm surprised it's not poisoned.

287
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,077
There's always dessert, you know.

288
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:13,774
I'll pass. But I feel bad
that you prepared all this for nothing.

289
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:19,196
And I feel bad that this meal cost you
people a couple hundred grand tonight.

290
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,826
You think planting a mole
will take us down?

291
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,419
You think so too.

292
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,776
There's an old story.

293
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,205
Two guys need kidney transplants,

294
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,424
but only one is available.

295
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,066
So they play a game.

296
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,449
They each put a playing card
into the other's pocket.

297
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:20,455
Whoever guesses
the card in his own pocket wins.

298
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,384
You know I can see your card.

299
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,078
I know yours too.

300
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,588
- I'll beat you.
- We'll see.

301
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,608
- Well, we'll be more careful.
- Me too.

302
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,726
I'm sure you realize,

303
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,394
the game's loser dies.

304
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,645
Then you're dead already.

305
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,252
Ever seen someone
shake a corpse's hand?

306
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,911
Let's go.

307
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,107
Next to the couch.

308
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,190
- Mary?
- What?

309
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:36,446
- What's the decorator's number?
- The interior designer? 9025 5047.

310
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:41,478
Now I lost count. Where was I?

311
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,357
24.

312
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,834
- 24? Are you sure?
- Positive.

313
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,290
- Give me the phone.
- Coming.

314
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,774
(phone rings)

315
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,764
Hello?

316
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:00,313
Who is it?

317
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,629
- Hello?
- It's me.

318
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:07,308
Hi. I'm moving in.
Don't eavesdrop. It's police business.

319
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,783
I lost my goods.

320
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,996
- Find me this mole.
- Hold on, I'll go outside.

321
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,951
- [ don't have access to undercover files.
- [ don't care how difficult it is.

322
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,634
l only know he uses Morse code.

323
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:35,051
Give me all the information
on your people from last night.

324
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:40,283
Their real names, ID numbers,
bank accounts, et cetera.

325
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,432
- Bring it to the theater tonight.
- OK.

326
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,971
What's up?

327
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,445
It's 29.

328
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:59,125
- 28
- 29.

329
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:03,304
Not the boxes.
I know what my next novel will be about.

330
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,699
- Aman with 28 personalities.
- Your mother?

331
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,910
- Don't joke.
- I'll stop.

332
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,012
Think about it. A man with 28 personalities.

333
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,082
The second he wakes up,
he could be anybody.

334
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,712
He starts to forget which one
is the real him.

335
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,212
- Creepy, right?
- Very creepy.

336
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,004
- You like it?
- Yeah, a bestseller, for sure.

337
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:27,531
- Hold on.
- What?

338
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,122
- Why's the chair so big?
- Which one?

339
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,712
I must have messed up the measurements.

340
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,529
(she groans)

341
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,314
Take it easy. You get so carried away.

342
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,450
Let's see. Maybe we can make it fit.

343
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,770
Relax.

344
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,724
(Yan) Meet up? You want me dead?

345
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:55,677
One of your officers is a mole.
Find him, then we'll meet.

346
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,368
I can't help you.

347
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,974
It's impossible.

348
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,523
What? Later.

349
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,109
I just can't talk right now.

350
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,392
l have an appointment.

351
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,418
I'm seeing your damn shrink!

352
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,679
(clock ticks)

353
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,390
(alarm beeps)

354
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,188
This chair is... incredible.

355
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,826
I'll tell you where you can get one.

356
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,640
So you don't have to waste your time
coming here.

357
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,479
It's more comfortable here.

358
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,098
Don't be so mean.

359
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,130
If it weren't for me,
for the past four months...

360
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,150
You'd have no time to play video games.

361
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,500
It's been five months.

362
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,150
Pretty soon your mandatory "therapy"
will end.

363
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,319
Then you can sleep at home.

364
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:38,942
So soon?

365
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,585
You don't see any improvements?

366
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,808
Can't you prolong my treatment?

367
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:51,287
I've started getting migraines.
Might be schizophrenia.

368
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:55,574
Therapy doesn't cure headaches.
I'll prescribe some aspirin.

369
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,417
Actually, l do want to ask you something.

370
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,394
It's kind of embarrassing.

371
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,150
What do you think of me?

372
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,837
Do you think I'm a good guy or a bad guy?

373
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,231
l hardly know you at all.

374
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:29,774
If l tell you something,
will you keep it a secret?

375
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,238
I'm a cop.

376
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,115
Soaml.

377
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,634
OK, I'll see you next week.
Try to remember your dreams.

378
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,942
Of course.

379
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,694
I'll dream of you.

380
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,147
See you next week.

381
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,424
Just aspirin, that's all?

382
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,382
Bye-bye.

383
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,929
You're going to get promoted.

384
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:25,836
You'll work for Internal Affairs,
but you'll stay at OCTB.

385
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,712
Why?

386
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,818
Sam has a mole in the department.

387
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,954
- want you to find him.
- Why me?

388
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,931
We've vetted all candidates.

389
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:43,745
You have an immaculate record.
You did a great job at CIB.

390
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:48,643
Working in IA puts you in touch
with senior officials.

391
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,399
It's a great opportunity.

392
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,563
I can already tell

393
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,629
you're going to be a great addition.

394
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:03,384
- When will l meet the Board?
- lam the Board.

395
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,952
Come on, take a swing.

396
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,353
Thanks.

397
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,508
By the way, how's the wedding coming?

398
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:19,949
Everything's on schedule.

399
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:24,227
That's great.
Marriage will improve your stability.

400
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,719
As well as your image.

401
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,741
You'll get promoted faster.

402
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,602
Time to broaden your horizons.

403
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,268
(Keung) Use your real name.

404
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:41,753
That is my real name.
You know my name is Del Piero.

405
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,610
Really?

406
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,093
What's going on?

407
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,405
The Boss told us to fill out these forms.

408
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:02,392
Must be setting up mutual provident funds
for us. You know, MPF.

409
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,206
You don't know how to spell "bodyguard"?

410
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:10,692
- What, this isn't right?
- Not even close.

411
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,701
- That's how you spell it.
- All right, professor.

412
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,401
(woman's singing)

413
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,843
I'm getting a shipment in.

414
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,079
They're watching.

415
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,518
Do what you need to do.

416
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,866
But get this mole.

417
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,636
I don't have access.
I can't arouse suspicion.

418
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,680
So you're not worried about me,

419
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,990
you're worried about yourself,
Inspector Lau.

420
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,633
God, these girls are ugly.

421
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:30,042
I'll take care of it.

422
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,579
(phone rings)

423
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,272
Hello?

424
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,844
I'm coming.

425
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,093
Yan.

426
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:28,823
- How long have you been with me?
- Over three years.

427
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,400
That long? Time flies.

428
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,673
l have another shipment next week.

429
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:42,252
But this time, I'm using some new faces.

430
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,047
You guys can rest.

431
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,462
- Even Keung?
- Keung?

432
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,745
He's nuts, you know.

433
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:11,062
So you've heard about this cop mole?

434
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,925
What should we do?

435
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,094
- I'll take care of it.
- You will?

436
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,999
I'll find out who he is in a couple of days.
Be ready.

437
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,305
Yan.

438
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,136
I trust you the most of all.

439
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,713
(Wong) Lau, come here.

440
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:24,083
No, thanks.

441
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:32,379
- Pretty tense.
- Just think of them as old friends.

442
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:36,477
They're not so friendly right now.

443
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,349
They know you're here to dig out the mole.

444
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:44,249
What do you want from them,
a standing ovation?

445
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:47,292
They're all under the microscope.

446
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:50,282
They want it to be over more than we do.

447
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,341
Just tell me who's first on the list.

448
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,036
OK. Any clues?

449
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:01,098
Two days ago my guy
almost caught the mole.

450
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:05,775
He lost him. But when Sam gets another
shipment, he'll have to make contact again.

451
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,169
Stay on Sam and we'll find the mole.

452
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:13,094
- Why do they need me?
- Don't say that.

453
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,807
Division sent you because
they have confidence in you.

454
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,923
Not everyone can handle IA cases.

455
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,569
It's stuffy in here. Let's get some air.

456
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:23,895
You want coffee? I'll pour you a cup.

457
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:30,483
(types)

458
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:52,973
Two days ago,
my guy almost caught the mole.

459
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:56,754
Stay on Sam and we'll find the mole.

460
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,317
NO MATCH

461
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:28,624
CLASSIFIED

462
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,826
MORSE CODE

463
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,986
CALL ME WHEN BED ARRIVES.
DO YOU MISS ME? SEE YOU LATER.

464
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:06,806
- Yes?
- (Lau) The bed has arrived.

465
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,781
Is that so? Comfortable?

466
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:13,304
- You want to try it out?
- [have work to do.

467
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:18,209
All work and no play...

468
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,962
- No, I can't.
- Come on.

469
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:24,225
How about next Saturday? I'm free then.

470
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:27,792
OK. It's up to you.

471
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,143
- Up already?
- Yes.

472
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,243
We just "tested" the bed
and you're back at work?

473
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,103
I'm very hardworking.

474
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:45,375
- What are you writing now?
- Here.

475
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,817
I'm getting worried. My main character
is turning out to be pathetic.

476
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:52,424
Pathetic?

477
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:57,703
He needs to be happier.
Maybe I should turn him into a good guy.

478
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:03,343
I mean, he's good, but he does bad things.
How does something like that end?

479
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:09,315
Good question. I'll leave it up to the genius.

480
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,547
- Come back to bed.
- Help me with the ending.

481
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:17,674
- lL can't.
- Then go back to sleep, old man.

482
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,156
(dials)

483
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:38,275
From now on you follow SP Wong
around the clock.

484
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:47,299
- [know how to spot an undercover cop.
- How?

485
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:52,208
If he's watching you,
but pretending to do something else,

486
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,393
then he's a cop.

487
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:16,674
Is that so?

488
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,117
- Then everybody's a cop.
- They're everywhere.

489
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,833
(men talking)

490
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,833
Yan.

491
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:32,924
Boss.

492
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,840
- Watching something?
- You're a cop.

493
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:49,869
Huh?

494
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:52,314
We're playing "find the cop."

495
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,887
Good luck.

496
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:59,324
- I'm going for a massage. Wanna come?
- Forget it.

497
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:01,583
Don't tell.

498
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,863
- You're a cop.
- Shut up.

499
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:16,136
- What a coincidence.
- Just shopping in the old neighborhood.

500
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,844
Haven't seen you for ages.

501
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,306
Almost seven years.

502
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:26,834
- How are you?
- Married. And you?

503
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:30,811
Still doing the same...?

504
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,060
Mommy.

505
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:43,020
- Your daughter?
- Yes.

506
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:47,032
- How old is she?
- She's five.

507
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,868
I've got to meet my husband, so...

508
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,480
I'll see you around.

509
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:57,412
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

510
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,714
Mommy. I'm six!

511
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,627
Sorry, Mommy always forgets.

512
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,801
- Where are you now?
- On my way.

513
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,638
(phone rings)

514
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:56,299
- Hello?
- Boss, he's taking the subway.

515
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,976
Keep on him.

516
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,215
(dials)

517
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,510
Boss, he's gone to the 24th floor.

518
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,289
Don't move until I tell you.

519
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,263
(dials)

520
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,250
Boss, we've got him.

521
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:50,628
Don't know yet.
But I know where he is now.

522
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,604
Keep watch over here.

523
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:17,583
(Wong) What's the word, Yan?

524
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,715
A shipment's coming in next week.
Time and location still unknown.

525
00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:25,958
I don't know who Sam's mole is,
but he's confident he can find me.

526
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:29,458
In that case...

527
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,688
- We'd better get out.
- Are you kidding?

528
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:41,982
I don't want you getting killed.

529
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,721
(phone rings)

530
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,811
Hello?

531
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:50,473
Boss said he found the mole.
He told us to take care of him.

532
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,613
I'll be right there.

533
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,475
(phone rings)

534
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:17,444
Hello? Find SP Wong!

535
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,272
You two, take the stairs.

536
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:37,586
Keung, take the elevator.

537
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,627
- (Yan) Anyone know about our meeting?
- No.

538
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:43,511
Sam's men are downstairs.

539
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:09,678
(gun being cocked)

540
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,320
Hey, what are you doing? Put it away.

541
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,790
(footsteps)

542
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:41,556
- Take the window-washing crane.
- What about you?

543
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:44,292
I'll take the elevator. (taps gun)

544
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,605
Be careful.

545
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,271
Yan.

546
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,500
Nothing.

547
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:21,900
(dials)

548
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:29,337
(ting)

549
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:33,084
Darling, the apartment is superb.

550
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,083
A 180-degree window
facing the golf course.

551
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,846
Plus club membership and...

552
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:47,411
Superintendent Wong.

553
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,180
Drive around to the main entrance.

554
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,269
(musical interlude)

555
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:54,038
Any observations about me?

556
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:02,246
It's real, It's for your birthday.

557
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:24,986
Let's go. Police! Let's go!

558
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,788
Boss. SP Wong is down!

559
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,367
(newsreader) Shots rang out
in Sheung Wan this afternoon,

560
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,460
leaving three people dead
and several others wounded.

561
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:02,991
Police confirmed one of the dead
was OCTB Superintendent Wong.

562
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:06,736
Details are sketchy, but it appears to be
a case of gang warfare.

563
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:10,087
Triads in southern Kowloon
are suspected.

564
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:14,183
The police chief
expressed his condolences

565
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,451
and pledged to swiftly solve the case.

566
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:20,205
(Keung) That was a close one.

567
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:23,727
Ten minutes after you left,
Boss told us to get ready.

568
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:30,282
l was scared shitless.
You know, I can't stand violence.

569
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,752
But this was serious stuff.

570
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:38,151
I just wanted to run away.

571
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:46,325
Two days ago, Boss invited me
into his room.

572
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,129
He asked me how long I'd worked for him.

573
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,102
I couldn't even remember.

574
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:57,719
So he says, "Keung,
it's been five years already."

575
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,601
"And you've always been loyal."

576
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:04,825
"l have a question for you."

577
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:09,725
"If one of our brothers is a mole,
would you be able to take him out?"

578
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:14,223
Of course I said "yes" to his face.
I'm no idiot!

579
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,023
(coughs)

580
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:22,221
It's just as well no one found the mole.

581
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,714
That Wong guy was tough.

582
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:31,580
They dragged him upstairs
and beat him for ten minutes.

583
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,108
Ten long minutes.

584
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:40,291
Ten long minutes.

585
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,020
He didn't make a peep.

586
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,979
(horn blares)

587
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:50,992
Keung.

588
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:57,092
Boss said the cops were hot on his trail.

589
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:03,243
And whoever didn't show up today
is the mole.

590
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:08,298
I didn't tell him you went for a massage.

591
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:13,283
If he knew, you'd be dead.

592
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,845
Yan, I want to ask you something.

593
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,035
Is your masseuse pretty?

594
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,273
Because...

595
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:29,576
if she's a pig, it's not worth it.

596
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:32,564
(coughs)

597
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:36,783
Get out of here.

598
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,540
Cops'll be here any minute.

599
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:45,739
Remember this.

600
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,067
If you see someone watching you,

601
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,124
but pretending...

602
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,891
to do something else,

603
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:00,926
they're a cop.

604
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,611
(Keung stops breathing)

605
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,486
(horn blares)

606
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:50,416
(man) Closed circuit TV shows us
SP Wong entered the building at 4:15pm.

607
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:53,584
The suspects entered 20 minutes later.

608
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:58,381
At 4:38pm
we received Inspector Lau's report.

609
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:04,397
Eight minutes before we arrived,
a body fell off the building.

610
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:07,372
It was SP Wong.

611
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:11,607
All the suspects killed or injured
belong to Sam's gang.

612
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:15,688
Many others got away.

613
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:19,286
Do you know why
SP Wong went to that building?

614
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,849
Not sure. I had CIB following him.

615
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:28,329
Why was CIB following him?

616
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:30,698
That's IA's business.

617
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,707
Now that SP Wong is dead,
it is OCTB's business.

618
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,320
What kind of attitude is that?

619
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,802
SP Wong was a loyal man
and you investigated him?

620
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:41,057
- What kind of attitude is that?
- You have to let us do our jobs.

621
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:44,214
You screwed up
or SP Wong wouldn't be dead.

622
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:47,001
- I'm talking business here.
- And I'm getting personal.

623
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,386
Nobody wanted this, OK?

624
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,578
Sorry, sir.

625
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,828
It was my negligence.

626
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,425
I'm just as angry as you. Sorry.

627
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,820
SP Wong has a file
on our undercover officer in Sam's gang.

628
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:19,785
But it's locked with a password.
The technical staff can't open it.

629
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:24,803
Inspector Lau.
Work with CIB to decode it.

630
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:28,308
Find our man and get him out of there.
OK?

631
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,726
And also...

632
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,918
SP Wong was a good cop.

633
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:38,407
We'll give him a hero's funeral.

634
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:41,702
- OK?
- (all) Yes, sir.

635
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,761
(phone rings)

636
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:57,481
Boss, you went overboard this time.

637
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:01,165
He was getting too close.
It was either him or me.

638
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:04,611
I'm in charge here now. I can make
your next transaction go smoothly.

639
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:09,120
No need. We got the goods
when they killed the cop today.

640
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,870
A nice distraction, eh?

641
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:02,934
(phone switches on)

642
01:10:04,267 --> 01:10:06,347
(phone rings)

643
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,531
(phone rings)

644
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,000
(snaps phone shut)

645
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,124
(dials)

646
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,427
(phone rings)

647
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:51,454
(tapping of Morse code)

648
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,900
(phone rings)

649
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,080
(Yan) Why are you calling me?

650
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:26,911
It's really you.

651
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:31,658
- Who are you?
- Inspector Lau at OCTB.

652
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,596
Maybe you should come home.

653
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:42,166
l have unfinished business.

654
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:45,922
SP Wong wouldn't want you
to take the law into your own hands.

655
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,952
What do you want?

656
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:51,422
Cooperation.

657
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:02,265
(newsreader) Police have discovered
the body of a fugitive suspect

658
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:07,255
involved in the Sheung Wan shootout
earlier today,

659
01:12:07,957 --> 01:12:11,997
and have confirmed the body
is that of undercover cop Keung.

660
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,527
The OCTB have expressed
their condolences

661
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:16,204
and have promised
a thorough investigation.

662
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:17,425
Boss, Yan is back.

663
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:20,443
Three vehicles collided
in Yuen Long today.

664
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:24,303
One driver was trapped
until firefighters arrived.

665
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,290
- Boss.
- Yan.

666
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:34,464
I took care of Keung.

667
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:37,001
Did he know about the warehouse?

668
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,617
We could have problems if he did.

669
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:51,146
(man) Boss.

670
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,887
- We're still being followed.
- Keep circling around.

671
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:57,233
(man) Spread the word.
Make sure the others know.

672
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,818
Inspector Cheung.

673
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:11,515
Tell our guys to drop the tail on Sam.

674
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:18,025
He's headed to the warehouse,
but he'll change course

675
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,536
if he thinks he's being tailed.

676
01:13:23,266 --> 01:13:25,545
Just call them off.
Do it for SP Wong if not for me.

677
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:27,775
I need your help.

678
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:30,781
Tell them!

679
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,223
This isn't my case.

680
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:36,156
I'm not getting involved.

681
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:39,599
If you want something, talk to them.

682
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:43,143
I know you blame me for SP Wong's death.

683
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:46,482
But I'm a cop just like you.
And I want to solve this case!

684
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,960
And get promoted too?

685
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,277
I got a tip from Wong's mole.

686
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:58,072
Don't you want the chance
to finish the job that SP Wong started?

687
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:01,542
Huh?

688
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:38,045
Update.

689
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:49,287
Attention: target vehicle
on Highway Number Three.

690
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,040
U-turn at Pier Number Three
to Lung Cheung Road.

691
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:16,541
Targets arrived and are on their way
up to the car park,

692
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:38,835
Hey, Lau. I'm not supposed
to be on this case.

693
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:42,231
It's your ass if this thing crashes.

694
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:50,398
They're loading up at 4P.
Elephant, stand by at exit 3P.

695
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:54,723
Double 8, stand by at entrance 2P.
Fishball, Cheung, stand by here.

696
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,867
- Everyone wait for my signal.
- (voices over radio) Yes, sir.

697
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,948
Hey, Boss told me to stay behind.
Drop me here.

698
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,803
- Go! Go!
- Police!

699
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:52,329
(shouting)

700
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:07,291
Run them over.

701
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,148
(sirens)

702
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,489
(phone rings, echoing)

703
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:51,575
(ringing stops)

704
01:17:57,573 --> 01:17:59,353
My master always said...

705
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,925
"What millions died
that Caesar might be great."

706
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:07,823
But you can choose your own future.

707
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,690
(gunshot)

708
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,453
(body hits water)

709
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:24,281
I've chosen.

710
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:03,976
Here's some coffee.

711
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:13,166
He's been waiting.

712
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,790
So it's you?

713
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:31,057
- How's the stereo?
- Pretty good.

714
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:35,543
The tubes have to warm up.
After ten minutes they sound great.

715
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:38,695
- Should I salute you?
- Forget it.

716
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,069
How long have you been undercover?

717
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:45,891
Been with Sam three years.
A few others before him.

718
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:50,318
- Altogether, it's been ten years.
- Ten years? I should salute you instead.

719
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:54,019
I just want my life back.
I want to be normal.

720
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,797
Had enough?

721
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:00,883
If you've never been a mole
you can't understand.

722
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,710
Too bad I couldn't find Sam's mole.
I'd like to take him down.

723
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:17,140
It's over now.
Let me give you back your identity.

724
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,269
I'd open your file,
but no one knows the password.

725
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:25,622
It's Morse code for "undercover."

726
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:29,355
That's it?

727
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:17,306
You're telling me
you can't spell "bodyguard"?

728
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:20,933
- What, this isn't right?
- Not even close.

729
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,125
DELETE

730
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:54,643
EMPTY PROTECTED FILE

731
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,831
Dr. Lee.

732
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:38,607
- [didn't think you'd come.
- You're wanted by the police.

733
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,885
It's not what it looks like.

734
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:43,951
Let's talk upstairs.

735
01:23:47,623 --> 01:23:51,053
You told me you were a cop. Is that true?

736
01:23:51,994 --> 01:23:55,273
It's true. But I can't prove it.

737
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:02,596
What's your plan?

738
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:06,038
Don't have one. Still thinking.

739
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,758
I just wanted to tell you something.

740
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:26,325
Though it's embarrassing.

741
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:34,027
Remember I said I dreamt about you?

742
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,276
It's true.

743
01:24:43,879 --> 01:24:46,159
Me too.

744
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:32,734
REMEMBER MY SECRET.
DON'T TELL ANYONE.

745
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:51,141
Mary.

746
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,230
What's the matter? Is it broken?

747
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:04,507
(music)

748
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:07,616
This morning, a guy from
the electronics store came by.

749
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:09,843
He tuned it up.

750
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,633
He left a CD for you.

751
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:17,520
I listened to it.

752
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:26,018
Have you eaten yet? I'll get you something.

753
01:26:27,449 --> 01:26:29,499
Iced tea?

754
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:31,991
A snack?

755
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:34,404
Sure.

756
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,514
I can't finish my story.

757
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,704
Unless I know if the lead is good or bad.

758
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:04,949
He has to make up his mind.

759
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:08,050
(on CD) I'm getting a shipment in.

760
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:10,267
They're watching.

761
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,705
Do what you need to do.

762
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:15,340
But get this mole.

763
01:27:16,298 --> 01:27:18,728
! don't have access.
! can't arouse suspicion.

764
01:27:19,134 --> 01:27:21,854
So you're not worried about me,

765
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:24,144
you're worried about yourself,
Inspector Lau.

766
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:34,684
Voices crisp enough?
That recording was from Sam's office.

767
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,280
There are plenty more like it.

768
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,696
Don't threaten me. What do you want?

769
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:42,105
l want my identity back.

770
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:45,327
3pm, Central Ferry Pier. Keep your cell on.

771
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:12,750
The number you have dialed can't be
connected, Please leave a message.

772
01:28:14,923 --> 01:28:17,583
Mary, I'm sorry.

773
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:19,959
You didn't hear the whole story.

774
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,168
I've chosen to be the good guy.

775
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:25,281
No matter what,
I'm going to do the right thing.

776
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:27,817
I need you to believe in me.

777
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:31,830
Believe that I'm the good guy.

778
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:49,788
- By the book.
- Lalso went to cadet school.

779
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:55,791
Do all undercover cops like rooftops?

780
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:02,473
Unlike you, I'm not afraid of the light.

781
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:05,651
Where's my file?

782
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,677
You have nothing for me either.

783
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:17,038
So what are we gonna do?
Did we come up here to sunbathe?

784
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:21,907
We need to talk.

785
01:30:22,317 --> 01:30:24,247
What for?

786
01:30:25,654 --> 01:30:27,964
I'm not the same man.

787
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,635
I've turned over a new leaf.

788
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:37,216
Good.

789
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:40,009
Tell it to the judge.

790
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,745
Maybe he'll give you a break.

791
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,760
Why not kill me?

792
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:49,472
No way. I'm a cop.

793
01:30:49,878 --> 01:30:51,718
Are you?

794
01:31:07,729 --> 01:31:09,779
Freeze, police!

795
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,061
Drop your weapon
and let Inspector Lau go.

796
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,330
Your boss is Sam's mole. I have evidence.

797
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:17,644
Let's clear this up at the station.

798
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:19,736
Drop it. Drop it, now.

799
01:31:20,075 --> 01:31:22,245
- Cops are on their way.
- [don't trust you.

800
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:25,130
I don't care.

801
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:37,947
(sirens)

802
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:49,791
You'll never make it out.

803
01:31:50,205 --> 01:31:52,785
Don't shoot your boss.

804
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:04,989
(ting)

805
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,941
(gun blast)

806
01:32:13,895 --> 01:32:16,705
(music)

807
01:32:36,451 --> 01:32:40,201
You are my eyes inside the police force.

808
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:44,137
Bottoms up, "officers."

809
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:49,485
It's OK. We're brothers.

810
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:53,519
Now that Sam's dead...

811
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,893
you don't have to worry.

812
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,278
(gunshots)

813
01:33:03,278 --> 01:33:08,818
l infiltrated in 1994.
But my career never really took off.

814
01:33:09,651 --> 01:33:11,760
Sam looked down on me.

815
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,170
I got rid of Sam's tapes.

816
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:17,332
I'm your man from now on.

817
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:21,813
Cops'll be here any minute.
Let's give 'em a good show.

818
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,016
I'm actually pretty smart.

819
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:32,711
Too bad Sam never knew that.

820
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:37,129
(gunshots)

821
01:33:39,314 --> 01:33:40,894
Shots fired.

822
01:33:43,718 --> 01:33:45,768
(gunshots)

823
01:33:51,693 --> 01:33:53,713
(ting)

824
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:14,402
I'm a cop.

825
01:34:40,108 --> 01:34:42,278
Six months later,
Yan's psychiatrist, Dr. Lee,

826
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:44,757
uncovered personal files
of the former cadet headmaster

827
01:34:45,113 --> 01:34:47,333
and proved Yan's police identity.

828
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:55,191
(bagpipes)

829
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,466
(breathes shakily)

830
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:36,621
I'll dream of you, Officer Yan.

831
01:36:14,402 --> 01:36:17,502
You break the rules
and you're out, like him.

832
01:36:18,006 --> 01:36:20,026
Expelled.

833
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:22,305
Who wants to be like ex-cadet Yan?

834
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:31,353
Ido.

835
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:42,924
Says the Buddha: "He who is
in Continuous Hell never dies."

836
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:45,961
"Longevity is a big hardship
in Continuous Hell."
