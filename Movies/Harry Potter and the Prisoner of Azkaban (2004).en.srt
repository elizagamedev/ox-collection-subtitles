1
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,588
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,566
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,422
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,566
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,437
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,468
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,583
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,759
Marge. How lovely to see--

9
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,170
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:55,918
What is it?

11
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,119
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,892
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,318
I will if she does.

14
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,537
-Oh, you're still here, are you?
-Yes.

15
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,603
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,827
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:16,042
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he’d been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:20,577
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,854
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,233
Take Marge’s suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,459
Okay.

22
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,601
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,565
-Can I tempt you, Marge?
-Just a small one.

24
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,671
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,378
A bit more.

26
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,124
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,981
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,123
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,082
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,661
What are you smirking at?

31
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,690
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

32
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,985
St. Brutus’. It’s a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,215
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus’, boy?

34
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,108
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,890
Yeah. I've been beaten
loads of times.

36
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,679
Excellent. 1 won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,949
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,225
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,235
It’s all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,779
What is it the boy’s father did,
Petunia?

41
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,845
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,875
-And a drunk too, no doubt?
-That’s a lie.

43
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,638
-What did you say?
-My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,527
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,808
l think it’s time you went to bed.

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,040
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,264
Actually, it’s nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,286
It’s all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,515
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something’s wrong with the pup.

50
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,672
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,409
Right.

52
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,661
Let me tell you....

53
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,251
Vernon!

54
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,130
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,544
Stop!

56
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,619
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.

57
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,121
-Hold on, hold on.
-Get off.

58
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,222
-Don't you dare!
-Sorry.

59
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,225
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,137
Oh, God.

61
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,099
Marge!

62
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,354
Please!

63
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,161
Marge!

64
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,313
Come back!

65
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,804
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,134
-You put her right!
-No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,717
-Keep away from me.
-You can't do magic outside school.

68
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,933
-Yeah? Try me.
-They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,644
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,025
I don’t care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,084
“Welcome to the Knight Bus...

72
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,436
emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

73
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:37,373
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening.”

74
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,981
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,790
-I fell over.
-What you fell over for?

76
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,569
-I didn’t do it on purpose.
-Well, come on, then.

77
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,029
Let’s not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,095
-What you looking at?
-Nothing.

79
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,161
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,033
No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.

81
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,281
Come on.

82
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,859
Come on. Move on, move on.

83
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,817
-Take her away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,344
It’s going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,200
-What did you say your name was?
-I didn't.

86
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,771
-Whereabouts are you headed?
-The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,085
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.”

88
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,657
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

89
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,571
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,627
-But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
-Muggles?

91
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,640
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,271
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,016
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

94
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,324
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,244
.. seven, six, five...

96
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,736
..-four, three, three and a half...

97
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,795
...two, one and three quarters.

98
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,981
Yes!

99
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:55,751
Who is that?

100
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,202
That man.

101
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,740
Who is that?

102
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,472
Who is--?

103
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,977
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,703
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,394
He’s a murderer.

106
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,150
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,133
-How did he escape?
-Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,443
He’s the first one that done it.

109
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,959
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,095
...-You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,628
l reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,424
Yeah.

113
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,962
Him I've heard of.

114
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,169
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

115
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,459
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,428
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,218
Mind your head.

118
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,115
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,454
Why the long faces?

120
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,702
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,397
-The Leaky Cauldron.
-Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,481
Mr. Potter, at last.

123
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,214
-Take it away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

124
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,350
Room 11.

125
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,314
Hedwig.

126
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,136
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,899
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,444
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

129
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,867
.. earlier this evening
your uncle’s sister was located...

130
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,908
..a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,845
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,689
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:32,608
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,626
So that’s that...

135
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,635
..and no harm done.

136
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,822
Pea soup?

137
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,024
No, thank you.

138
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,386
-Minister?
-Yes?

139
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,375
-[ don’t understand.
-Understand?

140
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,860
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

141
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,161
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

142
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,921
...for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:05,187
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

144
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,082
...Was very, very irresponsible.

145
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,891
-"The state of things,” sir?
-We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,128
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,069
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,811
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,349
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,509
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

151
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,545
..of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,085
Hedwig.

153
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:44,823
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

154
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,887
...-wander.

155
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,305
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,217
Housekeeping.

157
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,869
I'll come back later.

158
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,982
I'm warning you, Hermione.

159
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,571
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,035
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,090
-It’s in his nature.
-A cat? Is that what they told you?

162
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,850
-Looks like a pig with hair.
-That’s rich...

163
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,553
..coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,225
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,075
Harry.

166
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,601
Harry.

167
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,633
-Egypt. What's it like?
-Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

168
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:57,146
.. like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,563
-Egyptians used to worship cats.
-Along with the dung beetle.

170
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,900
-Not flashing that clipping again?
-l haven't shown anyone.

171
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,567
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,286
-The day maid.
-Night maid.

173
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,467
-Cook.
-The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,156
-Harry.
-Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,398
-Good to see you, dear.
-Good to see you.

176
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,004
-Got everything?
-Yes.

177
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,235
-Yes? All your books?
-It’s all upstairs.

178
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,901
-Your clothes?
-Everything.

179
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,352
-Good boy.
-Thank you.

180
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,454
-Harry Potter.
-Mr. Weasley.

181
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,945
-Harry, wonder if ! might have a word?
-Yeah, sure.

182
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,889
-Hermione.
-Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,573
-Looking forward to a new term?
-Yeah. It should be great.

184
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,458
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

185
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,433
...from divulging what I’m about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,860
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,713
You are in danger.

188
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,873
Grave danger.

189
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,983
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,218
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,929
-Only that he’s escaped from Azkaban.
-Do you know why?

192
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,543
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped....

193
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,663
-Voldemort.
-Don't say his name.

194
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,225
Sorry.

195
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,106
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,056
...Black lost everything.

197
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:19,208
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,799
And in his mind...

199
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,864
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

200
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,684
...0f You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,212
And that is why...

202
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,894
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,037
To find you.

204
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,147
And kill me.

205
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,626
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

206
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,342
...you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,228
Mr. Weasley...

208
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,070
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,880
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,876
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,641
Oh, for goodness’ sake!

212
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,275
Don't lose him!

213
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,418
I didn’t mean to blow her up. I just--

214
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,017
-l lost control.
-Brilliant.

215
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,640
Honestly, Ron, it’s not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,770
l was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,932
I still think it was brilliant.

218
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,838
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
Who do you think that is?

220
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,014
-Professor R.J. Lupin.
-Do you know everything?

221
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,400
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,583
-It’s on his suitcase, Ronald.
-Oh.

223
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,139
-Do you think he’s really asleep?
-Seems to be. Why?

224
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,145
I gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,697
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

226
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,961
-...to come after you?
-Yeah.

227
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,033
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

228
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,892
-l mean, everyone's looking for him.
-Sure.

229
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,331
Except no one’s ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

230
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:09,274
-...and he’s a murderous, raving lunatic.
-Thanks, Ron.

231
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,610
Why are we stopping?

232
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,399
We can't be there yet.

233
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,809
What's going on?

234
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,628
I don’t know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,942
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,796
There's something moving out there.

237
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,271
I think someone’s coming aboard.

238
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,359
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,078
Harry.

240
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,959
Harry, are you all right?

241
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,818
Thank you.

242
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,334
Here, eat this. It'll help.

243
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,000
It’s all right. It's chocolate.

244
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,381
What was that thing that came?

245
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,828
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It’s gone now.

246
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,781
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:05,471
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,072
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,401
What happened to me?

250
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,253
Well, you sort of went rigid.

251
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:25,415
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,123
And did either of you two...

253
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,681
...you know...

254
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,733
-...pass out?
-No.

255
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,770
I felt weird, though.

256
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,757
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,181
But someone was screaming.

258
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,820
A woman.

259
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,706
No one was screaming, Harry.

260
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,580
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,001
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

262
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,233
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,828
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

264
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,538
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

265
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,204
..of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,890
Good luck, professor.

267
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,740
Of course. That’s why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,654
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

269
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,447
-l mean, you actually fainted?
-Shove off, Malfoy.

270
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,737
-How did he find out?
-Just forget it.

271
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,235
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

272
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,365
...has decided to retire...

273
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:32,074
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,101
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

275
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,091
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

276
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:42,414
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,679
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

278
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,412
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:04,465
..-Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

280
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,803
. until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:13,422
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,499
Now whilst I’ve been assured...

283
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,094
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

284
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:20,881
...a word of caution.

285
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,026
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

286
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,573
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,343
Therefore, 1 must warn
each and every one of you...

288
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,147
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,841
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,502
But you know,
happiness can be found...

291
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,232
..-even in the darkest of times...

292
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,310
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,543
Fortuna Major.

294
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,971
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,081
-Fortuna Major.
-No, no. Wait, wait.

296
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,214
Watch this.

297
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:35,543
-Amazing. Just with my voice.
-Fortuna Major.

298
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,485
-Yes, all right. Go in.
-Thank you.

299
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,657
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,962
-She can't even sing.
-Exactly.

301
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,366
-Hey, man.
-Hey, man.

302
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,869
-Oh, God.
-That’s awful.

303
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,905
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,314
-What is that?
-You call that a monkey?

305
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,741
Do not give him one again.

306
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,491
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,440
-Ron, catch.
-I will.

308
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,761
I think we have a winner.

309
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,950
-Oh, don't try one of them.
-Oh, no.

310
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,060
Look at him. His face.

311
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,976
Welcome, my children.

312
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:17,932
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:23,384
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,910
Hello. l am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:33,608
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:37,775
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,540
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:43,681
What do you see?

319
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:48,999
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,031
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:56,471
-First, you must look beyond.
-What a load of rubbish.

322
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,895
-Where did you come from?
-Me?

323
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,638
-I’ve been here all this time.
-You, boy....

324
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,154
Is your grandmother quite well?

325
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,363
I think so.

326
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:09,165
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:13,711
Pity.

328
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,392
Broaden your minds.

329
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,249
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,492
-l think you are.
-Sure.

331
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,887
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,817
Yeah.

333
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,762
Harry’s got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,924
And that there could be the sun
and that’s happiness.

335
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,744
So...

336
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:44,646
... you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,514
Give me the cup.

338
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,917
Oh, my dear boy.

339
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,678
My dear...

340
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,275
...you have the Grim.

341
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,012
The Grin? What’s the Grin?

342
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,914
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,360
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

344
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,973
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,296
It’s an omen...

346
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,281
...of death.”

347
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:22,424
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

348
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,478
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination’s a woolly discipline.

349
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:30,342
Now, Ancient Runes,
that’s a fascinating subject.

350
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:33,706
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

351
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,719
A fair few.

352
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,934
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,793
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,049
You have to be in two
classes at once.

355
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,458
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

356
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,758
“Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future.”

357
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,924
That’s it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don’t mind.

358
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,190
I got a real treat for you today.

359
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,333
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,550
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,290
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,199
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,004
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:36,191
-Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
-I'm okay. Okay.

365
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,135
-l think they're funny.
-Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,932
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,651
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore’s
got this oaf teaching classes.

368
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,206
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,695
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,648
-Just ignore him.
-You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,488
Yeah.

372
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,507
Isn’t he beautiful?

373
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,356
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,243
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

375
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,499
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,991
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:50,058
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,095
It may be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,588
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,348
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,639
Come on now.

382
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,514
Now...

383
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,129
...you have to let him make the first
move. It’s only polite. So...

384
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,389
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,962
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,290
If he does, you can go and touch him.

387
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,533
If not-- Well,
we'll get to that later.

388
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,376
Just make your bow.

389
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,693
Nice and low.

390
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,699
Back off, Harry. Back off.

391
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,087
Keep still.

392
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,697
Keep still.

393
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:56,023
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

394
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,283
Right. 1 think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,410
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,217
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,112
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:27,229
Slow down, Harry. That’s it....

399
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,606
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,917
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly....

401
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,983
That's it....

402
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,006
Yes!

403
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,761
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,091
Does he get to fly?

405
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,653
-l think he may let you ride him now.
-What?

406
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,486
-Come on.
-Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,628
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:57,525
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,093
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,397
That was wicked, Harry!

411
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,059
Oh, please.

412
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,051
Well done, well done.

413
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,844
-How am I! doing me first day?
-Brilliant, professor.

414
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,331
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

415
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,279
Malfoy, no....

416
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,638
No!

417
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,950
Buckbeak!

418
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:09,221
Whoa, whoa, whoa....

419
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,235
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,641
Away, you silly creature....

421
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,817
-It’s killed me!
-Calm down. It’s just a scratch!

422
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,480
Hagrid!

423
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:25,369
-He has to be taken to the hospital.
-I’m the teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,593
-You're gonna regret this.
-Class dismissed!

425
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,100
You and your bloody chicken!

426
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,649
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

427
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:03,508
It comes and it goes.
Still, 1 consider myself lucky.

428
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:07,071
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

429
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,332
-I can’t do homework for weeks.
-Listen to the idiot.

430
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,665
-He’s really laying it on thick, isn't he?
-At least Hagrid didn’t get fired.

431
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,666
l hear Draco’s father’s furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,934
-He’s been sighted!
-Who?

433
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,848
Sirius Black!

434
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,758
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

435
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,842
You don’t think he’d come
to Hogwarts, do you?

436
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,525
-With dementors at every entrance?
-Dementors?

437
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,933
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:40,521
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It’s like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,660
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,985
Intriguing, isn’t it?

441
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,911
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

442
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,997
...as to what is inside?

443
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,929
-That’s a boggart, that is.
-Very good, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,740
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,074
-No one knows.
-When did she get here?

446
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,872
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,074
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:40,571
-That’s what makes them so--
-So terrifying, yes, yes, yes....

449
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:46,106
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:51,456
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

451
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,406
After me. Riddikulus!

452
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,759
-Riddikulus!
-Very good.

453
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,445
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,888
-Riddikulus!
-Riddikulus!

455
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,200
-This class is ridiculous.
-Very good.

456
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:08,172
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,146
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,674
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:21,005
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,766
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,538
Come on.

462
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,255
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,348
Professor Snape.

464
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,400
-Sorry?
-Professor Snape.

465
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,781
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:42,312
-You live with your grandmother.
-I don’t want it to turn into her, either.

467
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,768
No...

468
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,232
..it won't. 1 want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,650
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,966
-She carries a red handbag--
-We don’t need to hear.

471
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,913
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

472
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:02,484
.-here’s what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,933
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,981
Can you do that?

475
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,163
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,899
One, two, three.

477
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,779
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,557
Riddikulus!

479
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,694
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,773
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line....

481
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:49,536
Form a line!

482
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,857
l want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:56,191
..and turn it into something funny.

484
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,263
Next! Ron!

485
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,812
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,067
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,606
Riddikulus!

488
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,198
Yes!

489
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,517
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:31,470
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,908
Show us what you see.

492
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,446
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,756
Riddikulus!

494
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,759
And next! Step up, step up!

495
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,709
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,788
Here!

497
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,502
Riddikulus!

498
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,813
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,086
Collect your books from the back.

500
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,815
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,968
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:46,386
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:49,707
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

504
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,801
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:56,491
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,401
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,639
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,390
I thought if you signed it,
then I could--

509
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,059
I can’t. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,348
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:17,054
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,689
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,680
Professor, can Il ask you something?

514
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:41,535
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,436
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,263
l assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,847
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,794
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:55,504
-...and the dementor.
-I'm very impressed.

520
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,540
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,366
This is very wise.

522
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,535
Before I fainted...

523
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,810
...[ heard something.

524
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,026
A woman...

525
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:08,865
.
... Screaming.

526
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:12,073
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,250
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,370
l think it was my mother...

529
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,769
...the night she was murdered.

530
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:26,567
The very first time 1 saw you, Harry,
l recognized you immediately.

531
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:30,205
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,855
They're your mother, Lily’s.

533
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:35,318
Yes.

534
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,456
Oh, yes. I knew her.

535
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,535
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:48,042
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:51,536
.. she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:55,133
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,100
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,691
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

541
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,530
«he...

542
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:11,185
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:18,694
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,984
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,928
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:37,621
Honeyduke’s Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko’s Joke Shop.

547
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,576
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:44,628
-You heard it’s the most--
-Haunted building in Britain. 1 know.

549
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:47,807
What's going on?

550
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,305
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:52,908
-Hey.
-Oh, you're there.

552
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:57,151
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:00,736
Get back, all of you.

554
00:48:01,145 --> 00:48:03,895
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it’s been searched.

555
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,618
The Fat Lady! She’s gone!

556
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,055
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:12,191
It’s not funny, Ron.

558
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:18,025
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:25,739
-Be quiet.
-Make way.

560
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,846
-The headmaster’s here.
-Come on, move.

561
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,942
You heard. Move!

562
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,908
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:51,191
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:54,586
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,670
The Fat Lady’s there.

566
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,519
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,678
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:06,318
-Come back here!
-Keep moving!

569
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,734
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:19,405
Eyes like the devil, he’s got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,588
It’s him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,298
He’s here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,731
Sirius Black!

574
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:33,713
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:06,739
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There’s nothing there.

576
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,755
-Thank you.
-The third floor’s clear too, sir.

577
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:11,973
-Very good.
-l’ve done the dungeons.

578
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,716
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:17,469
I didn’t really expect him to linger.

580
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,066
Remarkable feat, don’t you think?

581
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,538
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one’s own...

582
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,328
-...completely undetected?
-Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,467
Any theories on how
he managed it?

584
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:31,503
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:33,466
You may recall...

586
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,321
...prior to the start of term
l expressed concerns...

587
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,644
..-about your appointment
of Professor--

588
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:42,669
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,450
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...

590
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:49,100
..and I’m more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,763
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:54,558
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:50:55,753 --> 00:50:59,883
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:06,468
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,531
Turn to page 394.

596
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,511
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:04,672
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:08,655
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:13,776
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:20,692
"Werewolves"?

601
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:23,634
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:26,958
-We’re not meant to start that for weeks.
-Quiet.

603
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:30,324
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:34,418
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:37,192
... between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,888
No one?

607
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:43,174
-How disappointing.
-Please, sir.

608
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,507
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,433
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:50,522
With each full moon...

611
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,334
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,135
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,173
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,730
..-you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,932
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:10,281
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:13,977
-He’s got a point, you know.
-Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:18,631
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

619
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:22,646
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

620
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:25,547
-...0n recognizing it.
-It’s Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,870
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:34,047
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:38,055
Page 394.

624
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,807
The term "werewolf"...

625
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,836
. is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

626
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:52,025
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,280
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:58,396
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,706
... being bitten by a werewolf....

630
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,947
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,669
Aresto momentum!

632
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:31,002
-He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
-Peaky?

633
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,575
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

634
00:56:34,024 --> 00:56:36,544
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:39,784
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,410
-How are you feeling?
-Oh, brilliant.

637
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,700
You gave us a right good scare.

638
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:52,276
-What happened?
-Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,026
Really? ! meant the match. Who won?

640
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,240
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:05,025
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore’s furious.

642
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,532
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

643
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:11,178
There's something else
you should know too.

644
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:17,735
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and....

645
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,312
Well....

646
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,792
i'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

647
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,683
Is there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,410
No.

649
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,674
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:35,202
-l mean, more than everyone else?
-Listen.

651
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:38,532
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,841
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

653
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:47,937
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:52,422
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:56,673
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:57:57,374 --> 00:58:00,093
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,964
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:06,987
-I'm scared, professor.
-I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,721
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,071
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,073
There was only one that night.

662
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:19,599
-But you made it go away.
-l don’t pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,857
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

664
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:28,855
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,143
For now, I need to rest.

666
00:58:56,833 --> 00:59:00,583
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,470
-Guys, let me go.
-Clever, Harry.

668
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,439
-But not clever enough.
-We've got a better way.

669
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,448
-I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
-We know.

670
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,160
We'll get you there.

671
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,746
-We'll show you a quicker way.
-If you pipe down.

672
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,392
-Bless him.
-Let me go! Come on, guys. Don’'t--

673
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:35,717
-Now, Harry.
-Come and join the big boys.

674
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,310
What are you doing?!

675
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:42,303
-What's this rubbish?
-"What's this rubbish?” he says.

676
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,746
-It’s the secret to our success.
-It’s a wrench giving it to you--

677
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,899
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,939
George, if you will.

679
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:54,223
l solemnly swear
that 1 am up to no good.

680
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,421
“Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs...

681
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,875
...are proud to present
the Marauder’s Map.”

682
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:07,459
We owe them so much.

683
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,644
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that--

684
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,678
-No. Is that really--?
-Dumbledore.

685
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,051
-In his study.
-Pacing.

686
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,129
Does that a lot.

687
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:23,195
-So this map shows--?
-Everyone.

688
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,370
-Where they are.
-What they're doing.

689
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:26,779
-Every minute.
-Every day.

690
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,720
-Brilliant! Where did you get it?
-From Filch’s office.

691
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,660
-First year.
-There are seven secret passageways...

692
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:35,503
-...out of the castle.
-We'd recommend this one.

693
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,779
-The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
-Leads you to Honeyduke’s.

694
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:40,946
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:44,358
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

696
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:48,750
“Mischief managed.”
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

697
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:26,541
Now, how much do you want?

698
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,790
Delicious.

699
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:47,604
It’s meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did 1 mention that?

700
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,761
Twice.

701
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,724
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,700
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,732
Actually, I’m fine here.

704
01:01:58,248 --> 01:01:59,858
Well, well. Look who's here.

705
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,473
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:06,736
Bit grand for you, isn’t it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,299
-Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
-Not very friendly.

708
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:15,474
Boys, I think it’s time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:19,319
-Hope you don't mean yourself.
-How dare you talk to me!

710
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,653
You filthy little mudblood!

711
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,449
Who is that?

712
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,962
-Don’t stand there! Do something!
-What?

713
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,062
What’s up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,572
Get out of the way!

715
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:05,614
Move!

716
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,612
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:14,455
Harry!

718
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:18,428
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:22,936
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder’s Map.

720
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:26,555
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:30,683
-Aren't you?
-Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

722
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:33,531
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:36,067
-Ron fancies her.
-That’s not true!

724
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:38,153
-Professor McGonagall!
-Cornelius!

725
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:39,781
Allow me, minister.

726
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,760
-Oh, Hagrid....
-Sorry about that.

727
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:44,765
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

728
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,722
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,899
-...into my pub every other night!
-We have....

730
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,640
-We have a killer on the loose.
-Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,537
And what would bring him here?

732
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:03,663
-Harry Potter.
-Harry Potter?

733
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:05,891
Come.

734
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,395
Harry!

735
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:22,275
-No underage wizards allowed in today!
-Shut the damn door!

736
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:24,776
-So rude.
-Thick heads.

737
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,661
-Thick heads?!
-How dare they!

738
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,843
-Who are they calling thick heads?
-Young whippersnappers!

739
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,430
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,531
Professor Dumbledore doesn’t want
dementors around the place.

741
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:43,357
Tell me what this is all about.

742
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:47,667
Years ago, when Harry Potter’s parents
realized they were marked for death--

743
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,725
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:54,624
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:58,131
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

746
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:01,655
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,198
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy.

748
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,627
-Always trailing after Black.
-l remember.

749
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,680
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,472
-What happened?
-Peter tried to warn the Potters...

751
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:15,665
..and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:19,749
Black was vicious.
He didn’t kill Pettigrew.

753
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,317
He destroyed him!

754
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:27,379
A finger. That’s all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,783
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

756
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:34,167
-...but he’s the reason they're dead.
-He wants to finish things.

757
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,254
-I don’t believe it.
-That’s not the worst of it.

758
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:41,111
-What could be worse?
-This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,641
..-and remains to this day...

760
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,770
...Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,637
Ron, look!

762
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,905
-Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
-Merry Christmas.

763
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,276
Harry, what happened?

764
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,874
He was their friend...

765
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,600
...and he betrayed them.

766
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,406
He was their friend!

767
01:06:57,881 --> 01:06:59,611
l hope he finds me.

768
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,533
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

769
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:05,566
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

770
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,598
Harry.

771
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:23,734
There you are. You came.

772
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,740
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

773
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,548
..-well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:32,354
I'm sure.

775
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:35,286
Well, everything's prepared.

776
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:38,812
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,712
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,517
No? Well....

779
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,022
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

780
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:50,729
. it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,837
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:58,951
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

783
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:02,982
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,607
Close your eyes.

785
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,321
Concentrate.

786
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:13,628
Explore your past.

787
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,029
Do you have a memory?

788
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:19,790
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,603
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:27,856
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

791
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,428
-Expecto Patronum.
-Very good.

792
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,508
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:59,013
Expecto Patronum!

794
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:03,063
Expecto.... Expecto....

795
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,226
Expect....

796
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:11,013
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,154
It’s all right. I didn’t expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:20,529
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,511
-That’s one nasty dementor.
-Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,491
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,777
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

802
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,644
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

803
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:37,386
-Which memory did you choose?
-The first time I rode a broom.

804
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,972
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:09:49,252 --> 01:09:53,882
There's another.
It’s not happy, exactly.

806
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:58,299
Well, it is.

807
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:01,008
It’s the happiest I've ever felt...

808
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:04,977
-...but it's complicated.
-Is it strong?

809
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:12,329
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?

810
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:15,997
Just do it.

811
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:29,125
Expecto Patronum!

812
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,240
Expecto Patronum!

813
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:57,279
Yes!

814
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:02,378
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:06,956
-l think I’ve had enough for today.
-Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,770
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

817
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:11,783
And just so you know, Harry...

818
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:15,678
...[ think you’d have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:18,149
..is saying something.

820
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,326
I was thinking of him.

821
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,644
And Mum.

822
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:27,041
Seeing their faces.

823
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,320
They were talking to me.

824
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,809
Just talking.

825
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:35,306
That's the memory I chose.

826
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:39,363
I don’t even know if it’s real.

827
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:42,062
But it’s the best I have.

828
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:53,594
-Beautiful day.
-Gorgeous.

829
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:55,806
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:11:56,212 --> 01:11:58,352
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,594
-Ronald has lost his rat.
-l haven't lost anything!

832
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,021
-Your cat killed him!
-Rubbish.

833
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:07,383
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

834
01:12:07,957 --> 01:12:11,387
..is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:14,548
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

836
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:16,907
-Your cat killed him!
-Did not.

837
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,643
-Did.
-Didn’t.

838
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:23,180
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:26,572
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

840
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:29,483
...talking about why we were there.

841
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,021
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

842
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,126
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,347
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

844
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,700
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

845
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:46,950
..-who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,110
And then?

847
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,402
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

848
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:56,532
-They’re not sacking you!
-No, I'm not sacked.

849
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:01,771
Buckbeak’s been sentenced to death!

850
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:33,865
Spiders! There’s-- There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,964
-l don’t wanna tap-dance!
-You tell those spiders.

852
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,959
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them....

853
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:01,501
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy.

854
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,688
-Always trailing after Sirius Black.
-Black was vicious.

855
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,444
He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

856
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:18,858
-Put that light out!
-Sorry.

857
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:06,161
-Watch it there, boy.
-We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:17,157
Mischief managed. Nox.

859
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:20,852
Potter.

860
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,253
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

861
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:25,784
I was sleepwalking.

862
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:28,367
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

863
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:33,080
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

864
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:37,673
My dad didn’t strut. And nor do I.

865
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:41,624
Now, if you don’t mind, I would
appreciate it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:47,183
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:51,388
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:15:54,617 --> 01:15:56,047
What's this?

869
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:59,289
-Spare bit of parchment.
-Really? Open it.

870
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:09,422
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,026
Read it.

872
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:22,470
“Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

873
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,945
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and...."

874
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,060
Go on.

875
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,818
“And request he keep his large nose
out of other people’s business.”

876
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:36,740
-You insolent little--
-Professor!

877
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:41,061
Well, well. Lupin.

878
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:45,694
Out for a little walk in the moonlight,
are we?

879
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,776
Harry, are you all right?

880
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,442
That remains to be seen.

881
01:16:53,576 --> 01:16:56,856
Il have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,580
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:05,403
-Clearly, it’s full of dark magic.
-l seriously doubt it, Severus.

884
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:09,224
It looks as though it’s a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

885
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:13,224
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:17,616
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,050
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

888
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:24,534
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

889
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:33,346
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,047
Come in.

891
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:46,594
Il haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

892
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:51,349
...but quite frankly, 1 am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:55,287
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

894
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,688
...is a map to you?

895
01:17:58,741 --> 01:18:00,911
-No.
-No, sir.

896
01:18:03,212 --> 01:18:05,872
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:10,228
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:18:11,387 --> 01:18:14,987
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

899
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:19,558
..-with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

900
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,228
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

901
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:24,805
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, sir.

902
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:28,487
l want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

903
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:33,294
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

904
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:42,446
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

905
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:48,192
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

906
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,625
Oh, really? And who might that be?

907
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,497
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,138
That's not possible.

909
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:01,062
It's just what I saw.

910
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:05,596
Good night, professor.

911
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,971
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:18,429
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

913
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,185
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,965
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:29,493
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,777
The Grim, possibly.

917
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:40,906
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

918
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:44,887
...l sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

919
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,977
..-for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

920
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,838
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

921
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,965
...as an old maid’s, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

922
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,376
...to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,028
Have I said something?

924
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:27,341
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

925
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:30,373
...but now it’s in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,759
Hang on.

927
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:35,778
-We better take this back.
-l'm not going back.

928
01:20:36,465 --> 01:20:39,455
-Fine. See you later.
-See you.

929
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:22,269
Harry Potter....

930
01:21:29,785 --> 01:21:33,535
-Professor Trelawney--
-He will return tonight.

931
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,653
Sorry?

932
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:40,128
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:21:40,863 --> 01:21:42,643
..-Shall break free.

934
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,025
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

935
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:50,737
..and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:21:57,813 --> 01:22:00,683
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:03,464
No.

938
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,489
Nothing.

939
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:01,813
I can’t believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It’s just too horrible.

940
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,878
-It just got worse.
-What did I say? Father said...

941
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:09,040
...[ can keep the hippogriff’s head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors’ room.

942
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:11,891
This is going to be rich.

943
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,286
-Look who’s here.
-Come to see the show?

944
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:17,476
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

945
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:19,576
Hermione, no!

946
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,352
He’s not worth it.

947
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:38,522
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:42,670
-Let’s go. Quick.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?

949
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:47,251
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant.

950
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:10,989
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,670
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:24:14,116 --> 01:24:16,256
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

953
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,348
... would get into trouble.
He’s coming down, Dumbledore.

954
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,968
Says he wants to be with me
when they....

955
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:25,038
When it happens.

956
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,660
Great man, Dumbledore.

957
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,169
A great man.

958
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,442
-We'll stay with you too.
-You'll do no such thing!

959
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:37,750
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:41,530
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron....

961
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,498
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:55,204
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-l think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:59,137
Right. Next time 1 see Crookshanks,
Pll let him know.

964
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:00,721
I meant me!

965
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:03,493
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:11,468
Hagrid!

967
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:14,745
Oh, crikey.

968
01:25:16,378 --> 01:25:18,777
No, minister. Over this way.

969
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:22,914
It’s late. It’s nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,895
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

971
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:30,682
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:34,667
Quick. Quick!

973
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,650
Hagrid.

974
01:25:37,032 --> 01:25:40,492
-It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
-Go on, go on!

975
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:45,264
-That’s ling you see over there--
-On the slope.

976
01:25:45,774 --> 01:25:48,114
-On the slope-- Ah, Hagrid.
-Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,980
-Good evening.
-Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:25:51,513 --> 01:25:54,883
-Have a tea, if you like.
-No, Hagrid.

979
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:59,702
-Gentlemen.
-I'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:03,152
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

981
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:07,885
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

982
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,277
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

983
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:16,663
. hereinafter called "the condemned,”
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:20,606
-Dear, dear....
-Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

985
01:26:21,243 --> 01:26:25,113
-All right. It'll be all right.
-The execution shall dispatch--

986
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:27,334
What?

987
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:29,556
I thought I just saw--

988
01:26:29,985 --> 01:26:31,825
-Never mind.
-Let’s go!

989
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,242
Buckbeak didn’t mean no harm.

990
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,331
Oh, no.

991
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,350
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:27:41,223 --> 01:27:42,923
Ron. Ron!

993
01:27:44,126 --> 01:27:47,226
-Ron!
-Scabbers, come back.

994
01:27:49,164 --> 01:27:50,714
Wait!

995
01:27:56,838 --> 01:28:00,617
-Scabbers, you bit me!
-Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:03,329
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,968
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:11,281
It’s the Grim!

999
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:21,183
-Harry!
-Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:23,513
Harry!

1001
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,413
-Help!
-Ron!

1002
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:32,708
-Ron. Ron.
-Ron!

1003
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:49,706
Come on!

1004
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:53,120
Move!

1005
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,882
Duck!

1006
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:36,956
Harry!

1007
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:55,764
-Oh, I’m sorry.
-Don't worry.

1008
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:59,751
-Where do you suppose this goes?
-l have a hunch.

1009
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,072
I just hope I’m wrong.

1010
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:24,730
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1011
01:30:26,221 --> 01:30:27,620
Come on.

1012
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:39,428
Ron.

1013
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:42,445
-Ron. You're okay.
-The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:45,811
It’s a trap. He’s the dog.
He’s an Animagus.

1015
01:31:00,088 --> 01:31:02,518
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:04,604
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:06,726
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:15,067
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:31:16,538 --> 01:31:18,147
Expelliarmus!

1020
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:25,769
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1021
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:29,141
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:33,308
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1023
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:45,035
-l found him.
-l know.

1024
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,503
-He’s here.
-l understand.

1025
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:49,645
-Let’s kill him!
-No! I trusted you!

1026
01:31:50,472 --> 01:31:53,751
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1027
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:57,598
He's a werewolf!
That's why he’s been missing classes.

1028
01:32:00,782 --> 01:32:02,272
How long have you known?

1029
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:05,794
-Since Professor Snape set the essay.
-Well, Hermione.

1030
01:32:06,388 --> 01:32:08,968
You are the brightest witch
of your age I’ve ever met.

1031
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:11,601
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let’s kill him!

1032
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:14,403
-Wait!
-l did my waiting!

1033
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:17,036
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:20,041
In Azkaban!

1035
01:32:29,811 --> 01:32:31,331
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:35,423
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:37,421
I know why.

1038
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:39,812
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:32:40,255 --> 01:32:42,835
-You're the reason they're dead!
-No, it wasn’t him.

1040
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:45,028
Somebody did betray your parents...

1041
01:32:45,427 --> 01:32:48,496
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1042
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:52,170
-Who was it, then?
-Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:55,517
And he’s in this room! Right now!

1044
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:59,014
Come out, come out, Peter!

1045
01:32:59,541 --> 01:33:02,171
-Come out, come out and play!
-Expelliarmus!

1046
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,669
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:10,139
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,755
Severus--

1049
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:16,247
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here’s the proof.

1050
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:18,161
Brilliant, Snape.

1051
01:33:18,493 --> 01:33:22,363
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:25,438
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1053
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:30,324
-...to attend to.
-Give me a reason. I beg you!

1054
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,356
-Don't be a fool.
-He can't help it. It’s habit.

1055
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:35,278
-Be quiet.
-Be quiet yourself!

1056
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:37,783
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:40,466
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1058
01:33:41,316 --> 01:33:43,505
I could do it, you know.

1059
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:49,235
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:52,461
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:56,031
A Dementor’s Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1062
01:33:56,631 --> 01:34:01,381
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1063
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:04,230
Severus, please.

1064
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,290
After you.

1065
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,500
Expelliarmus!

1066
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:18,613
-Harry! What did you just do?
-You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:34:19,287 --> 01:34:21,537
-Tell me about Peter.
-He was at school with us.

1068
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:23,483
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:34:23,858 --> 01:34:26,488
-No. Pettigrew’s dead. You killed him!
-No, he didn’t.

1070
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:29,838
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:34:30,465 --> 01:34:32,895
-The map was lying, then.
-The map never lies!

1072
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:36,944
Pettigrew's alive!
And he’s right there!

1073
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:41,912
-Me?! He’s mental!
-Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:34:42,744 --> 01:34:45,494
-Scabbers has been in my family for--
-Twelve years?

1075
01:34:46,047 --> 01:34:48,236
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:50,996
-He’s missing a toe, isn't he?
-So what?

1077
01:34:51,486 --> 01:34:54,096
-All they could find of Pettigrew was his--
-Finger!

1078
01:34:54,656 --> 01:34:57,496
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:34:58,059 --> 01:35:00,719
-And then he transformed into a rat!
-Show me.

1080
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,388
-Give it to him, Ron.
-What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:35:06,968 --> 01:35:07,898
Scabbers!

1082
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:10,893
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:35:33,761 --> 01:35:35,371
Remus?

1084
01:35:36,364 --> 01:35:37,674
Sirius.

1085
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:39,702
My old friends!

1086
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,943
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:52,797
-James. We were the best of friends--
-How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:56,392
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:35:56,918 --> 01:36:01,487
-You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
-1 didn’t mean to!

1090
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:04,780
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1091
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:07,636
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:13,249
-What would you have done?
-Died, rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:18,184
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:36:18,673 --> 01:36:23,652
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:36:24,846 --> 01:36:28,535
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn’t kill you, we would. Together!

1096
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,030
No!

1097
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:36,267
-Harry, this man--
- know what he is.

1098
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:38,594
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:43,443
-Bless you, boy. Bless you!
-Get off!

1100
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,308
l said we'd take you to the castle.

1101
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,899
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:36:54,108 --> 01:36:57,388
Sorry about the bite.
l reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:36:58,012 --> 01:37:01,112
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:37:01,716 --> 01:37:03,086
I was going for the rat.

1105
01:37:03,451 --> 01:37:06,821
Normally, I have a very
sweet disposition as a dog.

1106
01:37:07,455 --> 01:37:12,055
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:17,139
The tail 1 could live with.
But the fleas, they’re murder.

1108
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:31,621
Okay.

1109
01:37:36,818 --> 01:37:39,038
-You better go.
-No. Don't worry, okay?

1110
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,750
It’s fine. I'll stay.

1111
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,439
You go, I'll stay.

1112
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:46,741
-You okay?
-I’m fine. Go.

1113
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:51,326
-That looks really painful.
-So painful.

1114
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:54,116
They might chop it.

1115
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:57,242
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:37:57,739 --> 01:38:01,428
It’s too late. It’s ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:04,821
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

1118
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:09,190
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1119
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:13,130
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:18,116
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,160
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:38:21,596 --> 01:38:24,375
I didn’t think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1123
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:26,272
...to become killers.

1124
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:29,917
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:38:30,538 --> 01:38:32,617
Alive, you're free.

1126
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:35,794
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:38:36,377 --> 01:38:39,307
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:38:39,881 --> 01:38:42,071
...to the dementors, will you?
l was your rat!

1129
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:46,090
-Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't--
-Get away from her!

1130
01:38:49,056 --> 01:38:50,726
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1131
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:54,725
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:57,096
I know.

1133
01:38:58,499 --> 01:39:02,068
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1134
01:39:02,737 --> 01:39:04,927
...but if you ever wanted
a different home....

1135
01:39:05,406 --> 01:39:07,596
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:11,960
It’s just a thought.
I can understand if you don’t want to.

1137
01:39:12,513 --> 01:39:14,063
Harry!

1138
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:32,780
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:39,224
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1140
01:39:41,242 --> 01:39:42,992
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:46,218
Expelliarmus!

1142
01:39:56,557 --> 01:39:57,927
Harry!

1143
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:01,803
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:10,419
Run! Run!

1145
01:40:20,715 --> 01:40:22,495
-Come on.
-Wait. Wait.

1146
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:27,397
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,149
Professor?

1148
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:35,869
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:40:43,838 --> 01:40:46,678
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:49,728
There you are, Potter!

1151
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:24,744
Sirius!

1152
01:41:25,713 --> 01:41:27,822
Come back here, Potter!

1153
01:42:33,948 --> 01:42:35,178
Sirius!

1154
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,759
No. Sirius!

1155
01:43:20,995 --> 01:43:23,515
Expecto Patronum!

1156
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:38,744
Harry?

1157
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:42,047
l saw my dad.

1158
01:45:42,536 --> 01:45:43,906
What?

1159
01:45:44,305 --> 01:45:45,645
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:47,236
l saw him across the lake.

1161
01:45:47,608 --> 01:45:49,038
Harry, they’ve captured Sirius.

1162
01:45:49,476 --> 01:45:51,965
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:54,669
-They’re gonna kill him?
-No. It’s worse.

1164
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:56,791
Much worse.

1165
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:59,264
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:46:01,255 --> 01:46:02,485
Headmaster, stop them.

1167
01:46:02,823 --> 01:46:05,783
-They’ve got the wrong man.
-It’s true. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,290
-It'’s Scabbers who did it.
-Scabbers?

1169
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:09,959
He’s my rat, sir.

1170
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:13,871
He’s not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy’s rat.

1171
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:17,755
-But then they gave him an owl--
-The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:46:18,405 --> 01:46:20,594
-Please believe us.
-l do, Miss Granger.

1173
01:46:21,141 --> 01:46:25,891
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:32,080
A child’s voice,
however honest and true...

1175
01:46:32,586 --> 01:46:35,896
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:43,782
Mysterious thing, time.

1177
01:46:45,266 --> 01:46:46,436
Powerful...

1178
01:46:46,767 --> 01:46:49,317
.and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1179
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:54,428
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:46:55,676 --> 01:46:57,516
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1181
01:46:57,945 --> 01:46:59,525
You must not be seen.

1182
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:03,134
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:06,851
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:47:07,821 --> 01:47:09,401
If you succeed tonight...

1185
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:12,280
..-more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:47:14,461 --> 01:47:16,421
Three turns should do it, I think.

1187
01:47:21,568 --> 01:47:23,178
Oh, and by the way.

1188
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:28,700
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:47:29,576 --> 01:47:31,386
Good luck.

1190
01:47:32,146 --> 01:47:34,316
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:37,332
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk....

1192
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:08,013
What just happened?

1193
01:48:08,382 --> 01:48:10,402
-Where’s Ron?
-7:30.

1194
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:12,491
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:14,466
I don’t know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:48:14,855 --> 01:48:16,964
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:19,934
Hermione!

1198
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:40,685
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:48:42,816 --> 01:48:45,946
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:48:46,587 --> 01:48:49,077
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:50,760
That's us.

1202
01:48:51,158 --> 01:48:53,708
Hermione, no! He’s not worth it.

1203
01:48:54,294 --> 01:48:55,554
This is not normal.

1204
01:48:58,032 --> 01:49:00,112
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:02,497
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:49:02,936 --> 01:49:05,896
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:49:06,507 --> 01:49:09,317
-You mean we've gone back in time?
-Yes.

1208
01:49:09,877 --> 01:49:12,837
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:18,329
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:49:21,855 --> 01:49:23,025
Good punch.

1211
01:49:23,357 --> 01:49:24,667
Thanks.

1212
01:49:25,859 --> 01:49:27,319
Malfoy’s coming.

1213
01:49:28,429 --> 01:49:30,479
-Run.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?

1214
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:33,920
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:49:34,468 --> 01:49:37,928
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant.

1216
01:49:39,773 --> 01:49:42,053
Come on. We should be at Hagrid’s.

1217
01:50:01,495 --> 01:50:03,745
Look. Buckbeak’s still alive.

1218
01:50:05,499 --> 01:50:07,169
Of course.

1219
01:50:07,568 --> 01:50:09,318
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:50:09,736 --> 01:50:13,276
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:50:14,141 --> 01:50:15,311
Let's go.

1222
01:50:36,763 --> 01:50:38,603
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:50:39,032 --> 01:50:41,222
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:50:41,702 --> 01:50:43,872
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:50:45,205 --> 01:50:47,315
Scabbers, you're alive!

1226
01:50:47,774 --> 01:50:50,204
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-That’s Pettigrew.

1227
01:50:50,777 --> 01:50:53,327
-Harry, you can’t.
-He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:50:53,847 --> 01:50:56,477
-You don't expect me to sit here.
-Yes, and you must!

1229
01:51:00,721 --> 01:51:03,120
Harry, you're in Hagrid’s hut now.

1230
01:51:03,624 --> 01:51:06,114
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:51:06,627 --> 01:51:09,147
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1232
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:11,652
We can't be seen.

1233
01:51:15,202 --> 01:51:16,722
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:51:17,838 --> 01:51:19,678
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:51:22,075 --> 01:51:23,474
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:51:34,588 --> 01:51:35,958
Are you mad?

1237
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:43,362
That hurt.

1238
01:51:43,730 --> 01:51:44,900
Sorry.

1239
01:52:05,919 --> 01:52:08,259
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:52:26,006 --> 01:52:28,466
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:52:30,877 --> 01:52:32,047
What?

1242
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,690
I thought I just saw....

1243
01:52:35,115 --> 01:52:37,455
-Never mind.
-Let’s go.

1244
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,119
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1245
01:53:00,641 --> 01:53:02,370
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:27,788
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1247
01:53:29,069 --> 01:53:31,819
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be....

1248
01:53:32,439 --> 01:53:35,749
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:53:40,681 --> 01:53:43,050
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1250
01:53:45,786 --> 01:53:49,126
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:53,290
-Your name only.
-It’s such a very long name....

1252
01:53:54,094 --> 01:53:55,584
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:53:58,498 --> 01:54:01,107
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,688
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:54:06,606 --> 01:54:10,556
-Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
-Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1256
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:12,771
-Now, look there.
-Where?

1257
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:16,140
-Look beyond the rocks.
-What am ! supposed to see?

1258
01:54:16,717 --> 01:54:19,786
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:54:20,387 --> 01:54:22,876
-Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
-And all the strawberries.

1260
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:26,711
-Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
-l see no strawberries.

1261
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:28,247
-Over there.
-Where?

1262
01:54:28,562 --> 01:54:30,112
-Over there.
-This way.

1263
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:32,870
-Let’s get this over, please.
-All right.

1264
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:36,358
But where is it?

1265
01:54:37,504 --> 01:54:39,434
I saw the beast, just now.

1266
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:42,270
-Not a moment ago!
-How extraordinary.

1267
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:43,879
Buckbeak.

1268
01:54:44,244 --> 01:54:47,844
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:54:48,515 --> 01:54:49,685
-Hagrid?
-Buckbeak.

1270
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:53,770
I don’t think the minister’s suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1271
01:54:54,521 --> 01:54:57,010
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:54:57,524 --> 01:54:59,164
-Right.
-Well, well...

1273
01:54:59,559 --> 01:55:00,899
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:55:01,261 --> 01:55:03,921
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1275
01:55:04,464 --> 01:55:09,244
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:13,580
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:15,881
Thank you.

1278
01:55:16,309 --> 01:55:19,209
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1279
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:31,700
-Come on.
-This way.

1280
01:55:38,698 --> 01:55:40,248
This way, now.

1281
01:55:42,903 --> 01:55:44,423
-Now what?
-We save Sirius.

1282
01:55:44,838 --> 01:55:47,027
-How?
-No idea.

1283
01:55:56,650 --> 01:55:58,730
-Look. It’s Lupin.
-immobulus!

1284
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:07,209
And Snape’s coming.

1285
01:56:13,667 --> 01:56:15,127
And now we wait.

1286
01:56:16,536 --> 01:56:18,116
And now we wait.

1287
01:56:45,899 --> 01:56:48,769
-At least someone's enjoying himself.
-Yeah.

1288
01:56:51,972 --> 01:56:53,522
-Hermione?
-Yeah?

1289
01:56:53,907 --> 01:56:57,717
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:56:58,411 --> 01:57:00,281
...1 did see someone.

1291
01:57:00,714 --> 01:57:03,734
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:05,487
With a Patronus.

1293
01:57:05,819 --> 01:57:07,489
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:57:07,888 --> 01:57:09,178
According to him...

1295
01:57:09,523 --> 01:57:12,513
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:57:13,093 --> 01:57:14,763
It was my dad.

1297
01:57:16,096 --> 01:57:17,675
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:57:18,064 --> 01:57:20,054
-Harry, but your dad’s--
-Dead. I know.

1299
01:57:21,735 --> 01:57:23,785
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:29,638
Here we come.

1301
01:57:35,515 --> 01:57:37,595
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:57:38,051 --> 01:57:40,631
-He’s asking me to come live with him.
-That’s great.

1303
01:57:41,154 --> 01:57:43,994
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys’.

1304
01:57:44,558 --> 01:57:45,988
It'll just be me and him.

1305
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:48,559
We could live in the country...

1306
01:57:48,962 --> 01:57:51,272
...-someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:57:51,765 --> 01:57:54,255
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:57:55,635 --> 01:57:57,005
Harry!

1309
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:00,228
Run!

1310
01:58:07,347 --> 01:58:08,687
Let's go.

1311
01:58:28,435 --> 01:58:30,485
-What are you doing?
-Saving your life.

1312
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:36,237
Thanks.

1313
01:58:38,244 --> 01:58:41,784
-Great. Now he’s coming for us.
-Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:58,940
That was so scary.

1315
01:59:59,325 --> 02:00:01,905
Poor Professor Lupin’s
having a really tough night.

1316
02:00:13,707 --> 02:00:16,457
Sirius. Come on!

1317
02:00:32,859 --> 02:00:34,699
-This is horrible.
-Don't worry.

1318
02:00:35,128 --> 02:00:37,968
My dad will come.
He’ll conjure the Patronus.

1319
02:00:47,073 --> 02:00:48,683
Any minute now.

1320
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:50,889
Right there. You'll see.

1321
02:00:52,545 --> 02:00:54,735
Harry, listen to me.
No one’s coming.

1322
02:00:55,215 --> 02:00:57,435
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1323
02:01:01,888 --> 02:01:04,028
-Sirius.
-You're dying...

1324
02:01:06,392 --> 02:01:08,032
...both of you.

1325
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:11,850
Harry!

1326
02:01:13,967 --> 02:01:17,366
Expecto Patronum!

1327
02:02:16,462 --> 02:02:17,832
You were right, Hermione.

1328
02:02:18,198 --> 02:02:21,128
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1329
02:02:21,701 --> 02:02:24,131
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
02:02:24,637 --> 02:02:26,717
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1331
02:02:27,173 --> 02:02:28,663
... well, [ had already done it.

1332
02:02:29,042 --> 02:02:31,212
-Does that make sense?
-No.

1333
02:02:31,678 --> 02:02:34,168
But I don’t like flying...!

1334
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:48,830
Bombarda!

1335
02:03:22,295 --> 02:03:24,755
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1336
02:03:25,265 --> 02:03:26,435
...to both of you.

1337
02:03:26,766 --> 02:03:29,346
-l want to go with you.
-One day, perhaps.

1338
02:03:29,869 --> 02:03:32,419
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:34,489
And besides...

1340
02:03:35,608 --> 02:03:38,508
-...you're meant to be here.
-But you're innocent.

1341
02:03:39,078 --> 02:03:40,948
And you know it.

1342
02:03:42,282 --> 02:03:43,952
And for now, that will do.

1343
02:03:46,486 --> 02:03:48,736
l expect you're tired of hearing this...

1344
02:03:50,056 --> 02:03:52,276
...but you look so like your father.

1345
02:03:54,327 --> 02:03:56,057
Except your eyes.

1346
02:03:57,263 --> 02:03:59,283
-You have--
-My mother’s eyes.

1347
02:04:01,501 --> 02:04:05,981
It’s cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1348
02:04:07,206 --> 02:04:08,516
But know this:

1349
02:04:09,809 --> 02:04:12,589
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
02:04:14,347 --> 02:04:16,076
And you can always find them...

1351
02:04:18,718 --> 02:04:20,358
..in here.

1352
02:04:30,964 --> 02:04:33,184
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:01,756
We have to go.

1354
02:05:30,223 --> 02:05:32,563
-Well?
-He’s free. We did it.

1355
02:05:33,059 --> 02:05:34,399
Did what?

1356
02:05:34,794 --> 02:05:36,494
Good night.

1357
02:05:45,505 --> 02:05:46,675
How did you get there?

1358
02:05:47,006 --> 02:05:49,346
l was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:05:50,009 --> 02:05:52,289
-What’s he talking about, Harry?
-I don’t know.

1360
02:05:52,812 --> 02:05:55,912
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:06:22,842 --> 02:06:24,152
Hello, Harry.

1362
02:06:27,947 --> 02:06:29,557
I saw you coming.

1363
02:06:34,353 --> 02:06:36,723
I've looked worse, believe me.

1364
02:06:39,759 --> 02:06:42,539
-You've been sacked.
-No.

1365
02:06:43,096 --> 02:06:45,705
No. I resigned, actually.

1366
02:06:46,232 --> 02:06:47,782
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:06:48,167 --> 02:06:52,827
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:06:53,639 --> 02:06:58,469
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1369
02:06:59,312 --> 02:07:02,272
..-well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:07:02,915 --> 02:07:04,585
-But Dumbledore--
-He has already...

1371
02:07:04,984 --> 02:07:06,624
...tisked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:07:07,019 --> 02:07:09,889
Besides, people like me are....

1373
02:07:10,923 --> 02:07:13,853
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1374
02:07:23,803 --> 02:07:26,053
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1375
02:07:26,539 --> 02:07:28,438
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:07:28,908 --> 02:07:32,008
-Pettigrew escaped.
-Didn’t make any difference?

1377
02:07:32,612 --> 02:07:35,682
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1378
02:07:36,282 --> 02:07:38,472
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:07:39,152 --> 02:07:41,342
It made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:07:46,292 --> 02:07:48,222
If l am proud of anything...

1381
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:51,001
. it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:53,897
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1383
02:07:54,433 --> 02:07:58,153
.. 1 feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:07:59,572 --> 02:08:01,762
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1385
02:08:02,241 --> 02:08:04,521
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:08:05,378 --> 02:08:06,548
Until then...

1387
02:08:08,047 --> 02:08:09,536
... mischief managed.

1388
02:08:44,016 --> 02:08:47,705
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:49,616
Harry.

1390
02:08:50,623 --> 02:08:51,852
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:08:52,191 --> 02:08:54,300
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1392
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:56,660
-What are you talking about?
-Quiet.

1393
02:08:57,096 --> 02:08:59,995
Let the man through.
I didn’t mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:09:00,566 --> 02:09:02,755
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:09:03,236 --> 02:09:04,546
Did not.

1396
02:09:06,105 --> 02:09:09,174
-It’s a Firebolt.
-It’s the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:09:09,775 --> 02:09:11,115
For me?

1398
02:09:11,510 --> 02:09:13,730
-But who sent it?
-No one knows.

1399
02:09:14,213 --> 02:09:15,883
This came with it.

1400
02:09:20,953 --> 02:09:22,413
-Go on, Harry!
-Yeah, let's see.

1401
02:09:22,788 --> 02:09:24,397
How fast is it, Harry?

1402
02:09:43,976 --> 02:09:45,406
Lumos.

1403
02:09:45,778 --> 02:09:47,888
f solemnly swear that [am
up to no good.

1404
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:08,939
Mischief managed.

1405
02:21:14,933 --> 02:21:16,193
Nox.

1406
02:21:19,204 --> 02:21:20,954
