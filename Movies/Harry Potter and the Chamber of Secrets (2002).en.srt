1
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,070
I can’t let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,604
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,913
-Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
-Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,648
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,028
He’s in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:40,007
I'm warning you, if you can’t control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,264
But she’s bored.

8
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,553
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,754
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,921
But I haven’t had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,147
Not one...

12
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,075
..-all summer.

13
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,260
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,066
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:11,597
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,069
...even let you have
Dudley’s second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,721
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:22,541
-Not now. It’s for when the Masons arrive.
-Which should be any minute.

19
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,367
Now, let’s go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

20
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,579
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

21
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,232
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

22
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:36,313
-Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
-l'll be waiting to open the door.

23
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,626
Excellent.

24
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,040
And you?

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,672
'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don’t exist.

26
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,890
Too right, you will.

27
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,341
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

28
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,042
..-and you will not mess it up.

29
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:14,874
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

30
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:22,641
-Who are you?
-Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

31
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,173
Not to be rude or anything...

32
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,984
...but this isn’t a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

33
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,833
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

34
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,032
It’s just that Dobby
has come to tell you....

35
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,832
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

36
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:45,686
-Why don't you sit down?
-Sit down? Sit down?

37
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:53,613
Dobby, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean
to offend you or anything.

38
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,234
Offend Dobby?

39
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,720
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

40
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:04,242
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

41
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,189
You can’t have met
many decent wizards then.

42
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,792
No, I haven't.

43
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,681
That was an awful thing to say.

44
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,694
-Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
-Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

45
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,491
Dobby, please, stop.

46
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,474
Don't mind that. It’s just the cat.

47
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,715
-Bad Dobby.
-Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

48
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,460
Are you all right?

49
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,996
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

50
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,352
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

51
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,376
-Your family?
-The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

52
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,650
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

53
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,440
If they ever knew Dobby was here....

54
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:59,464
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

55
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,353
Harry Potter must not go back...

56
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,933
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

57
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:12,214
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

58
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,943
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

59
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,387
Can't say.

60
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:25,163
-Okay, l understand. You can't say.
-Don't make me talk. I--

61
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,164
-Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
-Bad Dobby.

62
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,300
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole....

63
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,650
Give me the lamp.

64
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,785
Dobby, stop!

65
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,876
-Let me go.
-Get in there and keep quiet.

66
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,986
-What the devil are you doing up here?
-l was just--

67
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,053
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

68
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,220
Sorry.

69
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,530
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

70
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,537
-And fix that door.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,700
See why I've got to go back?

72
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:15,382
I don’t belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

73
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:20,079
-It’s the only place I’ve got friends.
-Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

74
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,364
Well, 1 expect they've been....

75
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,984
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

76
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,709
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

77
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,949
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

78
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,850
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

79
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:45,324
-Give me those. Now.
-No!

80
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,118
Dobby, get back here.

81
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,590
Dobby, please, no.

82
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,851
Harry Potter must say
he’s not going back to school.

83
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,839
I can’t. Hogwarts is my home.

84
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:20,722
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter’s own good.

85
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,964
It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

86
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,476
One plumber said,
“Look at all that water.”

87
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,512
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that’s just the top of it.”

88
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,200
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He’s very disturbed.

89
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,707
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

90
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,120
You're never going back to that school.

91
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:11,006
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

92
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:58,764
Hiya, Harry.

93
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,906
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

94
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,040
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

95
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,651
You better stand back.

96
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,227
Let’s go.

97
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,930
-What was that?
-What was it?

98
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,364
Potter!

99
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,264
Dad, what's going on?

100
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,641
Go. Go. Go.

101
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:37,843
Dad, hurry up.

102
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,773
-Come on.
-Come on, Harry, hurry up.

103
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,597
Petunia, he’s escaping!

104
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,363
-I’ve got you, Harry.
-Come here!

105
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,599
-Let go of me!
-No, boy!

106
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,621
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

107
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,590
-Get off!
-Drive!

108
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,603
-Right.
-Right!

109
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,458
No! No! No! No!

110
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,621
Dad!

111
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,291
Damn.

112
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,021
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

113
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,398
Come on.

114
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,992
Okay, come on.

115
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,018
Okay, come on.

116
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,072
-Think it'd be all right if we had some?
-Yeah, Mum will never know.

117
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,099
It’s not much, but it’s home.

118
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,650
I think it’s brilliant.

119
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,006
Where have you been?

120
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,526
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

121
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,230
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

122
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,470
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

123
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,720
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

124
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,874
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

125
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:01,607
Well, you best hope I don’t put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

126
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,225
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

127
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,055
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

128
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,721
That's it. There we go.

129
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,732
-Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
-Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

130
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,196
Hello.

131
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,942
What did I do?

132
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:28,317
Ginny. She’s been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

133
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,328
-Morning, Weasleys.
-Morning, Dad.

134
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,929
-What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
-Raids?

135
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,043
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

136
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,610
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

137
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,123
Well, now.

138
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,381
And who are you?

139
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,433
Sorry, sir. I’m Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

140
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,794
Good Lord. Are you really?

141
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,520
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

142
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,525
This morning.

143
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,477
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

144
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,275
Did you really? How did it go?

145
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:17,109
I mean-- That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

146
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:22,432
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

147
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,669
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

148
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,144
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

149
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,679
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

150
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,196
-Errol.
-He’s always doing that.

151
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,707
Look, it’s our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

152
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,055
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

153
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,301
-No.
-This lot won't come cheap.

154
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,513
-The spell books alone are very expensive.
-We'll manage.

155
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,525
There’s only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

156
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,477
Right.

157
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,656
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

158
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,715
But Harry’s never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

159
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,154
Floo powder?

160
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:20,206
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it’s done. Yes.

161
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,001
In you go.

162
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,106
That's it.

163
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,291
Diagon Alley.

164
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,612
You see? It’s quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

165
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:42,861
Come on.

166
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,992
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

167
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,542
That’s right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

168
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,664
That's it, very good.

169
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,967
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

170
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,409
Diagonally.

171
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,285
-What did he say, dear?
-Diagonally.

172
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,674
I thought he did.

173
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,370
-Not lost, are you, my dear?
-I'm fine, thank you. I was just going....

174
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:48,253
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

175
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,391
-No. Please--
-Harry?

176
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,774
Hagrid!

177
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,738
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

178
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:06,518
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

179
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,836
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

180
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,457
I was lost, I--

181
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,510
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

182
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:21,546
Me? I was.... 1 was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

183
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,890
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

184
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,583
Harry. Hagrid.

185
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,282
Hello, Hermione.

186
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,164
-It’s so good to see you.
-It’s great to see you too.

187
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,404
What did you do to your glasses?

188
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,413
Oculus Reparo.

189
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,633
I definitely need to remember that one.

190
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:53,416
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

191
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,330
-Okay, bye.
-Thank you. Bye.

192
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,415
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

193
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,347
Harry.

194
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,495
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

195
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,549
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

196
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,052
Here he is.

197
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,765
Mum fancies him.

198
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,005
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

199
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,593
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

200
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,734
It can’t be. Harry Potter?

201
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,259
Harry Potter!

202
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,704
Excuse me, madam.

203
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,257
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.

204
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,674
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

205
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,245
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

206
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,400
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

207
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,929
... Which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

208
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,695
..its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

209
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,400
..-he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

210
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:21,433
...with my entire collected works...

211
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,558
...free of charge.

212
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,959
Now, ladies?

213
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,252
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

214
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,875
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

215
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,808
I'll bet you loved that,
didn’t you, Potter?

216
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,237
Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into
a bookshop without making the front page.

217
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,912
Leave him alone.

218
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,364
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

219
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,504
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

220
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,482
Mr. Potter.

221
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,553
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

222
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,140
Forgive me.

223
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,594
Your scar is legend.

224
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,373
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

225
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,854
Voldemort killed my parents.

226
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,263
He was nothing more than a murderer.

227
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,308
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

228
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,471
Or very foolish.

229
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,166
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

230
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,074
And you must be Miss Granger.

231
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,094
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

232
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,293
Muggles, aren't they?

233
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,139
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

234
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,099
...tatty, secondhand book.

235
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,679
You must be the Weasleys.

236
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,287
It’s mad in here.
Let’s go outside.

237
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,959
-Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
-Lucius.

238
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,678
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

239
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,466
I do hope they’re paying you overtime...

240
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,700
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

241
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:36,172
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

242
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,606
...if they don’t even pay you well for it?

243
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:43,555
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

244
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,015
Clearly.

245
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,557
Associating with Muggles.

246
00:21:56,215 --> 00:22:00,254
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

247
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,583
I'll see you at work.

248
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,143
See you at school.

249
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,610
-10:58. Come on.
-The train will be leaving any moment.

250
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,978
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

251
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,415
Okay.

252
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,179
After you, dear.

253
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,403
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

254
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,908
Let’s go.

255
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,864
-What do you two think you're doing?
-Sorry.

256
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,317
Lost control of the trolley.

257
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,075
-Why can’t we get through?
-I don’t know.

258
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,487
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

259
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:23,726
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.

260
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,330
Harry, if we can’t get through...

261
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,379
... maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

262
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:34,697
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

263
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,351
The car.

264
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,928
Ron, I should tell you...

265
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,673
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

266
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,261
Right.

267
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,604
Okay.

268
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,920
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

269
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,541
Come on, then. Let’s go lower.
We need to find the train.

270
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,204
Okay.

271
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,086
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

272
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,968
We can't be far behind.

273
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,579
-Do you hear that?
-We must be getting close.

274
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:45,182
Hold on.

275
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,647
Harry!

276
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,158
Hold on!

277
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,910
Take my hand!

278
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:29,573
Hold on!

279
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,055
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

280
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,978
-l think we found the train.
-Yeah.

281
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,145
Welcome home.

282
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,529
Up! Up!

283
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,517
It’s not working!

284
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,973
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

285
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,433
Stop! Stop! Stop!

286
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,858
-My wand. Look at my wand.
-Be thankful it’s not your neck.

287
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,670
-What’s happening?
-I don’t know.

288
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,369
Come on, go! Fast!

289
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,462
Scabbers, you're okay.

290
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,087
The car!

291
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,400
Dad's gonna kill me.

292
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,251
See you, Hedwig.

293
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,921
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

294
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,984
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 9 34...

295
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,350
...we almost get killed by a tree....

296
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,014
Clearly someone doesn’t want me
here this year.

297
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,634
Well, take a good look, lads.

298
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,617
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

299
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,966
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

300
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:35,118
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

301
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,738
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

302
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,148
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

303
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,862
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

304
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,136
...that’s been on these grounds
since before you were born.

305
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,119
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.

306
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:55,746
Silence.

307
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:03,495
l assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

308
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:07,745
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

309
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,368
-As it is--
-They are not.

310
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:17,415
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

311
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,592
Headmaster...

312
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:24,171
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

313
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:28,353
-As such--
-l am well aware of our bylaws, Severus...

314
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,514
. having written
quite a few of them myself.

315
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,070
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

316
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:40,024
..jit is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

317
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,006
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

318
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,582
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

319
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,974
You're going to expel us, aren’t you?

320
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,565
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

321
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:57,508
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

322
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:02,726
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

323
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,822
Morning, everyone.

324
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,042
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning, Professor Sprout.

325
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:37,305
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

326
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,456
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

327
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:44,476
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

328
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,777
Yes, Miss Granger?

329
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,192
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

330
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:54,061
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

331
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:59,236
It’s also quite dangerous. The Mandrake’s
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

332
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,508
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

333
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,360
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

334
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,527
...their cries won't kill you yet.

335
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,265
But they could knock you out for several hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

336
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,206
...for auditory protection.

337
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:17,465
So could you please put them on,
tight away? Quickly.

338
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,630
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

339
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,769
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

340
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,939
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

341
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,253
Got it? And...

342
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,554
..-now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

343
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:40,117
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

344
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,139
Longbottom’s been neglecting
his earmuffs.

345
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,505
-No, ma’am, he’s just fainted.
-Yes, well, just leave him there.

346
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:55,504
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

347
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,237
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

348
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,936
-There’s Nearly Headless Nick.
-Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

349
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,813
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

350
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,481
Say it. I'm doomed.

351
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,415
-You're doomed.
-Hi, Harry.

352
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,286
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

353
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,188
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

354
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,533
Ron, is that your owl?

355
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,847
Bloody bird’s a menace.

356
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,690
Oh, no.

357
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,089
Look, everyone.
Weasley'’s got himself a Howler.

358
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:20,587
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

359
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,040
Ronald Weasley!

360
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:38,234
How dare you steal that car!
! am absolutely disgusted!

361
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,557
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...

362
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,127
.and it's entirely your fault!

363
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:48,283
if you put another toe out of line...

364
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,790
...we'll bring you straight home!

365
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,028
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.

366
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,908
Your father and { are so proud.

367
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:24,267
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

368
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,563
Me.

369
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,145
Gilderoy Lockhart...

370
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,528
..-Order of Merlin, Third Class...

371
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:36,028
..-honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

372
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,151
...and five times winner...

373
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:45,028
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

374
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,421
But I don’t talk about that.

375
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:51,759
I didn’t get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

376
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,574
Now, be warned.

377
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,000
It is my job to arm you...

378
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:06,086
.. against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

379
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,729
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

380
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,875
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst 1 am here.

381
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,120
I must ask you not to scream.

382
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,893
It might provoke them.

383
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,023
Cornish pixies?

384
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,044
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

385
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,091
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

386
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:36,183
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

387
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,411
Let's see what you make of them.

388
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,971
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

389
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,754
-You just stay there!
-Please, get me down!

390
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,764
-Get off me!
-Stop. Hold still!

391
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,508
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

392
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:40,638
l'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

393
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,827
What do we do now?

394
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,908
immobulus!

395
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,598
Why is it always me?

396
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,587
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

397
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,307
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

398
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,824
What--? I don’t believe it.

399
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:21,366
-Where you think you're going, Flint?
-Quidditch practice.

400
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:25,736
-l booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
-Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

401
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,602
I smell trouble.

402
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,575
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

403
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,249
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker.”

404
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,189
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

405
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,799
-Malfoy?
-That’s right.

406
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,721
And that’s not all
that’s new this year.

407
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,915
Those are Nimbus 2001s.
How did you get those?

408
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,339
A gift from Draco’s father.

409
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,048
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

410
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,302
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

411
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,422
They got in on pure talent.

412
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:13,381
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

413
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,394
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

414
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,004
You okay, Ron?

415
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,817
Say something.

416
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:44,258
-Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
-No, Colin, get out of the way.

417
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,497
Let’s take him to Hagrid’s.

418
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,788
He’ll know what to do.

419
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,890
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

420
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,230
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

421
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:13,118
-Okay.
-Better out than in.

422
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:18,768
-Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
-Malfoy. He called Hermione....

423
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,638
Well, I don’t know
exactly what it means.

424
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,955
He called me a Mudblood.

425
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:32,735
-He did not.
-What’s a Mudblood?

426
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,411
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood’s a really
foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.

427
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:41,886
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

428
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:46,537
It’s not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

429
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:52,399
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

430
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:57,250
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

431
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,419
That's horrible.

432
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,797
It’s disgusting.

433
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,198
And it’s codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

434
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,759
Why, there isn’t a wizard alive today
that’s not half-blood or less.

435
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:15,346
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

436
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,004
Come here.

437
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:25,057
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

438
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,283
Harry, Harry, Harry.

439
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,788
Can you possibly imagine...

440
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,070
...a better way to serve detention...

441
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,471
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

442
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,200
Not really.

443
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:53,138
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

444
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,778
Remember that.

445
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,684
Come.

446
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,960
Come...

447
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,009
...to me.

448
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,881
-What?
-Sorry?

449
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,164
That voice.

450
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,909
Voice?

451
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:27,744
-Didn’t you hear it?
-What are you talking about, Harry?

452
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:32,073
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

453
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:36,253
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

454
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,015
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

455
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,616
Spooky.

456
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,837
Blood.

457
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,371
i smell blood.

458
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,694
Let me rip you.

459
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,404
Let me kill you.

460
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,940
Kilt

461
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,222
Kilt

462
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,788
-KGHE
-Harry!

463
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,360
-Did you hear it?
-Hear what?

464
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:17,846
-That voice.
-Voice? What voice?

465
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,909
l heard it first in Lockhart’s office.
And then again just--

466
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,507
it’s time.

467
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,746
It’s moving.
I think it’s going to kill.

468
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,587
-Kill?
-Harry, wait! Not so fast!

469
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,446
Strange.

470
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:05,189
-I've never seen spiders act like that.
-I don't like spiders.

471
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,657
What's that?

472
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:19,333
“The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware.”

473
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,046
It’s written in blood.

474
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,163
Oh, no.

475
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,125
It’s Filch’s cat.

476
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:36,928
It’s Mrs. Norris.

477
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,661
“Enemies of the Heir, beware.”

478
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:59,575
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

479
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,571
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

480
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:08,281
Potter?

481
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:10,542
What are you...?

482
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,131
Mrs. Norris?

483
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:21,575
-You've murdered my cat.
-No. No.

484
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,596
PIL kill you.

485
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,580
-V'Il kill, you!
-Argus!

486
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,198
Argus, l....

487
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:38,535
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

488
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,567
Everyone except...

489
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:44,537
..-you three.

490
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,374
Ravenclaws, follow me.

491
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,982
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

492
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,109
Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn’t there.

493
00:45:58,623 --> 00:46:01,433
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

494
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,471
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.

495
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,433
Ask him.
It’s him that’s done it.

496
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,304
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

497
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:16,403
It’s not true, sir. 1 swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

498
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:20,974
-Rubbish.
-If l might, headmaster?

499
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:26,198
Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

500
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,955
However...

501
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,130
...the circumstances are suspicious.

502
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:36,727
I, for one, don’t recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

503
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,450
I'm afraid that’s my doing, Severus.

504
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,886
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

505
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,367
That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

506
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:49,337
We'd just found him when he said....

507
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:55,312
-Yes, Miss Granger?
-When I said 1 wasn't hungry.

508
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,658
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

509
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:08,347
-Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
-My cat has been Petrified.

510
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,990
-l want to see some punishment!
-We will be able to cure her, Argus.

511
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:20,824
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

512
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:25,472
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

513
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,834
And in the meantime...

514
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:32,122
... 1 strongly recommend caution...

515
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,014
...to all.

516
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:49,317
-It’s a bit strange, isn’t it?
-Strange?

517
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,330
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

518
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:56,967
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It’s just strange.

519
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,548
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

520
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,402
Are you mad?

521
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:07,577
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn’t a good sign.

522
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,433
She's right, you know.

523
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,111
Could I have your attention,
please?

524
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:24,759
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

525
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,683
...into water goblets.

526
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,366
Like so.

527
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:35,051
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

528
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,645
Now it’s your turn.
Who would like to go first?

529
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:48,081
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto.”

530
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,103
Vera Verto!

531
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,811
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.

532
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:06,375
-Yes, Miss Granger?
-Professor...

533
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:10,501
...l was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

534
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,298
Very well.

535
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,707
You all know, of course...

536
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:25,526
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

537
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:30,063
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

538
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:34,048
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

539
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:39,622
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

540
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:46,248
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

541
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,810
-One did not.
-Three guesses who.

542
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,060
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

543
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,304
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

544
00:49:56,861 --> 00:50:00,901
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

545
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,472
In other words, pure-bloods.

546
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:08,824
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

547
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,267
Now, according to legend...

548
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,990
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

549
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:19,804
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

550
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:24,317
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

551
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,652
.-until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

552
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,406
The Heir alone...

553
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,202
..-would be able to open the Chamber...

554
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:38,888
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

555
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:42,597
...purge the school
of all those who...

556
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:47,562
...in Slytherin’s view,
were unworthy to study magic.

557
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,649
Muggle-borns.

558
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:55,142
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

559
00:50:55,753 --> 00:50:58,793
No such chamber has been found.

560
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:03,893
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

561
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:07,576
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

562
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,195
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

563
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:15,459
It is said to be the home...

564
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,502
...of a monster.

565
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,667
Do you think it’s true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

566
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:30,974
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall’s
worried. All the teachers are.

567
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:35,055
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it really has been opened, that means--

568
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:39,153
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

569
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:43,637
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

570
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,675
-If you're talking about Malfoy--
-Of course. You heard him.

571
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:48,691
"You'll be next, Mudbloods.”

572
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:51,353
l heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

573
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,622
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

574
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,639
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

575
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,168
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

576
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:05,678
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

577
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,997
Mind you, it would be difficult.

578
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:11,051
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

579
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:15,515
..and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

580
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,043
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

581
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,909
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

582
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:32,131
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another.”

583
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:36,156
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

584
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:39,747
-Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
-Exactly.

585
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,724
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

586
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,080
-How long will it take to make?
-A month.

587
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,121
A month?

588
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,836
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

589
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,279
..-he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

590
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,510
I know.

591
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,399
But it’s the only plan we've got.

592
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:53,798
Another goal for Slytherin!

593
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:58,455
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

594
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:01,406
Yeah!

595
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,422
Yeah!

596
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:29,948
All right there, Scarhead?

597
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,530
Watch yourself, Harry!

598
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,793
Wood, look out!

599
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,180
Blimey! Harry’s got himself
a rogue Bludger.

600
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,244
That's been tampered with, that has.

601
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:01,366
Pll stop it.

602
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:05,735
No! Even with a proper wand,
it’s too risky. You could hit Harry.

603
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,641
Training for the ballet, Potter?

604
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:06,888
You'll never catch me, Potter.

605
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:38,884
Let’s go.

606
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:43,788
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!

607
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:52,514
Finite Incantatem!

608
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,013
-Thank you.
-Are you okay?

609
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:03,185
No. I think my arm is broken.

610
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,953
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

611
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,163
-Not you.
-Boy doesn't know what he’s saying.

612
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,787
This won't hurt a bit.

613
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,960
Brackium Emendo!

614
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,095
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

615
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,604
...but the point is...

616
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:41,881
..-you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

617
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,892
Broken? There’s no bones left.

618
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,653
Much more flexible, though.

619
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,821
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

620
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,165
Should have been brought
straight to me.

621
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,787
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back....

622
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,580
You will be able to, won't you?

623
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,688
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

624
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:09,808
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

625
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,913
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

626
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,476
Kill.

627
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:26,869
Kill.

628
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:35,276
Time to kill.

629
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:42,682
Hello.

630
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,514
Dobby?

631
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:47,866
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

632
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:51,898
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

633
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:56,562
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

634
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,037
Indeed. Yes, sir.

635
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:05,818
-You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
-At least you would be away from here.

636
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,943
Harry Potter must go home.

637
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:12,598
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see--

638
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:16,170
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

639
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,876
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

640
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:23,674
Dobby had to iron his hands.

641
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:30,363
You better clear off before my bones
come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.

642
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:38,133
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

643
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,365
I don’t suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

644
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,405
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

645
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:49,002
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

646
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,299
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

647
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:56,099
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

648
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,500
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

649
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,811
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

650
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:18,814
This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf’s enslavement.

651
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:24,089
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

652
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,049
Listen.

653
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:29,725
Listen!

654
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:33,366
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

655
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,596
Harry Potter must not stay here...

656
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:41,040
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

657
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,805
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

658
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:47,152
I shouldn't have said that.

659
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,891
-Bad Dobby! Bad!
-Stop it!

660
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:55,933
Stop it, Dobby!

661
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:01,154
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

662
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:06,384
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

663
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,740
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

664
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:22,898
Put him here.

665
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:30,191
-What happened?
-There’s been another attack.

666
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:35,814
I think he’s been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

667
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:41,417
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

668
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,529
What can this mean, Albus?

669
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,736
It means...

670
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,768
...that our students
are in great danger.

671
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,265
-What should I tell the staff?
-The truth.

672
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,285
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

673
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,662
It is as we feared, Minerva.

674
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:13,262
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

675
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:20,290
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

676
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,364
Of course.
Don't you see?

677
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,527
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

678
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,784
-Now he’s taught Draco how to do it.
-Maybe.

679
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:33,053
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

680
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:37,070
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

681
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:41,194
...in the middle of the girls’ lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

682
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:44,925
No. No one ever comes in here.

683
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:48,308
-Why?
-Moaning Myrtle.

684
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:50,522
Who?

685
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,781
Moaning Myrtle.

686
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:56,153
-Who’s Moaning Myrtle?
-I’m Moaning Myrtle.

687
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,585
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

688
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,701
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

689
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:11,234
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

690
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,725
She's a little sensitive.

691
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:27,194
Gather round!

692
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:32,157
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

693
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:35,686
Can you all hear me?

694
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,910
Excellent.

695
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:41,825
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

696
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:46,575
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

697
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:51,387
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

698
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:54,372
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.

699
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:58,078
For full details,
see my published works.

700
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,983
Let me introduce my assistant...

701
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:08,846
...Professor Snape.

702
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:14,939
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

703
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,225
I don’t want any of you
youngsters to worry.

704
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:22,007
You'll still have your Potions master
when I’m through with him. Never fear.

705
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,138
One.

706
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:40,973
Two.

707
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:44,565
-Three!
-Expelliarmus!

708
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:55,856
-Do you think he’s all right?
-Who cares?

709
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,962
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

710
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:03,499
...but if you don’t mind me saying, it was
pretty obvious what you were about to do.

711
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:07,067
If ! had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

712
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,670
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

713
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:15,216
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

714
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:19,647
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

715
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:24,927
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

716
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:28,685
Weasley’s wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

717
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,799
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

718
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:36,993
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?

719
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,931
Malfoy, perhaps?

720
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,941
-Good luck, Potter.
-Thank you, sir.

721
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,965
Wands at the ready.

722
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:04,448
-Scared, Potter?
-You wish.

723
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:16,751
On the count of three...

724
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:20,942
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

725
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:24,738
We don’t want any accidents here.
One.

726
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:29,193
-Two.
-Everte Statum!

727
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:43,117
Rictusempra!

728
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,950
l said disarm only.

729
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:58,069
Serpensortia!

730
01:08:06,983 --> 01:08:09,443
Don’t move, Potter.
Il get rid of it for you.

731
01:08:09,953 --> 01:08:14,733
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!

732
01:08:57,934 --> 01:09:00,274
Vipera Evanesca.

733
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,390
What are you playing at?

734
01:09:22,457 --> 01:09:24,827
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn’t you tell us?

735
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,318
-I'm a what?
-You can talk to snakes.

736
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:32,424
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

737
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:36,715
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.

738
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:40,683
No, they can’t.
It’s not a very common gift, Harry.

739
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,134
This is bad.

740
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,792
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin--

741
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:50,487
-That’s what you said to it.
-You were there. You heard me.

742
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:54,517
l heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

743
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:57,678
I spoke a different language?

744
01:09:59,095 --> 01:10:01,205
But I didn’t realize--

745
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:04,094
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

746
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,140
I don’t know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

747
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:10,295
Harry, listen to me.

748
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:13,427
There’s a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

749
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:17,923
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

750
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,615
Exactly.

751
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,876
Now the whole school’s gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

752
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,203
But I’m not.

753
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,891
I can’t be.

754
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,040
He lived a thousand years ago.

755
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:36,303
For all we know, you could be.

756
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,876
I'll see you back in the common room.

757
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:29,331
! want blood.

758
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:37,145
They all must die.

759
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,077
Kill.

760
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,837
Kill.

761
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,886
Kill.

762
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:50,072
Time to kill.

763
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:26,444
Caught in the act.

764
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,572
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

765
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:31,501
Mark my words.

766
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:35,701
No. Mr. Filch! You don’t understand--

767
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:04,679
Professor...

768
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:06,281
... swear I didn’t.

769
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:09,456
This is out of my hands, Potter.

770
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,835
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

771
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,353
Sherbet Lemon.

772
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,480
Professor Dumbledore?

773
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,598
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

774
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:35,781
I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

775
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:41,305
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

776
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,244
But I stand by what I said last year.

777
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,838
You would have done well in Slytherin.

778
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,588
You're wrong.

779
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,276
Harry?

780
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,777
Professor.

781
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,560
Your bird....
There was nothing I could do.

782
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,523
-He just caught fire.
-And about time too.

783
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,815
He’s been looking dreadful for days.

784
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,044
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

785
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:42,041
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

786
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:45,565
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

787
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:47,982
...and then they are...

788
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:51,071
...reborn from the ashes.

789
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,165
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

790
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:06,355
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

791
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:09,486
Their tears have healing powers.

792
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:15,125
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

793
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:18,342
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn’t Harry.

794
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:22,295
I'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

795
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:25,783
Relax.

796
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,478
I do not believe...

797
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:31,814
-...that Harry attacked anyone.
-Of course you don't.

798
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:38,405
Right. Well, l'll....

799
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,644
-I'll just wait outside, then.
-Yes.

800
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:48,921
-You don't think it was me, professor?
-No, Harry.

801
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,727
I do not think it was you.

802
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,655
But I must ask you...

803
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:59,044
..is there something
you wish to tell me?

804
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:07,688
No, sir.

805
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,400
Nothing.

806
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:14,495
Very well, then.

807
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,510
Off you go.

808
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,770
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

809
01:17:58,374 --> 01:17:59,894
Crabbe and Goyle.

810
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:02,706
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

811
01:18:03,212 --> 01:18:06,052
..-can’t burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

812
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:09,152
-How?
-I’ve got it all worked out.

813
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:11,902
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

814
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:14,818
Simple, but powerful.

815
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:17,290
Now, once they're asleep...

816
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:20,536
..-hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

817
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:22,766
..-and put on their uniforms.

818
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:26,035
-Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
-I’ve already got mine.

819
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:29,412
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

820
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:31,871
I got this off her robes.

821
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:34,588
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

822
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,477
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

823
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:52,005
Ron, maybe ! should do it.

824
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,271
Yeah. Right.

825
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:57,932
Wingardium Leviosa.

826
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:10,141
Cool.

827
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:35,079
How thick could you get?

828
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:37,200
Come on, let’s get them.

829
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:43,619
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

830
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,017
Add the hairs.

831
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,314
Essence of Crabbe.

832
01:20:00,696 --> 01:20:02,366
Cheers.

833
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,447
I think I'm gonna be sick.

834
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,255
Me too.

835
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,879
Harry?

836
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:06,931
Ron.

837
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,763
Bloody hell!

838
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:12,822
We still sound like ourselves.

839
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,818
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

840
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,225
-Bloody hell.
-Excellent.

841
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:21,031
-But where's Hermione?
che.

842
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:24,140
I don’t think I'm going.
You go on without me.

843
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,170
Hermione, are you okay?

844
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,038
Just go. You're wasting time.

845
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:32,913
Come on.

846
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:39,585
I think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

847
01:21:42,965 --> 01:21:45,135
Excuse me.

848
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:48,936
What are you doing d--?

849
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:51,148
I mean, what are you doing down here?

850
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:55,708
I happen to be a school prefect.

851
01:21:56,211 --> 01:22:00,131
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

852
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,860
What are your names again?

853
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:06,762
-I'm....
-Crabbe, Goyle, where have you two been?

854
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:10,083
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

855
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,980
Why are you wearing glasses?

856
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:17,587
-Reading.
-Reading?

857
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,121
I didn’t know you could read.

858
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,113
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

859
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:28,322
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

860
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,102
Well, sit down.

861
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:45,527
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

862
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:49,598
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

863
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:52,889
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

864
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:56,924
Stomachache.

865
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:03,391
You know, I’m surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

866
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,316
l suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

867
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:08,991
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

868
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:12,791
-...that ever happened to this place.
-You’re wrong!

869
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:21,779
What?

870
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:25,317
You think there’s someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

871
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,044
Well? Do you?

872
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:30,511
Harry Potter?

873
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:38,541
Good one, Goyle.

874
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:40,251
You're absolutely right.

875
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:42,723
Saint Potter.

876
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:46,382
And people actually think
that he’s the Heir of Slytherin?

877
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,772
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

878
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:56,512
You know I don’t, Goyle.
Il told you yesterday.

879
01:23:57,933 --> 01:24:00,153
How many times do I have to tell you?

880
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:03,076
Is this yours?

881
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:09,853
But my father did say this:

882
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:13,062
It’s been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

883
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:17,452
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

884
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:22,353
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

885
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:26,871
So it’s only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

886
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,606
As for me...

887
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:31,897
...[ hope it’s Granger.

888
01:24:32,334 --> 01:24:34,264
What's the matter with you two?

889
01:24:34,703 --> 01:24:36,893
You're acting very odd.

890
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:39,302
It’s his stomachache.

891
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,551
Calm down.

892
01:24:45,981 --> 01:24:47,731
Scar.

893
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:52,847
Hair.

894
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:01,274
Hey! Where are you going?

895
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:05,675
That was close.

896
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:08,141
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

897
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,244
Go away.

898
01:25:10,973 --> 01:25:14,403
Wait till you see. It’s awful.

899
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:18,362
Hermione?

900
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:20,177
Are you okay?

901
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,967
Do you remember me telling you...

902
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:27,133
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

903
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:31,319
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode’s robes.

904
01:25:34,196 --> 01:25:35,566
Look at my face.

905
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:39,038
Look at your tail.

906
01:25:45,907 --> 01:25:47,167
Have you spoken to Hermione?

907
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:49,759
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

908
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:52,705
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

909
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,369
What's this?

910
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,089
Yuck!

911
01:26:05,394 --> 01:26:07,854
Looks like Moaning Myrtle’s
flooded the bathroom.

912
01:26:24,413 --> 01:26:28,043
-Come to throw something else at me?
-Why would I throw something at you?

913
01:26:28,984 --> 01:26:32,554
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

914
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:36,410
...-and someone thinks it’s funny
to throw a book at me.

915
01:26:37,059 --> 01:26:39,609
But it can’t hurt if someone
throws something at you.

916
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,237
I mean, it'll just go
tight through you.

917
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:47,434
Sure! Let’s all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

918
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:50,416
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

919
01:26:50,906 --> 01:26:53,976
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

920
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:58,809
-But who threw it at you, anyway?
-I don’t know. I didn’t see them.

921
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:03,401
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

922
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:07,369
..and it fell through the top
of my head.

923
01:27:37,953 --> 01:27:40,143
"Tom Marvolo Riddle.”

924
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:12,368
My name...

925
01:28:12,821 --> 01:28:15,401
...is Harry...

926
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:19,229
...Potter.

927
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:37,281
Do you know anything...

928
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:44,603
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

929
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,230
Can you...

930
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,720
..-tell me?

931
01:30:03,265 --> 01:30:06,285
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what’s going on here?

932
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,188
Are you Tom Riddle?

933
01:30:12,641 --> 01:30:14,221
Hello, can you hear me?

934
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:36,550
Riddle!

935
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:38,705
Come.

936
01:30:39,067 --> 01:30:40,817
Professor Dumbledore.

937
01:30:43,238 --> 01:30:45,138
Dumbledore?

938
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:49,748
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

939
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:53,275
Yes, professor. 1 suppose l....

940
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:55,778
l had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

941
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:59,168
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

942
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:02,208
About the school as well?
I don’t have a home to go to.

943
01:31:02,724 --> 01:31:05,214
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

944
01:31:05,727 --> 01:31:07,947
l understand, Tom, but I’m afraid...

945
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:11,610
... Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

946
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:16,083
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught....

947
01:31:18,907 --> 01:31:20,747
Is there something...

948
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:23,693
..-you wish to tell me?

949
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:27,366
No, sir. Nothing.

950
01:31:34,456 --> 01:31:37,116
Very well, then. Off you go.

951
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:39,299
Good night, sir.

952
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:18,213
-Let’s get you out of there.
-Evening, Hagrid.

953
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,710
I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid.
I don't think you meant it to kill anyone....

954
01:32:23,405 --> 01:32:25,425
You can’t. You don’t understand.

955
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:28,624
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

956
01:32:29,177 --> 01:32:31,727
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

957
01:32:32,347 --> 01:32:35,097
It wasn’t him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

958
01:32:35,784 --> 01:32:37,683
Monsters don’t make good pets, Hagrid.

959
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:39,549
-Now, stand aside.
-No!

960
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:41,651
-Stand aside, Hagrid.
-No!

961
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,487
Cistem Aperio!

962
01:32:50,632 --> 01:32:52,712
Arania Exumai!

963
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:55,158
Aragog!

964
01:32:55,503 --> 01:32:56,583
Aragog!

965
01:32:57,272 --> 01:32:58,501
I can’t let you go.

966
01:32:59,207 --> 01:33:02,107
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

967
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:06,686
Hagrid!

968
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:40,575
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

969
01:33:41,249 --> 01:33:43,858
It can’t be Hagrid.
It just can’t be.

970
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:47,955
We don’t even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.

971
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:51,692
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

972
01:33:52,427 --> 01:33:55,906
Look, Hagrid’s our friend. Why don’t
we just go and ask him about it?

973
01:33:56,598 --> 01:33:58,938
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

974
01:33:59,434 --> 01:34:02,804
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?”

975
01:34:03,438 --> 01:34:06,248
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

976
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:07,845
No.

977
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,910
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

978
01:34:14,549 --> 01:34:18,559
It’s Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

979
01:34:19,287 --> 01:34:22,507
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing up to do.

980
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:26,193
But once their acne’s cleared up, we'll
be able to chop them up and stew them...

981
01:34:26,794 --> 01:34:29,693
..and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

982
01:34:31,533 --> 01:34:34,083
In the meantime, though, you three...

983
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:37,382
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

984
01:34:45,647 --> 01:34:47,317
Hello, Neville.

985
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:50,839
Harry, I don’t know who did it,
but you'd better come.

986
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,009
Come on!

987
01:35:15,777 --> 01:35:19,317
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

988
01:35:19,981 --> 01:35:21,941
Unless it wasn’t a student.

989
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:25,403
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

990
01:35:25,987 --> 01:35:27,217
And they found it.

991
01:35:28,122 --> 01:35:30,342
Tom Riddle’s diary is gone.

992
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,367
All right, listen up.

993
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:36,245
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

994
01:35:36,764 --> 01:35:38,404
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

995
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,460
Not to mention they’re dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

996
01:35:42,003 --> 01:35:45,043
-...if they fly anywhere near him.
-Well, that too.

997
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:48,048
Professor McGonagall.

998
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:51,068
-This match has been canceled.
-We can’t cancel Quidditch.

999
01:35:51,613 --> 01:35:55,973
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1000
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:59,091
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1001
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:02,007
There’s something
the both of you have to see.

1002
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:07,585
Il warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1003
01:36:16,404 --> 01:36:17,454
Hermione!

1004
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,352
She was found near the library...

1005
01:36:20,808 --> 01:36:22,618
.. along with this.

1006
01:36:24,312 --> 01:36:26,802
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1007
01:36:27,315 --> 01:36:28,605
No.

1008
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:45,047
Could I have your attention, please?

1009
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:50,450
Because of recent events, these new rules
will be put into effect immediately:

1010
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:55,982
“All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1011
01:36:56,778 --> 01:37:00,348
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1012
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:03,645
No exceptions.”

1013
01:37:04,686 --> 01:37:06,496
I should tell you this:

1014
01:37:06,921 --> 01:37:10,521
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1015
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:14,371
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1016
01:37:26,274 --> 01:37:28,854
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
l can’t believe it’s him...

1017
01:37:29,377 --> 01:37:31,397
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1018
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:34,625
...he’ll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1019
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:36,263
But you heard McGonagall.

1020
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:39,483
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1021
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:42,525
I think it’s time to get
my dad’s old cloak out again.

1022
01:37:56,437 --> 01:37:57,957
Who's there?

1023
01:38:01,976 --> 01:38:03,346
Hello?

1024
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:05,518
Hello?

1025
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:10,661
-What’s that for?
-Nothing. I was expecting....

1026
01:38:11,352 --> 01:38:14,751
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
[ just made a pot of tea.

1027
01:38:17,959 --> 01:38:19,979
Hagrid, are you okay?

1028
01:38:20,428 --> 01:38:22,978
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1029
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:25,785
Did you hear about Hermione?

1030
01:38:26,501 --> 01:38:29,691
Yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1031
01:38:30,505 --> 01:38:33,695
Look, we have to ask you something.

1032
01:38:35,843 --> 01:38:38,913
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1033
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:43,669
What you had to understand
about that is--

1034
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:47,019
Quick, under the cloak.

1035
01:38:47,889 --> 01:38:50,579
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1036
01:38:57,398 --> 01:39:00,088
-Professor Dumbledore, sir.
-Good evening, Hagrid.

1037
01:39:00,635 --> 01:39:02,775
I wonder, could we...?

1038
01:39:03,237 --> 01:39:05,427
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1039
01:39:05,907 --> 01:39:07,107
That’s Dad’s boss.

1040
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:10,572
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1041
01:39:11,179 --> 01:39:15,049
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1042
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:18,590
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1043
01:39:19,153 --> 01:39:21,993
-The Ministry's got to act.
-But I never--

1044
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:24,140
You know I never, professor.

1045
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:27,245
I want it understood, Cornelius...

1046
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,405
...that Hagrid...

1047
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:31,817
...-has my full confidence.

1048
01:39:32,266 --> 01:39:35,606
Albus, look,
Hagrid’s record is against him.

1049
01:39:36,237 --> 01:39:38,457
-I’ve got to take him.
-Take me?

1050
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:40,960
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1051
01:39:41,509 --> 01:39:44,819
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1052
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,583
Already here, Fudge?

1053
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:49,152
Good.

1054
01:39:50,218 --> 01:39:52,648
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1055
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:54,994
Believe me...

1056
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:59,179
...l take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your....

1057
01:40:01,562 --> 01:40:03,522
You call this a house?

1058
01:40:04,866 --> 01:40:05,766
No.

1059
01:40:06,067 --> 01:40:09,497
l simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1060
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:13,706
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1061
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:18,934
The other governors and I have decided
it’s time for you to step aside.

1062
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:23,698
This is an order of suspension.

1063
01:40:29,624 --> 01:40:32,584
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1064
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:40,553
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1065
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:43,852
Well, what, with all these attacks...

1066
01:40:44,305 --> 01:40:46,735
...there’ll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1067
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:51,251
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1068
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:53,909
You can’t take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1069
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:56,698
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1070
01:40:57,184 --> 01:40:59,354
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1071
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:01,250
You think so?

1072
01:41:01,622 --> 01:41:03,842
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1073
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:07,893
If the governors desire my removal...

1074
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:11,646
...[ will, of course, step aside.

1075
01:41:13,701 --> 01:41:15,661
However...

1076
01:41:16,604 --> 01:41:20,584
..-you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1077
01:41:21,309 --> 01:41:22,979
...to those who...

1078
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:25,427
ask for it.

1079
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,570
Admirable sentiments.

1080
01:41:35,022 --> 01:41:36,602
Shall we?

1081
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:50,276
Fudge.

1082
01:41:52,206 --> 01:41:53,816
Come, Hagrid.

1083
01:41:55,142 --> 01:41:56,512
Well?

1084
01:41:57,378 --> 01:41:58,308
If...

1085
01:41:58,846 --> 01:42:01,096
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1086
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:05,862
...then all they’d have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1087
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:08,901
Yep. That would lead them right.

1088
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:11,090
That's all Il have to say.

1089
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:16,340
And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1090
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:21,917
Good boy.

1091
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:30,179
Hagrid’s right.

1092
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:33,191
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1093
01:42:33,714 --> 01:42:35,174
Look.

1094
01:42:41,455 --> 01:42:43,035
Come on.

1095
01:42:46,961 --> 01:42:48,741
Come on, Fang.

1096
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,481
Come on.

1097
01:43:08,816 --> 01:43:09,956
What?

1098
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:13,124
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders.”

1099
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:15,998
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1100
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:22,279
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
“follow the butterflies”?

1101
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:00,996
Harry, I don’t like this.

1102
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,250
-Harry, I don’t like this at all.
-Shush!

1103
01:44:21,188 --> 01:44:23,408
Can we go back now?

1104
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:25,411
Come on.

1105
01:45:15,342 --> 01:45:17,772
Who is it?

1106
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:19,739
Don't panic.

1107
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:21,557
Hagrid?

1108
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,549
Is that you?

1109
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:26,018
We're friends of Hagrid’s.

1110
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:47,148
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1111
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,315
Yes.

1112
01:45:49,643 --> 01:45:52,953
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1113
01:45:53,581 --> 01:45:56,331
He’s in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1114
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,991
They think it’s Hagrid.

1115
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:02,613
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1116
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:05,310
That's a lie.

1117
01:46:06,093 --> 01:46:08,673
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1118
01:46:09,663 --> 01:46:12,183
-Then you're not the monster?
-No.

1119
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:15,360
The monster was born in the castle.

1120
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:20,600
l came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1121
01:46:21,842 --> 01:46:23,272
Harry.

1122
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:29,389
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1123
01:46:30,117 --> 01:46:32,747
We do not speak of it.

1124
01:46:33,454 --> 01:46:38,344
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1125
01:46:39,193 --> 01:46:40,743
But have you seen it?

1126
01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:46,759
Il never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1127
01:46:47,635 --> 01:46:50,415
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1128
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:54,920
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1129
01:46:55,643 --> 01:46:57,423
-Harry!
-What?

1130
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:13,154
Well, thank you.

1131
01:47:14,461 --> 01:47:16,361
We'll just go.

1132
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:18,647
Go?

1133
01:47:19,033 --> 01:47:20,583
I think not.

1134
01:47:20,968 --> 01:47:25,768
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1135
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:28,717
But I cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1136
01:47:29,176 --> 01:47:32,986
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1137
01:47:33,714 --> 01:47:37,024
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1138
01:47:37,651 --> 01:47:39,260
Can we panic now?

1139
01:47:50,197 --> 01:47:51,897
Know any spells?

1140
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:55,079
One, but it’s not powerful
enough for all of them.

1141
01:47:55,636 --> 01:47:58,036
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1142
01:48:11,885 --> 01:48:13,025
Let’s go!

1143
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:20,135
Arania Exumai!

1144
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:26,869
Go!

1145
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:46,829
Glad we’re out of there.

1146
01:48:54,061 --> 01:48:56,111
Arania Exumai!

1147
01:49:02,102 --> 01:49:05,412
-Thanks for that.
-Don't mention it.

1148
01:49:16,784 --> 01:49:18,683
Get us out of here.

1149
01:49:19,453 --> 01:49:20,943
Now!

1150
01:49:23,223 --> 01:49:26,943
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1151
01:49:30,164 --> 01:49:31,334
Come on! Go!

1152
01:49:48,982 --> 01:49:50,792
Get us in the air.

1153
01:49:52,119 --> 01:49:53,409
The flying gear’s jammed!

1154
01:49:57,691 --> 01:50:01,001
-Come on! Pull!
-I'm trying!

1155
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:33,371
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1156
01:50:33,894 --> 01:50:37,704
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
PIL kill him.

1157
01:50:52,212 --> 01:50:55,052
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1158
01:50:55,616 --> 01:50:59,656
-What have we found out?
-We know one thing.

1159
01:51:00,387 --> 01:51:03,376
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1160
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:05,741
He was innocent.

1161
01:51:21,475 --> 01:51:23,645
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1162
01:51:24,478 --> 01:51:26,468
We need you.

1163
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:29,521
Now more than ever.

1164
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,690
-What’s that?
-Ron....

1165
01:51:50,938 --> 01:51:54,858
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1166
01:51:55,943 --> 01:51:57,053
Come on.

1167
01:51:57,878 --> 01:52:00,487
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1168
01:52:01,014 --> 01:52:05,084
..-none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1169
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:09,129
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent’s eye.

1170
01:52:09,756 --> 01:52:12,386
Spiders flee before it.”
Ron, this is it.

1171
01:52:12,926 --> 01:52:15,386
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1172
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:19,356
That's why I can hear it speak.
It’s a snake.

1173
01:52:20,167 --> 01:52:24,797
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one’s dead?

1174
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:38,633
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1175
01:52:40,954 --> 01:52:43,233
Not directly, at least.

1176
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:46,751
Colin saw it through his camera.

1177
01:52:47,194 --> 01:52:50,734
Justin-- Justin must have seen
the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1178
01:52:51,398 --> 01:52:54,908
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he’s a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1179
01:52:55,569 --> 01:52:58,319
And Hermione had the mirror.

1180
01:52:58,872 --> 01:53:01,832
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1181
01:53:02,409 --> 01:53:03,518
And Mrs. Norris?

1182
01:53:03,844 --> 01:53:06,914
I'm pretty sure she didn’t have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1183
01:53:08,915 --> 01:53:10,555
The water.

1184
01:53:11,251 --> 01:53:16,141
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk’s reflection.

1185
01:53:22,963 --> 01:53:24,663
"Spiders flee before it.”

1186
01:53:25,065 --> 01:53:28,344
-It all fits.
-But how’s a basilisk been getting around?

1187
01:53:28,969 --> 01:53:31,459
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1188
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:36,959
-Hermione’s answered that too.
-Pipes? It’s using the plumbing.

1189
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:41,561
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1190
01:53:42,249 --> 01:53:45,969
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1191
01:53:47,154 --> 01:53:48,324
Moaning Myrtle.

1192
01:53:49,456 --> 01:53:52,996
All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.

1193
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:56,680
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.

1194
01:54:02,102 --> 01:54:07,232
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1195
01:54:08,108 --> 01:54:10,038
Our worst fear has been realized.

1196
01:54:10,477 --> 01:54:14,487
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1197
01:54:16,116 --> 01:54:21,096
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1198
01:54:24,157 --> 01:54:26,297
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?

1199
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:30,600
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1200
01:54:31,298 --> 01:54:33,878
-My moment?
-Weren’t you saying just last night...

1201
01:54:34,401 --> 01:54:38,380
...that you’ve known all along where
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1202
01:54:40,307 --> 01:54:45,107
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1203
01:54:45,946 --> 01:54:50,516
-Your skills, after all, are legend.
-Very well.

1204
01:54:51,318 --> 01:54:54,128
I'll just be in my office getting....

1205
01:54:55,355 --> 01:54:57,084
Getting ready.

1206
01:55:00,227 --> 01:55:03,037
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1207
01:55:03,597 --> 01:55:05,206
Ginny Weasley.

1208
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:19,532
“Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever.”

1209
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:25,530
Ginny.

1210
01:55:27,821 --> 01:55:30,891
Lockhart may be useless, but he’s
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1211
01:55:31,491 --> 01:55:33,891
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1212
01:55:35,562 --> 01:55:37,812
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1213
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:41,629
Are you going somewhere?

1214
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:44,755
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1215
01:55:45,305 --> 01:55:48,145
-What about my sister?
-Well....

1216
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:51,915
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

1217
01:55:52,512 --> 01:55:56,022
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can’t go now.

1218
01:55:56,683 --> 01:55:59,313
I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description--

1219
01:55:59,853 --> 01:56:00,873
You're running away?

1220
01:56:01,188 --> 01:56:03,648
-After all you did in your books?
-Books can be misleading.

1221
01:56:04,157 --> 01:56:06,407
-You wrote them.
-My dear boy, do use your common sense.

1222
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:10,763
My books wouldn't have sold half as well
if people didn’t think I'd done those things.

1223
01:56:11,865 --> 01:56:13,264
You're a fraud.

1224
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:16,093
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1225
01:56:16,603 --> 01:56:18,303
Is there anything you can do?

1226
01:56:18,705 --> 01:56:22,865
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1227
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:25,799
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1228
01:56:26,279 --> 01:56:28,999
I'd never have sold another book.

1229
01:56:29,549 --> 01:56:34,589
In fact, I’m going to have to do
the same to you.

1230
01:56:35,789 --> 01:56:38,219
Don't even think about it.

1231
01:56:49,436 --> 01:56:50,696
Who's there?

1232
01:56:53,306 --> 01:56:55,085
Hello, Harry.

1233
01:56:56,276 --> 01:57:00,816
-What do you want?
-To ask you how you died.

1234
01:57:03,817 --> 01:57:05,957
It was dreadful.

1235
01:57:06,419 --> 01:57:09,669
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1236
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:13,830
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1237
01:57:14,494 --> 01:57:18,804
I was crying, and then
l heard somebody come in.

1238
01:57:19,566 --> 01:57:25,135
-Who was it, Myrtle?
-I don’t know. I was distraught!

1239
01:57:27,207 --> 01:57:30,197
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1240
01:57:30,777 --> 01:57:36,347
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1241
01:57:38,318 --> 01:57:42,568
-...1 died.
-Just like that? How?

1242
01:57:43,323 --> 01:57:47,273
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1243
01:57:47,994 --> 01:57:51,364
...over there by that sink.

1244
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:18,702
This is it.

1245
01:58:19,859 --> 01:58:24,079
This is it, Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1246
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:30,946
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1247
01:59:23,056 --> 01:59:26,656
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be....

1248
01:59:27,327 --> 01:59:29,317
There’s no need for me to stay.

1249
01:59:30,196 --> 01:59:31,866
Yes, there is.

1250
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:36,620
-You first.
-Now, boys, what good will it do?

1251
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:38,340
Better you than us.

1252
01:59:39,706 --> 01:59:42,286
But-- Obviously, yes.

1253
01:59:46,913 --> 01:59:49,312
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1254
01:59:56,456 --> 01:59:59,296
It’s really quite filthy down here.

1255
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:04,139
-All right. Let’s go.
-Oh, Harry?

1256
02:00:05,098 --> 02:00:09,438
If you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1257
02:00:12,572 --> 02:00:14,302
Thanks, Myrtle.

1258
02:00:43,636 --> 02:00:48,206
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1259
02:00:49,776 --> 02:00:51,236
Go on.

1260
02:00:55,148 --> 02:00:56,318
This way.

1261
02:01:03,523 --> 02:01:08,123
-What's this?
-It looks like a snake.

1262
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:12,148
-It's a snakeskin.
-Bloody hell.

1263
02:01:12,766 --> 02:01:17,866
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1264
02:01:20,473 --> 02:01:23,083
Heart of a lion, this one.

1265
02:01:27,147 --> 02:01:31,247
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don’t fret.

1266
02:01:33,753 --> 02:01:38,553
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.

1267
02:01:39,559 --> 02:01:42,629
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1268
02:01:43,229 --> 02:01:45,839
..at the sight of her mangled body.

1269
02:01:47,066 --> 02:01:48,326
So....

1270
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:51,686
You first, Mr. Potter.

1271
02:01:52,205 --> 02:01:54,985
Say goodbye to your memories.

1272
02:01:57,443 --> 02:01:59,143
Obliviate!

1273
02:02:33,313 --> 02:02:36,063
-Ron! Ron, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1274
02:02:40,186 --> 02:02:41,736
Hello.

1275
02:02:42,622 --> 02:02:44,232
Who are you?

1276
02:02:45,825 --> 02:02:48,165
-Ron Weasley.
-Really?

1277
02:02:48,661 --> 02:02:51,181
And who am I?

1278
02:02:53,299 --> 02:02:57,079
Lockhart’s Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1279
02:02:57,937 --> 02:03:01,887
It’s an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1280
02:03:02,609 --> 02:03:04,479
Do you live here?

1281
02:03:05,445 --> 02:03:07,665
-No.
-Really?

1282
02:03:12,552 --> 02:03:14,132
-What do I do now?
-You wait here...

1283
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:17,100
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1284
02:03:17,624 --> 02:03:20,844
-l'll go on and find Ginny.
-Okay.

1285
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:57,920
Ginny! Ginny, please don’t be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1286
02:04:58,891 --> 02:05:00,731
Please wake up.

1287
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:03,130
She won't wake.

1288
02:05:08,868 --> 02:05:12,678
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1289
02:05:13,373 --> 02:05:16,333
-She’s not...?
-She's still alive, but only just.

1290
02:05:17,744 --> 02:05:19,764
-Are you a ghost?
-A memory...

1291
02:05:20,213 --> 02:05:22,322
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1292
02:05:25,284 --> 02:05:29,853
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don’t be dead. Wake up.

1293
02:05:30,656 --> 02:05:32,766
You've got to help me, Tom.
There’s a basilisk.

1294
02:05:33,226 --> 02:05:35,505
It won't come until it’s called.

1295
02:05:38,631 --> 02:05:41,091
-Give me my wand, Tom.
-You won't be needing it.

1296
02:05:42,502 --> 02:05:45,492
-We've got to go. We've got to save her.
-I'm afraid I can’t do that.

1297
02:05:46,072 --> 02:05:49,612
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.

1298
02:05:51,477 --> 02:05:55,427
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1299
02:05:56,149 --> 02:05:58,199
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1300
02:05:58,651 --> 02:06:01,461
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch’s cat...

1301
02:06:02,021 --> 02:06:04,161
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1302
02:06:04,624 --> 02:06:07,523
-But why?
-Because I told her to.

1303
02:06:08,094 --> 02:06:12,454
You'll find ! can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1304
02:06:13,232 --> 02:06:16,162
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1305
02:06:17,103 --> 02:06:19,293
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1306
02:06:19,772 --> 02:06:21,852
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls’ bathroom.

1307
02:06:22,308 --> 02:06:26,148
And then who should find it but you?

1308
02:06:26,846 --> 02:06:29,566
The very person
l was most anxious to meet.

1309
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:32,360
And why did you want to meet me?

1310
02:06:33,019 --> 02:06:35,979
I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.

1311
02:06:36,556 --> 02:06:39,425
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1312
02:06:39,992 --> 02:06:42,772
-...to gain your trust.
-Hagrid’s my friend.

1313
02:06:44,097 --> 02:06:48,137
-And you framed him, didn't you?
-It was my word against Hagrid’s.

1314
02:06:48,868 --> 02:06:51,738
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1315
02:06:52,305 --> 02:06:54,205
'll bet Dumbledore saw
tight through you.

1316
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:57,680
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1317
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:01,177
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was still at school...

1318
02:07:01,747 --> 02:07:03,357
...80 I decided to leave behind
a diary...

1319
02:07:03,749 --> 02:07:05,589
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1320
02:07:06,018 --> 02:07:08,388
...So that one day
I would be able to lead another...

1321
02:07:08,888 --> 02:07:11,348
...to finish Salazar Slytherin’s
noble work.

1322
02:07:11,858 --> 02:07:13,848
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1323
02:07:14,293 --> 02:07:16,902
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1324
02:07:17,430 --> 02:07:19,830
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1325
02:07:20,566 --> 02:07:25,166
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn’t matter to me anymore.

1326
02:07:26,072 --> 02:07:30,262
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1327
02:07:32,311 --> 02:07:35,471
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1328
02:07:36,082 --> 02:07:38,422
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1329
02:07:39,085 --> 02:07:41,665
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1330
02:07:42,188 --> 02:07:44,298
...while Lord Voldemort’s powers
were destroyed?

1331
02:07:44,757 --> 02:07:48,416
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1332
02:07:49,095 --> 02:07:54,775
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1333
02:08:15,988 --> 02:08:19,008
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1334
02:08:22,595 --> 02:08:25,755
-You're Voldemort.
-Surely you didn’t think...

1335
02:08:26,365 --> 02:08:30,315
... 1 was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father’s name?

1336
02:08:31,037 --> 02:08:34,697
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere...

1337
02:08:35,374 --> 02:08:39,063
..-would one day fear to speak when I
became the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1338
02:08:39,745 --> 02:08:42,525
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1339
02:08:43,082 --> 02:08:46,072
Dumbledore’s been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1340
02:08:46,652 --> 02:08:51,102
He’ll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1341
02:08:58,130 --> 02:08:59,000
Fawkes?

1342
02:09:15,414 --> 02:09:18,544
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1343
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:22,401
A songbird and an old hat.

1344
02:09:36,135 --> 02:09:40,115
Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort,
Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1345
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:44,380
.. against the famous Harry Potter.

1346
02:09:58,190 --> 02:10:02,000
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.

1347
02:10:32,725 --> 02:10:34,095
No!

1348
02:10:34,727 --> 02:10:38,677
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1349
02:12:21,233 --> 02:12:24,133
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1350
02:12:24,703 --> 02:12:29,013
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1351
02:12:29,775 --> 02:12:32,115
Lord Voldemort will return...

1352
02:12:32,812 --> 02:12:36,501
..-very much alive.

1353
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:38,980
Ginny?

1354
02:14:55,487 --> 02:14:56,887
Remarkable, isn’t it...

1355
02:14:57,256 --> 02:15:00,766
..-how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1356
02:15:01,427 --> 02:15:03,767
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1357
02:15:04,430 --> 02:15:07,970
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1358
02:15:13,472 --> 02:15:16,692
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1359
02:15:17,309 --> 02:15:21,729
..-especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1360
02:15:25,217 --> 02:15:26,826
What are you doing?

1361
02:15:29,855 --> 02:15:31,724
Stop. No!

1362
02:16:30,282 --> 02:16:33,762
It was me.
But I swear, I didn’t mean to.

1363
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:37,490
Riddle made me, and....

1364
02:16:38,457 --> 02:16:40,767
Harry, you're hurt.

1365
02:16:41,459 --> 02:16:42,769
Don't worry.

1366
02:16:43,128 --> 02:16:46,318
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1367
02:16:46,932 --> 02:16:49,802
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1368
02:17:02,347 --> 02:17:04,217
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1369
02:17:05,584 --> 02:17:07,724
I just wasn't quick enough.

1370
02:17:28,807 --> 02:17:30,327
Of course.

1371
02:17:30,808 --> 02:17:33,329
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1372
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:36,860
Thanks.

1373
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:40,687
It’s all right, Ginny.

1374
02:17:42,087 --> 02:17:44,017
It’s over.

1375
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:47,510
It’s just a memory.

1376
02:17:50,728 --> 02:17:55,419
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1377
02:18:07,346 --> 02:18:09,686
You both realize, of course...

1378
02:18:10,182 --> 02:18:15,012
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1379
02:18:16,355 --> 02:18:17,225
Yes, sir.

1380
02:18:17,522 --> 02:18:20,362
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1381
02:18:20,925 --> 02:18:21,975
Yes, sir.

1382
02:18:22,294 --> 02:18:24,724
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1383
02:18:26,598 --> 02:18:28,588
...that you both receive...

1384
02:18:29,368 --> 02:18:32,968
... Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1385
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:37,180
Thanks, sir.

1386
02:18:37,976 --> 02:18:39,996
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1387
02:18:40,445 --> 02:18:44,105
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1388
02:18:45,717 --> 02:18:49,907
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1389
02:18:55,459 --> 02:18:59,269
First, 1 want to thank you, Harry.

1390
02:19:00,432 --> 02:19:03,502
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1391
02:19:04,803 --> 02:19:08,813
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1392
02:19:11,777 --> 02:19:13,117
And...

1393
02:19:13,879 --> 02:19:15,139
..- second...

1394
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:19,670
... [sense that something
is troubling you.

1395
02:19:20,485 --> 02:19:22,675
Am I right, Harry?

1396
02:19:24,823 --> 02:19:26,343
It’s just....

1397
02:19:27,726 --> 02:19:31,886
You see, sir, 1 couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain....

1398
02:19:32,630 --> 02:19:37,581
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1399
02:19:38,837 --> 02:19:39,886
I see.

1400
02:19:40,205 --> 02:19:45,305
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1401
02:19:46,445 --> 02:19:51,305
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1402
02:19:53,185 --> 02:19:55,585
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...

1403
02:19:56,321 --> 02:19:59,691
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1404
02:20:00,325 --> 02:20:02,905
...the night he gave you that scar.

1405
02:20:03,428 --> 02:20:06,858
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1406
02:20:09,234 --> 02:20:11,604
Not intentionally...

1407
02:20:12,838 --> 02:20:14,508
...but yes.

1408
02:20:16,675 --> 02:20:19,574
So the Sorting Hat was right.
l should be in Slytherin.

1409
02:20:20,145 --> 02:20:24,395
It’s true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1410
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:27,670
Determination, resourcefulness...

1411
02:20:28,186 --> 02:20:31,696
...and if l may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1412
02:20:32,858 --> 02:20:36,368
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1413
02:20:37,663 --> 02:20:40,913
-Because I asked it to.
-Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1414
02:20:41,533 --> 02:20:43,342
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1415
02:20:43,769 --> 02:20:47,169
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1416
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:49,810
It is our choices.

1417
02:20:53,745 --> 02:20:56,735
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1418
02:20:57,316 --> 02:21:01,596
...then I suggest
you look more closely at this.

1419
02:21:03,188 --> 02:21:04,678
Be careful.

1420
02:21:10,529 --> 02:21:12,869
Godric Gryffindor.

1421
02:21:13,365 --> 02:21:16,965
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1422
02:21:26,345 --> 02:21:27,574
Dobby.

1423
02:21:29,014 --> 02:21:32,854
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1424
02:21:35,587 --> 02:21:38,517
lll deal with you later.

1425
02:21:44,763 --> 02:21:46,163
Out of my way, Potter.

1426
02:21:46,531 --> 02:21:49,691
So it’s true. You have returned.

1427
02:21:50,802 --> 02:21:53,232
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley’s daughter...

1428
02:21:53,739 --> 02:21:57,429
...-was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1429
02:21:58,777 --> 02:22:02,347
-Ridiculous.
-Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1430
02:22:03,015 --> 02:22:06,234
..-were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1431
02:22:06,852 --> 02:22:09,342
..jif they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1432
02:22:10,155 --> 02:22:13,195
-How dare you!
-Beg your pardon?

1433
02:22:13,792 --> 02:22:17,101
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1434
02:22:17,729 --> 02:22:20,219
...the welfare of this school...

1435
02:22:20,732 --> 02:22:24,512
...and, of course, its students.

1436
02:22:29,074 --> 02:22:32,764
The culprit has been identified,
l presume?

1437
02:22:33,678 --> 02:22:35,018
Yes.

1438
02:22:36,815 --> 02:22:38,425
And?

1439
02:22:39,818 --> 02:22:41,598
Who was it?

1440
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:50,510
Voldemort.

1441
02:22:51,963 --> 02:22:56,762
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1442
02:22:57,969 --> 02:23:01,159
...by means of this.

1443
02:23:04,276 --> 02:23:05,616
I see.

1444
02:23:07,279 --> 02:23:10,969
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1445
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:15,070
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort’s old school-things...

1446
02:23:15,687 --> 02:23:18,527
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1447
02:23:19,257 --> 02:23:22,716
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1448
02:23:23,562 --> 02:23:25,202
... Severe.

1449
02:23:26,832 --> 02:23:29,292
Well, let us hope...

1450
02:23:29,801 --> 02:23:34,661
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1451
02:23:36,108 --> 02:23:39,418
Don't worry. I will be.

1452
02:23:48,620 --> 02:23:50,400
Dumbledore.

1453
02:23:51,790 --> 02:23:54,890
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1454
02:24:12,611 --> 02:24:16,511
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

1455
02:24:23,488 --> 02:24:24,887
Mr. Malfoy.

1456
02:24:25,257 --> 02:24:27,187
Mr. Malfoy!

1457
02:24:27,926 --> 02:24:29,826
l have something of yours.

1458
02:24:31,763 --> 02:24:34,343
Mine? I don’t know
what you're talking about.

1459
02:24:34,933 --> 02:24:36,273
I think you do, sir.

1460
02:24:36,635 --> 02:24:39,355
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley’s cauldron...

1461
02:24:39,905 --> 02:24:41,165
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1462
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:44,260
You do, do you?

1463
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:54,640
Why don’t you prove it?

1464
02:25:01,259 --> 02:25:03,159
Come, Dobby.

1465
02:25:04,729 --> 02:25:06,509
Open it.

1466
02:25:10,302 --> 02:25:11,642
Dobby.

1467
02:25:12,003 --> 02:25:14,783
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1468
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:17,280
What? I didn’t give--

1469
02:25:17,709 --> 02:25:20,959
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1470
02:25:21,580 --> 02:25:24,270
Dobby is free.

1471
02:25:31,189 --> 02:25:34,469
You lost me my servant!

1472
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:45,410
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1473
02:25:58,049 --> 02:26:01,299
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1474
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:04,700
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1475
02:26:05,257 --> 02:26:09,827
you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1476
02:26:16,167 --> 02:26:21,357
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1477
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:26,160
-Just promise me something.
-Anything, sir.

1478
02:26:28,647 --> 02:26:30,817
Never try to save my life again.

1479
02:26:37,255 --> 02:26:39,884
-Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1480
02:26:40,558 --> 02:26:42,638
-Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
-Good evening.

1481
02:26:43,094 --> 02:26:45,643
-Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1482
02:26:47,399 --> 02:26:49,329
Hello.

1483
02:26:51,303 --> 02:26:55,373
-Hermione! Welcome back.
-Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1484
02:26:59,177 --> 02:27:02,107
Harry. It’s Hermione.

1485
02:27:29,341 --> 02:27:32,591
-Welcome back, Hermione.
-It’s good to be back.

1486
02:27:33,211 --> 02:27:35,491
Congratulations.
I can’t believe you solved it.

1487
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:37,970
We had loads of help from you.

1488
02:27:38,416 --> 02:27:41,256
-We couldn't have done it without you.
-Thanks.

1489
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:46,098
Could I have your attention, please?

1490
02:27:50,595 --> 02:27:52,814
Before we begin the feast...

1491
02:27:53,298 --> 02:27:58,778
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1492
02:27:59,704 --> 02:28:03,333
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1493
02:28:04,008 --> 02:28:06,348
...to all who had been Petrified.

1494
02:28:17,188 --> 02:28:19,818
Also, in light of the recent events...

1495
02:28:20,358 --> 02:28:22,258
...as a school treat...

1496
02:28:22,694 --> 02:28:26,174
...all exams have been canceled.

1497
02:28:29,334 --> 02:28:30,704
Oh, no.

1498
02:28:47,852 --> 02:28:49,632
Sorry I'm late.

1499
02:28:55,927 --> 02:28:59,797
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1500
02:29:00,665 --> 02:29:03,565
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1501
02:29:19,751 --> 02:29:25,021
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...

1502
02:29:25,924 --> 02:29:28,504
...and Hermione, of course...

1503
02:29:29,527 --> 02:29:33,127
...[ would still be you-know-where...

1504
02:29:33,798 --> 02:29:36,928
...so I'd just like to say thanks.

1505
02:29:46,778 --> 02:29:49,358
There’s no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.

1506
02:40:49,273 --> 02:40:50,123
