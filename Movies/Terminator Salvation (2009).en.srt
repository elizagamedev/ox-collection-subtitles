1
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,807
Marcus.

2
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:13,803
How are you?

3
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,145
Ask me in an hour.

4
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,207
I thought I'd try...

5
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,375
.one last time.

6
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,362
You should have stayed
in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.

7
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,444
By signing this consent form...

8
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:36,333
..you'd be donating your body
to a noble cause.

9
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,424
You'd...

10
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:44,386
..have a second chance,
through my research, to live again.

11
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,228
You know what I did.

12
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,754
My brother and two cops are dead
because of me.

13
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,305
I'm not looking for a second chance.

14
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,865
But I'm not the only one
with a death sentence, am I?

15
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,248
Do you think
I'm gonna cure your cancer, Serena?

16
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,016
I'm not worried about myself.

17
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,946
I'm worried about the future
of the human race.

18
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,861
I'll sell it to you.

19
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,204
For what?

20
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,326
Akiss.

21
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,148
So that's what death tastes like.

22
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,088
You're doing something very noble.

23
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,981
No, I'm guilty.

24
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,993
Just cut me up
until there's nothing left.

25
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,686
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

26
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,541
...[ will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

27
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,952
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

28
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,067
Do you have any last words?

29
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,263
Vanguard, this is Blackjack 6.
Missile inbound to Skynet target.

30
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,630
TTO 11 seconds. Danger close.

31
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,606
- Move! Move!
- Let's go, let's go! Move it!

32
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,654
Connor is on the ground.

33
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,834
This mission is a quick in-and-out.

34
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,349
Command deems the information
on those computers...

35
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,395
..to be of the highest priority.

36
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,479
Connor, there's no sign
of the machines. They're gone.

37
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,156
It's way too quiet.

38
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,214
It's almost like
they're waiting for us.

39
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,010
What the hell's that smell, man?

40
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,691
You seeing this?

41
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,699
Olsen. Objective located.

42
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,706
There's something else
you have to see.

43
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,960
- Hard wall.
- Get what we came for, Barbarosa.

44
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,506
The clock's ticking.

45
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,520
Spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.

46
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,827
Why didn't we know about this?

47
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,600
Sir, think this is what Command's
looking for. I'm in their source code.

48
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,166
These people are being taken
to San Francisco.

49
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,920
Some sort of R and D project
for a new Terminator.

50
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,053
Send it to Command.

51
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,761
- It's uploading. l need two minutes.
- Wait, wait, wait. Go back. Go back.

52
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,769
Stop.

53
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,662
- T-800.
- Anew Terminator.

54
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,023
It's like you said it would be.

55
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,771
- It's worse.
- Get your nose out of that.

56
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,578
None of your business.
You're not leading this mission.

57
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,681
Let's cut these sorry bastards loose.
Come on. Let's go.

58
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,137
- Jericho, come in.
- Watch that.

59
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,896
Come in, Jericho.

60
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,464
Connor, get your ass topside.
Remind those men...

61
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,906
..they need to answer me
on the radio, even if they're dead.

62
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,507
Connor!

63
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,026
Connor, get those men to respond.

64
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,949
Olsen, something's wrong up here.

65
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,589
Topside, come in.

66
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,674
Outbound enemy aircraft.
I'm in pursuit.

67
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,715
There are human prisoners
aboard that thing. Get after it!

68
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,539
Data transfer complete.
Connor, we're joining you topsi--

69
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,448
Olsen.

70
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,680
Bravo 10, Bravo 10,
do you copy? Over.

71
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,541
Eagle 1 to Bravo 10.
Bravo 10, do you copy? Over.

72
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,021
Bravo 10, Bravo 10,
do you copy? Over?

73
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,441
Here.

74
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,579
Bravo 10, identify. Over.

75
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:23,859
Connor.

76
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,697
We'll send units to the extraction point.
How many survivors are on-site? Over.

77
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,744
One.

78
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,372
Copy.

79
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,907
Return to base, sir?

80
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,810
-RTB?
- Negative.

81
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,566
- Take me to Command.
- Sir?

82
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,117
Command.

83
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,712
Roger. Rerouting.

84
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,269
Request has been denied.

85
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,481
Command doesn't wanna give up
their position. Radio comms only.

86
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,921
- Are they down there?
- Request has been denied, sir.

87
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,148
Need-to-know only.
That's straight from the top.

88
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,766
You open up that ramp...

89
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:31,355
..and you tell them I need divers for
a lock-in! Now!

90
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,997
This is crazy.

91
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,390
John Connor.

92
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,845
Prophesized leader
of the Resistance.

93
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,947
Soldier, you put every man
and woman in this sub in jeopardy...

94
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,644
..with your little frogman stunt.

95
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,840
What the hell are you doing here?

96
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,584
- What did we find down there?
- You'll be briefed...

97
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,251
-..on a need-to-know basis.
- Well, l need to know.

98
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,377
Because my men died
down in that hole.

99
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,411
What did we find down there?

100
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:32,238
We found a solution, Connor,
that can end this war once and for all.

101
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,128
We know the machines use shortwave
transmitters to communicate.

102
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,232
Intel has located a hidden signal
under the primary channel.

103
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,510
It allows for direct control
of the machines.

104
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,217
Skynet's a machine,
and like all machines...

105
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,730
.it has an off switch.

106
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:54,823
Does it work?

107
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:59,191
Will it work? Yes.
Have we field tested it? No.

108
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,390
Give it to me.

109
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,483
I'll do it.

110
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,973
I'll test it.

111
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,722
Connor and his tech-comm unit
have an excellent record.

112
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,705
All right.

113
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,437
All right.

114
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,204
Take Connor topside.
Prepare for lockout.

115
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,606
Connor, we do this right,
the war is over.

116
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,693
We mount our offensive
in four days.

117
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,016
Connor.

118
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,306
These are the codes for the signal.

119
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,646
- Good luck.
- Why four days?

120
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,335
Akill list was intercepted
from Skynet.

121
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,764
It says everyone in this room
will be dead by week's end.

122
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,511
You're number two on the list.

123
00:17:55,975 --> 00:18:01,014
- Well, who's number one?
- An unknown. A civilian. Kyle Reese.

124
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,678
Jericho, come in.

125
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,817
Come in, Jericho.

126
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,031
Barnes.

127
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,582
My brother,
he didn't make it, did he?

128
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,649
This is tape number 28
of Sarah Connor to my son, John.

129
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,158
What's most difficult
is trying to decide...

130
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,787
..what to tell you and what not to.

131
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,896
Should I tell you about your father?

132
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,690
Will it affect your decision to
send him back in time to protect me...

133
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,168
.. knowing that he is your father?

134
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,408
And he'll be younger than you.
Only a teenager when you meet him.

135
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,308
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

136
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,098
But if you don't send Kyle,
you can never be...

137
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,891
..and Skynet will win the war.

138
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,351
You want to talk about him?

139
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:20,068
Kyle is out there somewhere alone,
and Skynet is hunting him.

140
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,137
What about the signal?

141
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,966
What do you think?

142
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,168
If it works, it's incredible.

143
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,590
- We have to be careful.
-l agree.

144
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,762
- But we have to try.
- Okay.

145
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,745
All right, start with something small
that we're familiar with.

146
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,116
We should capture a Hydrobot,
bring it in for testing.

147
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,683
Yeah.

148
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,912
What is it, John?

149
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,158
Kill Kyle Reese, reset the future...

150
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,103
.-no John Connor.

151
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,609
Hey!

152
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,403
Come with me if you wanna live.

153
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,693
What is that?

154
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,925
She doesn't talk,
but you need to start.

155
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,289
Where'd you get that jacket?

156
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,093
The other guy didn't need it.

157
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,917
You see that red?

158
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,759
It stands for blood.
It's a symbol of the Resistance.

159
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,932
You're obviously not
a Resistance fighter, so take it off.

160
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,667
Take it off!

161
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,183
You point a gun at someone...

162
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,854
..you'd better be ready
to pull the trigger.

163
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,114
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

164
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,352
- What the hell was that thing?
- Terminator.

165
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:16,937
T-600.

166
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,823
What day is it?

167
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,749
What year?

168
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,803
2018.

169
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,144
What happened here?

170
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,672
Judgment Day happened.

171
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,331
I gotta get out of here.

172
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,443
You can't go on foot.
The machines will cut you down.

173
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,570
You need speed.

174
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,009
I need a car.

175
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,940
Well, look, there's some
by Griffith Observatory.

176
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,163
- They don't run, though.
- Take me.

177
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,290
Get down!

178
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,058
That was a Hunter-Killer.

179
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,741
Thanks to you,
they know we're here.

180
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,985
What's your name, kid?

181
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,559
Kyle Reese.

182
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,834
Come on.

183
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:52,408
We burned out his transmitter
so it can't talk to any of its pals.

184
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,948
But he can still receive.

185
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,854
Turn it on.

186
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,331
You got it?

187
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,216
Hold it down, hold it down.

188
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,907
Turn the signal up.

189
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,166
Give me the strap.

190
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,234
- Holy shit.
- Do you believe it?

191
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,204
- All right. Grab it tight.
- The signal has to be continuous.

192
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,304
If there's any interruption...

193
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,781
Okay.

194
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,885
Let's rig up a portable shortwave,
test it on something larger in the field.

195
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,552
All right.

196
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,908
Destroy this thing.

197
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,055
So where are the cars?

198
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,197
You don't wanna go out after dark.

199
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,222
Hunter-Killers have infrared,
hunt better at night.

200
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,987
We'll all go tomorrow morning.

201
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,460
- What is that?
- Two-day-old coyote.

202
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,439
Better than three-day-old coyote.

203
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,071
Hey, hey!

204
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:37,962
- Grab it.
- What?

205
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,718
Grab it.

206
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:50,838
Magic.

207
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,935
- Got it?
- Yeah.

208
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,695
Thanks.

209
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,927
Does this radio work?

210
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,022
No.

211
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,884
My dad tried to fix it,
but he could never get it to work.

212
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,512
Hold that.

213
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,239
Where is everybody?

214
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,551
They're gone.

215
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,053
So why are you still here?

216
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,972
Because we're the Resistance,
L.A. branch.

217
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,455
Welcome to the headquarters.

218
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,411
Resisting what?

219
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,043
Machines. Skynet.

220
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,034
- Just the two of you?
- Yeah.

221
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,199
How come you're not
wearing one of these?

222
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,052
Because I haven't earned mine yet.

223
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,074
l hope he's listening to this.

224
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,489
We've been fighting a long time...

225
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,814
..and we have all lost so very much,
so many loved ones gone.

226
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,176
But you are not alone.

227
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,351
There are pockets of Resistance
all around the planet.

228
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,678
We are at the brink.

229
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,365
Do you wanna see a magic trick?
Hold that up.

230
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:44,882
Press the button.

231
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:52,578
Effective range of their main weapon
is less than 100 meters.

232
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,564
They pack a lot of firepower,
but the T-600s are heavy and slow.

233
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,689
They are a primitive design.

234
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,827
- Who is that?
- If you can't outrun them...

235
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,256
-I don't know.
-..then you have one option.

236
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,834
Their motor cortex is partially
exposed at the back of their neck.

237
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,042
Aknife to this area will disorient
their tracking device, but not for long.

238
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,027
Above all, stay alive.
You have no idea...

239
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,449
.. how important you are,
and how important you will become.

240
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:23,088
The machines are advancing
even faster than I told you they would.

241
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:24,952
I've seen it with my own eyes.

242
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,454
They're inventing new Terminators,
new ways of killing us.

243
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,241
Skynet is planning something big.

244
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,138
But the Resistance
is planning something bigger.

245
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:38,793
This is John Connor.

246
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:43,554
If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.

247
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,174
John Connor.

248
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,437
We gotta find this guy.

249
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:27,022
- So you get it working?
- Almost.

250
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,906
Good. Look,
I figure we head east, right?

251
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,716
We go through the desert, then we
can connect with the Resistance there.

252
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,687
- I'm heading north.
- No, no, no.

253
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,227
The machines control the whole
northern sector, up to San Francisco.

254
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,794
- That's Skynet Central.
-l have to find someone.

255
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,703
There's a lot you don't understand
about Skynet, okay?

256
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,820
It's just too dangerous for us
to go there.

257
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,151
What about the L.A. branch?

258
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,918
Come on, man.
We need to get out of L.A.

259
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,343
What is that?

260
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,599
Something my brother
used to listen to.

261
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,530
Star, get out.

262
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,307
Don't look at me like that, Star.

263
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,072
Out. Get out!

264
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,245
You're leaving?
You're gonna leave us?

265
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,643
Oh, I get it.

266
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,438
You wanna know the difference
between us and the machines?

267
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,469
We bury our dead.

268
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,699
But no one is coming to bury you.

269
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,862
Aerostat!

270
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,301
- It's a scout for the Terminators.
- Go, drive!

271
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,406
The Aerostats heard the music!

272
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,644
- Keep it steady!
- I've never driven before.

273
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,650
Hold the wheel!

274
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:51,859
This thing's pissing me off!

275
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,748
Kid!

276
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,274
Hold on!

277
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:22,743
If the idea is to stay alive,
I'm driving.

278
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,938
We're seeing a lot
of enemy movement in L.A.

279
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,652
Any of our people in the area?

280
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,790
No one on the ground. Two A-10s
in the air. Williams and Mihradi.

281
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,319
Send the birds in.

282
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,838
Guide them to a safe area.

283
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,435
Roger, Coyote 67 copies all.
Inbound to grid Lima-Alpha...

284
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:48,662
.. 125793. Over.

285
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,277
- Copy that.
- Roger, Wild Eagle. Solid copy.

286
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,778
Hey, there's someone here.

287
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,028
Get off him, get down!
Get down. Down!

288
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,304
- Drop your weapon!
- Let me see your hands!

289
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,067
- Don't move.
- That's it, drop it.

290
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,038
- Put it down!
- What?

291
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:07,285
-Is there a problem?
- Hey, we saw your Resistance sign.

292
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,352
The old lady put it there, not me.

293
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,909
- What do you want?
- We're looking for fuel.

294
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,406
The dark season's coming.

295
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,745
We only got enough for ourselves.

296
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,670
You point that gun at somebody,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.

297
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,926
Put your guns down, everyone.

298
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:33,339
Look, we just came
to find the Resistance, that's all.

299
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,168
The Resistance?

300
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,873
What a joke. Fighting those machines
is impossible.

301
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,111
We keep our heads down,
they ignore us.

302
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,493
They'll come for you eventually.

303
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,368
We help you, maybe they will.

304
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,387
These people aren't going to help you.
Let's go.

305
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,107
You're not going anywhere.

306
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,046
Not until this one
gets something to eat.

307
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,268
Bring me a basket.

308
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,585
Here you go.

309
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:14,049
Come on.
Help yourself. Eat up.

310
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,170
Are you all right, son?

311
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,574
It's our food.

312
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:31,665
Our fuel.
It's not your choice to make!

313
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,283
- Are you okay?
- What?

314
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:08,795
Are you okay?!

315
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:11,846
- Star. Star.
- Star! Star!

316
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,763
You! You brought them here!

317
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,722
Hey!

318
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,500
- Stop! Stop!
- Come on, quick!

319
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:27,041
- Hey.
- Go! Go! Forget them! Go! Go!

320
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,938
Go!

321
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:40,322
- Tunnels! Head for the tunnels!
- Truck!

322
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:54,801
Marcus. Marcus.

323
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,538
We can't just run for it!

324
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,618
Run!

325
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:49,596
Shoot it!

326
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,345
Go, go, go!

327
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,293
It didn't work!

328
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,125
Shit!

329
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,109
Hell, yeah!

330
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,762
Moto-Terminators!

331
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,480
Shoot that son of a bitch!

332
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,115
Marcus, turn right up here.

333
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,730
Hold on!

334
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,575
Where's the other one?

335
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,265
Get up here!

336
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,207
Come on.

337
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,046
Star, give me the gun.

338
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:28,468
I got it.

339
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,025
Yeah!

340
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:42,395
Hang on!

341
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,620
- Drop the ball!
- All right.

342
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,483
Star, hold on!

343
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:43,939
- Star! Star!
- No!

344
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,877
- Kyle!
- Marcus.

345
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:26,285
Get back.

346
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,562
Marcus! Marcus!

347
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:42,746
- Got eyes on two targets.
- We've got two bogies at 270 degrees.

348
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,411
They've never come this deep before.
They're looking for something.

349
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,540
H.K. is down.

350
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,596
We've got an H.K. pushing our six.

351
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,849
- Abort run.
- Breaking off.

352
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,682
Evasive maneuvers, now!

353
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:30,266
Taking fire. I'm hit.
Port-side damage.

354
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,191
It's got a lock on you. Break off.

355
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,079
- Eject, Williams, eject!
- Punching out.

356
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,590
Prisoner transport
headed northwest...

357
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,400
.. bearing 289 toward San Francisco.

358
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,971
Let's test the signal...

359
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,451
..and pray it works.

360
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,563
You okay?

361
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,364
Get my knife. It's in my left boot.

362
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,551
What's your name?

363
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,693
Blair Williams.

364
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:30,887
What's yours?

365
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:36,436
Name's Marcus.

366
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,515
You can let me down now, Marcus.

367
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:52,235
- That thing, where'd it go?
- The transport? Skynet.

368
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,753
- Where the hell are you going?
- After it.

369
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,500
Il hate to break it to you,
but if you've got friends on that thing...

370
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:03,573
.. they're as good as dead. And same
as you, if you walk in that direction.

371
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,711
Yeah, I've been dead a while
and I'm getting used to it.

372
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:08,954
Why don't you come with me
to my base?

373
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,227
Connor might know a way.

374
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:16,939
If you got a problem
with the machines...

375
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,598
. he's definitely the guy
you wanna talk to.

376
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:25,086
- How far is your base?
- Should be one or two days' hike.

377
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,165
And it's that way.

378
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,522
What are you saying?
Speak English!

379
00:48:56,567 --> 00:49:00,927
I was telling him it is not true
about the machines killing us.

380
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:04,229
They're gonna kill us.
They're gonna kill everyone.

381
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,795
We're on the way
to the slaughterhouse!

382
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,888
Calm down. You're not helping.

383
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:15,232
The most important thing we can do
right now is stay alive.

384
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,415
In here and in here.

385
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,899
All right? Just stay alive.

386
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,888
Over there.

387
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:49,433
Find something to burn.
We'll be at my base tomorrow.

388
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:54,023
Are you hurt?

389
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,455
I'm fine.

390
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,520
What do you got there?

391
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,348
Just some antibiotics.

392
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:26,481
Antibiotics are hard
to come by these days.

393
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:30,046
Listen. I don't have much, but
you're welcome to whatever you need.

394
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,308
We've been watching you.

395
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:36,512
You looking for this?

396
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:40,522
Come on, guys.
The machines are the enemy.

397
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,241
- We're all on the same side.
- No, no.

398
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:45,821
You see,
I got a couple friends on my side.

399
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,270
Maybe they can carry you home
when I'm done with you.

400
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,969
You might want to chamber a round.

401
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,316
- Oh, no.
-No.

402
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,131
- We done caught us a donkey!
- Been waiting for you.

403
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,569
Killing me ain't gonna win this war.

404
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,810
Oh, God!

405
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,270
I'ma little cold.

406
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,675
Relax.

407
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:47,935
I just want some body heat.

408
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:56,278
You have a strong heart.

409
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,755
God, I love that sound.

410
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,703
Thank you for saving me back there.

411
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:15,086
I don't meet a lot of good guys
these days.

412
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,441
I'm not a good guy.

413
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:26,792
You are.

414
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:30,195
You just don't know it yet.

415
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:42,076
Do you think people deserve
a second chance?

416
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,408
Yeah, I do.

417
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:56,149
This is it. Skynet's valley of death.
We never been this deep before.

418
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:59,454
We gotta be sure the signal works
in their territory...

419
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,783
..on the bigger machines.

420
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,769
That'll bring them in.

421
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:33,248
H.K. incoming.

422
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,337
Turn it up!

423
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:22,242
It works, man.
The signal works. It's beautiful.

424
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,661
- Commander Ashdown's on.
- Connor, tell me it works.

425
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:39,723
It works. That is affirmative.
The signal works.

426
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,670
Good. The attack commences
tomorrow at 0400, worldwide.

427
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,361
Your unit will be in support
of the bombing of Skynet Central.

428
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:50,028
What is the extraction plan
for the prisoners?

429
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,384
Extraction plan?
There is no extraction plan.

430
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,569
- We're gonna level the place.
- Negative. I told you...

431
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,037
.. Skynet Central
is filled with human prisoners!

432
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,115
This is war, Connor.

433
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,770
Leadership has its costs.
You, above all, should know that.

434
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,029
Ashdown, come in!

435
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:13,245
Ashdown, Connor.

436
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,160
Ashdown, come-- Damn him!

437
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:32,109
Star! Get back! Get back!

438
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:41,515
You have to calm down now.

439
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,519
I gotta get out!
I gotta get out of here!

440
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,087
Blair?

441
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,633
What?

442
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,447
This is us. The mines are magnetic.

443
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,941
If we head due west
at this point of entry, we're good.

444
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,163
lll go first.

445
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:02,637
Let's go, Marcus. I'm starving.

446
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:13,095
For thou art with me.

447
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:16,543
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

448
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,299
Father.

449
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,137
This is the beginning...

450
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,807
..of something wonderful.

451
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:28,457
Son of a bitch is heavy.

452
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:30,825
- What have we got?
- He stepped on a land mine.

453
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:32,478
Start a large-bore IV.

454
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,886
- Keep it open. More morphine.
- I'm okay.

455
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:37,592
- What's his name?
- Marcus.

456
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:43,046
- He's got a prosthetic limb?
- What?

457
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,877
Okay, pulse is good.
Let's see what we've got.

458
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:53,892
Barnes.

459
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,322
The devil's hands have been busy.

460
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:05,114
What is it?

461
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,202
It's real flesh and blood,
though it seems to heal itself quickly.

462
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:13,226
The heart is human
and very powerful.

463
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,254
The brain, too,
but with a chip interface.

464
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,180
- What have you done to me?
- It has a hybrid nervous system.

465
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,940
One human cortex, one machine.

466
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,223
Blair, what have they done?

467
00:59:26,463 --> 00:59:27,833
Who built you?

468
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:31,928
My name is Marcus Wright.

469
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,253
You think you're human?

470
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,404
lam human.

471
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:04,596
No!

472
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:07,396
No!

473
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,655
Where were you manufactured?

474
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,921
was born...

475
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:20,274
.. August 22, 1975.

476
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:23,494
No. No!

477
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,018
I know you.

478
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,714
l heard your voice on the radio.

479
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,770
- You're John Connor.
- Of course you know me.

480
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:43,635
You were sent here to kill me.

481
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:46,638
Kill the leadership.

482
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:50,203
-I don't know what you're talking about.
- Then why are you here?

483
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,500
Blair said you'd help me
find who I'm looking for.

484
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:00,533
- Now, let me down.
- If llet you down...

485
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,785
you'll kill everyone in this room.

486
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:07,511
Just you, Connor.
Because I don't give a shit about you.

487
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:10,682
I didn't know your name
till two days ago.

488
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,424
No.

489
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:17,713
You and me...

490
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:23,662
..we've been at war
since before either of us even existed.

491
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:28,815
You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.

492
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:33,016
You killed my father, Kyle Reese.

493
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:36,464
You will not kill me.

494
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:43,051
Kyle Reese is on a transporter
heading for Skynet.

495
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,654
If l wanted to kill him...

496
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:49,234
.I'd have done him in L.A.

497
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:57,015
Where'd you find that thing?

498
01:01:57,414 --> 01:01:59,934
You sent Mihradi and me
to provide cover for some civilians.

499
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:03,443
- He was one of them.
- Was there a teenage boy?

500
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:07,094
I don't know. They were taken into
a transport. He was the only one left.

501
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,424
Not "he," Blair. "It."

502
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,410
It was the only one left.
Don't be naive.

503
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:14,546
It saved my life.

504
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,538
Kate, what's gonna happen to him?

505
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,310
Disassembled.

506
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:27,857
- You mean killed.
- lt may have information on Skynet.

507
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:33,696
I know he's not the enemy. I've been
shot at by the enemy. That's not him.

508
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:37,911
That machine saved you
only to gain access to kill all of us.

509
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:21,462
We're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

510
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,311
For my brother.

511
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:53,111
No!

512
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:01,109
Connor wants to see you.

513
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:02,438
What for?

514
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:05,886
Like he's gonna tell me, Barnes.

515
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:09,647
Let me see that.

516
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:17,969
Want me to tell Connor
you're not coming?

517
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:19,651
No.

518
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,710
Watch him.

519
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:55,633
I told you everything I know, John.

520
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,739
Skynet is ruthless
and unpredictable.

521
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:02,045
They will use the best part of you
against yourself.

522
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,912
And they will have methods
l can't imagine or predict...

523
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,679
.. that I can't help you with.

524
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:13,562
And when you're unsure, well,
just always follow your heart, John.

525
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:17,337
I love you. Goodbye.

526
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:21,799
There's nothing
about machines with organs.

527
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:23,928
That thing in there...

528
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,600
I thought I knew our enemy.

529
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:32,308
But that thing, that makes me feel
like l know nothing.

530
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,621
l looked in its eyes, and it believes,
absolutely believes...

531
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:40,415
..that it is human.

532
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:43,674
It believes everything that it says.

533
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,087
And it is telling me...

534
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:48,183
..that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.

535
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,226
If that is true...

536
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:56,301
..then Command is about to bomb my
father and the rest of those prisoners...

537
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:59,642
..and I cannot stop them.

538
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,090
Thank you.

539
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:10,732
Come in.

540
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:15,569
What's up?
Blair said you needed me.

541
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:37,816
Get in.

542
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:40,305
Get him.

543
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,544
- Barnes. What about Blair?
- She made her choice.

544
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,648
Get down!

545
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,422
Let's move.

546
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:22,031
- Get some light out there!
- We're back in the mine field.

547
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:23,562
Il have a plan.

548
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,745
- Let's run!
- There they go, they're on the move.

549
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:49,137
- Blair, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay!

550
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,329
-I can't see back!
- There they are!

551
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:53,964
Run! Go!

552
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:06,801
Now what?

553
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,547
My plan stopped at the jeep.

554
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,379
Sniper Team 1, do you have a shot?

555
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:23,408
I'll draw the fire.
You take out the light.

556
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,770
I got a target!

557
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:42,060
Go! Now! Keep your head down!
Keep your head down!

558
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,064
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

559
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:47,758
Go! Go, keep running!

560
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:54,684
Come on! Come on!

561
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:02,509
- You all right?
- Let's get you out of here.

562
01:09:08,211 --> 01:09:09,881
There they are!

563
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:30,613
Stay on the ground!
Stay on the ground!

564
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:33,745
You come on straight down.
I'm going in.

565
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,540
- Do not move!
- Keep your eye on him!

566
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,446
Flip him!

567
01:10:20,283 --> 01:10:23,273
lron Gator, this is Scarface 51.
We have eyes on the machine.

568
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,666
Contact initiated.

569
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,038
Take my gun!

570
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:15,947
Check the river.

571
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,151
You see him?

572
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:00,669
Hydraulics are out!

573
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:15,596
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

574
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,190
- They know you, even if you don't.
- Enough!

575
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,037
That gun ain't gonna stop shit!

576
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:13,003
Nobody's shot you in the heart,
and I see that thing beating!

577
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:14,896
Kyle Reese.

578
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:18,134
He's in Skynet.
You do that, he's dead.

579
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:20,898
I can get you in.

580
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,281
How?

581
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,512
Look at me.

582
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:34,989
That's why I don't trust you.

583
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,570
I'm the only hope you have.

584
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:46,032
I need to find who did this to me.

585
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,213
So do you.

586
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:51,556
Connor!

587
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,640
Make your choice.

588
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:02,907
You get me in.

589
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:09,384
You tell me where I can find
Kyle Reese.

590
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:13,201
Yeah?

591
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,046
Iwill.

592
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:25,083
Contact me on that.
Let me know he's still alive.

593
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,269
What are you?

594
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,052
I don't know.

595
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,968
He's over here!

596
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,496
You all right?

597
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,398
Any sign of him?

598
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:53,915
He's gone.

599
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:02,973
Why'd you do it?

600
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,380
I saw a man...

601
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:08,442
.-not a machine.

602
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,152
How's that leg?

603
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:21,097
-T'll live.
- Let her go!

604
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:32,803
Connor? Command for you.

605
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:37,254
- This is Connor.
- Connor, are your men ready?

606
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,577
Negative. Nobody is ready.

607
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:44,226
We are not, you are not. We must abort
the attack. The game has changed.

608
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,967
What are you talking about? All
elements are past their release points.

609
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:49,947
They're in assault position.

610
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:53,566
Then delay the attack. At least,
delay the attack. I have a chance...

611
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:57,466
..to infiltrate Skynet and rescue those
prisoners. Give me that opportunity.

612
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,250
No, absolutely not! This is not
the time for a rescue mission!

613
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:04,061
What you ask for will undermine
the whole operation.

614
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,750
Skynet has Kyle Reese.

615
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,866
- Then that is his fate.
- It's our fate.

616
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:12,826
I have to save him. He is the key.

617
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:17,818
The key to the future, to the past.
Without him, we lose everything.

618
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:20,221
No, you stay the course!

619
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:24,363
If we stay the course, we are dead!
We are all dead!

620
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,698
As of this moment, soldier...

621
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:29,637
..you are relieved of your command.

622
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:33,182
You are no longer a part
of this Resistance.

623
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:42,649
I didn't catch that last statement.

624
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:44,802
Neither did I.

625
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:48,947
This is John Connor.

626
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:52,115
If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.

627
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,542
Listen carefully.
If we attack tonight...

628
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,489
..our humanity is lost.

629
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:02,153
Command wants us
to fight like machines.

630
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:05,245
They want us
to make cold, calculated decisions.

631
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:07,721
But we are not machines!

632
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:12,349
And if we behave like them,
then what is the point in winning?

633
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:17,282
Command is going to ask you
to attack Skynet.

634
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:20,790
lam asking you not to.

635
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:27,602
If even one bomb drops on Skynet
before sunrise...

636
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:30,837
.our future will be lost.

637
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:35,107
So please, stand down.
Give me the time...

638
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,368
..to protect our future that all of us...

639
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,388
are fighting for.

640
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,816
This is John Connor.

641
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:12,568
What should I tell your men
when they find out you're gone?

642
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:18,593
I'll be back.

643
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:13,817
I'm coming for you.

644
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:00,965
Come on, Marcus.

645
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,219
Kyle.

646
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,538
Okay.

647
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:53,068
Signal broadcasting
at full strength, sir.

648
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:57,751
- Good. Commence bombing of Skynet.
- We have a green light for the attack.

649
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,754
This is Bakersfield.
That's a no-go on your last. Out.

650
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,990
- Eugene, standing down.
- This is Reno. Negative on your last.

651
01:24:04,573 --> 01:24:07,153
Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield.
They're all standing down.

652
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:11,049
They will not attack
unless Connor gives the order.

653
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,230
Kyle Reese?

654
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:43,922
Get to the transport! Go!
Is Kyle Reese here?

655
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:06,612
Welcome home, Marcus.

656
01:25:07,069 --> 01:25:07,939
We knew you'd be back.

657
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,124
After all, it was programmed in you.

658
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,862
And you executed
that programming beautifully.

659
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:18,909
What am I?

660
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:23,124
You are an infiltration prototype.
The only one of your kind.

661
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:27,982
We resurrected you, advanced
Cyberdyne's work, amended it.

662
01:25:28,757 --> 01:25:29,927
You're dead.

663
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:34,772
Calculations confirm Serena Kogan's
face is the easiest for you to process.

664
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:37,237
We can be others if you wish.

665
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:42,888
Marcus, what else could you be...

666
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:44,902
.if not machine?

667
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,377
Aman.

668
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,799
The human condition
no longer applies to you.

669
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,178
Accept what you already know.

670
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:55,228
That you were made
to serve a purpose.

671
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:59,644
To achieve what no other machine
has achieved before.

672
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:06,666
To infiltrate, find a target, and then
bring that target back home to us.

673
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:13,144
We've been at war since
before either of us even existed.

674
01:26:13,969 --> 01:26:17,039
You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.

675
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,513
You get me in.

676
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,195
You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.

677
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:24,821
- Yeah?
- Iwill.

678
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,677
Kyle Reese! Kyle Reese!
Move! Move!

679
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:34,605
Kyle Reese!

680
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,907
Get to the transports!

681
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:38,499
- Kyle Reese?
-No.

682
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,147
You! Move!

683
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:51,352
In times of desperation, people will
believe what they want to believe.

684
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:55,674
And so, we gave them
what they wanted to believe.

685
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:59,718
Atrick, in the form of a signal the
Resistance thought would win the war.

686
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:03,161
And they were right,
it will end this war.

687
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:06,592
Except that it is the Resistance
that will be terminated.

688
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:08,349
Not Skynet.

689
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:18,157
Get the attack on Skynet Central
back online.

690
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,099
Il want our aircraft in the sky
immediately.

691
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:24,330
Sir. Sir, we've got a bogie
with a very large radar signature...

692
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,776
..closing in on our position.

693
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:38,541
Losenko?

694
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:46,202
We have destroyed ourselves.

695
01:27:47,129 --> 01:27:50,669
Skynet tracked our signal.
We led them straight to us.

696
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:07,332
Our best machines had failed
time and again to complete a mission.

697
01:28:07,983 --> 01:28:11,323
Something was missing.
We had to think. Radically.

698
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:16,237
And so we made you. We created
the perfect infiltration machine.

699
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:19,616
You, Marcus.

700
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:23,188
You did what Skynet has failed to do
for so many years.

701
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:26,133
You killed John Connor.

702
01:29:27,062 --> 01:29:28,762
Kyle!

703
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:30,827
Hey!

704
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:41,978
Don't fight, Marcus.

705
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:44,271
Remember what you are.

706
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:47,513
I know what I am.

707
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:01,885
I'm better this way.

708
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:04,814
You will not be given
a second chance.

709
01:30:05,367 --> 01:30:09,287
- You cannot save John Connor.
- Watch me.

710
01:30:39,301 --> 01:30:40,561
Got a message from Connor.

711
01:30:41,403 --> 01:30:43,103
He's in Skynet, needs air support.

712
01:30:45,674 --> 01:30:48,394
Let's go. Scrambled aircraft!

713
01:30:51,513 --> 01:30:54,233
Star! Star, go!

714
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:03,450
Star!

715
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:06,605
Star! Star! Come on. Come on.

716
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:31,139
- What's your name?
- Kyle Reese.

717
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,558
Stay with me.

718
01:31:58,713 --> 01:31:59,853
Back!

719
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:04,841
Back!

720
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:17,452
Come on, Star, move! Move!

721
01:32:45,193 --> 01:32:46,803
T-800s.

722
01:32:47,695 --> 01:32:49,625
There's so many of them.

723
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:10,374
Careful.

724
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:16,969
- What are these?
- Fuel cells.

725
01:33:17,459 --> 01:33:20,068
Life source for the T-800.

726
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:23,876
Nuclear.

727
01:33:25,133 --> 01:33:26,653
Enough to level this place.

728
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:30,864
Cover us.

729
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,262
Get ready.

730
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:39,029
This is it.

731
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:04,800
Run!

732
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:07,343
Star, come on! Let's go!

733
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,440
Get in.

734
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:15,331
Come on!

735
01:34:18,786 --> 01:34:21,036
We gotta get to the transport.

736
01:34:26,361 --> 01:34:28,031
- Where are you going?
-1I gotta end this.

737
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:29,952
No, no. I'm not gonna leave you!

738
01:34:30,365 --> 01:34:32,915
- You didn't.
- Who are you?

739
01:34:34,135 --> 01:34:35,445
John Connor.

740
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:41,373
Hey! Hey, John Connor's in there.
He's still in there.

741
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:43,659
Chris, she's hypovolemic,
start a line!

742
01:37:44,092 --> 01:37:45,642
- What?
- John Connor's in there.

743
01:37:46,794 --> 01:37:47,693
Come with me.

744
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:08,304
Connor!

745
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:13,996
Connor, help!

746
01:38:15,123 --> 01:38:16,383
Help!

747
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:19,672
Connor, it's Kyle. Help!

748
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:22,296
Do it! You son of a bitch!

749
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:52,201
Come on!

750
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:58,571
Come on!

751
01:40:17,078 --> 01:40:18,308
Come on!

752
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:11,093
Let's get out of here.

753
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:30,470
John.

754
01:41:35,056 --> 01:41:39,306
We can't make it back to base.
Set this down in the nearest safe zone.

755
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:48,860
Medevac, urgent.
Severe chest trauma.

756
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:53,480
Call the surgical team.
Remarks: it's Connor.

757
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:13,099
How long?

758
01:43:16,724 --> 01:43:18,564
His heart...

759
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:21,550
..can't take it.

760
01:43:21,896 --> 01:43:24,826
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Kate.

761
01:43:25,433 --> 01:43:27,013
Kyle?

762
01:43:40,448 --> 01:43:41,818
Take it.

763
01:44:01,469 --> 01:44:03,279
You earned it.

764
01:44:21,889 --> 01:44:23,179
Kate?

765
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:30,907
Take mine.

766
01:44:32,066 --> 01:44:33,465
Marcus...

767
01:44:37,271 --> 01:44:39,901
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

768
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:44,567
This is mine.

769
01:45:42,203 --> 01:45:44,343
What is it that makes us human?

770
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,970
It's not something
you can program.

771
01:45:50,711 --> 01:45:52,961
You can't put it into a chip.

772
01:45:55,149 --> 01:45:56,989
It's the strength of the human heart.

773
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:01,919
The difference between us
and machines.

774
01:46:21,242 --> 01:46:25,842
There is a storm on the horizon.
A time of hardship and pain.

775
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:31,190
This battle has been won, but the war
against the machines rages on.

776
01:46:32,019 --> 01:46:34,649
Skynet's global network
remains strong.

777
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:37,411
But we will not quit...

778
01:46:37,925 --> 01:46:39,765
.. Until all of it is destroyed.

779
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:45,147
This is John Connor.
There is no fate but what we make.
