1
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,647
Hey, hey, watch out. Watch out.

2
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:48,701
Welcome, my friend.

3
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:49,942
Great to see you.

4
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,887
Yeah, glad you made it.

5
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,205
This can't be Ajit. He's a little man already.

6
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,768
-Unbelievable.
-[ hope you're hungry, Adrian.

7
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,241
I'm famished. How are you, Apama?

8
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,531
-[ made that fish curry you love.
-I can't wait.

9
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,534
She gets more beautiful every time I see her.
Why is that?

10
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,250
Strange, isn't it?
But her fish curry is still awful.

11
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,975
You were mysterious on the phone.
Why didn't you attend the conference?

12
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,909
-[ will show you, Adrian, sir.
-Satnam, stop “siring" me.

13
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,863
How deep do we need to go?

14
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,451
Eleven thousand feet.

15
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,917
I searched all over India for this thing.

16
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,897
Used to be the deepest copper mine in the world.

17
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,887
Remember my brother, Gurdeep? He's a student now.

18
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,040
Namaste, Dr. Helmsley, sir.

19
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,605
Adrian. It's just Adrian.

20
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,367
Just don't pour too much, huh?

21
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,631
How do you work in this heat?

22
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,570
You've come on a good day, my friend.

23
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,559
Sometimes it can hit 120 degrees.

24
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,136
You have to come and meet Dr. Lokesh...

25
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,981
...a Fellow of quantum physics
at the university in Chennai.

26
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,220
Dr. Helmsley.

27
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,571
So, what are we looking at?

28
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,551
These are neutrinos acting normally.

29
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,572
Minuscule mass, no electrical charge.

30
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,302
They pass through
ordinary matter almost undisturbed.

31
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,462
Your message said the count doubled
after the last solar eruptions.

32
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,768
That was last week.

33
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,088
But this happened two days ago.

34
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,648
The biggest Sun eruptions in human history...

35
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,911
...causing the highest neutrino count
we've ever recorded.

36
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,589
My God.

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,110
That's not what worries me, Adrian.
a

38
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,893
For the first time ever...

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,540
..the neutrinos are causing a physical reaction.

40
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,211
That's impossible.

41
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,268
That feels very good.

42
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,561
Please, follow me.
a

43
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,291
You won't believe this.

44
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,398
This water tank goes down another 6000 feet.

45
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,976
It looks like the neutrinos coming from the Sun...

46
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,565
...have mutated into
a new kind of nuclear particle.

47
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,229
They're heating up the Earth's core...

48
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,226
...and suddenly act like microwaves.

49
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:57,009
Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, no speech...

50
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,435
.. just a thank-you...

51
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,271
..because tonight,
with your extraordinary generosity...

52
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,994
...we have raised $1.7 million.

53
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,699
Have a stiff drink,
a
because I'm locking the doors...

54
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,737
-...and passing the hat around again.
-It's okay. It's okay.

55
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,044
-I work for the White House.
-I don't care.

56
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,943
This is a black-tie event.

57
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,125
Scotty.

58
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,780
Hey. Adrian, I thought you were in India.
What's going on?

59
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,854
-[ need your jacket.
-What?

60
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,749
I gotta speak to Anheuser.
Give me your damn jacket, please.

61
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,436
-All right.
-Okay?

62
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,107
-All right, here. Here.
-Hold that for a minute, will you?

63
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,549
Hey! Easy, that's a $600 jacket.

64
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,757
Mr. Anheuser?

65
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,255
Mr. Anheuser.

66
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,341
I need to talk to you.

67
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,666
-Do I know you?
-Sorry, sir.

68
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,247
My name's Dr. Adrian Helmsley.

69
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:56,049
I'm a deputy geologist at the Office of Science
and Technology Policy.

70
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,870
Excuse me, fellas.
a

71
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,691
You know that this is a fundraiser,
a
not a frat party, right?

72
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,473
-It's important, sir.
-You know what? It always is.

73
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,136
Make an appointment with my--
You know, even better:
a

74
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,825
Have your boss bring it up
at the quarterly briefing.

75
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,828
There's a good plan.

76
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,525
I just traveled
20 straight hours to get here, sir.

77
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,499
I haven't slept in two days.

78
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:21,011
You need to read this, sir.
a
You need to read it now.

79
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,613
Let me guess, national geology crisis?

80
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,047
Excuse me.

81
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,517
-Who do you report to?
-Lee Cavazos.

82
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,710
Not anymore.

83
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,787
Alan, bring the car around.

84
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,263
-You're gonna wish you took a shower.
-Sir?

85
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,181
You're about to meet the president.

86
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,671
What's going on?

87
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,666
Get that to the office.

88
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,496
No G8! No G8! No G8!

89
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:38,574
Good morning.

90
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,005
! would like to meet privately with my fellow
heads of state.

91
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,708
Mr. Makarenko wishes
to have his interpreters present.

92
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,844
Mr. President, I can assure you...

93
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,354
...your English is more than sufficient
for what I have to say.

94
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,592
Mr. Presidents.

95
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,907
Six months ago...

96
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,966
...l was made aware
ofa situation so devastating...

97
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,814
...that, at first, I refused to believe it.
ee

98
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,275
However...

99
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,167
..through the concerted efforts...

100
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,873
...of our brightest scientists...

101
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,785
...we have confirmed its validity.

102
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,558
The world as we know it...

103
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,650
...will soon come to an end.

104
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:04,793
This dam project will create many new jobs.

105
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,329
The Party and country
will assist in your relocation.

106
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,979
Grandma, give me your hand.

107
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,741
-But where are they taking us?
-It'll be all right.

108
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,366
EMPIRE GRAND HOTEL, LONDON
a

109
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:52,064
Has His Highness had
an opportunity to study the dossier?

110
00:09:56,863 --> 00:10:00,203
You must understand,
a
I have a very big family, Mr...?

111
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,574
Isaacs.

112
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,143
One billion dollars is a lot of money.

113
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,843
I'm afraid the amount is in euros, Your Highness.

114
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,556
! put a lot of faith into your organization.

115
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,589
It's a perfect replica, Roland.

116
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,241
There are too many fanatics out there
that could damage her.

117
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,922
Just think about the beautiful Buddha statues
they blew up in Afghanistan.

118
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,540
Our Heritage Organization
has already made selections...

119
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,708
...from the British Museum and L'Hermitage.

120
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,045
I guess she'll be safe now, tucked away...

121
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:06,188
..hidden in some bunker in Switzerland.

122
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,024
Perfectly safe, Roland.

123
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,103
Only infrared analysis
would reveal the difference.

124
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,632
But it's still a fake.

125
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,714
This mass suicide was actually discovered
by a documentary crew...

126
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,318
...here in the ancient Mayan city of Tikal.

127
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,527
Now, the victims, and we've seen many...

128
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,306
...are said to have adhered
to the Mayan-Quiché calendar...

129
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,615
..which predicts the end of time to occur...

130
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,001
...on the 21st of December of this year...

131
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,223
..due to the Sun's destructive forces.

132
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,909
Thank you, Mark.

133
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,630
Strangely enough,
scientific records do support the fact...

134
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:58,286
..that we are heading for the biggest solar
climax in recorded history.

135
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,093
Well, yes.

136
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,764
Apparently many people believe
that the Mayan calendar predicts...

137
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,648
..that there's supposed
to be a galactic alignment...

138
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,034
I'm a dead man.

139
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,825
I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man.

140
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,238
-it's the end of the world in 2012.

141
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,568
Goddamn it.

142
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,911
Hey, Kate.
I'm practically on the freeway right now.

143
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,485
Yes, I'm hurtling toward you as we speak.

144
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,875
Will you relax? Yeah, I'll be there any second.

145
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,106
You know it's a vacation
and not a doctor's appointment, right?

146
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,182
That it's supposed to be fun?

147
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,054
You remember fun, don't you, Kate?

148
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,599
Do you remember where you were
when it stopped being fun for you?

149
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,744
Yeah. I got it.

150
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,992
Bug spray? Oh, yeah,
because it's mosquito season in Yellowstone.

151
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,656
I got a whole bunch. Okay,
I gotta go, because I'm in a bad-reception area.

152
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,890
Whoa, man.
a

153
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,745
Would you look at that?

154
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,396
Sick.

155
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,901
Merrill, I told you.

156
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,763
We have to move back to Wisconsin.

157
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,206
Yeah, but these little mini-quakes are really
getting on my nerves.

158
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,499
A little surface crack? You're not gonna be
inconvenienced by that.

159
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,329
Right, surface cracks.
I got a plastic surgeon for that.

160
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,838
Thank God for those shake-proof coffee mugs, Lisa.

161
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,127
They show the true nature of us Californians.

162
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,106
We'll not bow to these inconvenient things
like surface cracks.

163
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,857
If you have a funny mini-quake story
and wanna share it, call 555-1070...
a

164
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,776
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, baby.

165
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,309
-How are you, sweetie?
-Good.

166
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,064
Jackson, what is this?
a

167
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,423
Please don't call me that. I'm your dad.

168
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,779
Come on.

169
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,224
You're taking them camping in a limo?

170
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,093
Okay, great.

171
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,822
What happened to your temp job?

172
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,680
Oh, you know, better hours, more time to write.

173
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,622
What about sleeping?
Have you been doing any of that lately?

174
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,639
I've said it a thousand times, no lipo on Fridays.
It's too messy. Hold on.

175
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,605
-Morning, Jackson.
Hi.

176
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:27,956
-Nice ride.
-Thanks.

177
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,441
Guys, have a nice trip.

178
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,112
Remember, watch out for the bears.
a
You know, they're:

179
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,658
Bye, Gordon.

180
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,706
-Love you, honey.
-Bye.

181
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,922
-Okay, so, Lil- Oh, yeah.
-You tell him.

182
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:39,881
Tell me what?

183
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,463
She needs to put these on
before she goes to sleep.

184
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,411
-Still?
-Yes.

185
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,887
Your 7-year-old still wets her bed.
That's something you should know.

186
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,514
-I love you.
-Love you, Mom.

187
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,030
-Hey.
-You okay?

188
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,625
They've been looking forward
to spending time with you.

189
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:58,993
I know.

190
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,822
-So don't be on your computer.
-Got it.

191
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,652
Love you.

192
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,588
-So this time, we hit Japan.
-S0?

193
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,641
Well, you could visit your boy, Will.

194
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,189
Afternoon, ladies.
a

195
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,841
-Hello there.
-Hello, handsome.
a

196
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,389
Are you even listening to me?

197
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,124
Unfortunately, l am, Harry.

198
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,133
[heard from Audrey you're a grandpa now.

199
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,698
Would you mind keeping your nose out of my family?

200
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,714
You're cramping my style, baby. There we are.

201
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,284
So he married a Japanese girl.
How is that the end of the world?

202
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,741
Come on, Tony. You should at least go see him.

203
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,543
-You see your boy?
-Not as much as I'd like.

204
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,122
D.C. is a long way, but at least we talk.

205
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,747
About what?

206
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,300
Life, and how short it is.
a

207
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,360
What the hell was that?

208
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:19,911
Hello?

209
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:21,713
Laura.

210
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,882
Laura, can you hear me?

211
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,727
Roland, is that you?

212
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,818
Laura, they lied to us.

213
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,184
I've arranged a press conference for tomorrow.

214
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,766
I will tell everyone the truth
about what's going on.

215
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,549
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,237
The art you collected...

217
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,626
..it's not in the Alps.

218
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,231
Those tunnels are empty.

219
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,500
[ have proofl

220
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,429
Laura.

221
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,760
Laura, can you hear me?

222
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,286
-I'm losing you. Roland?
-Laura, can you hear me?

223
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,771
Laura.

224
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,557
Break it down.

225
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,407
-I liked that song.
-We lost it.

226
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:26,088
--going on on the West Coast
with All those surface cracks.

227
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:30,586
I told myself,
"Charlie, get your stupid ass to Yellowstone.”

228
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:34,507
I don't want to miss all the fun
when it finally blows.

229
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,114
Let me tell you, there's been government people...

230
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,220
..flying in and out all morning, and trust me,
they did not look happy.

231
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,081
-Always remember folks:
-That's weird.

232
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,175
-You heard it first from Charlie.
-Yeah, just when he said that?

233
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,044
What are the odds?

234
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,434
We're not seeing soil liquefaction we'd expect...

235
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,775
...or any evidence of fracture propagation
within the tectonic plates.

236
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,126
-In English.
-The activity on the coast...

237
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,719
..1s not caused by tecto--
By regular earthquakes.

238
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,144
And these surface cracks have nothing to do
with shifting fault lines.

239
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,531
You suggesting this could be the beginning
of the Cho Ming operation?

240
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,021
Dr. Helmsley is flying to Yellowstone this morning
to collect more data.

241
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,165
We have been following the schedule you
established, Mr. Helmsley.

242
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,032
The most important schedule
in the history of mankind.

243
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,841
Now you're telling me we have to throw it out?

244
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,737
Yes, sir.
a

245
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,644
I was wrong.

246
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,466
Do you know how many times
I've heard those words in this office?

247
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,570
Zero.

248
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,217
Did you see this?

249
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,425
I'm sorry, Mr. President. She insisted.

250
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,027
It's all over the news.

251
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,869
We are learning more about
this deadly car explosion.

252
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,795
The director of the French National Museums...

253
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,984
...was to hold a press conference
at the Louvre this morning.

254
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,998
Coincidentally, his death took place
in the same Paris tunnel...

255
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,482
...where Princess Diana died in 1997.

256
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,265
We are continuing to follow this story. We will--

257
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,496
Laura, I don't believe you've met Dr. Helmsley.

258
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,030
I just talked to him, Dad, and he told me...

259
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,596
..that the organization
that I work for is a sham.

260
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,457
I mean, why would he say that?

261
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,031
You look just like your mother when you get upset.

262
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,639
Did I ever tell you that?

263
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,898
Every time I get upset.

264
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,767
Daddy, a man was killed.

265
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,891
Honey, please sit down.

266
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,655
Only a dozen people in this administration...

267
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,790
...know what I'm about to tell you.

268
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,032
Dad, what's going on?

269
00:19:55,795 --> 00:20:00,155
An unprecedented international
endeavor is underway.

270
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,950
At this point,
46 nations are invested in this thing.

271
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,551
Laura's a smart girl. She'll understand.

272
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,103
That thing in Paris, we're not involved in
any of that, are we?

273
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,734
We? Who the hell is "we"?
What are you talking about?

274
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,777
We need to focus on this timeline.
That's what we need to do.

275
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,397
-When do we let the country know?
-What do you mean?

276
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,906
The people, sir. They need to know.

277
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,860
Well, of course they do.

278
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,129
Listen, your job is to figure out when this is all
gonna fall apart.

279
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:32,974
My job is to figure out...

280
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,232
...how to retain some semblance of government
after it falls apart.

281
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,616
Until then, we don't have time for anything...

282
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,741
...except for doing those jobs. Okay?

283
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,343
Call me the moment you get
any news from Yellowstone.

284
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:44,693
Yes, sir.
a

285
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:46,915
Cute girl, huh?

286
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,113
-Sir?
-The First Daughter.

287
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,035
-I saw you looking at her.
-[ wasn't looking at her.

288
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,485
Better move fast, kid. The end is near.
a

289
00:20:56,689 --> 00:21:00,119
Adrian, your chopper's ready.
They're waiting on the South Lawn.

290
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,063
Daddy, where are we going?

291
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,139
Going to this really special place that I know.

292
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,160
It's a place where your mom
and I used to hang out a lot.

293
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,723
I don't wanna know where you and Mom had sex.

294
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,395
-I'm not ready for that, Jackson.
-Stop calling me that.

295
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,658
It's creeping me out. What's wrong with "Dad"?

296
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,945
-Grumpy Grumperson.
-Daddy, look at this.

297
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,128
That wasn't here before.

298
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,427
What do we do?

299
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,512
Go get your hat.

300
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,168
Don't you see the signs?

301
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,899
Used to be a lake here.

302
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,211
Doesn't look much of a lake to me.

303
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,937
I know, the whole damn thing's gone.

304
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,291
-Come on, let's check it out.
a
-Great.

305
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,956
Subjects have now entered hot zone.

306
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,254
Who is that?

307
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:36,997
That's the U.S. Army.

308
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,930
All manner of government vehicle
are converging on subjects.

309
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,939
You're in a restricted area, sir.
a

310
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,649
-We need you to come with us.
-Right. Right.

311
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,014
Okay, we're gonna go with these guys.

312
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,347
That'll be fun, huh?
a

313
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,378
This is wild.

314
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,610
This is really wild.

315
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,443
This is unbelievable.
2700 degrees Celsius at 40,000 feet?

316
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,971
I know, it sounds completely implausible.

317
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,096
Nonetheless, we're ticking off an increase of
almost 0.5 percent.

318
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,497
-Per day?
-No.

319
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,779
Per hour.

320
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,770
Dr. Helmsley. We've arrested
a group of tourists in the hot zone.

321
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,490
Okay, I'll take care of it.

322
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,098
Look, let's get Satnam on the communications link.

323
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,317
We'll try and cross-reference the data.

324
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,443
It's a national park.
There's not supposed to be posted fences.

325
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,632
I mean, what's going on here?

326
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,548
We're geologists.

327
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,277
Do you usually go digging with machine guns?

328
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,128
Major, I'll take care of this. Thank you.

329
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,316
-What happened to the lake?
-That's what we're trying to find out.

330
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,743
We think the entire area has become unstable.

331
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,835
I think you should take your kids
and leave, Mr. Curtis.
a

332
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,592
You're not by any chance the Jackson Curtis...

333
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,129
..who wrote Farewell Atlantis, are you?

334
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,244
The very same.

335
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,426
It's actually dedicated to my mom.

336
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,678
That's great.

337
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,467
l read a couple of your short stories
when I was in college. Yeah.

338
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,437
You know, your father is a very talented man.

339
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,985
-Listen up.
-t's amazing. I'm reading your book.

340
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,367
I'm around day 300, the shuttle has just lost
communication with Earth.

341
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,641
You're one of the lucky few who bought it.

342
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,503
-I didn’t buy it.
-No?

343
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,341
My dad gave it to me.

344
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,268
Let me ask you something.

345
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,793
You believe those people
would behave so selflessly...

346
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,156
...knowing that their own lives were at stake?

347
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,818
I hope so.

348
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:51,056
The critics said I was naive,
a
an unabashed optimist...

349
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,087
...but what do they know, right?

350
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,482
Well...

351
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,024
-Pleasure.
-It was a great pleasure meeting you.

352
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,390
Major, could you escort
these good people to the campgrounds?

353
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,923
This is yours.

354
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,407
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir.
a

355
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:04,619
-Take care.
-Okay.

356
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:05,964
He was very nice.

357
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,475
You're just saying that because he liked my book.

358
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:17,296
Looks like that boy of yours is gonna be
smarter than any of us.

359
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,288
What's wrong?

360
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,962
I sent Satnam the temperature reading.

361
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:29,861
My colleagues in Argentina
and Ontario have almost identical data.

362
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,639
It's so hot here, we've had to seal off the mine.
a

363
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,442
-Double-checked the numbers?
-Triple-checked, my friend.

364
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,988
I wish we were wrong...

365
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,837
...but we're not.

366
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,826
The Earth's crust is destabilizing.

367
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,393
It's too early.

368
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,848
Adrian, you have to begin the evacuation.

369
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,424
My God.

370
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:00,119
All our scientific advances,
a
our fancy machines...

371
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,279
The Mayans saw this coming thousands of years ago.

372
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,728
I thought we'd have more time.

373
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,375
Okay.

374
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,450
I want you to pack up your family.

375
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:29,102
I'm gonna arrange an airlift for you from Delhi.

376
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,051
Thank you, my friend.

377
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:32,897
And good luck.

378
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,341
Ajit.

379
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,449
We are going on a big ship.

380
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,245
-That was so cool.
-Yeah, that was intense.
a

381
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,581
-The helicopters.
-Craziest place I've seen.

382
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,237
-Those helicopters were so cool.
-Wait. Wait. Wait.

383
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,614
Wait. Sorry. One question:

384
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,693
What did the government guys say to you?

385
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,654
Well, they don't like us
going over their fences...

386
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,764
...and that the whole area back there is unstable.

387
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,711
Unstable. They said "unstable"?

388
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,138
Yeah, unstable.
a

389
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,011
That's funny.

390
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,339
Let's go. Have a good one.

391
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,168
Unstable.

392
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,031
It's not just Yellowstone, sir.

393
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,737
Temperatures are rising
with incredible velocity...

394
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,600
..dn hot zones across the globe.

395
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,985
Are you absolutely sure about this, Adrian?

396
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,894
Because once we give these orders...

397
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,168
..here's no going back. You understand that?

398
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:52,155
I'm afraid there's no longer any doubt, sir.

399
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,543
We have to save what we can.
And we have to move now!

400
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,774
There's mosquitoes in here.
Did anybody spray the tent?

401
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,573
I'm gonna get that spray tomorrow.

402
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,588
They just like you because your blood's so sweet.

403
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,192
Dad, you said you wouldn't work on your book.

404
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,738
What, Lil'bee? I'm not, I'm not.
ee
I'm just-- I'm doing something else.

405
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:46,269
Let me get you ready for-- Ready for bed.

406
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,255
Okay.

407
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,745
Did you really need all these hats?

408
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,538
-Where are your Pull-Ups, sweetie?
-[ have them on.

409
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,648
Who gave you this, Mommy?

410
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,379
No, Gordon gave it to me for my birthday.

411
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,193
A cell phone is something we gotta talk about,
you know, as a family.

412
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:13,841
What family?

413
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,883
That hurts my feelings
when you say stuff like that.

414
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,362
Just go away.

415
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:30,437
Adults get...

416
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,374
...hurt feelings too.

417
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,105
We have a listener calling in.

418
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,144
Bill from Cooke City,
you're on the Charlie Frost Show.

419
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,470
Charlie, just wanted to say I love your show.

420
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:51,882
No way.

421
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,593
-not afraid to tell the truth.

422
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,572
Thank you, Bill. What is your question?

423
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,924
I wanted to know, where is all this gonna start?

424
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,297
Well, something like this
could only originate in Hollywood, Bill.

425
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,090
They got the Earth cracking
under their asses already.

426
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:07,123
Our family believes in the gospel
of the Lord Jesus.

427
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:10,803
-We have nothing to fear, Charlie.
-Good for you, Bill. Thanks for calling.

428
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:15,633
This is Charlie Frost reporting live from
Yellowstone National Park...

429
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:20,835
...800n to become
the world's largest active volcano.

430
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,657
I'll be right back, folks.

431
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,582
Do you mind if I join you?
I wanted to ask you something.

432
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,437
! only got a minute.

433
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,409
Hey. Pickle?

434
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,992
No. I was listening to the broadcast
and was wondering...

435
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,882
...what exactly is it
that's gonna start in Hollywood?

436
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,186
It's the apocalypse.

437
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,098
End of days.

438
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,580
The Judgment Day, the end of the world, my friend.

439
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,234
Christians called it the rapture,
but the Mayans knew about it...

440
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,691
..the Hopis, the I Ching...

441
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,721
..the Bible, kind of...
a

442
00:30:59,124 --> 00:30:59,994
Beer?

443
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,009
-Yeah.
-So look, I gotta eat.

444
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,834
Why don't you download my blog. It's free.

445
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,369
Of course, we do appreciate donations.

446
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,599
In ancient times, the Mayan people
were the first civilization to discover...

447
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,480
..that this planet had an expiration date.

448
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,266
According to their calendar...

449
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,684
...in the year 2012,
a cataclysmic event will unfold...

450
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,805
...caused by an alignment of the planets in our
solar system...

451
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,951
..that only happens every 640,000 years.

452
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,085
Oh, not again.

453
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,741
Pretty neat, huh? I did all the animation myself.

454
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:39,282
Just imagine the Earth as an orange.

455
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:43,992
You lure them in with humor.
Then you make them think.

456
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:47,893
Our sun will begin to emit
such extreme amounts of radiation—

457
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,440
Those little bastards are called neutrinos.

458
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,099
--that the core of the Earth will melt.
That's the inside part of the orange...

459
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,496
..eaving the crust of our planet free to shift.

460
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:02,243
In 1958, Professor Charles Hapgood named it
Earth Crust Displacement.

461
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,630
Albert Einstein did support it.

462
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,181
People, we'll get it all.

463
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:10,016
The forces of Mother Nature
will be so devastating...

464
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:15,692
..{t will bring an end to this world
on winter solstice, 12-21-12.
a

465
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,171
Always remember, folks,
you heard it first from Charlie Frost.

466
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,840
You'd have to keep a thing like this under wraps.

467
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,159
I mean, just think about it, okay?

468
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,861
First, the stock market would go.

469
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,344
Then the economy, boom!

470
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:32,927
The dollar, boom!
a

471
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:37,735
And then pandemonium in the streets.
War, genocide, boom, boom, boom!

472
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,707
Bullshit.
Nobody could keep that big a secret, Charlie.

473
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,694
-Somebody would blow the whistle.
-Every once in a while...

474
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,960
...Some poor little sucker tries.

475
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,772
Well, like these guys, boom, boom!

476
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,492
Every one of these guys, dead, dead, dead.

477
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,766
That's Professor Meyers.

478
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,604
He ran the Atlantis shuttle program.
Why, did you know him?

479
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,256
Yeah, he helped me with research on my book.

480
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,969
Well, that must have been before his "accident."
a

481
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,446
Meyers is dead?

482
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,231
Oh, yeah, two months ago.

483
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,090
He was one of my most avid listeners...

484
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,326
..and he had it all figured out.

485
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,661
Everything the government was doing,
where and why...

486
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,165
He even sent me a map.

487
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,115
A map for what, Charlie? What's the map for?

488
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:36,691
They're building spaceships, man.

489
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,858
Shit, man, I have to go...

490
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,129
...because ! gotta get back to Earth.

491
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,097
-But do you got a traveler for the road?
-This is my last--

492
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,380
Oh, that'll be all right.
But, anyway, I really enjoyed most of this.

493
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:55,956
Thank you so much.

494
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,880
Hey. Hey, guess what.

495
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,643
-They're selling seats.
-Put me down for three.

496
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,012
No, guys like you and me don't have a chance.

497
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,584
You'd have to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch...

498
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,807
...or some Russian billionaire or something.

499
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,735
Keep it down, my kids are sleeping.

500
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,518
Get them out of Yellowstone.

501
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,011
It's gonna get ugly here.

502
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,194
Why don't we make a baby?

503
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,675
We're not making a baby in the supermarket.

504
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,638
Hey, hands off the merchandise.

505
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,325
Honey, women pay me
thousands of dollars to handle their boobs.

506
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,990
You get it for free.

507
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,996
You always act strange after he shows up.

508
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,272
I'm not acting strange.
I'm looking for the macaroni.

509
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,722
So why did you stick with him so long?

510
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,857
Can we just give it a rest, please?
He's the father of my children.

511
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,731
Oh, come on, Kate.
a

512
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,979
You gave up med school so you could have Noah.

513
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,615
You practically raised him
and Lilly by yourself...

514
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,574
..while he sat writing that junk.

515
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,973
It's not junk. He's published.

516
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,852
Oh, published, right, ! forgot.

517
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,393
Four hundred and twenty-two copies.

518
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:40,214
Did you see that?

519
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,592
See what? Hey, Kate.

520
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,474
Listen, we have to keep
working at this, our relationship.

521
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,865
I mean, I don't know, honey.
I just feel like there's something pulling us apart.

522
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:55,955
Gordon!

523
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,687
Hang on! Hang onto the pole!

524
00:35:58,757 --> 00:35:59,807
Kate. Don't let go.

525
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,238
-Oh, my God.
-Hang onl!

526
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,442
Gordon!

527
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,139
Do you have anything for mosquito bites?

528
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,178
Before or after?

529
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,141
I'd get before and after.

530
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,903
Stop scratching. You're gonna get it all infected.

531
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,308
[ had to make a stop at the grocery store.

532
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,265
It's Mrs. Birnbaum. She's my teacher, she's on TV.

533
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,429
Here is Grayson's Market, which was open
for business at the time...

534
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,004
..-but fortunately, there were no fatalities
or injuries reported.

535
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,489
It really is a miracle that no one got hurt.

536
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,092
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.
ce

537
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,995
Did you see what happened to our supermarket?

538
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,507
She wants us to come home.

539
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:41,955
Is this even possible?

540
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,170
We worked every option through the night.

541
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:48,266
The good news, consensus is that four of the arks
will be operational in time.

542
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,403
Only four? You call that good news?

543
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,979
We can save over 400,000 people.

544
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,258
To me, sir, that's nothing short of a miracle.

545
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,994
But we have to initiate
the boarding process now. Thomas.

546
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,404
We don't have a choice.

547
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,430
You have got to convince them.

548
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,846
Listen, I'll try to keep this brief.

549
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,919
According to the latest information
from Yellowsto—

550
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:14,106
-Please continue, Adrian.
a
-Thank you, sir.

551
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,716
The temperature of the subterranean crust...

552
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:20,452
..that is, the cement
a
that holds our land mass in place...

553
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,976
..{s increasing at a rapid rate,
much faster than anticipated.

554
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,266
As a result,
a
we've observed extreme polar instability.

555
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,246
The magnetic fields have decreased by
more than 80 percent...

556
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,122
...in the last 48 hours.

557
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:35,267
How much time do we have, Dr. Helmsley?

558
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,429
Two, maybe three days, if we're lucky.

559
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,715
How can you speak about luck in such a situation?

560
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,732
Apologies, Mr. Prime Minister. l....

561
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,949
I meant no disrespect.

562
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:54,819
I'm afraid the longer we wait,
the more luck plays its part.

563
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,352
My friends...

564
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,962
...l recommend we evacuate immediately.

565
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,203
If any of you have objections...

566
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,053
...please speak now.

567
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,663
In the blue corner...

568
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,233
...98 victories, 34 knockouts...

569
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,185
..{he fighting machine from the Ukraine...

570
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:27,545
..the undefeated number-one ranked
heavyweight challenger:

Mr. Zultan Balashin!

572
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,971
-Yuri!
-Zultan!

573
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,297
l feared you would not come.

574
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,486
He needs to concentrate now, Mr. Karpov.

575
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:50,025
You shut up when I talk to my boy, understand?

576
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,402
Yes, Mr. Karpov.

577
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,984
Good. That is good.

578
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,529
Zultan, listen to me...

579
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:00,546
...we are fighters, we never go down...

580
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,436
...No matter how hard they hit us.

581
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,435
Kill the bastard.

582
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,283
Kill the bastard, Zultan.
a

583
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,116
Ladies and gentlemen...

584
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,112
..let's get ready to rumble!

585
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,540
Zultan!

586
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:52,739
Yuri, where are you going?

587
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,306
Yuri?

588
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:04,135
One, two, three...
ee

589
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,603
Caltech believes that the half-mile fissure
running through Westwood...

590
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,987
...has released most of the surface tension.

591
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,962
Life will soon return to normal,
a
Mayor Gonzales said...

592
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,412
-...at an early news conference.
-Okay, guys. Almost home.

593
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:20,848
Rise and shine.

594
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,366
All right, you're free.

595
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,502
-Thank God.
-Mommy.

596
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,783
Hi, sweetheart.
a

597
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,206
Gordon!

598
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,362
Hey, buddy boy.

599
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,571
Good time? Yeah?

600
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,481
God, I missed you.

601
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:55,736
Yeah.

602
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,104
-Who wants pancakes? Come on.
-Me.

603
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:05,656
-Thanks for bringing them home early.
-Yeah.

604
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,355
Pancakes?

605
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,508
Late for work.

606
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,953
-Yes, hello?
a
-Curtis, where are you?

607
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,613
-Just getting back from vacation, sir.
-Good. That is good.

608
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,303
[ will send the jet to pick up Alec and Oleg.

609
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,369
Yuri bear, tell him to
a
bring the raincoat for Caesar.

610
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,946
-It's in the Range Rover.
-Curtis.

611
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,298
-Yeah?
-Get my boys as fast as you can.

612
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,494
I'm hurtling towards you as we speak, sir.

613
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:42,953
Good. That is good.

614
00:41:58,616 --> 00:41:59,756
Curtis, you're late.

615
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,728
Good morning to you too.

616
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,904
Oh, be careful with our stuff.
a
Don't get your dirt on it.

617
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,967
Idiot.

618
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,459
Took you a while, Mr. Curtis.

619
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,107
What's your problem?

620
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,616
Be more careful.

621
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,288
He did that on purpose.

622
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,669
Hey, have a safe trip, you little bastards.

623
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,106
Now you're laughing, Curtis...

624
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,214
...but we have tickets to go on a big ship.

625
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:36,993
We will live...

626
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,228
..and you will die.

627
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,741
Folks, did you hear that?

628
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:57,011
The authorities in L.A. say
there's nothing to worry about.

629
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,882
I'd love to see their dumb faces...

630
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:02,518
..when Malibu and Beverly Hills...

631
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:06,144
..get sucked into
the gurgling maw of the Pacific.

632
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,444
Where they gonna plug in their electric cars then?

633
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,457
-Hey. Is this your plane?
-Yes.

634
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,153
-Are you a pilot?
-Yeah.

635
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,138
[wanna rent it. I'll give you anything.

636
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,053
Here. This is a very expensive watch.

637
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:24,276
My editor gave it to me
when he thought I was gonna be somebody.

638
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:30,261
I confirmed with my people at Caltech
that in the last 36 hours...

639
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,899
...we had basically zero earthquake activity
in Southern California...

640
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,042
...which is very rare.
Unlike many of the tough characters...

641
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,603
-...'ve portrayed in my film career...
-Hello?

642
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,029
-Stop what you're doing.
-Jackson?

643
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,701
Listen to me. I've rented a plane.
Pack up the kids.

644
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:48,534
-I'm gonna be there in five minutes.
-Plane? What?

645
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,100
We're gonna do our regular Saturday.
Noah has music and Lil has karate.

646
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,160
Not that we'd expect him to remember.

647
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,315
Kate, California is going down.
Pack up the kids now!

648
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,332
They just got back.

649
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,927
God, you sound like a crazy person.
The governor just said we're fine now.

650
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,034
The guy's an actor. He's reading a script.

651
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,067
When they tell you not to panic...

652
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,908
..that's when you run!

653
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,803
Okay, could you call me back when you calm down?

654
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,771
Mommy, why is Daddy so crazy?

655
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:18,424
--taking the most severe hit In Los Angeles.

656
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,973
Finish your pancakes, Al Capone.

657
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:24,828
It seems to me that the worst is over.

658
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:28,504
Mommy!

659
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,539
Everyone hold on to each other.

660
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,558
-No, Lilly!
-Hold Mommy's hand and stay close.

661
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:47,184
Daddy!

662
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,628
Let's go! Let's gol

663
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,566
I think it's safer under here!

664
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,485
Get in the fucking car right now!

665
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,416
Move your ass! Move!

666
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:57,874
-Come on, kids.
a
-Get up!

667
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,718
-Move. Quick, quick!
-Move!

668
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,495
Go! Now!

669
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,821
-Come on, let's go.
-Run! Don't look back!

670
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,174
-Come on!
-Take her! Get in, honey, get in.

671
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:11,197
My hats.

672
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,440
Lilly, get in!

673
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:16,646
Get in!

674
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,911
-Buckle up!
-Lilly.

675
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:28,457
Sorry.

676
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:43,756
Jackson, hurry up. Look behind you.

677
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,153
-Holy--!
-Oh, God.
a

678
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:53,673
Get out of here! Get out of the way!

679
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,335
-Move it!
-Hold on to those eggs, dear.

680
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,584
-Come on!
-Come on, you old bags!

681
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,445
Sidewalk, sidewalk! Tree! Tree!
a

682
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,592
God. Careful.

683
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,538
Everybody, hang on.

684
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,263
Oh, my God.

685
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,867
Careful, careful.
a

686
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:23,685
Yikes. That stinks.

687
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,534
We gotta get to the airport.

688
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,946
Well, take the freeway, it'll be half the time.

689
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:38,735
Yeah, right.

690
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,526
Jesus.

691
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,385
We gotta get to the other side of the freeway.

692
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,112
Daddy!

693
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,766
-Dad, look!
a
-No. We're not gonna make it! Careful!

694
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:18,164
-No, Daddy!
-Dad, look. Dad, look.
ee

695
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,154
No, no, no!
ce

696
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,455
It's been upgraded to
a 10.9 by the guys at Harvard.

697
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,244
What does Caltech have to say?

698
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:42,252
The whole city of Pasadena
was wiped out just a few minutes ago.

699
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,510
This is coming in from
Coachella Valley out near Joshua Tree.

700
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,903
That canyon? That wasn't there this morning.

701
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:51,846
And 400 miles further north,
a
Point Reyes, same thing.

702
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,641
The San Andreas Fault is shifting.

703
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,442
Yes. And all major sister faults in the Bay Area.

704
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,350
The whole Pacific plate is destabilizing.

705
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,596
Hold my hand. Stay close to me.

706
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,286
Come on!

707
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,267
-Who's that?
-Our pilot!

708
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,973
Oh, jeez. It's our pilot.

709
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:20,136
Gordon. Gordon, you can fly.

710
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,584
No, no, I've only had a couple of lessons in a
single-engine plane only.

711
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,601
-You're the guy.
-l am not the guy.

712
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:29,373
-Trust me, you're the guy.
-I'm not being modest about this.

713
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,029
Come on, kids. Gordon's gonna get us out of here.

714
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,380
That plane has multiple engines.

715
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,430
Jackson!

716
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,280
-T's and P's, T's and P's.
a
-T and P?

717
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,127
-Temperatures and pressures.
-Gol

718
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,754
-I've gotta do my preflight check.
-Let him concentrate.

719
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,410
He has no experience.

720
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,001
Thank you.

721
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:04,997
-Gordon, go.
-Come on.

722
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:07,126
-Gordon!
-Go, go, go!

723
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,960
-We're not there yet.
-Gordon, take off.
a

724
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,284
-Punch it, punch it!
-[ have to get to 85 knots.

725
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:18,033
-Eighty's good.
-Oh, screw it. Here we go.

726
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,990
Okay. Okay, we're up.

727
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:35,898
Higher, higher!

728
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:14,527
Oh, my God.

729
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,709
Lilly, go sit with your brother.

730
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,272
I don't understand.
How did you know this was gonna happen?

731
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:54,066
tis not just California.

732
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,858
It's the whole goddamn world that's going to shit.

733
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,228
I met this guy in Yellowstone, this crazy guy.

734
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,000
He's been right about everything
that's happened so far.

735
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,515
And he said the government is building spaceships.

736
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,865
-[ don't know what, but something.
-Ships?

737
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:08,911
Yeah, places where we can be safe.

738
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,819
He knows where they are. He's got a map.

739
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:13,475
Jackson.

740
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,647
Kate, you gotta just trust me on this, okay?

741
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,326
Guys, look.

742
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,107
There's a twist and a turn to
each lesson you learn

743
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:47,602
First you're up,
then you're bust Livin’ life on a crust

744
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,955
But it ain't the end of the world, buddy

745
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:54,002
It's only the end of this song

746
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:57,505
It's been a gas, been a flip Been a hell of a trip

747
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:02,424
But it ain't the end of the world

748
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,514
Oh, yeah.

749
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:06,789
Thank you.

750
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,601
You got fans, Tony.

751
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,835
There's a call for you.
You want me to take a message?

752
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,047
No, that’s all right, Kevin. I got it.

753
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,451
-Hello.
-Dad?

754
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,046
Adrian.

755
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:27,508
Remember when I told you about that dam in China?

756
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,255
Yeah.

757
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,163
It's happening, Dad.

758
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:43,917
They'd probably shoot me
if they knew that I told you.

759
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,339
Nobody's gonna shoot you, son. They need you.

760
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:52,062
The president has ordered us
to clear out the White House.

761
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,923
About time somebody cleaned up that mess.

762
00:52:58,442 --> 00:52:59,642
Where are you, Dad?

763
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,127
What exactly is the course
of the Genesis right now?

764
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,794
It's all good, Adrian.

765
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,893
Don't you be worrying about your old man now.

766
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:12,063
You got more important things to do now.

767
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,225
You know...

768
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,027
..your mom and I, we...

769
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:22,287
We had one hell of a great life, son.

770
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:27,457
And the best part about that...

771
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,432
..s we had one hell of a great kid too.

772
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,268
Now, you lookie here.

773
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:38,351
The Genesis...

774
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,821
..it's a pretty big ship, son.

775
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:45,282
So don't you write your old man off just yet.

776
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:46,839
Besides...

777
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:51,339
...you know I couldn't leave Tony alone.

778
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:55,815
You know that old fool can't keep
decent time by himself.

779
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:00,188
I love you, Dad.

780
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,643
I love you too, son.

781
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:09,952
God knows I do.

782
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,283
Kevin, I want a double.
a

783
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,597
-Harry.
-[ need a double right now.

784
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,473
Thank you, son.

785
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:42,686
After 25 years on the wagon,
are you out of your mind?

786
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,526
-What are you doing?
-Gotta go.

787
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:03,508
-That's against regulation.
-Careful, careful.
a

788
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,528
-Anything?
-Yeah, there's fuel.
a

789
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,397
Fill it up. I'm gonna find Charlie.

790
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,239
Daddy, wait. l wanna come with you.

791
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,194
-No, no. Lil. Lil, no!
a
-It's all right. Just fill it up.

792
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,477
-We'll be back.
-Jackson, hurry, please.

793
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:21,859
I'm standing here at the highest point...

794
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:26,729
...of what is the rim of
the world's largest super-volcano...

795
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:32,714
-...Mount Bighorn, elevation 2779 feet.
-Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

796
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:38,271
I can only hope that all of
you have made your peace with God...

797
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,022
-He's gotta be around somewhere.
-Let's go back.

798
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,815
No, no, no.
ce
We gotta find Charlie because he's got a map.

799
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,330
It's like a secret map, like in the Pirate movies.

800
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,360
-We gotta work as a team, okay?
-Okay.

801
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:50,209
Okay, come on.

802
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:53,074
Call Mommy and tell her
we're gonna be 5 minutes late.

803
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,018
-Hello?
-[ need to talk to Mommy.

804
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,327
-It's Lilly.
-Sweetheart, where are you?

805
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:04,983
-Hi, Mommy.
-Let me speak to Daddy, sweetie.

806
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,125
He can't talk right now.
He's driving really, really bad.

807
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,814
Any minute now, the fireworks are gonna start.

808
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:14,887
Who is that? Who's speaking in the car?

809
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,935
He's not in the car.
He's on a mountain waiting for fireworks.

810
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,227
-Fireworks? What fireworks?
-Daddy. Daddy, over there.

811
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:24,002
--to send All of Yellowstone into outer space?

812
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:25,624
Good job, Lilly. Good job.

813
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:29,275
Let me talk to Mom.

814
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:32,462
-Kate, we got him.
-Jackson, bring back my child now.

815
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:38,936
Okay. You stay here and guard the ship...

816
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,836
-...and I'm gonna go talk to the pirate.
-Okay.

817
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:44,676
--your race, your country, your God.

818
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:49,302
Whether you're a Christian or a Buddhist
or Muslim or Rastafarian...

819
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,913
-...by tomorrow we will all be one!
-Charlie.

820
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,120
-Jackson. What are you doing here?
-Yeah.

821
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,005
-[ thought you were toast.
-No. Where are the spaceships?

822
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,388
There's no way you can make it there.

823
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:04,361
We have a plane. You could come with us,
but we gotta leave right now.

824
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:15,009
Fly, birdies.

825
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,112
Fly!

826
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:18,874
Is this your kid?

827
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:21,087
Where's the goddamn map?

828
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,108
-We're going live.
-Where is it?

829
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,910
Charlie. Focus. Where's the map? Where?

830
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,373
It's in the camper.

831
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:28,580
Where in the camper?

832
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,812
In the map section on the conspiracy shelf.

833
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,056
Dewey decimal system.

834
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,594
Between Roswell...

835
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,807
...and Marilyn Monroe.

836
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,315
It's starting.

837
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,745
You sure you don't wanna come with, man?

838
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:04,234
It's so beautiful. I'm gonna stay.

839
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:06,955
Good luck.

840
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:15,220
This marks the last day of
the United States of America.

841
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,160
And, by tomorrow, all of mankind.

842
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:22,934
And we will be visible from the Milky Way...

843
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:25,773
...a8 a tiny little puff of smoke.

844
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:30,720
I'm watching the earth crumble before my eyes.

845
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:37,135
The giant ash cloud created
by this super-volcano...

846
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,825
..Will first envelop Vegas...

847
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:41,907
..and then St. Louis...

848
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,516
..and then Chicago...

849
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:46,705
..and then, at long last...

850
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:51,057
...Washington, D.C. will have its lights go out!

851
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:54,405
-That guy's crazy, right, Daddy?
-I don't think so.

852
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:58,927
This is ridiculous.

853
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,522
Been over half an hour.
I tell you, the guy's a nut job.

854
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,409
Stop it, Gordon.

855
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,446
Noah, hand me the phone again.

856
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:29,581
Daddy, what was that?

857
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,007
Nothing. Nothing.

858
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,290
I have goose bumps, people.

859
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:01,352
I wish you could see what I'm seeing, people.

860
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,088
I wish you could be here with me!

861
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:07,215
Oh, baby.

862
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,268
Bring it on!

863
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,136
Always remember, folks...

864
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,990
...you heard it first from Charlie!

865
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:33,529
Daddy, it's following us.

866
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:35,187
Don't look! Get on the ground.

867
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,435
Get on the ground and hold on. Don't look back.

868
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:40,531
Don't look back. Just look at me.
Look at me. Do I look scared?

869
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,983
Now, hold on, baby. Hold on tight.

870
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:56,879
Daddy, we're on fire.

871
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,342
There it is! There they are.

872
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,113
It's them.

873
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:16,221
It's them. It's them.

874
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:18,841
Mommy!

875
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,909
Jeez.

876
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,807
-No, Daddy.
-Hang on, baby. Hang on!

877
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,149
No, Daddy!

878
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:47,609
Oh, my Go-

879
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,328
-Mommy.
-Take her, take her. I'll be right back.

880
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,944
-Come here, Lil. Grab my hand.
-Come on, Lil. Lilly, you okay?

881
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:02,537
Aliens, Roswell and Marilyn Monroe

882
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,328
Maps! Maps!

883
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,511
-Everybody on? Are we ready?
-Jackson!

884
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,607
-Kate, where is he? What's he doing?
-I don't know.

885
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:18,507
Nol

886
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,657
-Daddy!
-No!

887
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:34,932
-Oh, my God.
-Kate, we have to go.

888
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:36,858
No. We're not going anywhere.

889
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,624
-Kids, buckle up, we're leaving.
-This is my dad. We're gonna wait.

890
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:47,519
Nol

891
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,301
Daddy!

892
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:55,556
Wait! Wait, Gordon, I see something.

893
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,476
Dad!

894
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,265
It's Daddy!

895
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,024
Slow down!

896
01:03:09,386 --> 01:03:10,236
Jackson, run!
a

897
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:13,558
Jackson, take my hand. Jackson.

898
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,957
-Dad, hurry!
-Run!

899
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,817
We're running out of runway.
For God's sakes, Kate, pull him up.

900
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:23,467
-Jackson, reach for my hand.
-Dad, you can make it, come on.

901
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,529
Daddy!

902
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,636
All right, buckle in. Here we go!

903
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,406
Come on, faster. Faster.
a

904
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:55,907
Hang on.

905
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:00,048
-Go faster.
-I'm trying.

906
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,850
Okay. We're good!

907
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,749
-We're good.
-We're okay.

908
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,214
So now that you got your map, where are we going?

909
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,756
We're gonna need a bigger plane.

910
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:51,638
No, you just said that, Mom.
Yeah, you just said that.

911
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:53,885
You don't remember that you just said that?

912
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:57,104
That's okay. That's okay.

913
01:04:57,694 --> 01:05:01,294
Listen, Ma, l am going to call
you next week, same time.

914
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:03,382
Okay?

915
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,693
You take care now. Take care of yourself.

916
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:10,846
Sir?

917
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,718
I think you need to see this.

918
01:05:19,182 --> 01:05:21,372
I thought for sure they'd give you
an extra ticket, sir.
a

919
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:23,025
They did.

920
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:25,696
But my mother is almost 89...

921
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,802
...she's in a wheelchair,
a
and she's easily confused.

922
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,759
And I am confident that
she would want to meet her maker...

923
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:33,815
...on her own terms, okay?

924
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,780
Yes, sir. Who are you bringing?

925
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:39,269
Nobody. Who, my ex-wife?
Last thing she said to me...

926
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:41,892
.. She never wanted to see me again. So be it.

927
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,102
We need to bring people who can contribute.

928
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,411
The South American continent has been ravaged...

929
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,336
...by a series of major earthquakes.

930
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:51,404
The death toll is expected
to be well over 2 million people.

931
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,821
The devastation in Rio de Janeiro
is beyond imagination.

932
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:58,028
Two 8.5 tremors have left
the people in the streets...

933
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:00,868
... desperately fighting for
the last remaining resources.

934
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:05,111
In the last hour, we received this video from
a
Globo News, Brazil.
a

935
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:14,865
Fear and chaos have spread throughout
the globe, as in London...

936
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:17,898
..where the 30th Olympic Games
have just been suspended.

937
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,961
Hundreds of thousands
are marching towards 10 Downing Street...

938
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:23,941
...demanding a lift of the information blackout.

939
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,731
We've had thousands of calls.
We had to shut it down.

940
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,470
We're receiving reports from all across the globe.

941
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,946
Millions upon millions of distraught masses...

942
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:35,202
..are gathering in public places, converging in
desperate prayer.

943
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:37,572
Preachers of many religious denominations...

944
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,697
...have taken their message of the end...

945
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,529
..to the streets all over the U.S.

946
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:43,951
Repent. There is still time.

947
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:47,804
Kind of galling when you realize that nutbags with
their signs had it right.

948
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,311
All these people out there, sir...

949
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,353
.. Shouldn't we be issuing warnings now?

950
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:55,235
Only when the boarding process is complete.
That's the plan.

951
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,388
-British Columbia, 2010, remember?
ee
-Sir.

952
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:00,848
Sir, those plans were drawn up two years ago.

953
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,337
Okay. Everybody out. Go on, get out.

954
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:05,824
Mary, get the door.

955
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,696
Wasn't it decided that people have the right...

956
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:10,998
...to fight for their lives best way they can?

957
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:13,481
After we get everyone onboard, Adrian.

958
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:14,833
I think that's wrong.

959
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:18,414
Wha--? Just wanna tell everyone they're doomed?

960
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,028
There'd be anarchy.

961
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,279
-You wanna jeopardize the president?
-Come on.

962
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:27,936
Our mission is to assure
the continuity of our species.

963
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:32,241
My question: Can I count on you?

964
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:34,019
Can I?

965
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:35,904
What?

966
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,652
The Yellowstone caldera has erupted.

967
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,214
The ash cloud will reach
Washington in roughly seven hours.

968
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,679
We've got to get the government airborne.

969
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:46,835
Where's the president, Sally?

970
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,776
Said he wanted some time alone.
I think he's over at the chapel.

971
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,383
-He's gotta go to church now?
-He's praying, sir.

972
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:55,209
Which, under the circumstances,
re
is not such a bad idea.

973
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,615
Mr. President.

974
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,530
I need to get you on Air Force One immediately.

975
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:06,855
Give me a moment with Adrian.

976
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,056
No disrespect, but we simply do not have time.

977
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:10,718
Make time.

978
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:26,083
Did you ever meet my wife, Dorothy?

979
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:29,446
No, sir. I didn't have that honor.
a

980
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,319
She was in and out of it towards the end.

981
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:38,057
The night before she passed on,
she took my hand and she told me:

982
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:41,937
I think you should have a lottery.

983
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,578
Everyone should have a chance to go.

984
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,305
Maybe that's what we should have done.

985
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:59,100
I'll be the last president of
the United States of America.

986
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:01,616
Do you know how that feels, son?

987
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,562
No one could have saved the country, sir.

988
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:08,536
And I think...

989
01:09:09,412 --> 01:09:11,582
I think people have a right to know.

990
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:15,059
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

991
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:18,423
Go on now.

992
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:22,002
Not without you, sir.

993
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,102
You get on that plane, son.

994
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:29,542
It's a brave new world you're heading to.

995
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:34,673
And a young scientist
is gonna be worth 20 old politicians.

996
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,813
We should go to my parents’ house in the Rockies.

997
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:59,922
This isn't one of your crazy stories.
How are we gonna make it to China?

998
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,530
Gordon, without Jackson,
a
we wouldn't have made it out of California.

999
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,423
Noah, please.

1000
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,312
You, be careful with the landing gear.

1001
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:17,832
Easy, gringo. I know what I doing.

1002
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,484
Attention. The National Guard has informed us...

1003
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,653
..hat an extremely hazardous ash cloud...

1004
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:24,316
..s headed for Las Vegas.

1005
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:25,797
Hey, where are you going?

1006
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,325
Everyone move indoors immediately.

1007
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:30,724
-Sir, you can't stay here.
-[ have plane here.

1008
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:32,214
It's not safe. Move it!

1009
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,232
Move it!

1010
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,728
So you have positive confirmation on this?

1011
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,093
Thank you, I understand.

1012
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,609
President's not coming.

1013
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,156
So...

1014
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:12,451
..the captain doesn't want to
abandon his sinking ship.

1015
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,402
That's his choice.

1016
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,581
And a noble one.

1017
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:19,969
I have also just learned
that the vice-president's chopper...

1018
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,766
...went down in the ash cloud
outside of Pittsburgh.

1019
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:27,524
Fortunately, we have protocols to follow.

1020
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:29,814
What about the Speaker of the House?

1021
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:33,119
- have no idea. Where is he?
-He's the commander in chief now, sir.
a

1022
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:36,623
This is one flight
he shouldn't have been late for.

1023
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,885
-Tell the captain we're taking off.
-You don't have the authority.

1024
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,273
Who's got authority? You've got the authority?

1025
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:44,342
You couldn't even keep your mouth shut.

1026
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,817
You betrayed top-secret information last year.

1027
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,443
-What are you talking about?
-You told your father...

1028
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:51,079
...put this plan in jeopardy.

1029
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,929
Good thing for you
the old man could keep his mouth shut.

1030
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,206
Oh, come on. Don't look so shocked.
a

1031
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,335
We had to monitor everybody.
How do you think we kept it a secret?

1032
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:01,936
We just killed anybody who tried to talk?

1033
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,558
Anybody who tried to talk...

1034
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,320
...was not just an enemy of the state,
they're an enemy of humanity.

1035
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:08,816
The director of the Louvre, an enemy of humanity?

1036
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,022
After he called a press conference he was!

1037
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,061
Jesus. What did you think?

1038
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:18,067
We're all just gonna get onboard,
hold hands and sing "Kumbaya"?

1039
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,838
Sit down and buckle up.

1040
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,999
Oh, excuse me. Is my father in the command center?

1041
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,659
President's on the line, Dr. Wilson.
a

1042
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,486
Thank you.

1043
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:46,318
Where are you?

1044
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:50,122
You never would have gotten on
that plane if ! told you.

1045
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:54,112
But you said that you'd be--

1046
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,963
Darling, listen to me.

1047
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,682
Do you understand how much strength it gives me...

1048
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,077
...knowing that you'll survive?

1049
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,965
The only thing left to do now...

1050
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,398
..4s tell the truth to people.

1051
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:11,575
At least if they know...

1052
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:17,210
..families can say goodbye to each other.

1053
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:21,257
A mother can comfort her children.

1054
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,239
And a father...

1055
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,190
...can ask his daughter for forgiveness.

1056
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:41,852
Whenever you're ready, Mr. President.

1057
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,326
My fellow Americans...

1058
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:56,262
...this will be the last time I address you.

1059
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,543
As you know...

1060
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:02,308
...catastrophe has struck our nation...

1061
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,746
...has struck the world.

1062
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,788
I wish I could tell you...

1063
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:11,297
...we could prevent the coming destruction.

1064
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:13,548
We cannot.

1065
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,607
Today, none of us are strangers.

1066
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:19,376
Today...

1067
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:24,262
...we are one family
stepping into the darkness together.

1068
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:27,874
We are a nation of many religions...

1069
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:33,854
...but I believe these words
reflect the spirit of all of our faiths:

1070
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,191
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall--

1071
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,808
People! Keep away from the doors and windows.

1072
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,282
What are we gonna do? Where are we gonna go?

1073
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:46,768
Dr. Silberman.

1074
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,879
-Tamara.
-What are you doing here?

1075
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,629
-Excuse me.
-She's a patient, honey.

1076
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,585
Excuse me, I have a private plane out there.

1077
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,235
-Karpov!
-We need help.

1078
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:58,793
-Yuri!
-Takeoffs are canceled.

1079
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,441
-Curtis, you're--
-You knew. This whole time you knew.

1080
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:04,454
So you've got a way out of here, right?
You got a plane?

1081
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,841
My family, take us with. Please. Please.

1082
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:08,853
Boss. Boss.

1083
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,941
I found us a plane, an Antonov.

1084
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,744
They were about to take off,
but the tower didn't let them.

1085
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,206
But can you still fly that thing?

1086
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,109
Sure, boss. But need copilot.

1087
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:22,363
Gordon's a pilot.

1088
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:24,951
No, I'm not. I'm not.
a

1089
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,084
Yes, he is. Great pilot. Let's go.

1090
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:29,781
Good. Let's go!

1091
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:32,496
Honey, this is-- Jackson, stop saying I'm a pilot.

1092
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,049
Hey! Hey, stop!

1093
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,644
You can't go out there. Come back!

1094
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,575
Move back, people.

1095
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:46,267
Get away from the glass!

1096
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:52,876
Wow, that's a big plane.

1097
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:55,896
It's Russian.

1098
01:15:56,819 --> 01:15:58,399
-Let's move, everybody. Come on.
-Run!

1099
01:15:58,821 --> 01:16:00,841
-Yeah, let's go, let's go.
-Boys, come on.

1100
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,966
-Gordon, where are you?
-Where did you go?

1101
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,975
I'm up here in the cockpit. Hurry up.

1102
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:11,879
Oh, my God. Not again.

1103
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:21,406
Whoa, look at these.
a

1104
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:23,507
Las Vegas Auto Show.

1105
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,163
We had VIP tickets for that.

1106
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,176
That's fantastic. Let's go.

1107
01:16:28,551 --> 01:16:31,071
Check the main bus for hydraulics, I'll balance
the tanks.

1108
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,760
What?

1109
01:16:34,557 --> 01:16:36,867
Okay, okay, okay. I'm trying, okay? I'm trying.

1110
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,184
Tower to Antonov. What are you doing?

1111
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,116
Shut down immediately.

1112
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:50,845
Caesar.

1113
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:54,017
Okay, when I say go,
you push all this down at once, okay?

1114
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,540
-Okay.
-Gol

1115
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:58,855
Antonov, abort takeoff. You do not have clearance.
a

1116
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:01,841
You must abort. I repeat, you must abort.

1117
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,254
Nol

1118
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:11,975
-What the hell was that?
-I don't know, but it's not good.

1119
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,406
-Push.
-Pushing.

1120
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,075
Come on!

1121
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:23,834
We're going down! We're going down!

1122
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:32,759
Where are the flaps? The flaps are not down.

1123
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:34,919
It must be the pumps. Take over.

1124
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:37,601
Take over? What do you mean, take over?

1125
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:41,229
-Sashal!
-Relax!

1126
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,460
Sit down!

1127
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:49,136
God. God. Jesus.

1128
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,704
-Oh, God.
a
-Okay, I think got it.

1129
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:56,473
-Sasha, now!
a
-Okay, okay. Take a deep breath.

1130
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:59,063
Pull

1131
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,532
Come on, baby. Lift your big ass for Sasha!

1132
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,214
-Pull! Pull!
-Come on.

1133
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:23,630
Mommy.

1134
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:27,548
Was that the Eiffel Tower?

1135
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:29,734
I think so.

1136
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,006
Ladies and gentlemen...

1137
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:42,035
...we are on our way to China.

1138
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,919
Good. That is good, huh?

1139
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,819
Do not believe in something simply
because you have heard it, Nima.

1140
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:05,134
But, great Lama, Tenzin is my brother.

1141
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:09,112
He works inside the big tunnel,
where the ships are built.

1142
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:16,483
But what is there in your wisdom,
great Lama, if Tenzin is right?

1143
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,800
What if our world is indeed coming to an end?

1144
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:34,605
It is full, great Rinpoche.

1145
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:40,208
Like this cup...

1146
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:44,462
...you are full of opinions and speculations.

1147
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:48,479
To see the light of wisdom...

1148
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,544
... YOu first must empty your cup.

1149
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:10,861
Be careful with the clutch.

1150
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,637
It tends to slip.

1151
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,837
-Grandma.
-Grandpa, Nima is here!

1152
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,351
Grandma, I got a message from Tenzin.

1153
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:40,396
He wants us to meet him
in Cho Ming at the west gate.

1154
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:44,053
He says he can get us
on the ships he's working on.

1155
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:48,251
What are you talking about?
Tenzin works on the dam.

1156
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,034
Granda...

1157
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:57,056
..the dam is a ship! The government lied to us.

1158
01:20:57,886 --> 01:20:59,696
There will be a big flood!

1159
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:01,916
We must pack up right away.

1160
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:04,670
Nima, he gave you the truck?

1161
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,598
We took a trip on the Laem Song ferry once.

1162
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:11,858
Grandpa threw up the whole way.

1163
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:14,708
Let's eat first.

1164
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,213
Hey, look. The new Bentley.

1165
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:24,308
Our father had one on order.

1166
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:26,557
We were supposed to get it next year.

1167
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:29,185
But then he canceled it because of the ships.

1168
01:21:30,519 --> 01:21:32,889
How many cars does your family have?

1169
01:21:33,856 --> 01:21:35,196
My mom's boyfriend has a Porsche.

1170
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:38,512
Our parents are divorced too.

1171
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:41,007
Yeah, but there's nothing we can do about that.

1172
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:43,017
Found a hat.

1173
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:44,512
She has a thing for hats.

1174
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:47,521
[ was just like that at her age.

1175
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:49,433
They made me feel safe.

1176
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,456
So how did you meet Dr. Silberman?

1177
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:57,576
As you can see, not the same way you did.

1178
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:02,674
My boyfriend asked me to get them done.

1179
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:04,402
He's not your husband?

1180
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,652
Oh, no. We are not married.
a
And probably never will.

1181
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,485
For the boys.

1182
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:25,182
They seem to like each other, huh?

1183
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:27,281
She is adorable.

1184
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,459
Yeah, I guess.

1185
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,706
So tell me, Mr. Karpov, how much did you pay?

1186
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:38,286
One billion euro. Per seat.

1187
01:22:40,222 --> 01:22:42,592
-That's disgusting.
-Oh, yeah?

1188
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:47,106
You know, Curtis, l wasn't always businessman.

1189
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:49,663
lam a boxer.

1190
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:53,291
Was my only playing
when I was boy back in Murmansk.

1191
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:57,779
And my coach, his name was also Yuri.

1192
01:22:58,507 --> 01:22:59,847
He always said:

1193
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:06,222
If someone wants to beat you,
he has to kill you first.

1194
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,425
That's very nice.

1195
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,780
Yeah.

1196
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:18,175
But tell me, what would you have done
if you rich like me?

1197
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,364
Look. They are wonderful children, huh?

1198
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:25,428
Okay, guys.

1199
01:23:25,801 --> 01:23:28,321
The plan is to refuel in Hawaii,
so sit down and buckle up.

1200
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,301
Gordon and I will do the rest.

1201
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:35,146
Oh, God.
a

1202
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:38,753
Go get the guys.

1203
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,654
Guys, there's a-- You might wanna....

1204
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:05,581
What is that?

1205
01:24:06,308 --> 01:24:07,888
The state of Hawaii.

1206
01:24:08,677 --> 01:24:12,047
Not good. That is not good.

1207
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:19,143
How much fuel do we have left?

1208
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:22,395
Not enough.
We're going to have to make a water landing...

1209
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:24,721
... somewhere in South China Sea.

1210
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,380
Great. At least we're not gonna
need the landing gear.

1211
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,616
-What about it?
-Oh, we lost it all. In Vegas.

1212
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,931
Dr. Wilson, may I come in?

1213
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:48,030
I'm not very good company, I'm afraid, Dr...?

1214
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,906
Please, call me Adrian.
a

1215
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,065
All those people we left behind...

1216
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:02,138
..they don't stand a chance, do they?

1217
01:25:03,966 --> 01:25:07,216
believe that nature
will choose for itself from itself...

1218
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:08,858
...what will survive.

1219
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:14,099
Just like you preserving those great artworks.

1220
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:18,009
Our culture is our soul,
a
and that's not dying tonight.

1221
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,044
Oh, come on.
a

1222
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,802
! contributed to this cover-up.

1223
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,974
And Da Vinci, Picasso, they're in.

1224
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:28,515
But you're some nobody, you don't stand a chance.

1225
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:30,041
That's not-

1226
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:33,009
That's not necessarily true.

1227
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:37,675
You ever hear of a writer called Jackson Curtis?

1228
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,299
Wrote a book, Farewell Atlantis.
a

1229
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,446
What do you think the chances
are of an unknown writer...

1230
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,312
..who barely sold 500 copies,
making it aboard this plane?

1231
01:25:48,944 --> 01:25:49,704
I don't understand.

1232
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:53,642
I mean, call it chance or fate or nature.
a
It doesn't matter.

1233
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:57,449
This book is part of our legacy now. Why?

1234
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,990
Because I'm reading it.

1235
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:06,995
Dr. Helmsley, please report
to the Situation Room immediately.

1236
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,956
Hello. I'm sorry. Who is this?

1237
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:27,856
This is Yoko Delgatto.
Do you wanna speak to my daddy?

1238
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,143
Yes, please.

1239
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,482
Who should I say is calling?

1240
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:41,527
Tell him it's his father.

1241
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:43,704
You're my grandpa?

1242
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,053
Yes, sweetheart, am.
a

1243
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:51,787
Daddy, Daddy, Grandpa's on the phone.

1244
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,269
Mr. President, sir.
a

1245
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:02,709
Mr. President.

1246
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:06,846
-What's the matter, sweetie?
a
-She can't find her daddy.

1247
01:28:09,918 --> 01:28:11,617
Why don't you two get comfy on that couch?

1248
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:14,452
Sally, come help them out, okay?

1249
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,853
I'll find your daddy.

1250
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:27,331
Who can help me with missing persons?

1251
01:28:27,736 --> 01:28:29,925
Sorry, man. I'm really busy right now.

1252
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:34,023
I mean-- Of course, sir.
a
Sorry, Mr. President.

1253
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:36,976
Don't worry about it.
You're doing a great job, son.

1254
01:29:03,605 --> 01:29:05,625
-What?
-The capital's been hit by a 9.4.

1255
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:07,247
We've lost communication.

1256
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:10,239
-Where's it centered?
-North Chesapeake Bay.

1257
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,539
Mr. Anheuser,
a
the Russian president's on the line, sir.

1258
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,056
Excuse me.

1259
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:22,295
We just entered Chinese airspace.

1260
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:25,532
That's affirmative, Mr. President.
a

1261
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:30,061
Until communication is restored,
a
I suppose I am in command.

1262
01:29:31,633 --> 01:29:33,853
It appears that
all other heads of state are en route...

1263
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,648
...with the exception of
the Italian prime minister...

1264
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:41,445
...who has also decided to
stay behind and trust in prayer.

1265
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:51,264
The Earth's crust has begun to shift, Dr. Helmsley.

1266
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:54,526
-By what degree?
-1.2 degrees, but it's still moving.

1267
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,226
So, what happens next?

1268
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:58,754
Once the movement of
our land masses comes to a halt-

1269
01:30:59,254 --> 01:31:00,804
Let's see a simulation, Scotty.

1270
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:03,152
--expect the formation of gigantic tsunamis...

1271
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,495
...proportional to the magnitude of the
corresponding quakes.

1272
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:13,713
Pull up the Japanese seaboard, will you?

1273
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,535
Yes, sir.
a

1274
01:31:16,338 --> 01:31:18,768
My dad's on a cruise ship out here.

1275
01:31:20,108 --> 01:31:22,418
But I guess you already knew that, huh?

1276
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:26,768
Sir, we recorded
a
two underwater quakes at 7.9 and 8.2.

1277
01:31:44,766 --> 01:31:46,076
From what we have just learned...

1278
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:49,098
... Tokyo seems to have taken
the full force of the earthquake.

1279
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,631
At this point, unconfirmed reports indicate...

1280
01:31:52,107 --> 01:31:54,627
..that large areas of land are underwater.

1281
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:57,046
Please stay tuned for further--

1282
01:32:07,055 --> 01:32:08,485
Tony--

1283
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:10,630
I called.

1284
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:15,982
I was too late.

1285
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:23,538
Maybe they got out in time.

1286
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:25,869
You never know. They--

1287
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:55,572
Harry!

1288
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:55,704
I'm coming home, Dorothy.

1289
01:34:22,457 --> 01:34:23,717
Anything?

1290
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:28,396
Nothing. Just static.
Not even an emergency signal.

1291
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,020
Can't think about what's going on down there.

1292
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:53,449
Remember that old Beetle we used to camp in?

1293
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:55,528
We could never get the roof up.

1294
01:34:55,957 --> 01:34:57,297
Yeah.

1295
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:59,362
We definitely traded up.

1296
01:35:02,564 --> 01:35:04,294
Tried to find our old spot at Yellowstone...

1297
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:06,699
..when [ went camping with the kids...

1298
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:09,629
...but couldn't find it.

1299
01:35:18,313 --> 01:35:19,893
Do you think people change?

1300
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:22,572
By "people," do you mean me?

1301
01:35:22,984 --> 01:35:25,794
Yes. Do you think you've changed
since we separated?

1302
01:35:28,356 --> 01:35:30,056
I certainly eat a lot more cereal now.

1303
01:35:34,762 --> 01:35:36,722
You always had tunnel vision.

1304
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:40,515
You could just block everything out and write.

1305
01:35:44,539 --> 01:35:46,089
You blocked us out.

1306
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:57,013
Do you love him?

1307
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:01,630
I love him enough.

1308
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:17,179
All global ground communication has ceased, sir.

1309
01:36:21,309 --> 01:36:23,329
The only signals our satellites are picking up...

1310
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:25,891
..are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming.

1311
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:28,664
Well, there's a piece of good news.

1312
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:30,197
Any updates, doctor?

1313
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:33,301
We expect the tsunamis
to reach landfall in every continent.

1314
01:36:33,888 --> 01:36:36,928
The Cho Ming area will be impacted in
approximately six hours.

1315
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:41,757
It looks like the crust has shifted
by almost 23 degrees...

1316
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:43,880
..to the southwest.

1317
01:36:44,332 --> 01:36:48,612
The data also shows the Earth's poles have
reversed their magnetic fields.

1318
01:36:49,404 --> 01:36:50,604
These are their new positions.

1319
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,029
So you're...

1320
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:56,117
You're telling me that the North Pole...

1321
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:58,938
..dS now somewhere in Wisconsin?

1322
01:36:59,414 --> 01:37:01,434
Actually, that's the South Pole now.

1323
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,481
Engine failure. Two of the six are down.

1324
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,600
We must get ready.

1325
01:37:15,963 --> 01:37:19,333
-How long do we have?
-Fifteen minutes. Maybe.

1326
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,916
-Better wake up the kids.
-Yeah.

1327
01:38:03,845 --> 01:38:05,685
Why do you hate Gordon?

1328
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,344
Hey.

1329
01:38:11,986 --> 01:38:13,326
Come on.

1330
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,699
What are you talking about?

1331
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:18,298
I don't hate him.

1332
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:19,999
Well, you don't like him, either.

1333
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:23,198
Well, that's just
because ! don't know him that well, maybe.

1334
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:24,840
Yeah, but I do.
a

1335
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,188
He's really nice once you get to know him.

1336
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:29,038
You should talk to him more often.

1337
01:38:29,437 --> 01:38:31,957
You guys would get along really, really well.

1338
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,293
You like him a lot, huh?
a

1339
01:38:46,187 --> 01:38:47,647
I'l do my best, I promise.

1340
01:38:48,356 --> 01:38:49,526
Okay?

1341
01:38:50,892 --> 01:38:54,262
I'm really proud of you.
Really, really proud of you.

1342
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:57,463
Is it time?

1343
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,710
Yeah.

1344
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,565
-Dad, what's wrong?
-Well, Sasha said we gotta land...

1345
01:39:07,108 --> 01:39:10,328
..and it's gonna be a little bumpy
and maybe a little wet.

1346
01:39:10,978 --> 01:39:11,878
Daddy?

1347
01:39:18,419 --> 01:39:19,439
Hold her steady.

1348
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:39,698
Daddy, I'm not a really good swimmer.

1349
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:43,744
Hey, no, that's all right.
That's what you got this for. Right?

1350
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:47,105
It's like being in a swimming pool,
only it's got more cool stuff.

1351
01:39:47,682 --> 01:39:50,522
Look, it's got a whistle,
and a light thing. Right?

1352
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:52,958
I thought we were going to China.

1353
01:39:54,255 --> 01:39:56,035
No, we gotta land here.

1354
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,287
So we're just all gonna stay together, right?

1355
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:04,312
-No, we're not, we're gonna die.
-No. We're not.

1356
01:40:05,433 --> 01:40:06,663
Promise?

1357
01:40:07,034 --> 01:40:08,844
I promise you we're gonna all stay together...

1358
01:40:09,303 --> 01:40:12,463
...No matter what happens, okay?

1359
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,349
Jackson.

1360
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:29,262
Yuri.

1361
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:32,145
I think you better come up here.

1362
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:34,357
I'm gonna go check this out.

1363
01:40:34,729 --> 01:40:36,459
-Dad. Where are you going?
I'll be back.

1364
01:40:36,898 --> 01:40:39,448
-You said you'd stay with us.
-We gotta buckle up. Let's go.

1365
01:40:41,135 --> 01:40:43,035
Okay, don't ask me how that happened...

1366
01:40:43,504 --> 01:40:44,764
...but there is no more ocean...

1367
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:46,889
...and we're close to where we wanted to go.

1368
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:49,241
It's like the world shifted by 1000 miles.

1369
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,960
One thousand five hundred
and seventy-eight to be exact.

1370
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,530
It's called Earth Crust Displacement Theory.

1371
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,859
Professor Hapgood, 1958.

1372
01:40:58,019 --> 01:40:58,889
Way to go, Charlie.

1373
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:04,297
What was that?

1374
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:07,393
We just lost our last two engines.

1375
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:29,167
I'm gonna shoot for that glacier.
It's gonna get rocky.

1376
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:33,470
Listen, this is gonna sound crazy,
but here's what you have to do.

1377
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:39,495
Unbuckle. Come on, come on, come on.
a

1378
01:41:41,362 --> 01:41:42,972
Yuril What are we doing?

1379
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:45,567
We are taking the Bentley.

1380
01:41:47,468 --> 01:41:49,688
Not yet. Not yet.

1381
01:41:50,204 --> 01:41:51,514
It has to be perfect.

1382
01:41:51,906 --> 01:41:53,246
Almost there.

1383
01:41:53,641 --> 01:41:55,861
-Come on.
-Get in the car.

1384
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:08,590
Okay, go. Now. Pull.

1385
01:42:13,894 --> 01:42:16,064
No, no, no!
ce

1386
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:20,599
Go. Go, Jackson.
a

1387
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,138
No, we gotta wait for Sasha and Gordon.

1388
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:26,798
Go. Make sure everybody gets out of the plane
before I touch down.

1389
01:42:27,441 --> 01:42:28,311
What about you?

1390
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:32,563
I'll be fine. l have to touch this baby down.

1391
01:42:33,848 --> 01:42:35,338
What are you waiting for?

1392
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:38,120
Gol Gol

1393
01:42:52,933 --> 01:42:54,103
There he is. I see him.

1394
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:56,688
-Where is Sasha? Where is Sasha?
-Come on. Let's go.

1395
01:42:57,204 --> 01:42:59,924
He said he's fine. We should get out of here
before he touches down.

1396
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,378
No, no, no. Don't go. We have to wait for him.

1397
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,880
Go, Jackson. Go.
a

1398
01:43:05,312 --> 01:43:08,501
-Don't go!
-It won't start. It won't start.

1399
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:12,190
Just shut up, everybody!

1400
01:43:13,621 --> 01:43:14,851
Engine...

1401
01:43:15,823 --> 01:43:16,693
...Start.

1402
01:43:20,294 --> 01:43:22,374
Voice control. Sold me on it.

1403
01:45:02,496 --> 01:45:04,806
Hey! Hey!

1404
01:45:24,185 --> 01:45:26,465
Welcome to the People's Republic of China.

1405
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:28,891
Good to be here. Say hi, kids.

1406
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:30,286
Hi.
Hi.

1407
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,023
What color are your passes?

1408
01:45:33,928 --> 01:45:36,117
What color are your boarding passes?

1409
01:45:37,932 --> 01:45:39,541
For my boys and me.

1410
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:41,257
What?

1411
01:45:44,538 --> 01:45:46,407
Yuri. Yuri.

1412
01:45:46,874 --> 01:45:49,834
Yuri, it's a mistake. A joke, right?

1413
01:45:50,444 --> 01:45:51,734
What?

1414
01:45:52,279 --> 01:45:55,209
You think I didn't know about you and Sasha?

1415
01:45:57,384 --> 01:46:00,044
May God bless that poor bastards soul.

1416
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:08,520
I'm sorry, guys. Good luck.

1417
01:46:10,331 --> 01:46:11,821
Come on, boys.

1418
01:46:12,466 --> 01:46:14,216
-Does anybody have any money?
-I do, I do.
a

1419
01:46:14,802 --> 01:46:16,031
You got a billion euros?

1420
01:46:21,242 --> 01:46:22,142
Dr. Wilson?

1421
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:25,460
I'm Captain Michaels,
skipper of the American ship.

1422
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,910
Please accept my condolences for your father.

1423
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:29,902
Thank you, captain.

1424
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:33,888
Mr. Anheuser, your party is the last to arrive.

1425
01:46:38,525 --> 01:46:40,545
There've been reports of severe damage, captain.

1426
01:46:41,028 --> 01:46:42,638
What's the status of Ark Number 3?

1427
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,083
We haven't done a complete assessment yet...

1428
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:47,556
...but it looks like we lost it.

1429
01:46:57,444 --> 01:46:59,724
No toothbrush. Only books.

1430
01:47:01,015 --> 01:47:03,975
Yeah, when I was a kid,
a
my dad was on the road a lot.

1431
01:47:04,752 --> 01:47:06,712
He would always leave me a box full of books...

1432
01:47:07,187 --> 01:47:08,857
...call me every night and quiz me.

1433
01:47:09,723 --> 01:47:12,303
I'd get an ice-cream cone for every book I read...

1434
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:13,849
...S0 [ was a fat kid.

1435
01:47:15,629 --> 01:47:17,059
I find that very hard to believe.

1436
01:47:17,464 --> 01:47:18,224
No, it's true.
a

1437
01:47:18,532 --> 01:47:21,902
My high school career was 2000 books...

1438
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:24,029
...and Zero girlfriends.

1439
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:28,259
didn't even kiss a boy till ! was in college.

1440
01:47:29,043 --> 01:47:31,152
They were all too scared of my dad.

1441
01:48:19,026 --> 01:48:20,606
Leave it to the Chinese.

1442
01:48:21,028 --> 01:48:22,608
I didn't think it was possible.

1443
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:24,460
Not in the time we had.

1444
01:48:25,299 --> 01:48:26,559
That's Ark Number 3, sir.
a

1445
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:30,538
The roof collapsed on it during
the shifting of the Earth's crust.

1446
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,162
Jesus Christ.

1447
01:48:34,608 --> 01:48:37,598
Boarding of Ark Number 3
will be delayed due to technical difficulties.

1448
01:48:38,212 --> 01:48:39,502
-Excuse me.
-We paid a fortune!

1449
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:42,490
Please be patient as we keep you updated.

1450
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,630
Hey, what's going on here?

1451
01:48:45,052 --> 01:48:47,272
I have a green card for my boys and me.

1452
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:49,571
I want to speak to a supervisor.

1453
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:50,984
lam the supervisor.

1454
01:48:51,325 --> 01:48:54,394
Get back with the other green cards
or I'll have you detained.

1455
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:58,700
What he said about you and Sasha, is it true?

1456
01:48:59,166 --> 01:49:02,416
Sasha was worth 100 times a man like Yuri.

1457
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:05,179
I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman.

1458
01:49:05,672 --> 01:49:10,012
actually liked the way I looked before that
monster talked me into it.

1459
01:49:10,811 --> 01:49:12,771
Did you know he asked me for a discount?

1460
01:49:13,247 --> 01:49:14,947
And he paid in installments.

1461
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:16,751
Cheap bastard.

1462
01:49:17,151 --> 01:49:18,491
You hear that?

1463
01:49:21,488 --> 01:49:23,098
Over there!

1464
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:26,202
-Hey!
-Hey!

1465
01:49:26,593 --> 01:49:28,523
-Stop! Stop! Please!
-Hey! Hold it!

1466
01:49:32,833 --> 01:49:34,322
Hey! Hey!

1467
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:37,469
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1468
01:49:39,106 --> 01:49:40,505
Help!

1469
01:49:50,084 --> 01:49:51,044
Hey!

1470
01:50:10,571 --> 01:50:11,911
How were all these people chosen?

1471
01:50:12,306 --> 01:50:14,616
Same way your art was:
By experts from all over the world.

1472
01:50:15,142 --> 01:50:17,751
We had geneticists determine
the perfect gene pool to repopulate.

1473
01:50:18,312 --> 01:50:19,892
These people were chosen by geneticists?

1474
01:50:20,314 --> 01:50:23,274
All green-card holders,
please proceed to Gallery D-4.

1475
01:50:23,884 --> 01:50:25,754
Looks like their checkbooks got them onboard.

1476
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:28,770
Right.
Without billions of dollars from the private sector...

1477
01:50:29,323 --> 01:50:30,753
..this would've been impossible.

1478
01:50:31,158 --> 01:50:32,968
We sold tickets.

1479
01:50:33,427 --> 01:50:36,447
And what about all these workers?
They all get passes?

1480
01:50:37,498 --> 01:50:40,958
What, life isn't fair? Is that it?
a

1481
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:46,770
Captain, ! want a prelaunch briefing.
All international teams present.

1482
01:51:22,376 --> 01:51:23,956
What the hell?

1483
01:51:27,381 --> 01:51:30,571
What is this? You could fit 10 people in here.

1484
01:51:37,824 --> 01:51:38,964
Satnam, where are you?

1485
01:51:39,326 --> 01:51:41,756
-On the Nampan Plateau.
-What?

1486
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:45,350
There's a tidal wave coming from the east.

1487
01:51:45,832 --> 01:51:48,582
-It's gigantic.
-Satnam, what happened?

1488
01:51:49,169 --> 01:51:51,009
We never got picked up, Adrian.

1489
01:51:51,471 --> 01:51:53,370
The airlift never came.

1490
01:51:55,175 --> 01:51:56,665
Goodbye, my friend.

1491
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:58,943
Satnam.

1492
01:51:59,746 --> 01:52:00,826
Satnam.

1493
01:52:02,015 --> 01:52:03,275
Satnam.

1494
01:52:25,372 --> 01:52:27,892
-The flooding is coming this way?
-Mary. Where are we set up?

1495
01:52:28,442 --> 01:52:29,702
Over there.

1496
01:52:33,547 --> 01:52:35,387
Get me the satellite images from Nampan, India.

1497
01:52:35,849 --> 01:52:37,309
-Okay, right away.
-What's happening?

1498
01:52:38,852 --> 01:52:41,102
No. Satnam was talking about another wave...

1499
01:52:41,622 --> 01:52:42,912
...coming from the east.

1500
01:52:46,727 --> 01:52:48,867
-Holy mother.
-The flooding is gonna hit earlier?

1501
01:52:49,363 --> 01:52:51,703
Is that what you're telling me?
The second wave is closer?

1502
01:52:52,232 --> 01:52:53,932
-Plug in the new data.
-Okay.

1503
01:52:55,302 --> 01:52:57,291
-Satnam didn't get picked up.
-What?

1504
01:52:58,038 --> 01:53:00,498
A lot of people didn't
get picked up in this chaos.

1505
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:02,411
This is not a conspiracy, Helmsley.

1506
01:53:03,076 --> 01:53:05,706
Your predictions haven't exactly panned out,
have they, doctor?

1507
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:07,950
It's ready. It's ready.

1508
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:11,847
Oh, God. It's 1500 meters high.

1509
01:53:13,654 --> 01:53:16,404
When's it gonna get here? Talk to me, Helmsley.
When's it gonna hit?

1510
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:18,420
Adjust the countdown.

1511
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:37,298
Twenty-eight minutes, 10 seconds to impact.

1512
01:53:37,844 --> 01:53:38,924
Oh, my God.

1513
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:42,299
Captain, I need to speak to the other heads of
state immediately.

1514
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:45,316
-Right away. Taylor?
-Aye, captain. Standing by.

1515
01:53:45,852 --> 01:53:48,102
Ark 6, stand by. Ark 7, stand by.

1516
01:53:48,622 --> 01:53:50,932
-Carl Anheuser, acting CIC, Ark 4.
-Yes, sir.
a

1517
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:53,447
Requesting emergency conference, T-99.

1518
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:16,891
He thinks the world of you, you know that?

1519
01:54:19,152 --> 01:54:20,642
He's a great little man.

1520
01:54:21,788 --> 01:54:23,098
Yeah.

1521
01:54:31,331 --> 01:54:33,611
l always wanted to have a family of my own.

1522
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:39,497
You're a lucky man, Jackson.

1523
01:54:40,474 --> 01:54:42,084
Don't ever forget it.

1524
01:54:58,358 --> 01:54:59,258
Who are they?

1525
01:54:59,593 --> 01:55:01,083
We found them along side of the road.

1526
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:05,160
You don't have to take all of us.

1527
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:07,264
Just take my children. I'm begging you.

1528
01:55:08,034 --> 01:55:09,464
Why should I do that?

1529
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:12,650
The same reason you sent for your family.

1530
01:55:14,574 --> 01:55:18,053
Please. I don't know if you can understand what
I'm saying.

1531
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:20,415
As amother, I'm begging you.

1532
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:21,637
Please take them.

1533
01:55:22,182 --> 01:55:23,081
Please.

1534
01:55:24,618 --> 01:55:28,018
We are all children of the earth.

1535
01:55:29,089 --> 01:55:31,869
My plan will not work for so many, Grandma.

1536
01:55:32,559 --> 01:55:35,049
We will take them all.

1537
01:55:35,862 --> 01:55:37,472
Thank you. Thank you.

1538
01:55:38,732 --> 01:55:39,582
Please.

1539
01:55:43,804 --> 01:55:46,264
Attention: All construction workers, off deck.
a

1540
01:55:47,073 --> 01:55:49,563
All crew members, onboard now.
a

1541
01:55:50,110 --> 01:55:51,630
They're opening the mountain.

1542
01:55:52,312 --> 01:55:54,712
They are leaving without us.

1543
01:55:55,248 --> 01:55:58,117
Step back. Get back. What did I tell you?

1544
01:55:58,718 --> 01:56:01,238
They are leaving you behind too. Look, idiot.

1545
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:03,598
Please be patient.

1546
01:56:06,493 --> 01:56:07,783
Let's go.

1547
01:56:11,064 --> 01:56:12,084
Follow me.

1548
01:56:15,769 --> 01:56:17,469
Follow me.

1549
01:56:24,344 --> 01:56:25,304
We have to hurry!

1550
01:56:26,112 --> 01:56:27,132
They are leaving!

1551
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:31,713
Initiate security procedures.

1552
01:56:32,152 --> 01:56:36,192
Time to impact: 17 minutes, 42 seconds.

1553
01:56:37,791 --> 01:56:39,981
Oh, excuse me. Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?

1554
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:41,723
He's on the bridge. This way.

1555
01:56:46,366 --> 01:56:47,216
Tenzin wait!

1556
01:56:48,969 --> 01:56:50,699
Grandma, we're almost there.
a

1557
01:56:51,137 --> 01:56:52,777
Green lights on pressure, Mr. Anton?

1558
01:56:53,206 --> 01:56:54,986
Green lights across the board, captain.

1559
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:08,190
Why do they have anchors?

1560
01:57:08,555 --> 01:57:11,425
Because they're not spaceships, buddy.
They're arks.

1561
01:57:12,025 --> 01:57:13,394
Let's go.

1562
01:57:25,906 --> 01:57:26,806
Mr. President.

1563
01:57:27,908 --> 01:57:28,838
You've got to see this.

1564
01:57:58,605 --> 01:57:59,504
Stop.

1565
01:57:59,839 --> 01:58:01,209
Stop! Stop!

1566
01:58:02,876 --> 01:58:03,746
Stop!

1567
01:58:10,517 --> 01:58:11,807
Engage the support mechanisms.

1568
01:58:12,185 --> 01:58:14,085
Aye, aye, captain. Engaging bow-anchor supports.

1569
01:58:14,554 --> 01:58:16,984
How long are these things
expecting to hold us in place?

1570
01:58:17,524 --> 01:58:20,074
They're just meant to withstand
the first impact of the waves.

1571
01:58:40,213 --> 01:58:42,233
Down there Oleg, you go first!

1572
01:58:47,053 --> 01:58:48,393
Caesar.

1573
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:56,161
Caesar.

1574
01:59:05,105 --> 01:59:06,094
Caesar.

1575
01:59:09,109 --> 01:59:10,369
Good. Good boy.

1576
01:59:11,011 --> 01:59:12,881
Come to Mommy. Caesar!

1577
01:59:14,481 --> 01:59:16,090
Mom, where's Tamara?
a

1578
01:59:18,652 --> 01:59:19,732
Daddy look!

1579
01:59:21,321 --> 01:59:23,131
Come on. Caesar, come on.
a

1580
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:25,050
-Tamaral
-I'm coming.

1581
01:59:33,266 --> 01:59:34,635
Take him.

1582
02:00:01,628 --> 02:00:03,208
Oh, my God. What's happening out there?

1583
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:04,920
Anheuser.

1584
02:00:05,665 --> 02:00:08,765
Anheuser convinced
the other heads of state to launch.

1585
02:00:12,405 --> 02:00:13,804
Mr. Anheuser.

1586
02:00:15,742 --> 02:00:17,882
We have to stop this madness.

1587
02:00:18,745 --> 02:00:20,765
Make sure the other bridges can see me.

1588
02:00:21,414 --> 02:00:24,454
-What do you think you're doing?
-[ know what I'm doing. Turn it on.

1589
02:00:26,019 --> 02:00:28,009
Ladies and gentlemen, this Dr. Adrian Helmsley...

1590
02:00:28,488 --> 02:00:30,738
...chief science advisor
to the late President Wilson.

1591
02:00:31,257 --> 02:00:33,916
Could you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann?

1592
02:00:34,561 --> 02:00:36,611
We've all been forced
to make difficult decisions...

1593
02:00:37,097 --> 02:00:38,617
..to save our human civilization.

1594
02:00:39,032 --> 02:00:41,222
But to be human means to care for each other...

1595
02:00:41,735 --> 02:00:45,165
..and civilization means to work together
to create a better life.

1596
02:00:45,839 --> 02:00:47,949
If that's true, then there's nothing human...

1597
02:00:48,441 --> 02:00:51,311
..and nothing civilized
about what we're doing here.

1598
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:53,931
Dr. Helmsley's passion is admirable.

1599
02:00:54,414 --> 02:00:57,874
But I will remind you that
we have very limited resources and limited time.

1600
02:00:58,551 --> 02:01:02,471
Ask yourselves, can we really stand by
and watch these people die?

1601
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:05,559
l read a quote two days ago.

1602
02:01:05,959 --> 02:01:08,209
The author is probably dead by now, but he said:

1603
02:01:08,728 --> 02:01:10,628
The moment we stop fighting for each other...

1604
02:01:11,097 --> 02:01:13,817
..that's the moment that we lose our humanity.

1605
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,540
To save the human race...

1606
02:01:15,902 --> 02:01:17,922
...we have an obligation to stick to this plan...

1607
02:01:18,404 --> 02:01:20,714
...which every nation on
this flotilla has signed up for.

1608
02:01:21,241 --> 02:01:23,871
-We have to let these people in!
-They're in God's hands now.

1609
02:01:25,945 --> 02:01:27,375
Officer, you turn that off.

1610
02:01:29,482 --> 02:01:30,772
That is an order. Turn it off!

1611
02:01:31,151 --> 02:01:32,441
Don't you dare touch that button.

1612
02:01:32,819 --> 02:01:35,279
Have you completely lost your mind?

1613
02:01:35,822 --> 02:01:38,722
Look at the clock. We have barely 15 minutes left.

1614
02:01:39,325 --> 02:01:41,934
Do you wanna be responsible for
the extinction of the human race?

1615
02:01:42,495 --> 02:01:43,755
Can you handle that, Adrian?

1616
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:46,000
There's a young astrophysicist from India...

1617
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:48,776
-...who's the reason we're all here.
-Oh, for God's sake.
a

1618
02:01:49,803 --> 02:01:52,733
He's the one who discovered it all.
He connected all the dots.

1619
02:01:53,339 --> 02:01:55,509
We all owe him our lives.

1620
02:01:56,009 --> 02:01:58,149
just leamed that
he was killed with his family...

1621
02:01:58,645 --> 02:02:01,075
...ina tsunami in eastern India.

1622
02:02:03,349 --> 02:02:04,549
He was my friend.

1623
02:02:06,019 --> 02:02:07,689
And he died in vain.

1624
02:02:08,588 --> 02:02:11,398
Everybody out there has died in vain...

1625
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:15,741
...if we start our future with an act of cruelty.

1626
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:19,170
What will you tell your children?

1627
02:02:20,867 --> 02:02:22,677
What will they tell theirs?

1628
02:02:25,305 --> 02:02:28,465
If my father were here, he would open the gates.

1629
02:02:36,216 --> 02:02:37,416
The people of Russia...

1630
02:02:39,819 --> 02:02:40,809
..along with China...

1631
02:02:43,223 --> 02:02:45,833
..and Japan, agree.

1632
02:02:47,293 --> 02:02:48,933
Open the gates.

1633
02:02:51,231 --> 02:02:54,771
The United Kingdom, Spain,
France, Canada, Germany...

1634
02:02:55,468 --> 02:02:59,338
...and I believe ! may also speak for
the Italian prime minister...

1635
02:03:00,073 --> 02:03:02,473
...we vote to let these people come in.

1636
02:03:08,915 --> 02:03:10,345
Captain Michaels.

1637
02:03:12,151 --> 02:03:13,141
Please.

1638
02:03:17,223 --> 02:03:18,533
This is the captain.

1639
02:03:18,925 --> 02:03:21,175
In a few moments, we will open the gates...

1640
02:03:21,694 --> 02:03:23,244
..and get you people in.

1641
02:03:23,663 --> 02:03:26,732
Please step back and clear the platform.

1642
02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:31,689
P-yew, it stinks.

1643
02:03:50,924 --> 02:03:52,974
-They are opening the gates.
-Go. Go.

1644
02:03:53,459 --> 02:03:55,479
Climb! Don't look down! Climb! Gol

1645
02:03:55,962 --> 02:03:57,392
Noah. Noah.

1646
02:03:57,797 --> 02:03:58,786
Get down.

1647
02:04:08,975 --> 02:04:10,525
Mom. Mom, something happened.

1648
02:04:10,944 --> 02:04:11,964
Hold on! Hold on!

1649
02:04:14,981 --> 02:04:15,880
Hold on!

1650
02:04:18,451 --> 02:04:20,441
Gordon, hold on, goddamn it! Give me your hand!

1651
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:22,230
-Give me your hand. Reach!
-Help!

1652
02:04:22,622 --> 02:04:24,462
-Reach for it! Gordon!
-Please. Please. Please.

1653
02:04:25,425 --> 02:04:26,715
Gordon! Gordon!

1654
02:04:28,061 --> 02:04:29,050
Gordon!

1655
02:04:30,263 --> 02:04:31,313
Nol

1656
02:04:32,465 --> 02:04:33,755
God.

1657
02:05:13,106 --> 02:05:14,246
What's wrong with the gate?

1658
02:05:14,607 --> 02:05:17,217
Looks like it didn’t run the full cycle.
We're checking, captain.

1659
02:05:18,311 --> 02:05:19,210
Hold it.

1660
02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:21,280
Hold it, people.

1661
02:05:26,019 --> 02:05:28,209
Four minutes to impact.

1662
02:06:12,498 --> 02:06:13,808
Go to the lower deck. Let's go.

1663
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,660
-We are loaded, captain.
-Well, then let's lock it up. Now.

1664
02:06:27,246 --> 02:06:29,876
Oleg. Grab my hand.

1665
02:06:30,716 --> 02:06:31,586
Oleg.

1666
02:06:32,718 --> 02:06:33,827
No, no.
a

1667
02:06:42,562 --> 02:06:45,022
Papal Papal

1668
02:06:49,902 --> 02:06:51,192
Papal

1669
02:07:02,715 --> 02:07:05,615
-Something's jamming the hydraulics.
-Then get it out, for chrissake.

1670
02:07:06,219 --> 02:07:08,829
I can't fire up the engines till
we get a good seal on that gate.

1671
02:07:09,388 --> 02:07:11,438
Captain, we have a breach in the zoological bay.

1672
02:07:11,924 --> 02:07:13,914
-Can you zoom in?
-Yeah.

1673
02:07:18,064 --> 02:07:19,204
I know those kids.

1674
02:07:19,565 --> 02:07:21,294
What is happening? What's going on?

1675
02:07:21,734 --> 02:07:23,404
Where did they come from?

1676
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:27,188
There. Through the hydraulic chamber.

1677
02:07:27,607 --> 02:07:29,097
Captain, I think we found the problem.

1678
02:07:29,509 --> 02:07:30,799
-Who are these people?
-No, wait.
a

1679
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:33,851
He's injured. Something must have gone wrong.

1680
02:07:34,313 --> 02:07:36,713
Something must have gone wrong?
Something must have gone--?

1681
02:07:37,250 --> 02:07:39,440
Are you kidding me?
Of course something went wrong!

1682
02:07:39,952 --> 02:07:41,562
You know, congratulations to both of you.

1683
02:07:41,988 --> 02:07:45,058
Might of gotten us killed, but as long as your
conscience is clean.

1684
02:07:45,691 --> 02:07:48,651
Let's get a team down there.
I'l meet them at the hydraulics chamber.

1685
02:07:49,262 --> 02:07:50,251
-You know your way?
-Yeah.

1686
02:07:50,596 --> 02:07:53,116
-Let's go!
-One minute to impact.

1687
02:08:07,213 --> 02:08:10,343
Captain, Cho Ming Airfield's been hit.

1688
02:08:10,983 --> 02:08:12,473
Put me on emergency com, Mr. Taylor.

1689
02:08:12,885 --> 02:08:14,905
Aye. You're on, captain.

1690
02:08:15,388 --> 02:08:16,617
This is the captain speaking.

1691
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:20,200
We expect to be impacted by water shortly.

1692
02:08:20,726 --> 02:08:22,566
-We need to go this way.
-All new passengers:

1693
02:08:23,029 --> 02:08:25,169
-Hit the deck, brace yourselves.
-Okay, let's go!

1694
02:08:25,665 --> 02:08:28,275
Excuse me. Excuse us. Excuse us. Brace yourselves!

1695
02:08:28,834 --> 02:08:29,854
Coming through, excuse me.

1696
02:08:43,516 --> 02:08:46,005
All stations, prepare for impact.

1697
02:09:16,616 --> 02:09:17,876
Come on, boys. Go, go, gol

1698
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:20,391
This way! Let's go! Go, go!

1699
02:09:32,131 --> 02:09:34,091
Collision pressure just below 80 pascal, captain.

1700
02:09:34,567 --> 02:09:36,757
0.2 mil surface compression
on bow sensors, captain.

1701
02:09:37,270 --> 02:09:40,170
-All right, track Dr. Helmsley.
-There.

1702
02:09:42,742 --> 02:09:43,612
Come on.

1703
02:09:43,943 --> 02:09:45,203
-I got you!
-Get out of the way!

1704
02:09:45,578 --> 02:09:47,188
-We have to get through here.
-Excuse me.

1705
02:09:48,648 --> 02:09:50,288
Tenzin, almost there.
a

1706
02:09:51,651 --> 02:09:52,991
Nima, what happened?

1707
02:09:55,288 --> 02:09:57,918
Tamara. Will you take the kids to the stairs,
please?

1708
02:09:59,058 --> 02:10:01,668
-Which way?
-We can't get there.

1709
02:10:02,228 --> 02:10:04,188
Water has penetrated the stern.

1710
02:10:04,664 --> 02:10:07,794
The rear of the ship is starting to seal itself up
one compartment at a time!

1711
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:10,590
Where's Gordon?

1712
02:10:11,671 --> 02:10:12,601
No?

1713
02:10:13,306 --> 02:10:14,476
No.

1714
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:18,380
We gotta go back. We gotta go back!
We need to go back!

1715
02:10:19,979 --> 02:10:22,469
-No! Lilly!
-Mommy!

1716
02:10:23,316 --> 02:10:25,896
-Lilly!
-Help, Daddy!

1717
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:29,960
Run, Lilly! Run!

1718
02:10:30,823 --> 02:10:33,573
Lilly, run! Go, go!

1719
02:10:34,994 --> 02:10:36,304
Go over, Lilly.

1720
02:10:39,498 --> 02:10:40,897
Caesar. Lilly, take him.

1721
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:45,250
Mommy!

1722
02:10:47,373 --> 02:10:49,152
Oh, no.
a

1723
02:10:52,611 --> 02:10:54,981
Sir, is there another way to
the hydraulics chamber?

1724
02:10:55,514 --> 02:10:57,824
-Where does this ladder go?
-To the zoological bay!

1725
02:10:58,351 --> 02:10:59,931
Okay, okay, let's go.

1726
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:06,561
Professor...

1727
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:09,140
..it's Air Force One.

1728
02:11:27,012 --> 02:11:29,182
-The mid-ship anchor is hit.
-We're destabilizing.

1729
02:11:29,682 --> 02:11:30,791
The bow anchor's giving in.

1730
02:11:50,569 --> 02:11:52,179
Captain, the turbine's not responding.

1731
02:11:52,605 --> 02:11:55,065
So override it.
Hit the override button and start the engines.

1732
02:11:55,608 --> 02:11:58,328
We cant start the engine
until we close that gate.

1733
02:12:16,362 --> 02:12:18,112
Help me! Help!

1734
02:12:23,569 --> 02:12:24,439
Tamara!

1735
02:12:25,471 --> 02:12:26,700
Tamara!

1736
02:12:27,973 --> 02:12:30,343
-You okay?
-My mommy's in there. Help her.

1737
02:12:30,876 --> 02:12:32,986
We'll get to your mommy.
They're doing everything they can.

1738
02:12:33,479 --> 02:12:35,619
-Can we talk to them?
-I'm gonna try and connect us.

1739
02:12:36,115 --> 02:12:39,545
-We have to stop the bleeding.
-Mom, how about my belt?

1740
02:12:40,219 --> 02:12:42,269
Mr. Curtis! Jackson!

1741
02:12:42,755 --> 02:12:43,745
Hey!

1742
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:45,839
Help! Hey!

1743
02:12:46,292 --> 02:12:48,022
It's Adrian Helmsley. We met at Yellowstone.

1744
02:12:48,461 --> 02:12:50,301
That's great! Open the goddamn door!

1745
02:12:50,763 --> 02:12:51,873
Your daughter is with me!

1746
02:12:52,231 --> 02:12:54,311
-Lilly!
-Lilly!

1747
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:57,260
-Where's Noah?
-I'm right here, Lil.

1748
02:12:58,170 --> 02:12:59,510
Impact warning.

1749
02:12:59,905 --> 02:13:01,514
Thirty degrees west.

1750
02:13:01,941 --> 02:13:03,431
Forty-five degrees east.

1751
02:13:03,843 --> 02:13:06,883
Target elevation, 29,035 feet.

1752
02:13:07,513 --> 02:13:09,943
Twenty-nine thousand feet? What the hell is at
29,000 feet?
a

1753
02:13:10,483 --> 02:13:12,443
We're headed straight for the north face...

1754
02:13:12,918 --> 02:13:14,788
...0f Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.
a

1755
02:13:15,254 --> 02:13:19,233
And if we can't start our engines,
we will not survive the impact.

1756
02:13:29,702 --> 02:13:32,252
Jackson, you're sealed off. We can't get to youl

1757
02:13:32,805 --> 02:13:34,445
There's something blocking the hydraulics.

1758
02:13:34,874 --> 02:13:37,714
If you can't get it out,
none of us are gonna make it.

1759
02:13:38,644 --> 02:13:40,724
Dr. Helmsley, look at this.

1760
02:13:41,514 --> 02:13:42,974
Itis completely submerged down there.

1761
02:13:43,382 --> 02:13:44,781
There'd be no way to get any air.

1762
02:13:45,784 --> 02:13:48,914
-There's no other way.
-But it's a suicide mission, sir.
a

1763
02:13:56,462 --> 02:13:58,712
I know where it is, I'll give it a try.

1764
02:14:05,504 --> 02:14:07,964
-Dad. Wait, l wanna go with you.
-No, Noah.
a

1765
02:14:08,507 --> 02:14:10,996
-Dad. I wanna help you.
-No, no. You are helping me, buddy.

1766
02:14:11,544 --> 02:14:12,414
Dad, please.

1767
02:14:12,745 --> 02:14:14,555
Remember when Lilly was born...

1768
02:14:15,014 --> 02:14:17,184
..and you wanted to be introduced
as her big brother?

1769
02:14:17,683 --> 02:14:20,343
Well, she's scared now,
a
and she needs you more than ever.

1770
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:21,770
And if you're safe...

1771
02:14:22,087 --> 02:14:24,167
...l know that she's safe. Do you understand?

1772
02:14:30,996 --> 02:14:33,166
You can help me out the next time.

1773
02:14:33,666 --> 02:14:34,716
Come on.

1774
02:14:35,067 --> 02:14:37,467
Kate, we caused this thing, it was us.

1775
02:14:38,003 --> 02:14:40,223
-Gotta go check it out.
-Okay.

1776
02:14:52,952 --> 02:14:54,182
I love you.

1777
02:15:08,867 --> 02:15:11,417
Please! Can you hear me?

1778
02:15:15,975 --> 02:15:17,085
Help!

1779
02:15:19,812 --> 02:15:21,041
Help!

1780
02:15:43,769 --> 02:15:46,809
Press down. Press down with your hand.

1781
02:15:54,913 --> 02:15:56,282
Don't stop. Keep pressing.

1782
02:16:14,133 --> 02:16:15,003
Noah!

1783
02:16:19,805 --> 02:16:23,265
Distance to impact: 1850 meters.

1784
02:16:26,845 --> 02:16:27,835
There he is!

1785
02:16:29,381 --> 02:16:30,811
Captain, we have a visuall

1786
02:16:31,216 --> 02:16:33,966
-[ think we found the problem.
-Show us the hydraulic chamber!

1787
02:16:51,736 --> 02:16:53,816
Goddamn it, I told you to stay up there with Mom.

1788
02:16:54,306 --> 02:16:55,506
I just wanted to help.

1789
02:16:55,874 --> 02:16:57,304
All right, all right.

1790
02:16:57,709 --> 02:16:58,669
You hold the light...

1791
02:16:59,011 --> 02:17:01,181
..-but from right here,
right in the air pocket, okay?

1792
02:17:02,013 --> 02:17:03,653
You're a crazy little dude.

1793
02:17:08,587 --> 02:17:09,816
Grandma, Grandpa.

1794
02:17:10,522 --> 02:17:11,922
I'm sorry.

1795
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:15,928
-I could not save us.
-He has gone back in. He will fix it.

1796
02:17:17,763 --> 02:17:19,753
There's no way.

1797
02:17:21,266 --> 02:17:22,995
Don't lose your faith, brother.

1798
02:17:50,896 --> 02:17:52,326
Dad!

1799
02:17:59,103 --> 02:18:02,233
No, we lost him. We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

1800
02:18:23,929 --> 02:18:26,148
Great job.
You light the way, I'll go for the cable.

1801
02:18:26,665 --> 02:18:27,565
Okay.

1802
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:30,389
Distance to impact: 400 meters.

1803
02:18:30,936 --> 02:18:33,395
Underwater ridge ahead.
We're going to run aground, captain.

1804
02:18:51,924 --> 02:18:52,794
Yeah!

1805
02:19:04,202 --> 02:19:06,452
-Sir, the gate is sealed.
-That's affirmative, captain.

1806
02:19:06,972 --> 02:19:08,582
Anton, start the engine.

1807
02:19:09,007 --> 02:19:10,527
Aye, aye, captain. Full reverse.

1808
02:19:19,684 --> 02:19:23,344
-Too fast! We're not gonna make it.
-Distance to impact: 50 meters.

1809
02:19:24,556 --> 02:19:25,636
Forty meters.

1810
02:19:49,514 --> 02:19:51,354
Reverse motion activated.

1811
02:19:51,817 --> 02:19:54,806
Distance to impact: 10 meters.

1812
02:19:55,888 --> 02:19:56,878
Twenty meters.

1813
02:20:05,664 --> 02:20:06,804
Yes!

1814
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:13,860
-Hard to port.
-Aye, captain. Hard to port.

1815
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:27,300
We did it. We did it. We did it.

1816
02:20:28,620 --> 02:20:30,640
-Where's your dad?
-He was right behind me.

1817
02:20:32,391 --> 02:20:34,881
Any word from the hydraulic chamber? Where is he?

1818
02:20:35,427 --> 02:20:36,886
I thought you said he was behind you.

1819
02:20:37,296 --> 02:20:38,636
-He was.
-Are you sure?

1820
02:20:39,031 --> 02:20:40,901
Yeah. He was right there.

1821
02:20:49,775 --> 02:20:50,855
Dad.

1822
02:20:51,977 --> 02:20:53,117
Dad.

1823
02:20:53,478 --> 02:20:54,967
Come on, Jackson. Come on.
a

1824
02:20:59,651 --> 02:21:02,371
Please, God. Please, please.

1825
02:21:04,323 --> 02:21:06,493
Please, please, please.

1826
02:21:07,559 --> 02:21:08,929
Come on, Jackson.
a

1827
02:21:13,899 --> 02:21:15,128
Oh, my--

1828
02:21:24,509 --> 02:21:25,799
-He did it!
-Daddy!

1829
02:21:26,178 --> 02:21:29,308
-He did it!
-He did it.

1830
02:22:26,004 --> 02:22:28,754
Shuttle Atlantis. Our last day.

1831
02:22:29,341 --> 02:22:31,831
All we can hear is
the sound of our own breathing...

1832
02:22:32,377 --> 02:22:37,327
..that reminds us we are still sharing our
memories, hopes and ideas.

1833
02:22:38,250 --> 02:22:41,410
And isn't it funny, just this morning,
we worked it out:

1834
02:22:42,054 --> 02:22:46,064
Somehow or another,
a
we all have relatives in Wisconsin.

1835
02:22:49,194 --> 02:22:50,394
The end.

1836
02:23:00,605 --> 02:23:01,744
It's good.

1837
02:23:02,841 --> 02:23:04,511
I thought you'd like it.

1838
02:23:06,211 --> 02:23:07,231
Tell me, Dr. Wilson...
a

1839
02:23:07,579 --> 02:23:10,449
.. apart from books and art...

1840
02:23:12,050 --> 02:23:16,880
...do you think there's anything else
we might possibly share in the future?

1841
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:22,170
Are you asking me out on a date, Dr. Helmsley?

1842
02:23:23,361 --> 02:23:25,611
Because, you know, my diary is pretty full.

1843
02:23:27,365 --> 02:23:28,675
Actually...

1844
02:23:31,803 --> 02:23:33,383
yes, l was.

1845
02:23:37,809 --> 02:23:39,979
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge, please.

1846
02:23:40,779 --> 02:23:41,949
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge.

1847
02:23:45,050 --> 02:23:46,359
Come here.

1848
02:23:52,657 --> 02:23:55,317
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Michaels speaking.

1849
02:23:55,894 --> 02:23:58,884
In a few minutes
will give orders to unseal the decks.

1850
02:23:59,498 --> 02:24:02,217
-Come on.
-At 2345 last night...

1851
02:24:02,801 --> 02:24:06,430
...our sister arks, Numbers 6 and 7,
ee
have joined our course.

1852
02:24:08,473 --> 02:24:09,933
For the first time on our journey...

1853
02:24:10,342 --> 02:24:12,952
...we'll have clear skies
and moderate-to-good air quality.

1854
02:24:13,512 --> 02:24:16,382
As you know, our passenger count
is way over capacity.

1855
02:24:16,982 --> 02:24:19,122
So please be careful when you step out.

1856
02:24:19,618 --> 02:24:22,868
And of course, enjoy the fresh air.

1857
02:24:25,423 --> 02:24:26,353
Can I hold him?

1858
02:24:27,259 --> 02:24:29,509
Sure. He can be your dog too, if you like.

1859
02:24:30,028 --> 02:24:31,018
Thanks.

1860
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:38,230
-Where have you been all my life?
-Gift shop.

1861
02:25:35,527 --> 02:25:37,607
Oh, Adrian, excellent.
ee

1862
02:25:38,363 --> 02:25:40,733
I called because
we just got our first satellite feed.

1863
02:25:41,266 --> 02:25:43,436
The equalization of the oceanic seabeds...

1864
02:25:43,935 --> 02:25:46,105
...has not turned out
to be as extreme as we expected.

1865
02:25:46,605 --> 02:25:49,795
The waters are receding
much faster than we thought, thank God.

1866
02:25:50,442 --> 02:25:51,991
And this is hard to believe...

1867
02:25:52,410 --> 02:25:55,039
...but the Himalayas are
no longer the roof of the world.

1868
02:25:55,614 --> 02:25:58,454
It's now the Drakensberg mountains of
KwaZulu-Natal.

1869
02:25:59,050 --> 02:26:00,830
The entire African continent has risen.

1870
02:26:01,286 --> 02:26:03,866
Several thousand feet,
a
and it likely never even flooded.

1871
02:26:04,422 --> 02:26:06,472
That's why they call it the Cape of Good Hope.

1872
02:26:06,958 --> 02:26:08,508
We've already set course for it.

1873
02:26:15,934 --> 02:26:17,604
Daddy, when will we go back home?

1874
02:26:18,703 --> 02:26:19,783
Well, we talked about that.
a

1875
02:26:20,138 --> 02:26:23,328
We're gonna find a new home
out here somewhere, right?

1876
02:26:23,975 --> 02:26:26,375
I mean, wherever we're all together, that's home.

1877
02:26:26,911 --> 02:26:28,901
Right? Don't be scared.

1878
02:26:29,381 --> 02:26:30,751
I'm not.

1879
02:26:32,784 --> 02:26:34,094
No more Pull-Ups.

1880
02:26:37,656 --> 02:26:38,916
Nice.
