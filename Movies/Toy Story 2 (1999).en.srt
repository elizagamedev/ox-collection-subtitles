1
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:00,783
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

2
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,711
All signs point to this planet
as the location of Zurg's fortress,

3
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,531
but there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

4
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,609
Come to me, my prey.

5
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,157
To infinity and beyond!

6
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,911
So, we meet again,
Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.

7
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,432
So, we meet again,
Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.

8
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,078
Not today, Zurg!

9
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,040
You almost had him.

10
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,649
- I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!
- Sure, you will, Rex.

11
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,241
In fact,
you're a better Buzz than lam.

12
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,936
But look at my little arms!

13
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,841
I can't press the "fire" button
and jump at the same time!

14
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,165
Where is it?
Where is it?

15
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,674
- Woody?
- Huh?

16
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,907
Hang on, cowboy!

17
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,489
- Woody, are you all right?
- Yeah.

18
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,239
Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. OK. Here's your
list of things to do while I'm gone.

19
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,880
Batteries need to be changed.

20
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,805
Toys in the bottom of the chest
need to be rotated.

21
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,327
And make sure everyone
attends Mr. Spell's seminar...

22
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,409
on what to do
if you or a part of you is swallowed.

23
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,081
OK? OK. Good. OK.

24
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,246
Woody, you haven't found
your hat yet, have you?

25
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,692
And Andy's leaving
for cowboy camp any minute,

26
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,131
and I can't find it anywhere!

27
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,311
Don't worry, Woody.
In just a few hours,

28
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,844
you'll be sitting around a campfire with
Andy making delicious, hot "sch'moes."

29
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,893
- They're called s'mores, Buzz.
- Right. Right. Of course.

30
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,969
Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?

31
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,694
Keep looking, men.
Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching.

32
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:39,075
The lawn gnome next door says it's not
in the yard, but he'll keep lookin’.

33
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,354
It's not in Molly's room.
We've looked everywhere.

34
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,418
- [found it.
- You found my hat?

35
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,265
Your hat? No.
The missus lost her earring.

36
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,026
- My little sweet potato!
- You found it!

37
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,513
It's so nice...

38
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,076
to have a big, strong spud
around the house.

39
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,917
That's just great.

40
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,878
This'll be the first year l miss cowboy
camp, all because of my stupid hat!

41
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,442
- Woody, look under your boot.
- Don't be silly.

42
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,461
- My hat is not under my boot.
- Would you just look?

43
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,334
No hat.
Just the word "Andy."

44
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,425
And the boy who wrote that

45
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,340
would take you to camp
with or without your hat.

46
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,510
I'm sorry, Bo.

47
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,246
It's just that I've been
lookin’ forward to this all year.

48
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,402
It's my one time
with just me and Andy.

49
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,471
You're cute when you care.

50
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,799
- Bo, not in front of Buzz.
- Let him look.

51
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,545
Miss Peep, your sheep!

52
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,997
This is Al from Al's Toy Barn,

53
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,499
and I'm sittin’ on good deals.

54
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,347
think I'm feeling
a deal hatching right now.

55
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,116
Let's see what we got. We got boats
for a buck, Beanies for a buck...

56
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,784
- Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear!
- Which one is off?

57
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,166
Buck-buck-buck! And that's
cheap-cheap-cheap! So hurry on down...

58
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,520
For cryin’ out loud, it's this one.

59
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:02,162
- [despise that chicken.
- Fellas! Fellas!

60
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,649
OK, I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.

61
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,645
What news?

62
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,678
The good news is
I found your hat, Woody.

63
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,126
My hat! Slink, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

64
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,472
- Where'd you find it?
- Well, that's the bad news.

65
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,404
It's Buster!

66
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,693
Canine alert!
Man your battle stations!

67
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,621
Let's move, move, move!

68
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,565
Woody! Hide! Quick!

69
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,891
OK, OK, OK.
OK, OK! You found me!

70
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,948
Buster, all right.
Hey, how did he do, Hamm?

71
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:57,854
- Looks like a new record.
- OK, boy. Sit.

72
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,401
Reach for the sky.

73
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,887
Gotcha!

74
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,500
Great job, boy.

75
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,005
Who's gonna miss me
while I'm gone, huh?

76
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,498
Who's gonna miss me?

77
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,533
Who's gonna miss me?

78
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,088
Andy, you got all your stuff?

79
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,906
Have a good weekend, everybody.
I'll see you Sunday night.

80
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,385
It's in my room.

81
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,736
Stick 'em up.

82
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,740
I guess we'll work on that later.

83
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,645
Hey, Woody.
Ready to go to cowboy camp?

84
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,250
Andy, honey, come on.
Five minutes, and we're leavin’.

85
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,587
Five minutes.

86
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,857
Help, help!
Somebody help me!

87
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,202
Let her go, evil Dr. Pork Chop!

88
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,891
Never!

89
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,703
You must choose, Sheriff Woody.
How shall she die?

90
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,843
Shark, or death by monkeys?

91
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:49,931
Choose!

92
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,653
I choose Buzz Lightyear!

93
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,466
What? That's not a choice!

94
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,924
To infinity and beyond!

95
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,612
- I'll save you, Miss Peep.
- My hero.

96
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,266
- Thanks, Buzz.
- No problem, buddy.

97
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,635
You should never tangle
with the unstoppable duo

98
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,351
of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!

99
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,301
Oh, no.

100
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,586
Andy, let's go!
Molly's already in her car seat.

101
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,897
- But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped.
- Oh, no.

102
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,020
- Maybe we can fix him on the way.
- No, just leave him.

103
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,637
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know toys don't last forever.

104
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,363
- What happened?
- Woody's been shelved.

105
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,284
Andy!

106
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,613
- Woody?
- Woody? Honey, are you OK?

107
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,056
Ride 'em, cowboy!

108
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,449
He's back? Hey, everybody! Andy's back!
He's back early from cowboy camp!

109
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,714
Places, everybody!
Andy's coming!

110
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,792
Hey, Woody!
Did you miss me?

111
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,432
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap.
Ride 'em, cowboy!

112
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,495
I forgot.
You're broken.

113
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,899
I don't wanna play with you anymore.

114
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,943
No, Andy!
No. No, Andy! No!

115
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,695
Andy. Andy.

116
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,718
Bye, Woody.

117
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,058
No! No! Andy!

118
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,790
Wheezy, is that you?

119
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,461
- Hey, Woody.
- What are you doing up here?

120
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,626
I thought Mom took you
to get your squeaker fixed months ago.

121
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,953
- Andy was so upset.
- Nah.

122
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,275
She just told him that
to calm him down

123
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,371
and then put me on the shelf.

124
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,730
- Why didn't you yell for help?
- Well, I tried squeakin'.

125
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,656
But I'm still broken.
No one could hear me.

126
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,215
Besides, the dust
aggravates my condition.

127
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,450
What's the point
in prolonging the inevitable?

128
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,536
We're all just one stitch away
from here to there.

129
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,809
Yard sale? Yard sale!

130
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,468
Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up!
There's a yard sale outside!

131
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,129
- Yard sale?
- Sarge, emergency roll call!

132
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,300
Sir, yes, sir!
Red alert!

133
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,319
All civilians fall in position now!
Single file! Let's move, move, move!

134
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:45,747
- Hamm?
- Here.

135
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,272
- Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs.?
- Here.

136
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,083
Troikas. Check,
check, check, check, check.

137
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,119
l hate yard sales!

138
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,777
Someone's coming!

139
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,876
OK. Let's see what's up here.

140
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,153
Bye, Woody.

141
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,743
Wheezy! Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

142
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,438
Hey. Here, boy. Here, Buster!

143
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,260
Up here!

144
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,434
OK, boy.
To the yard sale!

145
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,487
What's goin’ on? He's nuts.

146
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,809
His arm ain't that bad.

147
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,803
Don't do it, Woody!
We love you!

148
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,495
Careful on the steps, now.

149
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,214
OK, boy. Let's go.
And keep it casual.

150
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,737
Not that casual.

151
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,572
Piggy bank coming through,
coming through.

152
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,731
- ls he out there?
- There he is.

153
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,906
He's in the box!

154
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,135
He's sellin’ himself
for 25 cents!

155
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,818
You're worth more than that.

156
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,069
Hold on. Hold on.
He's got something.

157
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,224
- It's Wheezy!
- Wheezy?

158
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,040
Hey, it's not suicide.
It's a rescue.

159
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,786
Good boy, Buster. Hold still.
There. There you go, pal.

160
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,470
- Bless you, Woody.
- All right, now.

161
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,258
Back to Andy's room.

162
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,318
Way to go, cowboy.

163
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,838
- Golly bob howdy!
- Woody, I'm slipping!

164
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,281
Mommy... Mommy, look! Look at this!

165
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,637
- Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly!
- Hey, that's not her toy!

166
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,137
What's that little gal
think she's doin'?

167
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,766
Mommy, Mommy, can we get it?
Please? Mommy, please?

168
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,026
You don't want that toy.
It's broken.

169
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,438
There's a snake in my boot.

170
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,487
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest!

171
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:40,512
Little rip. Fixable. If only you had
your hand-stitched, polyvinyl...

172
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,927
A hat! I found him!
I found him! I found him!

173
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,731
Buster! Quiet down!

174
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,768
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Yes.

175
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,130
You can help
take his paws off my pal.

176
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,656
I'll give you 50 cents
for all this junk.

177
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,422
- Now, how did this get down here?
- Hand her the sheriff.

178
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,785
Nice and easy.

179
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,676
- Five dollars.
- I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.

180
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,287
Now just walk away.

181
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,248
- Wait.
- The other way.

182
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,967
- I'll give you 50 bucks for him.
- Fifty bucks ain't bad.

183
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,649
- It's not for sale.
- Everything's for sale.

184
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,759
- Or trade. You like my watch?
- Sorry.

185
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,228
- He's safe. Way to go!
- She showed him!

186
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,962
- Molly, don't touch that, sweetie.
- Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car.

187
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,954
- Hold on.
- What's up?

188
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,593
What is it, Buzz?

189
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,693
What's happening?

190
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:32,790
What's he doing?

191
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,602
I can't watch!
Can someone cover my eyes?

192
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,108
- He's stealin' Woody!
- What? He can't take Woody.

193
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,634
It's illegal.

194
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,446
- Where's he going?
- Do something.

195
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,374
Buzz!

196
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,686
Get him, Buzz.

197
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,382
Where's the red jacket?

198
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,806
Why would someone steal Woody?

199
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,144
All right.
Let's review this one more time.

200
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,828
At precisely 8:32-ish,

201
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,743
Exhibit A, Woody, was kidnapped.

202
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,383
Exhibit B,
a composite sketch of the kidnapper.

203
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,697
- He didn't have a beard like that.
- Fine. Etch, give him a shave.

204
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,699
The kidnapper was bigger than that.

205
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,553
- Picky, picky, picky.
- Let's just go straight to Exhibit F.

206
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,114
The kidnapper's vehicle.

207
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,392
Now, the vehicle fled the scene
in this direction.

208
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,557
Your eyes are in backwards.
It went the other way.

209
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:34,779
Hey. Put a cork in it.

210
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,121
- How do you spell FBI?
- My crime scene!

211
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,473
Why don't you watch
where you're going, Godspilla?

212
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,099
- didn't know there was a crime scene.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

213
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,598
A little quiet, please.
Thank you.

214
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,057
Lazy toy brain.

215
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,629
- Lousy try, Brian.
- What are you doing, Buzz?

216
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,608
It's some sort of message
encoded on that vehicle's I.D. tag.

217
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,755
- Liz try bran.
- It's just a license plate.

218
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,683
- It's just a jumble of letters.
- Yeah, and there are about

219
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,254
3.5 million registered cars
in the tri-county area alone.

220
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,589
Lou's thigh burn.

221
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,179
This can't help.
Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys.

222
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,646
Toy. Toy. Toy.
Hold on!

223
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,299
- Al's Toy Barn.
- Al's Toy Barn!

224
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,644
Etch, draw that man
in a chicken suit.

225
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,610
It's the chicken man!

226
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,198
That's our guy.

227
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,190
I knew there was something
I didn't like about that chicken.

228
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,393
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll be right there.

229
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,902
And we're gonna do this commercial
in one take, do you hear me,

230
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,061
because I am in the middle
of something really important.

231
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:52,126
You, my little cowboy friend,
are gonna make me big buck-buck-bucks.

232
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,420
Andy!

233
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,895
I can't believe I have to drive
all the way to work on a Saturday.

234
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,633
All the way to work!

235
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,437
What?

236
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:59,412
Hey! Stop! Horsy, stop!
Stop! Sit, boy!

237
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,794
Stop it!
Sit, I said!

238
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,462
It's you! It's you!
It's you! It's you! It's you!

239
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,023
- It's really you!
- What's me?

240
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,321
There's a snake in my boot.

241
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,346
- It is you!
- Please stop saying that.

242
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,788
Prospector said someday you'd come.

243
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,821
Sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln!

244
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,255
The Prospector!
He'll wanna meet ya!

245
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,955
Say "hello" to the Prospector!

246
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,280
- It... It's a box.
- He's mint in the box.

247
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,474
Never been opened.

248
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,432
Turn me around, Bullseye,
so I can see.

249
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,952
Why, the prodigal son has returned.

250
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,627
It's you! It's you!

251
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,075
You're here! It's you!
It's you! It's you!

252
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,704
OK. I'm officially freaked-out now.

253
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,990
We've waited countless years
for this day.

254
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,405
- It's good to see you, Woody.
- Listen. I don't know wh...

255
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,937
- Hey, how do you know my name?
- Everyone knows your name, Wood-y.

256
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:23,474
Why, you don't know
who you are, do you? Bullseye?

257
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,651
That's me.

258
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,056
Wow.

259
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,912
Holy cow.

260
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,423
Cowboy Crunchies,

261
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,835
the cereal that's sugar-frosted
and dipped in chocolate,

262
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,571
proudly presents:

263
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:27,296
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

264
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,590
There's Jessie
the yodeling cowgirl

265
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,683
Look it! That's me!

266
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,258
- Bullseye, he's Woody's horse
- He's a smart one

267
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:40,412
- Pete the old Prospector
- Has anyone seen my pick?

268
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,010
And the man himself
Of course, it's time for Sheriff Woody

269
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,750
He's the very best

270
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,161
He's the rootin'’-est
tootin’-est cowboy

271
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,990
In the wild, wild west

272
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:54,587
Woody's Roundup

273
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,926
I can't find it! It doesn't seem
to be on any of these stations.

274
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,982
- Keep looking.
- You're going too slow.

275
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,583
Let me take the wheel.

276
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,096
It's too fast.

277
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,148
- How can you even tell what's on?
- l can tell.

278
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,658
Stop! Back, back, back!

279
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,956
Too late. I'm in the 40s.
Got to go ‘round the horn. It's faster.

280
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,004
- Back, back! Stop!
- And look for the giant chicken!

281
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,734
Now, Etch!

282
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,367
That's where I need to go.

283
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,510
You can't go, Buzz.
You'll never make it there.

284
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,822
Woody once risked his life to save me.

285
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:32,767
I couldn't call myself his friend
if l weren't willing to do the same.

286
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,039
So who's with me?

287
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:40,321
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

288
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,568
This is for Woody when you find him.

289
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,108
All right,

290
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,341
but I don't think it'll mean
the same coming from me.

291
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:56,941
Mr. Buzz Lightyear,
you just gotta save my pal Woody.

292
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,343
I'll do my best, son.

293
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,664
OK, fellas.
Let's roll.

294
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,351
Geronimo!

295
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,968
You'd think with
all my video game experience,

296
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,397
I'd be feeling more prepared.

297
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,479
The idea is to let go.

298
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,197
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

299
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,460
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!

300
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,917
To Al's Toy Barn and beyond!

301
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:45,785
They don't calf this

302
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,531
the old abandoned mine
for nothin’, Prospector.

303
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,563
! reckon we oughta
get outta here.

304
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,782
Where's my gold?
Hold on. I'll light me a candle.

305
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,091
This sure is a fast-burnin' wick.

306
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:58,351
Blast us to smithereens!
That there's dynamite!

307
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,637
- Holy tarnation!
- I'l call for help.

308
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:07,002
Hey, critters, go get Sheriff Woody.
Now scurry!

309
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,086
Good job, Bullseye.

310
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,648
! reckon the new schoolhouse
is finally done.

311
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,491
What's that?

312
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,814
Jessie and Prospector are trapped
in the old abandoned mine,

313
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,075
and Prospector just lit a stick
of dynamite thinkin’ it was a candle,

314
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,110
and now they're about
to be blown to smithereens?

315
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,907
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

316
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:31,263
You're fannin' the flames, Jessie!
It takes brains to put out that fire.

317
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,754
My biscuits are burnin'!

318
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,371
Will Woody and Bullseye
land to safety?

319
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,953
Can they reach Jessie
and Stinky Pete in time?

320
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,676
Tune in next week for the exciting
conclusion: "Woody's Finest Hour."

321
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,787
All right! All right! Next tape!

322
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,757
Hey, wait. What happened?
What happens next?

323
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,226
- Come on! Let's see the next episode!
- That's it.

324
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:57,452
What?

325
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,518
The show was canceled after that.

326
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,826
Wait, wait, wait.
What about the gold mine

327
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,375
and the cute little critters
and the dynamite?

328
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,187
That was a great show!
I mean, why cancel it?

329
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,734
Two words: Sput-nik.

330
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,436
Once the astronauts went up, children
only wanted to play with space toys.

331
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:19,261
l know how that feels.
But still, my own show.

332
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,851
- mean, look at all this stuff!
- Didn't you know?

333
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,757
Why, you're valuable property!

334
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,756
I wish the guys could see this.
Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.

335
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,613
I'm on a yo-yo.

336
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,916
Nice teeth.
And yet, still a good-lookin' guy.

337
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,726
It's a bank! Cool.

338
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,806
What do you do?
You push the hat, and out co...

339
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,449
Out come bubbles. Clever.

340
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,426
Wow. What's this thing do?

341
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,238
I get it.

342
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,539
"There's a snake in my boot."

343
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:59,947
Hey, Bullseye.
Go long! Go long!

344
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,771
A record player!

345
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,736
l haven't seen one of these in ages.

346
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,600
OK, now. Slow.

347
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,572
That's funny, Bullseye.

348
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,212
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!

349
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,841
- Not bad.
- It's time for Woody's Roundup

350
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,343
He's the very best

351
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,453
He's the rootin'’-est
tootin’-est cowboy...

352
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,096
Look at us!
We're a complete set!

353
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,949
- Now it's on to the museum.
- Museum?

354
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,732
- What museum?
- The museum.

355
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,591
We're being sold
to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.

356
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,085
- That's in Japan!
- Japan?

357
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,704
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't go to Japan.

358
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,287
What do you mean?

359
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,399
I've got to get back home
to my owner, Andy.

360
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,021
Hey, look, look. See?

361
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,986
- He still has an owner.
- My goodness.

362
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,434
No. Can't go.

363
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:03,315
I can't do storage again.
I just can't!

364
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,552
- Jessie.
- [won't go back in the dark!

365
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,517
What's the matter?
What's wrong with her?

366
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,063
Well, we've been in storage
for a long time

367
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,229
waiting for you.

368
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,160
- Why me?
- The museum's

369
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:17,173
only interested in the collection
if you're in it, Woody.

370
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,523
Without you, we go back into storage.

371
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,332
- It's that simple.
- It's not fair!

372
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,249
How can you do this to us?

373
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,160
Hey, look. I'm sorry,
but this is all a big mistake.

374
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,290
- You see, I was in this yard sale...
- Yard sale?

375
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,667
Why were you in a yard sale
if you have an owner?

376
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,556
Well, l wasn't supposed to be there.
I was trying to save another toy when...

377
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,195
Was it because you're damaged?
Did this Andy break you?

378
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:44,142
Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no!
It was... It was an accident.

379
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,993
- [ mean...
- Sounds like he reaily loves you.

380
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,846
It's not like that, OK?
And I'm not going to any museum!

381
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,610
Well, I'm not going back into storage!

382
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,087
Al's coming!

383
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,732
Go! Go on, Jessie.

384
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,197
Jessie, look at me.

385
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:03,892
I promise you'll come out of the box.
Now go! Go!

386
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,873
It's show time!

387
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,958
Money, baby.
Money, money, money.

388
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:22,084
And now, the main attraction.

389
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,652
No! His arm! Where's his arm?

390
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,408
What am I gonna do?
I know. I know.

391
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,828
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Pick up the phone!

392
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,920
- Hello?
- It's me. It's Al.

393
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,082
I got an emergency.

394
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,831
- I'm busy.
- Yes, we're all busy.

395
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,546
Look. It has to be tonight.

396
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,262
All right. All right.
But first thing in the morning.

397
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,935
It's gone!
I can't believe it!

398
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,634
- My arm is completely gone!
- All right. Come here. Let me see that.

399
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,927
It's just a popped seam,
easily repaired.

400
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,447
- You should consider yourself lucky.
- Lucky?

401
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,463
Are you shrink-wrapped?
lam missing my arm!

402
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,802
Big deal.

403
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,473
Let him go.
I'm sure his precious Andy

404
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,663
is dying to play with
a one-armed cowboy doll.

405
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:24,803
Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last
an hour on the streets in his condition.

406
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,984
It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.

407
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,056
All right.
Nobody look till 1 get my cork back in.

408
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,259
Good work, men. Two blocks down
and only 19 more to go.

409
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:58,886
- What?
- Nineteen?

410
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,486
Are we gonna do this all night?
My parts are killing me.

411
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:02,907
Come on, fellas.

412
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,871
Did Woody give up when Sid
had me strapped to a rocket?

413
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,739
And did he give up when you threw him
out of the back of that moving van?

414
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,369
- You had to bring that up.
- No, he didn't!

415
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:18,242
We have a friend in need, and we will
not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!

416
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,520
Now let's move out!

417
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,225
And that concludes
our broadcast day.

418
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:17,066
Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.

419
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,519
Come on. You don't wanna
help me. I'm the bad guy.

420
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:23,115
You're gonna go back in storage
because of me, remember? Just go.

421
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,185
Bullseye...
All right. All right.

422
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:31,205
But you have got
to keep quiet. Come on.

423
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:39,015
Over here. Attaboy.

424
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,607
OK, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy.

425
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,669
Bullseye. Cut it out.

426
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:01,394
Stop it.
Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.

427
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,856
Stop it.

428
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,569
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

429
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:41,349
No, Officer! 1 swear.
What?

430
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:51,817
Get in there.
There you go. Cheap case.

431
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:56,364
Where is the remote?
Where is the remote?

432
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,243
Why don't! put it in the same place
every... Here it is.

433
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:13,987
What is your problem?

434
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,942
Look, I'm sorry I can't
help you guys out.

435
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,616
Really, lam. But you didn't have
to go and pull a stunt like that.

436
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,267
What? You think did that?

437
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,493
Right. The TV just happened
to turn on,

438
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,872
and the remote magically ended up
in front of you!

439
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,747
- You calling me a liar?
- Well, if the boot fits...

440
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,064
Say that again.

441
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:34,326
If the boot fits.

442
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,049
OK, cowboy.

443
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:46,431
How do you like that?
Take it back! Take it back!

444
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,268
Don't think just ‘cause you're a girl,
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

445
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,988
Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.

446
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,382
I don't know
how that television turned on,

447
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,846
but fighting about it
isn't helping anything.

448
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,060
- If lhad both my arms...
- The fact is, you don't, Woody,

449
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,638
so I suggest
you just wait until morning.

450
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,807
- The cleaner will come, fix your arm...
- And then I'm outta here!

451
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:14,629
Oh, no, no.
Bullseye, don't take it that way.

452
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,016
- It's just that Andy...
- Andy, Andy, Andy.

453
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,832
That's all he ever talks about.

454
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,334
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?

455
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,056
May I remind you that some of us are
carrying over six dollars in change?

456
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,312
Losing health units.
Must rest.

457
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,513
- ls everyone present and accounted for?
- Not quite everyone.

458
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,280
- Who's behind?
- Mine.

459
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,670
Hey, guys.
Why do the toys cross the road?

460
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:54,787
- Not now, Hamm.
- Llove riddles. Why?

461
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,673
To get to the chicken
on the other side!

462
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:01,975
The chicken!

463
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,944
- Oh, well. We tried.
- We'll have to cross.

464
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,437
What the...

465
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,412
You're not turning me
into a mashed potato.

466
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:16,511
I may not be a smart dog,
but I know what roadkill is.

467
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:18,971
There must be a safe way.

468
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,688
OK.
Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go.

469
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,042
Drop!

470
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,677
Go!

471
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,391
Drop! I said "drop"!

472
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,606
Go!

473
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,048
Drop.

474
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:11,418
Go.

475
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,021
That went well.

476
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,099
Good job, troops.
We're that much closer to Woody.

477
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,773
Thank goodness you're here.

478
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,758
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?

479
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,299
So how long is this gonna take?

480
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,535
You can't rush art.

481
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:50,543
Oh, no. It's closed.

482
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:54,262
We're not preschool toys, Slinky.
We can read.

483
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,609
Hey, Joe, you're late.

484
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,305
We've got a ton of toys to unload.

485
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,557
All right. All right.
I'm comin’. I'm comin’.

486
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,392
All right. Let's go.

487
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:09,540
But the sign
says it's closed.

488
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,421
No, no, no, no.
All together. Now!

489
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,184
Whoa, Nelly! How are we going
to find Woody in this place?

490
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:43,117
Look for Al. We find Al,
we find Woody. Now move out!

491
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:46,865
- Woody?
- Woody.

492
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,723
There you go.

493
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,279
He's for display only.

494
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,809
You handle him too much,
he's not gonna last.

495
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,832
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.

496
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,417
Wow.

497
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,294
I could use one of those.

498
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,846
I could use one of those.

499
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:02,247
You know, they make it so you can't
defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.

500
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,450
It's extortion.
That's what it is.

501
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,468
Hey, I always thought
the golden sector was the only...

502
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,147
I thought
we could search in style.

503
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:15,089
Nice going there, Hamm. So how about
letting a toy with fingers drive?

504
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,486
Am I really that fat?

505
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,026
- What are you doing?
- You're in direct violation

506
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:38,865
of Code 6404.5,

507
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,550
stating all space rangers
are to be in hyper-sleep

508
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,883
until awakened
by authorized personnel.

509
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:45,072
Oh, no.

510
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,006
You're breakin’ ranks, ranger.

511
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:49,665
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

512
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:53,281
- I've got an AWOL space ranger.
- Tell me I wasn't this deluded.

513
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:57,107
No back talk!
l have a laser, and I will use it.

514
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,825
You mean the laser that's a light bulb?

515
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:04,308
Has your mind been melded?
You could've killed me, space ranger.

516
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,132
Or should I say "traitor"?

517
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:09,882
- [don't have time for this.
- Halt!

518
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,361
l order you to halt!

519
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,916
Listen to me.
Listen. Wait.

520
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,946
- We've been down this aisle already.
- We've never been down this aisle.

521
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:28,232
- It's pink.
- Face it. We're lost.

522
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,869
Back it up. Back it up.

523
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,607
What a great party!

524
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:39,983
How low can you go?
How low can you go?

525
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,810
Excuse me, ladies.

526
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,567
Does anyone know where we might
find the Al of Al's Toy Barn?

527
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,674
I can help.

528
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:52,201
I'm Tour Guide Barbie.

529
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:55,107
Please keep your hands, arms
and accessories inside the car,

530
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,136
and no flash photography.

531
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:00,118
-Thank you.
-I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud.

532
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:03,405
- I'ma married spud.
- Then make room for the single fellas.

533
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,618
To our right is
the Hot Wheels aisle. Developed in 1967,

534
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,261
the original series had 16 cars,
including the Corvette.

535
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,547
l beg your pardon, ma'am,
but where's Al's office?

536
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,596
Please hold all questions
until the end of the tour. Thank you.

537
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,006
It says how
you defeat Zurg! Look!

538
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,778
- Excuse me, sir.
- Get this outta here, "geek-osaur."

539
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,768
- Look out!
- Stop, stop, stop!

540
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,060
Turn into the spin, Barbie!

541
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,485
My source of power!

542
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:38,279
No! Come back! Hey!

543
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:42,055
Wait up! Hey!
Come on! Slow down!

544
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,442
Dinosaur overboard!
Slow down!

545
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,960
Remain seated, please.

546
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,379
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not really a space ranger.

547
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:57,369
You're a toy.
We're all toys. Do you hear me?

548
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,128
Well, that should hold you
till the court martial.

549
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:03,894
Let me go! You don't
realize what you're doing!

550
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:06,832
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.

551
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:11,621
In 1995, shortsighted retailers did not
order enough dolls to meet demand.

552
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,442
- Hey, Buzz!
- Halt! Who goes there?

553
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,115
Quit clownin' around
and get in the car!

554
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,468
Buzz, Buzz,
I know how to defeat Zurg!

555
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,680
- You do?
- Come on. I'll tell you on the way.

556
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:27,977
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong Buzz!
You've got the wrong Buzz!

557
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,739
Say, where'd you
get the cool belt, Buzz?

558
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,168
Well, slotted pig,
they're standard issue.

559
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,670
It's like printing my own money.

560
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,374
Yeah? What?

561
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:55,769
Mr. Konishi.
Yes, I have the pictures right here.

562
00:46:56,414 --> 00:47:00,224
In fact, I'm in the car right now on
my way to the office to fax them to you.

563
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,398
I'm going through a tunnel!
I'm breakin’ up!

564
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:07,073
Wow! Will you look at me?
It's like I'm fresh out of the box!

565
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:11,315
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna
have a hard time rippin’ this! Hello!

566
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:13,766
Hi! Hello!

567
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,350
Great. Now you can go.

568
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,850
Well, what a good idea.

569
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:33,365
Woody, don't be mad at Jessie.

570
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,711
She's been through
more than you know.

571
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:38,243
Why not make amends
before you leave, huh?

572
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,022
It's the least you can do.

573
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:52,232
All right.
But I don't know what good it'll do.

574
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,233
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?

575
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:05,862
Thought I'd get one last look at
the sun before I get packed away again.

576
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,668
Look, Jessie.
I know you hate me for leaving,

577
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,210
but I have to go back.

578
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,020
I'm still Andy's toy.

579
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:18,006
Well, if you knew him, you'd understand.
Andy's a real...

580
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:21,589
Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid.

581
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,243
And to him, you're his buddy,
his best friend.

582
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:29,525
And when Andy plays with you,
it's like even though you're not moving,

583
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,817
you feel like you're alive,
because that's how he sees you.

584
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,308
How did you know that?

585
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,577
Because Emily was just the same.

586
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,540
She was my whole world.

587
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,286
When somebody loved me

588
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,569
Everything was beautiful

589
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:55,402
Every hour we spent together

590
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,563
Lives within my heart

591
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,820
And when she was sad

592
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:06,404
! was there to dry her tears

593
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:11,801
And when she was happy so was

594
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:16,860
When she loved me

595
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,591
Through the summer and the fall

596
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,721
We had each other
That was all

597
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,991
Just she and I together

598
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:35,384
Like it was meant to be

599
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,935
And when she was lonely

600
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,509
! was there to comfort her

601
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,033
And I knew that

602
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:51,787
She loved me

603
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,716
So the years went by

604
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,442
l stayed the same

605
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,235
But she began to drift away

606
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:12,342
! was left alone

607
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,870
Still l waited for the day

608
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,504
When she'd say

609
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:22,002
will always

610
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,650
Love you

611
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:30,634
Lonely and forgotten

612
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,215
! never thought she'd look my way

613
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,892
She smiled at me and held me

614
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:41,975
Just like she used to do

615
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,700
Like she loved me

616
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,613
When she loved me

617
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,585
When somebody loved me

618
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:59,302
Everything was beautiful

619
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:03,437
Every hour we spent together

620
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:07,830
Lives within my heart

621
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:07,881
Lives within my heart

622
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:13,185
When she loved me

623
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:31,574
You never forget kids
like Emily or Andy.

624
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,564
But they forget you.

625
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:39,770
- Jessie, I... 1 didn't know.
- Just go.

626
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:03,843
How long will it last, Woody?

627
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,221
Do you really think Andy
is gonna take you to college

628
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:09,214
or on his honeymoon?

629
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,372
Andy's growing up,

630
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:16,357
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

631
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,711
It's your choice, Woody.

632
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:23,667
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

633
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:28,631
You'll be adored
by children for generations.

634
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,482
Who am I to break up
the Roundup gang?

635
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:07,971
- Hey, Woody, are you in here?
- Nah. This one's empty too.

636
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,912
- Woody! Woody!
- Woody!

637
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:14,451
Pardon me, gentlemen, but have either of
you seen a cowboy doll with a bad arm?

638
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,978
- Why, no, I haven't.
- Hey! He was talkin’ to me!

639
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,347
- No! He was talkin’ to me!
- Why, you...

640
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,402
You see, all along,

641
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,939
we thought the way into Zurg's fortress
was through the main gate,

642
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:29,555
but in fact, the secret entrance
is to the left, hidden in the shadows.

643
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,200
To the left in the shadows. Got it.

644
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,457
- Someone's coming.
- Everyone, take cover.

645
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,050
It was a big pile-up, but I don't want
to bore you with the details.

646
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,406
Yes. Now, let me
confirm your fax number.

647
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:42,895
- 011...
- 011. Wait.

648
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,580
That's a lot of numbers.
No. I got it.

649
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:46,785
- It's him.
- The chicken man.

650
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:48,234
Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.

651
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:50,888
That's the kidnapper,
all right.

652
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:54,455
A kidnapper!
An agent of Zurg if l ever saw one.

653
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:05,342
And the piéce de résistance!

654
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,339
I promise the collection will be
the crown jewel of your museum.

655
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,886
- It's Woody!
- Now that I have your attention,

656
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,058
imagine we added
another zero to the price, huh?

657
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:18,783
- I'll pay anything you want.
- Yes! Yes!

658
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:21,623
You got a deal!
I'll be on the next flight to Japan!

659
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,805
Quick.
Into the poultry man's cargo unit.

660
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:27,121
He'll lead us to Zurg.
Move, move, move!

661
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:29,942
Don't touch my moustache!

662
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,896
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

663
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,464
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

664
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,320
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

665
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:08,046
- He didn't take the bag!
- No time to lose!

666
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,770
He's ascending
in the vertical transporter.

667
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,980
All right, everyone. Hang on.
We're gonna blast through the roof.

668
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:27,017
- Buzz?
- To infinity and beyond!

669
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,366
What are you? Insane? We're
wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.

670
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:36,879
I don't understand.

671
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:39,494
Somehow my fuel cells
have gone dry.

672
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:59,151
Blast. He's on level 23.

673
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:01,533
How are we gonna get up there?

674
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,025
Maybe if we find some balloons,
we could float to the top.

675
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,761
Are you kidding?
Il say we stack ourselves up,

676
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,327
push the intercom
and pretend we're delivering a pizza.

677
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:12,593
How about a ham sandwich...
with fries and a hot dog?

678
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:13,933
What about me?

679
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:15,651
You can be the toy
that comes with the meal.

680
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:18,455
Troops! Over here.

681
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:25,336
Just like you said, lizard man.
"In the shadows to the left."

682
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,682
OK. Let's move!

683
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,139
Mission log. Have infiltrated
enemy territory without detection

684
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,986
and are making our way
through the bowels of Zurg's fortress.

685
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:38,489
You know, I think that Buzz aisle
went to his head.

686
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,511
Oh, no.
Which way do we go?

687
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,769
- This way!
- What makes you so sure?

688
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:47,164
I'm Buzz Lightyear.
I'm always sure.

689
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,575
We've been detected. The walls!
They're closing in! Quick!

690
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:53,111
Help me prop up vegetable man,
or we're done for.

691
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,250
Hey! Put me down, you moron!

692
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,122
Guys, look! It's not the walls!
It's the elevator!

693
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:08,551
Come on. We've got no time to lose.
Everyone, grab hold!

694
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,816
What?

695
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,734
Buzz, why not
just take the elevator?

696
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,467
They'll be expecting that.

697
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:32,497
Hey, Buzz! Stop!

698
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:35,366
Slow down!

699
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:38,272
To overnight six packages
to Japan is how much?

700
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,142
- What? That's in yen, right?
- No, dollars, sir.

701
00:58:41,485 --> 00:58:42,715
- Dollars?
- Yes.

702
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:46,553
You are deliberately taking advantage
of people in a hurry, you know that?

703
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:49,754
All right.
I'll do it! All right. Fine.

704
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,033
I'll have the stuff in the lobby,
and you'd better be here in 15 minutes,

705
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:55,747
because I have a plane
to catch, do you hear me?

706
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,479
We're finally going.
Can you believe it?

707
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,502
That's custom-fitted foam insulation
you'll be riding in, Bullseye.

708
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,936
First class all the way!

709
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,558
You know what?
I'm actually excited about this.

710
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:13,862
l mean it.
I really am!

711
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:15,444
And why shouldn't you be?

712
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,797
Swing your partner do-si-do

713
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:22,991
- Look at you, dancing cowboy!
- Look! I'm doin’ the box step!

714
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,696
Hey, heads up down there!

715
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:40,419
- Pork bellies are fallin’.
- Hey, how much farther, Buzz?

716
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:43,721
Halfway there.

717
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:47,051
My arms can't hold on much longer!

718
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,511
Too... heavy.

719
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,470
What was I thinking?

720
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,279
My antigravity servos!

721
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:01,828
Hang tight, everyone.
I'm going to let go of the wall.

722
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,705
- What?
- He wouldn't.

723
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,577
- One...
- He would.

724
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,799
Two...

725
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,370
Three!

726
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:16,719
To infinity and beyond!

727
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,904
Approaching destination.
Reengaging gravity.

728
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:32,596
Area secure.

729
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:33,866
It's OK, troops.

730
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:38,424
The antigravity sickness will wear off
momentarily. Now let's move!

731
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,971
Remind me to glue his helmet shut
when we get back.

732
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:53,661
How ‘bout givin' me
a little intro there, Jessie?

733
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,894
Introducing the high-ridin'-est
cowboy around...

734
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,433
You forgot "rootin'-tootin'-est"!

735
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:03,192
The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est
cowboy hero of all time,

736
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,570
Sheriff Woody!

737
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:17,768
Say, little missy, you notice
any trouble around these parts?

738
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:20,798
Nary a bit,
not with Sheriff Woody around.

739
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:22,994
Wait-wait-wait! got it!
This is great! OK!

740
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,453
The bandits got the critters tied up
in the burning barn. Now the best part!

741
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,685
Help us!
The barn's on fire!

742
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,128
I've got ya, critters.
No need to worry.

743
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,327
Woody saves the day again!

744
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:35,466
Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye?

745
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:38,266
I have to ride off
into the sunset...

746
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:41,761
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

747
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,639
Watch it. Wait.
I'm ticklish, OK?

748
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,615
Oh, you are?

749
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,837
No, no, no. Cut it out.
Stop it. Stop it.

750
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,906
No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop!

751
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,328
Mission log. Have reached
Zurg's command deck,

752
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,064
but no sign of him
or his wooden captive.

753
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,513
- Please, no!
- That's Woody!

754
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:15,002
This way!

755
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,197
Please, please, no!

756
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,402
Buzz, can you see?
What's going on?

757
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:25,907
- Take that!
- To the left.

758
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,613
No, your left.

759
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,687
- Take it up higher.
- What's happening?

760
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:32,703
It's horrible.
They're torturing him.

761
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:36,049
- What are we gonna do, Buzz?
- Use your head!

762
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,919
But I don't wanna use my head!

763
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,174
What's going on here?

764
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:48,433
Buzz, guys!
Hey, how did you find me?

765
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,754
Watch yourself!

766
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,336
We're here to spring ya, Woody!

767
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,411
You heard of kung fu?

768
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:55,167
Well, get ready for pork chop.

769
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:59,948
Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!

770
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:03,427
Hold it, now! Hey, you don't understand!
These are my friends!

771
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,660
- Yeah, we're his friends!
- No, Rex, mean they're my friends!

772
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,140
Hey, stop it!
You leave him alone, springy dog!

773
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:13,001
- Grab Woody, and let's go!
- Fellas, hold it!

774
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:15,493
- Buzz, put me down!
- Quick! To the vent!

775
01:03:15,859 --> 01:03:18,259
- They're stealing him!
- No!

776
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:20,659
Hold it right there!

777
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:22,567
- Buzz?
- You again?

778
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,009
Woody! Thank goodness
you're all right.

779
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:25,524
Buzz, what is going on?

780
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:28,928
Hold on. lam Buzz Lightyear,
and I'm in charge of this detachment.

781
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:30,669
No, I'm Buzz Lightyear.

782
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,047
- I'm Buzz Lightyear!
- I'm Buzz Lightyear!

783
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,115
So, who's the real Buzz?

784
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,346
- lam!
- lam!

785
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:36,835
Don't let this impostor fool you!

786
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,150
He's been trained by Zurg himself
to mimic my every move.

787
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:48,327
Buzz!

788
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:49,815
l had a feelin’ it was you.

789
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,520
My front end just had
to catch up with my back end.

790
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:56,084
Will somebody please
explain what's going on?

791
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:59,156
It's all right, space ranger.
It's a code 546.

792
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:01,916
- You mean it's a...
- Yes.

793
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,479
- And he's a...
- Oh, yeah.

794
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:08,326
Your Majesty.

795
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,548
Woody, you're in danger here.
We need to leave now.

796
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,100
Al's selling you toa museum
in Japan!

797
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:17,173
I know. It's OK, Buzz.
l actually wanna go.

798
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:19,183
- What?
- Are you crazy?

799
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:22,006
Look, the thing is,
I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll,

800
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,945
and these guys
are my Roundup gang.

801
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,022
- What are you talking about?
- Woody's Roundup!

802
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:31,625
It's this great old TV show,
and I was the star. See? Now look.

803
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:34,185
Look! Look at me!
See? That's me!

804
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,607
- This is weirdin' me out.
- Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.

805
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:41,038
There was all this merchandise that
got packed up. You should have seen it.

806
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,094
There was a record player and a yo-yo.
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

807
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:47,234
- "Was"?
- Stop this nonsense and let's go.

808
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:48,794
Buzz.

809
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,980
I can't go.
I can't abandon these guys.

810
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,477
They need me
to get into this museum.

811
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,080
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!

812
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:04,110
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.

813
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,886
You are a toy!

814
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:10,400
For how much longer?
One more rip, and Andy's done with me.

815
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,020
And what do I do then, Buzz?
Huh? You tell me.

816
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:16,336
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me

817
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:19,503
that life's only worth living
if you're bein’ loved by a kid.

818
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:23,019
And I traveled all this way
to rescue that toy

819
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,250
because I believed him.

820
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:28,773
Well, you wasted your time.

821
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:36,744
- Let's go, everyone.
- What about Woody?

822
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:40,194
He's not coming with us.

823
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:44,381
But... But Andy's coming home tonight.

824
01:05:44,841 --> 01:05:47,361
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.

825
01:05:57,387 --> 01:06:00,787
I don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.

826
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:05,574
To do what, Woody? Watch kids from
behind glass and never be loved again?

827
01:06:06,229 --> 01:06:07,928
Some life.

828
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,992
- ls everybody OK?
- Sheriff Woody!

829
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,411
- 1 knew you'd make it!
- Now, remember, deputies,

830
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:21,312
the real treasures are
your friends and family.

831
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,841
Before I go, kids, 1 want to share
somethin’ special with you,

832
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,688
- for the times I'm not around.
- Good going, Woody!

833
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:29,484
I thought they'd never leave.

834
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:31,836
You've got a friend in me

835
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,298
You've got a friend in me

836
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:37,959
- Woody?
- You've got troubles

837
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:40,750
Well, I've got ‘em too

838
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,704
There isn't anything
! wouldn't do for you

839
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:47,818
We stick together
and see it through

840
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:51,138
‘Cause you've got a friend in me

841
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:56,606
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than 1am

842
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,283
Bigger and stronger too

843
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:01,229
Maybe

844
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,708
But none of them will ever love you

845
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,831
The way I do

846
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,463
It's me and you, boy

847
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,288
And as the years go by

848
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:17,257
Our friendship will never die

849
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:21,241
- What am I doing?
- You're gonna see it's our destiny

850
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,461
- Buzz! Wait! Wait!
- Woody, where are you going?

851
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:27,928
You're right, Prospector.
I can't stop Andy from growing up.

852
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,461
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.

853
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,683
- No!
- Buzz!

854
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:34,416
- Yes?
- Yes?

855
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:35,914
I'm coming with you!

856
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,962
Wait... wait... wait.
I'll be back in just a second.

857
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:41,092
Way to go, cowboy!

858
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:41,490
- Hey, you guys... Come with me.
- What?

859
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:44,621
- Hey, you guys... Come with me.
- What?

860
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:47,028
Andy will play with all of us.
I know it!

861
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,203
Woody, I... 1...
I don't know. I...

862
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:52,752
Wouldn't you give anything
just to have one more day with Emily?

863
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:57,109
Come on, Jessie. This is what it's
all about: to make a child happy.

864
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:00,457
And you know it.
Bullseye, are you with me?

865
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:03,578
OK, good boy.

866
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,610
Prospector, how ‘bout you?

867
01:08:09,886 --> 01:08:12,256
- Prospector?
- You're outta your box!

868
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,879
I tried reasoning with you, Woody,

869
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:19,415
but you keep forcing me
to take extreme measures.

870
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,437
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV
last night, not Jessie.

871
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,064
Look, we have an eternity
to spend together in the museum.

872
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,970
Let's not start off
by pointing fingers, shall we?

873
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:33,273
You really are Stinky Pete,
aren't you?

874
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,839
Prospector, this isn't fair.

875
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:38,148
"Fair"? I'll tell you what's not fair.

876
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,510
Spending a lifetime on a dime-store
shelf watching every other toy be sold.

877
01:08:44,252 --> 01:08:46,212
Well, finally my waiting
has paid off,

878
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:50,975
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll
is gonna mess it up for me now!

879
01:08:53,261 --> 01:08:55,602
Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!

880
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:59,599
It's too late, Woody. That silly
Buzz Lightweight can't help you.

881
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,129
His name is Buzz Lightyear.

882
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:06,221
Whatever. I've always hated
those upstart space toys.

883
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,919
It's stuck! What do we do?

884
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,358
Should I use my head?

885
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:13,919
It's Al!

886
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,564
Look at the time.
I'm gonna be late!

887
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:20,854
Figures. I can't miss this flight!
I've gotta pack.

888
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:23,149
All right. Let's see.
Wallet, keys, tickets,

889
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,043
passport, beef jerky,
very expensive over there.

890
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,832
Shower!
Il can skip the shower.

891
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:32,662
I just gotta get outta here now!

892
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:33,268
Quick! To the elevator!

893
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:35,489
Quick! To the elevator!

894
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:42,743
Hurry. Il can hear it coming.

895
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:50,397
So, we meet again,
Buzz Lightyear,

896
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,250
for the last time.

897
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:55,892
It's Zurg! Watch out!
He's got an ion blaster!

898
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:12,776
Quick! Get on!

899
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,788
The emergency hatch!
Come on!

900
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:41,737
- Come on! Hurry!
- But Buzz is in peril!

901
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,947
Buzz.., Buzz...
Buzz.., Lightyear to the rescue!

902
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:58,451
Surrender, Buzz Lightyear.
l have won.

903
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,538
I'll never give in.
You killed my father!

904
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:05,558
No, Buzz.
lam your father.

905
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,304
Come on! Come on! Come on!

906
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:20,303
Buzz, you could have
defeated Zurg all along!

907
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,423
You just need to believe in yourself!

908
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,946
- Prepare to die!
- L can't look!

909
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:38,782
I did it.
I finally defeated Zurg!

910
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:40,832
Father.

911
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:50,195
Finally!

912
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:16,848
How are we gonna get him now?

913
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:19,661
Pizza, anyone?

914
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:22,904
- Go, go, go!
- [got it!

915
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:24,169
Buzz, are you coming?

916
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:27,913
No, I have a lot of
catching up to do with my dad.

917
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:32,952
Good throw, son.
That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!

918
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:36,915
- You're a great dad.
- Farewell.

919
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,036
Does anyone know how to drive?

920
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:41,342
Slink, take the pedals.
Rex, you navigate.

921
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,274
Hamm and Potato,
operate the levers and knobs.

922
01:12:49,332 --> 01:12:50,882
- Strangers.
- From the outside.

923
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:53,947
- Oh, no.
- He's at a red light! We can catch him!

924
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,573
Maximum power, Slink!

925
01:12:57,907 --> 01:12:59,987
It turned green! Hurry!

926
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:02,683
- Why won't it go?
- Use the Wand of Power.

927
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:13,082
- Rex, which way?
- Left! No, no! l mean right!

928
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,186
That's right! No, mean left!
Left is right!

929
01:13:16,626 --> 01:13:21,046
Buzz, he's turning left!
He's turning left!

930
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,460
Oh, boy!

931
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,288
I seriously doubt
he's gettin’ this kind of mileage.

932
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:31,101
Go right! To the right!
Right-right-right-right!

933
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:38,188
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

934
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:39,891
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

935
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:51,631
The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading...

936
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,212
No parking.

937
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,850
Guys, we can't park here!
It's a white zone!

938
01:14:00,236 --> 01:14:02,866
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

939
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:04,976
- Final boarding call...
- There he is!

940
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,584
. for Far East Airlines
flight 451 to Tokyo.

941
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:11,607
All confirmed passengers
must board at this time.

942
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:16,521
Passenger Twitch,
passenger Leon Twitch, please pick up...

943
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,616
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

944
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:22,212
- Will you leave me alone?
- Someone's coming!

945
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,931
- A puppy!
- Bark-bark-bark-bark.

946
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:27,518
Bark-bark-bark-bark-bark.

947
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:28,767
Listen, flyboy.

948
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,545
The contents of that case are
worth more than you make in a year!

949
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,077
- You got that? You be careful!
- l understand, sir.

950
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:36,517
Do you have a "fragile" sticker
or something?

951
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:39,012
l had a box of cookies once
that came back as crumbs!

952
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:42,460
The Mystic Portal!

953
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:46,788
Once we go through,
we just need to find that case.

954
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:03,721
- There's the case!
- No, there's the case!

955
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:07,093
You take that one!
We'll take this one!

956
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,553
Buzz, my back end's
goin' to Baton Rouge!

957
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:26,227
Slinky!

958
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:31,380
Here we come, Woody!
Woody, here we come! Woody!

959
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:33,805
Nice flash though.

960
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,697
OK, Woody, let's go!

961
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:52,236
Take that, space toy.

962
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:54,855
Hey! No one does that
to my friend!

963
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,407
Your choice, Woody.

964
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:06,186
You can go to Japan
together or in pieces.

965
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:09,615
If he fixed ya once,
he can fix ya again. Now get in the box!

966
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,269
- Never!
- Fine!

967
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:20,491
- No!
- Gotcha!

968
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,980
Idiots!
Children destroy toys!

969
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,425
You'll all be ruined, forgotten!

970
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:28,271
Spending eternity
rotting in some landfill!

971
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:33,254
Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you
learned the true meaning of playtime.

972
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:37,706
- Right over there, guys!
- No. No! No!

973
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:42,483
Atlantic Air flight 810
from Point Richmond

974
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:44,831
now arriving at Gate 3.

975
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:48,704
Look, Barbie.
A big ugly man doll.

976
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,760
He needs a makeover.

977
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:55,928
Hi! You'll like Amy.

978
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:58,632
She's an artist!

979
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,867
Come on, hon!

980
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:06,937
Happy trails, Prospector.

981
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:09,006
- Buzz! Woody!
- Help us out here!

982
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:10,952
Hurry!

983
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,090
- Oh, no. Jessie! Come on!
- Woody!

984
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:25,512
Jessie!

985
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:27,981
Come on, Buzz.

986
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,454
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

987
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:42,560
Hey-howdy-hey!
Giddyap!

988
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,788
Come on, Bullseye!

989
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,900
Buzz, give me a boost!

990
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,255
Woody!

991
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:35,339
Here's the rest!

992
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:59,405
Excuse me, ma'am, but believe
you're on the wrong flight.

993
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:01,648
- Woody!
- Come on, Jess.

994
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:03,521
It's time to take you home.

995
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:06,646
- But what if Andy doesn't like me?
- Nonsense! Andy'll love you!

996
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:09,979
- Besides, he's got a little sister.
- He does?

997
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:12,876
Why didn't you say so?
Let's go!

998
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:19,935
Hold it! There's a couple more bags
coming from the terminal!

999
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:22,156
OK. On three.

1000
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,478
- One, two...
- Too late!

1001
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:26,937
Put 'em on the next flight!

1002
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:36,073
- This is bad.
- How are we gonna get outta here?

1003
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,920
Over there! Come on!

1004
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,721
- You sure about this?
- No! Let's go!

1005
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:18,652
Hold on, Woody!

1006
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,656
- What's a cowboy without his hat?
- Buzz!

1007
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:42,749
Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tires!

1008
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:50,664
Jessie, let go of the plane!

1009
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,213
What? Are you crazy?

1010
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:55,168
Just pretend it's
the final episode of Woody's Roundup.

1011
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:58,687
But it was canceled!
We never saw if you made it!

1012
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,968
Well, then, let's find out together!

1013
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:17,908
We did it! We did it! We did it!

1014
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:19,583
Nice ropin', cowboy.

1015
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:22,331
That was definitely
Woody's finest hour!

1016
01:21:22,745 --> 01:21:25,205
Your hat, partner.

1017
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,423
Let's... go home.

1018
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:51,480
Hey, Woody! Woody?

1019
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:59,513
Wow! New toys!

1020
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,688
Cool! Thanks, Mom!

1021
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:06,468
It's Bazooka Jane
and her jet-propelled horse!

1022
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:09,955
Woody, Buzz, that polecat Zurg
has stolen my space cows

1023
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,946
and they're headed
for the asteroid!

1024
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,715
Andy, come on, hon.
Time to go.

1025
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,504
- Hey, you fixed Woody!
- Yeah.

1026
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:28,367
Glad I decided not to take him to camp.
His whole arm might have come off.

1027
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,496
Well, what do you know?

1028
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:42,641
Bullseye, we're part
of a family again!

1029
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,849
Ma'am, I...

1030
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:52,102
l wanted to say
you're a bright young woman

1031
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,044
with a beautiful "yarnful" of hair.

1032
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,858
"Hairful" of yarn. It's...

1033
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:58,262
I must go.

1034
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:02,604
Well, aren't you
the sweetest space toy I ever met?

1035
01:23:04,847 --> 01:23:06,717
What's that? Bark-bark?

1036
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:10,009
This fella says he needs to go out
for a little private time.

1037
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,626
That critter needs help!

1038
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:25,978
Rex, I could use a hand
over here, buddy.

1039
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:28,821
I don't need to play.
I've lived it!

1040
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,471
Oh, nuts!

1041
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:33,673
Welcome to Al's Toy Barn.

1042
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,529
We've got the lowest prices in town.

1043
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:40,785
Everything for a buck-buck-buck.

1044
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:44,373
Well, l guess crime doesn't pay.

1045
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,753
Andy did a great job, huh?
Nice and strong!

1046
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:50,773
I like it.
Makes you look... tough.

1047
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:56,102
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

1048
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:59,865
You saved their lives?
My hero!

1049
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:03,442
And they're so adorable!
Let's adopt them!

1050
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:05,049
Daddy!

1051
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:06,444
Oh, no.

1052
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:09,763
Wheezy, you're fixed!

1053
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,952
Oh, yeah. Mr. Shark looked in the toy
box and found me an extra squeaker.

1054
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,390
- And... how do you feel?
- l feel swell.

1055
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:21,723
In fact, I think I feel
a song comin’ on.

1056
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:27,277
You've got a friend in me

1057
01:24:28,764 --> 01:24:32,104
You've got a friend in me

1058
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:35,034
You just remember
what your old pal said

1059
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:38,537
Babe, you've got a friend in me

1060
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:41,561
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1061
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:44,997
Come on over.
You are such a big girl.

1062
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,349
Andy, you think she's ready
to drive the car yet?

1063
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:49,323
Yeah, and I can teach her.

1064
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:52,168
- You still worried?
- About Andy?

1065
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:56,367
- No, it'll be fun while it lasts.
- I'm proud of you, cowboy.

1066
01:24:56,959 --> 01:25:01,438
Besides, when it all ends, I'll have
old Buzz Lightyear to keep me company...

1067
01:25:02,164 --> 01:25:04,130
..for infinity and beyond.

1068
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:05,272
..for infinity and beyond.

1069
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:09,040
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1070
01:25:11,073 --> 01:25:11,938
- You've got a friend in me
- Yes, you do

1071
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,110
- You've got a friend in me
- Yes, you do

1072
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:17,606
- You've got a friend in me
- That's the truth

1073
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,833
You've got a friend

1074
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:24,485
In me

1075
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:27,036
In me

1076
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:28,506
Yeah!
