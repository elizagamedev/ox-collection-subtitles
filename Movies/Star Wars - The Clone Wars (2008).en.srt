Striking swiftly
after the Battle of Geonosis,

10
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,559
Count Dooku's droid army has seized
control of the major hyperspace lanes,

11
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,513
separating the Republic
from the majority of its clone army.

12
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,711
With few clones available,

13
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,613
the Jedi generals cannot gain
a foothold in the Outer Rim

14
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:12,832
as more and more planets choose
to join Deoku's Separatists.

15

While the Jedi are occupied fighting a war,
no one is left to keep the peace.

Chaos and crime spread,

and the innocent become victims
ina lawless galaxy.

18
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:30,296
Crime lord Jabba the Hutt's son has
been kidnapped by a rival band of pirates.

19
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,835
Desperate to save his son,
Jabba puts out a call for help.

A call the Jedi are cautious te answer.

21
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,874
Jabba requests that anyone whe can
help us find his kidnapped son

22
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,188
send any information
they have immediately.

23
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:51,211
We must help Jabba. This is
the opportunity we've been looking for.

24
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,955
The Jedi must rescue Jabba's son.

25
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,881
I don't like it,
dealing with that criminal scum.

26

This is a dark day for the Republic.

l agree, my friend,
but what choice do we have?

28
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,835
The Hutts control the Outer Rim,

29
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,387
and we'll need their space lanes
in order to move our troops.

30
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,221
There is more to this kidnapping
than it seems.

31
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,492
Then you must send
as many Jedi as you can.

32
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,565
Impossible, Chancellor.

The only Jedi we can spare
are Skywalker and Kenobi.

They just captured
the planet Christophsis.

36
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,666
Then contact them immediately.

37
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,134
We need to make contact
with General Kenobi.

38

We've been unable to reach him.
It could be a solar storm,

39

or they're rebooting
their communication system.

40
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,979
I'm sure the blackout is temporary.

A messenger, we are sending,
with important orders for General Kenobi.

42
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,365
See to it that she gets there
as fast as possible.

43

Yes, sir.
As soon as we load relief supplies.

No time, there is.
Immediately, the messenger must ga.

an unloaded ship to drop her off,

75
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,837

and set up our deflector shields.

to get our reinforcements.

Then it looks like our problems are solved.
Fresh troops, new supplies,

85

my new Padawan with them.

You really think it's a good idea
to bring a Padawan learner into all this?

I'm at your service, Master Kenobi,

to Master Skywalker.

What? No, no, no.

129
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:54,121
There must be some mistake.
He's the one who wanted the Padawan.

No, Master Yoda was very specific.

you're old enough to be a Padawan.

Well, maybe I'm not,
but Master Yoda thinks I am.

Well, you're not with Master Yoda now.

you better start proving it.

-Padawan.

Have you thought about
moving that line back, Captain?

160
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,707
They'd have better cover that way.

161
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,312
Thanks for the suggestion,

162
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,719
but General Skywalker thinks
they're fine where they are.

163
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,866
So, if you're a captain and I'm a Jedi,

164
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,298
then, technically, l outrank you, right?

165
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,981
In my book, experience
outranks everything.

166
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:15,548
Well, if experience outranks everything,
I guess I better start getting some.

167
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,606
What's that?

168
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,270
Not good. They've got an energy shield.

That's gonna make things
damn near impossible.

170
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,012
If you wanted experience, little one,

171
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,401
it looks like you're about to get plenty.

172
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:49,505
(GRUNTS)

173
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,004
What is it?

174
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:56,844
The clones are pulling back,

175
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,896
and the lead tanks are now
approaching the city center.

176
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,196
Get to those heavy cannons
as quickly as you can!

177
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,728
The shield generator is
somewhere in this area.

178
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,674
They're slowly increasing the diameter,
and keeping it just ahead of their troops.

179
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,085
Heavy cannons
are gonna be useless against that.

180
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,464
As they get closer, suppose we could
try to draw them into the buildings.

181
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,881
That might level the playing field a bit.

182
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,853
If that shield's gonna be such a problem,
why don't we just take it out?

183
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:39,487
-Easier said than done.
-Well, I, for one, agree with her.

184
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:43,183
Someone has to get to that
shield generator and destroy it.

185
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,685
That's the key.

186
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,920
Right, then. Maybe you two
can tiptoe through the enemy lines

187
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,274
and solve
this particular problem together.

188
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,217
-Can do, Master Kenobi.
-I'll decide what we do.

189
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,650
If Rex and I can engage them here,

190
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,378
you two might have a chance to get
through their lines undetected, here.

191
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,636
They won't have much time.
The droids far outnumber us,

192
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,306
so our ability to street fight is limited
without the use of heavy cannons.

193
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,693
They will march forward under
the protection of their shield

194
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,265
until they are right on top of our cannons,
then they'll blow them away.

195
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,365
We'll figure out a way.
Come on, Master, let's go.

196
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,432
If we survive this, Snips,
you and I are gonna have a talk.

197
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:24,053
They make quite a pair, don't they, sir?
You think they have a chance?

198
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,567
They better.

199
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,235
If they can't turn off that shield generator
before it reaches the heavy cannons,

200
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,619
there'll be no escape for any of us.

201
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,965
What's the status?

202
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,750
It looks like those bounty hunters
went up there.

203
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,466
Contact General Windu.
Tell him we found the Hutt.

204
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:45,684
Yes, Commander?

205
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,314
REX: We've discovered that Jabba the Hutt

206
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,016
has alse hired bounty hunters
to track down his son,

207
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,443
and we followed them to
a monastery on planet Teth.

208
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,649
We feel it's where
Jabba's son is being held,

209
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,447
but it's too heavily fortified for us
to do anything alone, sir.

210
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,607
Commander, stay out of sight
and await further orders.

211
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,394
Will do, General.

212
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,926
Unusual, it is, a problem Obi-Wan
has, subduing the droid army.

213
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:08,977
I'll take care of it.

214
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,472
Get me Admiral Wurtz.
I need three of his star cruisers.

215
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:13,949
Yes, General.

216
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,790
Greater than we think,
this mystery may be.

217
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,216
Go with the fleet
to aid Master Kenobi, I will.

218
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,766
So, what's the plan?

219
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,769
(SCOFFS) I thought
you were the one with the plan.

220
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,185
No, I'm the one with enthusiasm.

221
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,141
You're the one with the experience, which
I'm looking forward to learning from.

222
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,022
Well, first, we need to get behind
that shield, then get past their tank lines.

223
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,708
Why don't we just go around?
Outflank them?

224
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,907
-That'd take too long.
-Sneak through the middle, then?

225
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,487
Impossible.
Unless you can turn yourself into a droid.

226
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,510
All right. You win.

227
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,919
My first lesson will be to wait
while you come up with the answer.

228
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,662
Well, the wait's over. I've got a plan.

229
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,739
That shield is certainly putting
a crimp in my day.

230
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,416
It's no use, sir! Even at full power
the cannon doesn't affect it.

231
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,706
All right, Rex. It was worth a try.
Tell the men to fall back!

232
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,393
This is a stupid plan!

233
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,844
We should fight these guys,
instead of just sneaking around.

234
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,135
Except for the fact that their deflective
energy shield just passed over us.

235
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,261
If you can't cross their lines,
let their lines cross you.

236
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,074
If you say so.

237
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:15,177
We're inside the shield.
Just stay away from those tanks.

238
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,620
A Jedi?

239
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,577
-Where's the General?
-CLONE: I don't know, sir!

240
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,600
Fall back!

241
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:55,117
I think we made it past all of them,
Master. We may pull this off yet.

242
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,985
We still have a ways to go before
we get to the generator station.

243
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,121
Do we still need this thing?

244
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,234
I can't take it anymore.
I have to stand up.

245
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,733
You have got to be careful!

246
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,038
You never know
what you're gonna run into.

247
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,161
See what I mean?

248
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,792
-We can't beat its shield.
-Run!

249
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,708
-What? Jedi don't run!
-Il said, run!

250
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,240
-Ahsoka, stop!
-Make up your mind!

251
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,432
I said, stop!

252
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,453
Good. You take direction well.

253
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,675
They're right behind us, sir!
They wiped out most of my unit.

254
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,161
We had to pull out of there.

255
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,243
(EXPLOSION)

256
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,487
The shield has almost reached
the heavy cannons.

257
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,710
We're not gonna be able to stop them, sir.

258
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,832
Move your troops back
to the heavy cannons.

259
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,971
Do everything you can to protect them.
I'll delay the droids.

260
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,890
-But...
-That is an order, Captain!

262

You must be
the infamous General Kenobi.

264
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,759
I surrender.

265
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,793
Now, Master Kenobi,
order your troops to stand down.

266
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,069
General, have a seat.

267
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,609
Have you gone mad?

268
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,534
I've conceded the battle.

269
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,569
Now we simply have to
negotiate the terms of surrender.

270
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,020
Don't try any of your tricks, Jedi.

271
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,419
Surely there's no reason
we can't be civilized about this.

272
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,774
‘Tis a rare honor to be able to meet
one's opponent face-to-face.

throughout the Inner Core.

274
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:43,179
Thank you. The honor is all mine.
I'm so glad you decided to surrender.

275
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,342
Well, at some point, one must accept
the reality of the situation.

(CLEARS THROAT)

277
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,257
Might we have some refreshments?

278
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,358
You! Bring us something liquid.

279
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,696
Thank you. This shouldn't take long.

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,610
We are approaching Christophsis, sir.

281
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,938
The Separatist blockade
is holding position.

282
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,444
Deploy the fleet.
Have the cruisers protect the transports.

283
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,078
Yes, sir.

284
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,884
Admiral, hurry, we must,
if we are to aid General Kenobi.

285
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,415
It will not be easy to breach the blockade,
Master Yoda.

286

It's what stopped our relief ships before.

287
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,730
Last time, not as many ships did you have.

288
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,400
Get past it, we must.
Get past it, we will.

289
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,876

let that shield reach the cannons.

taken custody of my troops,

for their food and shelter.

would be knocked out by now.

-Yes.

to have happened to your shield, General.

General Kenobi, if you can hear me,
we're through the blockade.

328
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,827
The Separatist armada is in retreat.

329
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:00,203

should be landing in a moment.

Your timing is perfect, Master Yoda.

331
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,456
You're reckless, little one.

332

You never would have made it
as Obi-Wan's Padawan.

333

Well, I don't like this.
Can I just take care of them?

506
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,868
Oh, well, if you feel so strongly
about it, go ahead.

508
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,743
Not bad. You remembered to
destroy their weapons first.

509
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,866
I'm improving your technique.

510
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,450
-Of course, you did miss one.
-I did that on purpose.

511
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,490
-l sense our kidnapped Hutt is in here.
-(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) I smell him, too.

He's a lot younger than I thought he'd be.

514
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,296
Oh, he's just a baby.

515
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,845
This will make our job a lot easier.
Oh, he's so cute.

516
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,233
Just wait until you see
what he'll grow into.

520
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:04,516
O great Jabba the Hutt,
I have news of your son.

521
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,509
I have discovered it is the Jedi
who have kidnapped him.

522

(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

523
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,304
How have you come by this information?

524
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:21,850
I have my ways. More importantly,
mighty Jabba, I bring a warning.

525
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,859
The Jedi are planning to destroy you.

526
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:32,264
The most wise Jabba demands proof.

527
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,567
And he shall have it.

528
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,696
-No sign of any more droids, Captain.
-All right, Sergeant.

529
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:44,702
General Skywalker, the castle is secure,
and it's nearly midday.

530
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:48,643
Thanks, Rex. We've got Jabba's son.
Any sign of General Kenobi yet?

531
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:50,136
Wo, sir.

532
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:54,678
Master, my Jedi training didn't prepare me
for this. What are we gonna do?

533
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:59,266
Well, since you think that smelly larva
is cute, you're gonna carry it.

535
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,506

to get underway.

-We need to reinforce Anakin.
-Right away, sir.

537
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,589
How do you like your little buddy now?
Still cute?

538
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,848
You know, he's reminding me
of you more and more.

539
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,763
See? You're two of a kind.

540
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,288
Maybe you should carry both of us then.

Master, I think this little guy is sick.
He's burning up with a fever.

544
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:47,246
You're right. We've got to get him back
to the ship immediately.

545
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,995

VENTRESS: My lord,
I have the recording you requested.

549
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,422
Transmit it at once. Your new objective
is to recover the Hutt.

550
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,650
And deliver him to Jabba unharmed?

551
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,125
Precisely. Do not fail me.

As you can see, it is the Jedi who have
your son and are plotting against you.

(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

558

My droid army
has already initiated a rescue.

559

Rest assured, mighty Jabba,
your son will be saved.

560
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,106
Mighty Jabba wishes to know
what you ask in return.

561
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:03,974
Perhaps you would consider joining
our struggle against the Republic.

562
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:08,310
OBI-WAN. Anakin,
did you locate Jabba's son?

563
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,832
We have him, but it looks like
the Separatists are behind his abduction.

564
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,396
This smells like Count Dooku to me.

565
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,955
I think it's little Stinky you smell.

566
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:20,678
I'll bet Dooku is using us
to get Jabba to join the Separatists.

567
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:25,152
Master Kenobi, we have another problem.
This Huttlet is very sick.

568
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,876
I'm not sure we can get him back
to Tatooine alive, Master.

569
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,076
This whole rescue may backfire on us.

570
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,364
I still don't think dealing
with the Hutts is a good idea.

571
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:35,537
Anakin, you know they control
shipping routes in the Outer Rim.

572
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,220
Jabba's cooperation is crucial
to the war effort.

573
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:40,523
if you let anything happen te his son,

574
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:42,674
our chances ofa treaty
with him will disappear.

575
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,951

-Anakin?
-I'll have to call you back, Master.

578
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:56,231
We're under attack. We could use
a little help here if you have the time.

579
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,994
I'll get there as soon as can.
Protect the Hutt, Anakin.

themselves inside the main vault.

586

They have nowhere to run.

Kenobi arrives with reinforcements.

-What?
-Master,

589
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:10,736
do you honestly think
we can hold them off?

592
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,631
and that's what
we're going to do, Ahsoka.

593
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,334

back to Tatooine,

I can hold him, Master. I'm not tired.

Okay, suit yourself. 1 don't see why
you won't just listen to me.

That I'm not too young
to be your Padawan.

“Nothing happens by accident.”

It is the will of the Force
that you are at my side.

-No.

01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,160
You must dispense one of these
medical boosters into the infant's mouth.

845
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:46,375
if you have any problems,
please call an actual doctor to assist you.

846
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:49,394
I hope this works.

847
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:53,232
Okay, sweetums.
I've got some yum-yum for you.

848
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,310
You'll take this and like it!

851
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,547
Captain, I understand
General Skywalker escaped.

852
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,553
REX: Yes, sir.
On some beat-up old space freighter.

853
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,466
I'll be surprised if he even makes it
to Tatooine in that junker.

854
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:23,869

through hyperspace, he can.

he's gonna live to stink another day.

857
01:07:35,919 --> 01:07:38,908
Great. Keeping him alive wasn't as easy
as you'd hoped, was it?

858
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:41,509
Master, if you have taught me one thing,

859
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:43,728
it's that nothing is easy
when you are around.

860
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,611
You think Rex and Master Obi-Wan
made it out okay?

861
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:51,373
If 1 know my old master, he has things
well in hand. Now help me with this.

862
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:55,325
I want the primary systems fully repaired
by the time we reach Tatooine.

863
01:07:56,773 --> 01:08:00,903
You grew up on Tatooine, right?
So, for you, this trip is like going home.

864
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:02,933
Yeah.

865
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:04,602
Home.

clone troopers, my lord.

867
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,839
By the time we were able to find
Jabba's son, Skywalker had already

868
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,103
killed him.

I take it you at least defeated the Jedi?

873
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:36,090
No, Master. The Jedi escaped
and are headed to Tatooine.

874
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:41,063
I'm sure you did the best you could.
We will discuss your failure later.

875
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,048
Yes, my master.

(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

877

Glorious Jabba demands to know why
the Jedi would dare come to Tatooine.

878
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:58,417
To kill you, Jabba.
The Jedi plot is quite clear now.

879
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:02,498
They only promised to rescue your son
to win your trust.

880
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:06,709
Now Skywalker is coming here
to finish his true mission...

881
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:10,822
to wipe out the entire Hutt clan.

882
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,533
If it pleases you, mighty Jabba,

883
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:19,795
this time I will deal
with Skywalker personally.

884
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,716
I was hoping I'd never have to lay eyes
on this dust ball again.

885
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:35,515
Okay. What happened?

886
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,075
I don't want to talk about it.
How's Stinky holding up?

887
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:41,993
He seems to be feeling much better.

888
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:45,892
His fever is gone. Even you have to admit
he's cute when he's asleep.

889
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:49,679
l admit I like him better when he's quiet,
but only a little.

I want the cannon operational first.

Leave the rear deflector shields for later.

893
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,529
No rear shields, Master?
That's awful risky.

is the best offense.

with the Huttlet, Master,

945

but he’s still in grave danger.

946
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:44,782
Separatist troops
are desperate to intercept him.

947
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,704
think this whole plot
was engineered by Dooku

948
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:49,934
to convince Jabba we kidnapped his son.

949
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:54,396
If believe this, the Hutts do, ended will
our chance of a treaty with them be.

Join Dooku and the Separatists,
Jabba will, yes.

I'm afraid the Jedi's efforts
to strike a secret treaty with the Hutts

Jabba believes Anakin
has abducted his infant son.

967
01:14:57,093 --> 01:15:00,903
A Jedi would never do such a thing!
Perhaps I can get that treaty signed.

of the Senate, of course.

but far too dangerous.

Besides, we've attempted
to contact Jabba,

Jabba the Hutt has an uncle in the

this dispute and broker a treaty

1011
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,558

1012
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:33,702

A treaty is impossible.

1013
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:37,916
My nephew Jabba's son has been
kidnapped by your Republic Jedi scum.

1014
01:18:38,581 --> 01:18:40,921
But, sir, there's been a misunderstanding.

1015
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:43,497
There is no misunderstanding.

1016
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:47,703
It is the Jedi who have rescued his son.
If you can put me in touch with Jabba,

1017
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:50,720
lam confident
I can convince him of the truth.

1018
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,040
No! No more discussions.
Escort her out!

1019
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:59,384
Please, Ziro! Your nephew Jabba
is in danger. You're being deceived.

1020
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,772

He means your past can ruin your future
if you allow it.

1029

There is so much more we can talk about
out here. Like the sand.

It takes everything from you.

A senator from the Republic was here.

1035
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:38,721
What if she found out
I helped you kidnap Jabba's son?

1036
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:42,618
Don't worry, l have convinced Jabba
that the Jedi have murdered his son

1037
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:44,968
and are on their way to kill him.

1038
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,544
Jabba will slay the Jedi on sight!

1039
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:51,900
Then the mighty Jedi Order will be forced
to bring Jabba to justice,

1040
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:56,971
and you, my friend, will be left
to take control of all the Hutt clans.

1041
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:02,047
Then the plot against my nephew Jabba
has succeeded.

1042
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,670
But what about this meddling senator?

1043
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:07,234

extremely valuable to my Separatist allies.
