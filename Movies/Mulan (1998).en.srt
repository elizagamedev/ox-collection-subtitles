1
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,056
We're under attack!
Light the signal!

2
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,942
Now all of China knows you're here.

3
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,115
Perfect.

4
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,780
Your Majesty, the Huns
have crossed our northern border.

5
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,530
Impossible. No one
can get through the Great Wall.

6
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,891
Shan-Yu is leading them.

7
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,411
We'll set up defenses
around the palace.

8
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,394
No. Send your troops
to protect my people.

9
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,661
- Chi Fu.
- Yes, Your Highness?

10
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,984
Deliver conscription notices
throughout the provinces.

11
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,487
Call up reserves and
as many new recruits as possible.

12
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,601
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but I believe my troops can stop him.

13
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,255
l won't take
any chances, General.

14
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,101
Asingle grain of rice
can tip the scale.

15
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,144
One man may be the difference
between victory and defeat.

16
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,247
"Quiet and demure."

17
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,966
"Graceful. Polite. Delicate."

18
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,208
"Refined. Poised."

19
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,943
"Punctual."

20
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,845
Little Brother!

21
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,081
Little Brother.

22
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,111
There you are.

23
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,693
Who's the smartest doggy
in the world? Come on, smart boy.

24
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,207
Can you help me
with my chores today?

25
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,145
Honorable ancestors...

26
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:19,197
please help Mulan
impress the Matchmaker today.

27
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,168
Please.

28
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,131
Please help her.

29
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,950
- Father, I brought your...
- Mulan.

30
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,822
l brought a spare. The doctor said
three cups of tea in the morning...

31
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,873
- Mulan.
- And three at night.

32
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,872
Mulan, you should already be in town.
We are counting on you...

33
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,856
To uphold the family honor.

34
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,189
Don't worry, Father.
I won't let you down.

35
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,121
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

36
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,197
I'm going to pray some more.

37
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,958
Fa Li, is your daughter here yet?

38
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,274
The Matchmaker
is not a patient woman.

39
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:18,998
Of all days to be late! I should
have prayed to the ancestors for luck.

40
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,493
How lucky can they be?
They're dead.

41
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:26,386
Besides, I've got
all the luck we'll need.

42
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,357
This is your chance
to prove yourself.

43
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,530
Grandma, no!

44
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,103
Yep, this cricket's a lucky one!

45
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,014
I'm here.

46
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,670
What? But, Mama, I had to...

47
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,433
None of your excuses.
Now, let's get you cleaned up.

48
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,207
This is what you give me
To work with

49
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,438
Well, honey
I've seen worse

50
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,929
We're gonna turn
This sow's ear

51
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,042
- Into a silk purse
- It's freezing.

52
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,472
It would have been warm
if you were here on time.

53
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,472
We'll have you
washed and dried

54
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,229
Primped and polished
till you glow with pride

55
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,085
Trust my recipe
for instant bride

56
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,774
You'll bring honor
to us all

57
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,853
- Mulan, what's this?
- Notes.

58
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,970
In case I forget something.

59
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,109
Hold this. We'll need
more luck than I thought.

60
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,322
Wait and see
When we're through

61
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,114
Boys will gladly go to war for you

62
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,031
- With good fortune
- And a great hairdo

63
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,437
You'll bring honor to us all

64
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,548
A girl can bring her family

65
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,647
Great honor in one way

66
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,580
By striking a good match

67
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,213
And this could be the day

68
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,056
- Men want girls with good taste
- Calm.

69
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,440
- Obedient.
- Who work fast-paced

70
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,349
- With good breeding
- And a tiny waist

71
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,762
You'll bring honor to us all

72
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,052
We aif must serve our emperor

73
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,002
Who guards us from the Huns

74
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,815
A man by bearing arms

75
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,556
A girl by bearing sons

76
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,824
- When we're through you can't fail
- When we're through

77
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,750
- Like a lotus blossom, soft and pale
- You can't fail

78
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,680
- When we're through
- How could any fellow say no sale

79
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,676
- Soft and pale, how could any fellow
- Like a lotus blossom

80
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,878
- Tous all
- You'll bring honor to us all

81
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,110
There. You're ready.

82
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,715
Not yet. An apple for serenity.

83
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,492
A pendant for balance.

84
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,157
Beads of jade

85
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,918
For beauty

86
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,837
You must proudly

87
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,332
Show it

88
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,119
Now add a cricket

89
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,604
Just for luck

90
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,711
And even you can't blow it

91
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,154
Ancestors, hear my plea

92
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,034
Help me not to make a fool of me

93
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,837
And to not uproot my family tree

94
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,170
Keep my father standing talf

95
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,160
Scarier than the undertaker

96
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,010
We are meeting our Matchmaker

97
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,787
Destiny
Guard our girls

98
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,706
And our future as it fast unfurls

99
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,553
Please look kindly
On these cultured pearls

100
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,531
Each a perfect porcelain doll

101
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,616
Please bring honor to us

102
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,559
Please bring honor to us

103
00:08:55,969 --> 00:09:00,329
Please bring honor to us all

104
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,613
- "Fa Mulan."
- Present!

105
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,976
Speaking without permission.

106
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,262
Who spit in her bean curd?

107
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,253
Too skinny.

108
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,053
Not good for bearing sons.

109
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,750
Recite the final admonition.

110
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,995
Well?

111
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,902
Fulfil your duties
calmly and respectfully.

112
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,843
Reflect before you snack...

113
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,144
Act! This shall bring you
honor and glory.

114
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,752
This way.

115
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,949
Now, pour the tea.

116
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,435
To please your future in-laws,

117
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,348
you must demonstrate
a sense of dignity

118
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,406
and refinement.

119
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,042
You must also be poised.

120
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,194
- Pardon me.
- And silent!

121
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,728
Could I just take that back...
for a moment?

122
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,818
Why, you clumsy...

123
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,648
I think it's going well, don't you?

124
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:04,664
Put it out! Put it out!

125
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,951
You are a disgrace!

126
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,089
You may look like a bride...

127
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,692
but you will never
bring your family honor!

128
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,666
Look at me

129
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,238
! will never pass

130
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,641
For a perfect bride

131
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,854
Or a perfect daughter

132
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,122
Can it be

133
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:14,245
I'm not meant
To play this part?

134
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,338
Now I see

135
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:21,586
That if l were truly
To be myself

136
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:26,732
! would break
My family's heart

137
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:35,503
Who is that girl l see

138
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,332
Staring straight

139
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,745
Back at me?

140
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,757
Why is my reflection

141
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:50,521
Someone I don't know?

142
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:56,464
Somehow I cannot hide

143
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,263
Wholam

144
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,896
Though I've tried

145
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:06,825
When will my reflection show

146
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,510
Wholam

147
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,959
Inside

148
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:20,965
When will my reflection show

149
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,724
Wholam

150
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,970
Inside

151
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,369
My, my.

152
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:53,005
What beautiful blossoms
we have this year.

153
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,420
But, look, this one's late.

154
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,114
But I'll bet that when it blooms,

155
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:05,277
it will be
the most beautiful of all.

156
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,472
What is it?

157
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,092
Mulan, stay inside.

158
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,480
Citizens, I bring a proclamation
from the Imperial City.

159
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,954
The Huns have invaded China.

160
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,198
By order of the emperor,

161
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,890
one man from every family
must serve in the Imperial Army.

162
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,839
The Hsiao family.

163
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,196
The Yi family.

164
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,928
I will serve the emperor
in my father's place.

165
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,674
- The Fa family.
- No!

166
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,103
lam ready to serve the emperor.

167
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,266
- Father, you can't go.
- Mulan!

168
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,928
Please, sir, my father
has fought bravely...

169
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,873
Silence! You would do well
to teach your daughter

170
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,424
to hold her tongue
in a man's presence.

171
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,594
Mulan, you dishonor me.

172
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,207
Report tomorrow
to the Wu Zhong camp.

173
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,533
Yes, sir.

174
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,146
The Chu family!

175
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,790
The Wen family!

176
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,954
The Chang family!

177
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,451
You shouldn't have to go! There are
plenty of young men to fight for China.

178
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,685
It is an honor to protect
my country and my family.

179
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,930
So, you'll die for honor.

180
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,695
- [ will die doing what's right.
- But if you...

181
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,637
I know my place!
It is time you learned yours.

182
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,245
- Mulan is gone!
- What?

183
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,283
It can't be.

184
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,742
Mulan!

185
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,716
No.

186
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:05,047
You must go after her.
She could be killed.

187
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,821
If l reveal her...

188
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,290
she will be.

189
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,792
Ancestors, hear our prayer.

190
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,756
Watch over Mulan.

191
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:24,927
Watch over Mulan.

192
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,281
Mushu, awaken.

193
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,710
I live!

194
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,110
So tell me what mortal needs
my protection, Great Ancestor.

195
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,767
You just say the word and I'm there.

196
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,170
Anybody foolish enough
to threaten our family,

197
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,336
vengeance will be mine!

198
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,824
Mushu!
These are the family guardians.

199
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,572
- They...
- Protect the family.

200
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,329
And you, O Demoted One?

201
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,279
I... ring the gong.

202
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:30,589
That's right.
Now, wake up the ancestors.

203
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,533
One family reunion comin’ right up.

204
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,390
Okay, people, look alive.
Come on. Get up.

205
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,490
Let's move it. Rise and shine. Y'all way
past the beauty sleep thing, trust me.

206
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,932
I knew it. I knew it. That Mulan
was a troublemaker from the start!

207
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,316
Don't look at me. She gets it
from your side of the family.

208
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,183
- She's just trying to help her father.
- But if she's discovered,

209
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,832
dishonor will come to the family.

210
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:03,649
- Traditional values will disintegrate.
- They'll lose the farm.

211
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,596
My children never caused trouble.
They became acupuncturists.

212
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,706
- Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.
- No!

213
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,063
Your great-granddaughter
had to be a cross-dresser!

214
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,256
- Let a guardian bring her back.
- Yes, awaken the most cunning.

215
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,473
No. The swiftest.

216
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,325
- No. Send the wisest.
- Silence!

217
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:29,464
We must send
the most powerful of all.

218
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:33,592
OK, OK, I get the drift. I'll go.

219
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,722
Y'all don't think I can do it.
Watch this here.

220
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,036
Jump back.
I'm pretty hot, huh?

221
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,731
Don't make me have to singe
nobody to prove it.

222
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,474
You had your chance
to protect the Fa family.

223
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,270
Your misguidance led
Fa Deng to disaster.

224
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,223
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- And your point is?

225
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:58,879
The point is, we will be sending
a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.

226
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,322
What? I'm a real dragon!

227
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:06,714
You are not worthy of this spot.
Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon.

228
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,504
So you'll get back to me
on the job thing?

229
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,706
Just one chance,
is that too much to ask?

230
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,619
I mean, it's not like it'd kill ya.

231
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,675
Yo, Rocky, wake up!
Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!

232
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,849
Come on, boy!
Go get her! Go on!

233
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,039
Come on.

234
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,918
Hello?

235
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,489
Stony? Man, they're gonna kill me.

236
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,416
Great Stone Dragon,

237
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,272
have you awakened?

238
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,517
Yes, I just woke up.

239
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:14,163
I'm the Great Stone Dragon.
Good morning.

240
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,877
I will go forth
and fetch Mulan.

241
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,689
Did I mention that
Il was the Great Stone Dragon?

242
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,842
Go! The fate of the Fa family

243
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,438
rests in your claws.

244
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,928
Don't even worry about it.
I will not lose face.

245
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,905
My elbow.
I know I twisted something.

246
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,101
That's just great.
Now what? I'm doomed!

247
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:47,088
And all 'cause Miss Man decides to take
her little drag show on the road.

248
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,696
Go get her?
What's the matter with you?

249
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,838
After this Great Stone mess,

250
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,470
I'd have to bring her home
with a medal to get back in the temple.

251
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,400
Wait a minute. That's it!
l make Mulan a war hero

252
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,700
and they'll beg me
to come back.

253
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,529
That's the master plan.
You done it now, man.

254
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:13,446
Hey, what makes you
think you're comin'?

255
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,815
You're lucky?

256
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,257
Do I look like a sucker to you?

257
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,757
What you mean, a loser?

258
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,569
What about if 1 pop
one of your antennas off,

259
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,828
then who's the loser,
me or you?

260
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,216
Imperial scouts.

261
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,899
Shan-Yu.

262
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,408
Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun Army.

263
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,971
The emperor will stop you.

264
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,417
Stop me? He invited me.

265
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,992
By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.

266
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,486
Well, I'm here to play his game.

267
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:43,087
Go! Tell your emperor
to send his strongest armies.

268
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,792
I'm ready.

269
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,264
How many men does it take
to deliver a message?

270
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,054
One.

271
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:01,476
OK, how about this?

272
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,950
Excuse me.
Where do I sign in?

273
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,884
Il see you have a sword.
l have one too.

274
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,568
They're very manly and tough.

275
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,534
I'm working on it!

276
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,607
Who am I fooling?

277
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,716
It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.

278
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,699
Did I hear someone ask
for a miracle?

279
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,286
Let me hear you say "ah"!

280
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,551
- That's close enough.
- A ghost.

281
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,784
Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand!

282
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:37,974
For I have been sent
by your ancestors

283
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,887
to guide you through
your masquerade.

284
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,132
If you're gonna stay, you work.

285
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,215
So heed my word, 'cause if the army
finds out you're a girl,

286
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,819
the penalty is death!

287
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:54,963
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

288
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:58,471
lam the guardian of lost souls.

289
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,254
lam the powerful,
the pleasurable,

290
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:04,986
the indestructible Mushu.

291
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,281
Pretty hot, huh?

292
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:17,295
My ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?

293
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,139
Hey, dragon. Dragon, not lizard.

294
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,962
I don't do that tongue thing.

295
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,802
- You're...
- Intimidating?

296
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,074
- Awe-inspiring?
- Tiny.

297
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,550
I'm travel-size for your convenience.

298
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:34,423
If l was my real size,
your cow here would die of fright.

299
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,610
Down, Bessie. My powers are beyond
your mortal imagination.

300
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:43,224
For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armor.

301
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,290
That's it! Dishonor!
Dishonor on your whole family.

302
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:52,194
Make a note of this. Dishonor on you,
dishonor on your cow...

303
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,194
Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

304
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:58,004
I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.

305
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:01,456
Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't slap me no more.

306
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,994
We clear on that?
All right.

307
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:07,093
Let's get this show on the road!
Cri-Kee, get the bags.

308
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:10,036
Let's move it, heifer.

309
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,188
OK, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.

310
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:20,812
Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.

311
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,973
Two, three... Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!

312
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,259
- Beautiful, isn't he?
- They're disgusting.

313
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,392
No, they're men. Now, you have to act
just like them, so pay attention.

314
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,483
Look. This tattoo
will protect me from harm.

315
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,938
l hope you can
get your money back.

316
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,984
I don't think I can do this.

317
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,839
It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.

318
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,626
- What are you lookin’ at?
- Punch him. It's how men say hello.

319
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,846
Yao, you've made a friend.

320
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,752
Good. Now slap him
on the behind. They like that.

321
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,677
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
itll make your ancestors dizzy.

322
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:12,141
Yao, relax and chant with me.

323
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,640
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

324
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,020
You ain't worth my time, chicken boy.

325
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,423
Chicken boy? Say that
to my face, ya limp noodle!

326
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,128
Sorry, Ling.

327
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,520
Hey!

328
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,076
Whoa! You're dead!

329
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,619
There he goes!

330
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,375
Hey, guys.

331
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,428
The Huns have struck here,
here and here.

332
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,594
I'll take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass...

333
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:19,324
and stop Shan-Yu
before he destroys this village.

334
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,015
Excellent strategy, sir.

335
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,841
I do love surprises.

336
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,408
You will stay and train
the new recruits.

337
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,159
When Chi Fu believes
you're ready,

338
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,429
you will join us, Captain.

339
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,186
Captain?

340
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,861
This is an enormous
responsibility, General.

341
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,517
Perhaps a soldier
with more experience...

342
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,880
Number one in his class, extensive
knowledge of training techniques,

343
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,725
an impressive military lineage.

344
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,481
I believe Li Shang
will do an excellent job.

345
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,750
I will. won't let you down.
This is... l mean...

346
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,651
- Yes, sir.
- Very good, then.

347
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,387
We'll toast China's victory
at the Imperial City.

348
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,881
I'll expect a full report
in three weeks.

349
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,141
And I won't leave anything out.

350
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,790
Captain Li Shang.

351
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,684
Leader of China's finest troops.

352
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,174
No. The greatest troops
of all time.

353
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,670
Most impressive.

354
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,506
Good luck, Captain.

355
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,798
Good luck, Father.

356
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,772
Day one.

357
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,640
Soldiers!

358
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,377
He started it!

359
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,101
don't need anyone
causing trouble in my camp.

360
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,400
Sorry.

361
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:22,273
l mean, sorry you had to see that,
but you know how it is,

362
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:27,434
when you get those manly urges
and you just gotta kill somethin’,

363
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,329
fix things, cook outdoors...

364
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:34,022
- What's your name?
el.

365
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:37,826
Your commanding officer
just asked you a question.

366
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,189
I've got a name.
And it's a boy's name too.

367
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,247
- Ling. How ‘bout Ling?
- His name is Ling.

368
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,266
I didn't ask for his name.
l asked for yours!

369
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,123
- Try... ah, Chu.
- Ah Chu.

370
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:54,663
- Ah Chu?
- Gesundheit. I kill myself.

371
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,476
- Mushu.
- Mushu?

372
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,138
- No.
- Then what is it?

373
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,956
- Ping was my best friend growin' up.
- It's Ping.

374
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,306
- Ping?
- Of course, Ping did steal my...

375
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,826
Yes, my name is Ping.

376
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,081
Let me see your conscription notice.

377
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:14,652
- Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?
- [didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

378
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,946
He doesn't talk about me much.

379
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,324
Il can see why.
The boy's an absolute lunatic.

380
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,920
OK, gentlemen,
thanks to your new friend, Ping,

381
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,338
you'll spend tonight picking up
every single grain of rice.

382
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,983
And tomorrow,
the real work begins.

383
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,233
You know, we have to work
on your people skills.

384
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,609
All right! Rise and shine,
Sleeping Beauty. Come on.

385
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,777
Get your clothes on. Get ready.
Got breakfast for ya.

386
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,410
Look, you get porridge,
and it's happy to see you.

387
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,305
Get outta there!
You gonna make people sick.

388
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,095
- Am [ late?
- No time to talk.

389
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,973
It's your first day,
so listen to your teacher,

390
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,826
play nice with the kids
unless they wanna fight,

391
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,939
then kick the other kid's butt.

392
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,074
But I don't wanna kick butt.

393
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,772
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Now let's see your war face.

394
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,827
I think my bunny slippers
just ran for cover.

395
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,143
Come on! Scare me, girl.

396
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,552
That's my tough warrior.
That's what I'm talkin’ about.

397
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,102
Now, get out there
and make me proud.

398
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,423
- What do you mean, the troops left?
- They what?

399
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,042
Wait!
You forgot your sword.

400
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,820
My little baby,
off to destroy people.

401
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,547
Order. People, order.

402
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,863
- I'd like a pan-fried noodle.
- Sweet and pungent shrimp.

403
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,716
- Moo goo gai pan.
- That's not funny.

404
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,171
Looks like our new friend
slept in this morning.

405
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,658
Hello, Ping. Are ya hungry?

406
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:34,055
Yeah, 'cause I owe you
a knuckle sandwich.

407
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,033
Soldiers!

408
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,438
You will assemble swiftly
and silently every morning.

409
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:49,185
Anyone who acts otherwise...
will answer to me.

410
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,598
Tough guy.

411
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,777
Yao.

412
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:02,781
Thank you for volunteering.
Retrieve the arrow.

413
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,999
I'll get that arrow, pretty boy,

414
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,419
and I'll do it with my shirt on.

415
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,086
One moment.
You seem to be missing something.

416
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,212
This represents discipline...

417
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:26,041
and this represents strength.

418
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,676
You need both to reach the arrow.

419
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,578
We've got a long way to go.

420
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,649
Let's get down to business

421
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,399
To defeat the Huns

422
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:16,228
Did they send me daughters

423
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,268
When I asked for sons

424
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:24,404
You're the saddest bunch
lever met

425
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,449
But you can bet
Before we're through

426
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,500
Mister, I'll make a man

427
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,507
Out of you

428
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,230
Tranquil as a forest

429
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,726
But on fire within

430
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,787
Once you find your centre

431
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,198
You are sure to win

432
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,229
You're a spineless
Pale, pathetic lot

433
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,027
And you haven't got a clue

434
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,350
Somehow I'll make a man

435
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,471
Out of you

436
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,710
- I'm never gonna catch my breath
- Say good-bye to those who knew me

437
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,917
Boy, was I a fool in school
For cutting gym

438
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,391
This guy's got ‘em scared to death

439
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,430
Hope he doesn't see right through me

440
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,448
Now I really wish that
1 knew how to swim

441
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:31,558
- Beaman
- You must be swift as a coursing river

442
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,953
- Beaman
- With all the force of a great typhoon

443
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:40,881
- Beaman
- With all the strength of a raging fire

444
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,236
Mysterious as the dark side

445
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,432
Of the moon

446
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:53,375
Time is racing toward us

447
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:58,138
Till the Huns arrive

448
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,790
Heed my every order

449
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,696
And you might survive

450
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:10,107
You're unsuited for the rage of war

451
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,168
So pack up, go home
You're through

452
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:18,112
How could 1 make a man

453
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,703
Out of you

454
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:23,944
Beaman

455
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,908
- You must be swift as a coursing river
- Beaman

456
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:32,063
- With all the force of a great typhoon
- Beaman

457
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:35,684
With alf the strength
Of a raging fire

458
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,950
Mysterious as the dark side

459
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:42,914
Of the moon

460
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,178
Beaman

461
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,906
- We must be swift as a coursing river
- Beaman

462
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,197
- With all the force of a great typhoon
- Beaman

463
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,098
With alf the strength
Of a raging fire

464
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:00,142
Mysterious as the dark side

465
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,201
Of the moon

466
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,137
What do you see?

467
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:36,563
Black pine,
from the high mountains.

468
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,388
White horse hair.
Imperial stallions.

469
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,042
Sulphur, from cannons.

470
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,624
This doll came from a village
in the Tung Shao Pass,

471
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,308
where the Imperial Army
is waiting for us.

472
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,694
We can avoid them easily.

473
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:57,234
No. The quickest way
to the emperor is through that pass.

474
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:02,993
Besides, the little girl
will be missing her doll.

475
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,708
We should return it to her.

476
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,482
Hey, no, this is not a good idea.
What if somebody sees you?

477
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:19,087
Just because I look like a man,
I don't have to smell like one.

478
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:23,323
So a couple of guys don't rinse out
their socks. Picky, picky, picky.

479
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,488
Well, myself, I kind
of like that corn chip smell.

480
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,850
All right. That's enough.
Now, get out before you get all pruny.

481
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,514
Mushu, if you're so worried,
go stand watch.

482
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,895
Yeah, yeah.
"Stand watch, Mushu...

483
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,353
while I blow our secret
with my stupid girlie habits."

484
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,117
Hygiene!

485
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,806
Me first! Me first!

486
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,769
We're doomed! There are a couple of
things I know they're bound to notice!

487
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,061
Hey, Ping!

488
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,080
Hi, guys.
I didn't know you were here.

489
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,596
l was just washing. Now I'm clean,
and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.

490
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,667
Come back here.
I know we were jerks to you before,

491
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,314
so let's start over.

492
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,453
Hi. I'm Ling.

493
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,926
- And I'm Chien-Po.
- Hello, Chien-Po.

494
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,283
And lam Yao!

495
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,480
King of the rock!

496
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,742
And there's nothin’
you girls can do about it.

497
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:44,412
Oh, yeah? Well, I think
Ping and I can take you.

498
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,852
- [don't wanna take him anywhere.
- Ping, we have to fight!

499
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,019
No, we don't. We could just...

500
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:53,926
close our eyes and swim around.

501
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:56,031
Come on. Don't be such a gir...

502
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,587
Something bit me!

503
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,490
- What a nasty flavor.
- Snake!

504
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,794
- Snake!
- Poison!

505
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,109
Snake!

506
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:11,466
- Snake!
- Help!

507
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,772
Some king of the rock.

508
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:20,386
- Boy, that was close.
- No, that was vile.

509
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,688
You owe me big.

510
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,818
I never want to see
a naked man again.

511
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:36,167
Hey, don't look at me.
l ain't bitin’ no more butts.

512
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,634
You think your troops
are ready to fight?

513
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,774
They would not
last a minute against the Huns!

514
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,964
- They completed their training.
- Those boys...

515
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,850
are no more fit to be soldiers
than you are to be captain.

516
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,638
Once the general reads my report,

517
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,394
your troops will never see battle.

518
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,133
No, you don't! I've worked
too hard to get Mulan into this war.

519
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,217
He's messin’ with my plan.

520
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,619
- We're not finished!
- Be careful, Captain.

521
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:09,256
The general may be your father,
but lam the emperor's counsel.

522
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:14,217
And, by the way,
I got that job on my own.

523
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,279
You're dismissed.

524
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:23,226
Hey. I'll hold him and you punch.

525
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,788
Or not.

526
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:30,131
For what it's worth,
I think you're a great captain.

527
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,836
- [saw that.
- What?

528
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:41,712
- You like him, don't you?
- No! lL...

529
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,706
Yeah, all right. Yeah, sure.
Go to your tent!

530
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:53,424
I think it's time we took
this war into our own hands.

531
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,060
Let me see what you got.

532
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:16,884
"From General Li.
Dear Son, we're waiting at the pass,

533
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,391
it'd mean a lot
if you'd come and back us up."

534
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:22,264
Great, but you forgot,
"We're out of potpourri,

535
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,930
perhaps you wouldn't mind
bringing some."

536
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,809
Hello! It's the army!
Make it sound more urgent!

537
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,922
You know what
I'm talkin’ about?

538
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,795
That's better.
Much better. Let's go.

539
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,665
Khanny, baby.
Hey, we need a ride.

540
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,888
Insubordinate ruffians!

541
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:53,528
You men owe me
a new pair of slippers!

542
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:56,298
And I do not squeal like a girl.

543
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:00,632
Urgent news
from the general.

544
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,372
What's the matter? You never seen
a black-and-white before?

545
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,132
Who are you?

546
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:13,591
Excuse me? I think
the question is, who are you?

547
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,911
We're in a war!
There's no time for stupid questions!

548
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:20,528
l should have your hat for that.
Snatch it right off your head.

549
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:24,442
But I'm feeling gracious today,
so carry on before I report you.

550
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:32,963
Captain, urgent news from the general!
We're needed at the front.

551
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:36,553
Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.
We're movin’ out.

552
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:42,134
For a long time
We've been marching off to battle

553
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:46,267
In our thundering herd
We feel a lot like cattle

554
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,906
Like a pounding beat
Our aching feet

555
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,445
Aren't easy to ignore

556
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,288
Hey! Think of instead
A girl worth fighting for

557
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,248
That's what I said.

558
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,000
A girl worth fighting for

559
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:08,316
! want her paler than the moon

560
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,839
With eyes that shine like stars

561
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,685
My girl will marvel at my strength

562
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,401
Adore my battle scars

563
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:21,154
! couldn't care less what she'll wear
Or what she looks like

564
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:24,676
It all depends on what she cooks like

565
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:27,779
Beef, pork, chicken

566
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,173
Bet the local girls
Thought you were quite the charmer

567
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:42,185
And I'll bet the ladies love
A man in armor

568
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:46,004
You can guess what
We have missed the most

569
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,594
Since we went off to war

570
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:52,893
- What do we want?
- A girl worth fighting for

571
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,247
My girl will think
! have no faults

572
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:59,044
That I'm a major find

573
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:03,014
How ‘bout a girl who's got a brain?

574
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,877
Who always speaks her mind?

575
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:09,795
My manly ways and turn of phrase

576
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,404
Are sure to thrill her

577
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,123
He thinks he's such a lady-killer

578
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:22,755
I've a girl back home
Who's unlike any other

579
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,560
Yeah, the only girl
Who'd love him is his mother

580
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,062
But when we come home in victory

581
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:34,082
They'll line up at the door

582
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:39,018
- What do we want?
- A girl worth fighting for

583
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,373
- Wish that I had
- A girl worth fighting for

584
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,223
A girl worth fighting...

585
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,784
Search for survivors.

586
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:52,209
I don't understand.
My father should've been here.

587
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:53,926
Captain!

588
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,737
The general.

589
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,839
I'm sorry.

590
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,337
The Huns are moving quickly.

591
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:16,446
We'll make better time to the Imperial
City through the Tung Shao Pass.

592
00:52:17,034 --> 00:52:19,114
We're the only hope
for the emperor now.

593
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,220
Move out!

594
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,770
What happened?

595
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,279
You just gave away
our position! Now...

596
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,962
Get out of range!

597
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:41,338
- Save the cannons!
- Come on!

598
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,075
Empty it! Empty it!

599
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,357
Hey!

600
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,790
Sure. Save the horse.

601
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:09,822
Fire!

602
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,761
Fire!

603
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:31,049
Hold the last cannon.

604
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,863
Prepare to fight.
If we die, we die with honor.

605
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:19,767
Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.

606
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,408
- Hey!
- Ping! Come back!

607
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,095
Ping!

608
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:52,855
Stop!

609
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,429
You might want to light that now.

610
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,285
Quickly. Quickly!

611
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:08,466
Come on! We gotta help!

612
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,145
You missed!
How could you miss?

613
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,136
He was three feet in front of you!

614
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,832
Mulan!

615
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:32,461
Mulan!

616
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,484
No.

617
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,267
Man, you are one lucky bug.

618
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,212
Shang!

619
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:02,780
- Do you see them?
- Yes.

620
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:10,023
Perfect. Now we'll
pull them to safety.

621
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,616
Hey, Mulan!
I found the lucky cricket!

622
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:17,836
We need help.

623
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:24,122
Nice. Very nice. You can sit by me.

624
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,679
We're gonna die!
We are definitely gonna die.

625
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,359
No way we survive this.
Death is coming!

626
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:36,724
I let them slip
through my fingers.

627
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,691
Pull!

628
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:56,911
I knew we could do it.
You the man!

629
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:59,181
Well, sort of.

630
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:06,892
Step back, guys.
Give him some air.

631
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:09,291
Ping?

632
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:12,332
You are the craziest man
I've ever met.

633
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,267
And for that, l owe you my life.

634
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:19,726
From now on,
you have my trust.

635
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,570
Let's hear it for Ping!
The bravest of us all!

636
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:27,194
- You're king of the mountain!
- Yes!

637
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,073
Ping! What's wrong?

638
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,602
He's wounded! Get help!

639
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:43,123
Ping, hold on.

640
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,721
Hold on.

641
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:16,565
I can explain.

642
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,065
So it's true!

643
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:21,312
Shang!

644
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:25,403
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

645
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:26,989
A woman!

646
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,206
Treacherous snake!

647
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,615
My name is Mulan.

648
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,154
I did it to save my father.

649
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:39,283
- High treason!
- [didn't mean for it to go this far.

650
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,549
Ultimate dishonor!

651
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:45,125
It was the only way.
Please believe me.

652
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,550
Captain?

653
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,732
Restrain him!

654
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,977
- No!
- You know the law.

655
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:19,832
A life for a life.
My debt is repaid.

656
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:25,239
- Move out!
- But you can't just...

657
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:28,362
Il said, "Move out."

658
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,267
l was this close.

659
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:09,286
This close
to impressin' the ancestors,

660
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:12,223
gettin’ the top shelf,
an entourage.

661
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:15,939
Man. All my fine work.

662
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,000
Hi.

663
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,849
I should never have left home.

664
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:27,832
Hey, come on. You went
to save your father's life.

665
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:31,587
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him,
disgracing your ancestors,

666
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,754
and losin’ all your friends?

667
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:38,000
You know, you just gotta...
You gotta learn to let these things go.

668
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:42,102
Maybe I didn't go for my father.

669
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:47,409
Maybe what I really wanted
was to prove I could do things right,

670
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,441
so when I looked in the mirror,

671
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:53,144
I'd see someone worthwhile.

672
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:58,686
But I was wrong.

673
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,038
l see nothing.

674
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,870
Now, that's just 'cause this needs
a little spit, that's all.

675
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:16,674
Let me shine this up for ya.

676
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,750
Il can see you. Look at you.
You look so pretty.

677
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,385
The truth is, we're both frauds.

678
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:30,514
Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.

679
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:33,227
You risked your life
to help people you love.

680
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,480
I risked your life to help myself.

681
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,305
At least you had good intentions.

682
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,035
What? What do you mean
you're not lucky?

683
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:47,080
You lied to me?

684
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:50,430
And what are you, a sheep?

685
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:56,375
I'll have to face my father,
sooner or later.

686
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:59,317
- Let's go home.
- Yeah.

687
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:01,466
This ain't gonna be pretty.

688
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:05,265
But don't you worry, OK?
Things will work out.

689
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:09,322
We started this thing together,
and that's how we'll finish it.

690
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,101
I promise.

691
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,022
Home is that way.

692
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,091
- [have to do something.
- Did you see those Huns?

693
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:44,288
They popped out of the snow
like daisies!

694
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:47,431
Are we in this together or not?

695
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:54,406
Well, let's go kick
some Hunny buns!

696
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:19,279
Make way for the heroes of China.

697
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,374
- Shang!
- Mulan?

698
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,866
The Huns are alive!
They're in the city!

699
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:41,629
You don't belong here, Mulan.
Go home.

700
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:48,177
Shang, I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.

701
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,138
Why should I?

702
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,220
Why else would I come back?

703
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:58,363
You said you'd trust Ping.

704
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:01,935
Why is Mulan any different?

705
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:12,838
Keep your eyes open.
I know they're here.

706
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,942
- Now, where are you going?
- To find someone who will believe me.

707
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,367
My children!

708
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:03,042
Heaven smiles down
upon the Middle Kingdom.

709
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,650
China will sleep safely tonight,

710
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,730
thanks to our brave warriors.

711
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:15,236
Sir, the emperor's in danger.

712
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,402
But the Huns are here.

713
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,390
Please, you have to help.

714
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:24,821
- No one will listen.
- Huh? I'm sorry.

715
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:26,930
- Did you say something?
- Mushu.

716
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,730
Hey, you're a girl again,
remember?

717
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:31,923
Your Majesty.

718
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,644
I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

719
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:38,839
I know what this means
to you, Captain Li.

720
01:08:39,314 --> 01:08:42,504
Your father would have been
very proud.

721
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:12,496
- No!
- Come on!

722
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,819
They'll never reach
the emperor in time.

723
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:41,046
Hey, guys! I've got an idea.

724
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,300
Beaman

725
01:09:56,559 --> 01:10:00,279
- We must be swift as a coursing river
- Beaman

726
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:04,403
- With all the force of a great typhoon
- Beaman

727
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:08,161
With alf the strength
of a raging fire

728
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:11,281
Mysterious as the dark side

729
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,441
Of the moon

730
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,688
Boo.

731
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,181
Guard the door.

732
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:39,052
Your walls and armies have fallen,

733
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,869
and now it's your turn.

734
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:43,648
Bow to me.

735
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:52,321
- OK. Any questions?
- Does this dress make me look fat?

736
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,658
Who's there?

737
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:02,408
- Concubines.
- Ugly concubines.

738
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,235
He's so cute!

739
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:19,179
Now, that's what I call
Mongolian barbecue.

740
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:38,633
Shang, go!

741
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,956
I tire of your arrogance, old man.

742
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:45,833
Bow to me!

743
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,565
No matter how the wind howls,

744
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,521
the mountain cannot bow to it.

745
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,134
Then you will kneel in pieces!

746
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,117
Chien-Po, get the emperor!

747
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,773
Sorry, Your Majesty.

748
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:18,039
No!

749
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:28,940
Come on!

750
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,607
No.

751
01:12:57,907 --> 01:12:59,607
You!

752
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,530
- You took away my victory!
- No!

753
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,297
I did.

754
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:12,866
The soldier from the mountains.

755
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,284
So what's the plan?

756
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:31,081
- You don't have a plan?
- Hey, I'm making this up as I... go.

757
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:33,861
- Mushu!
- Way ahead of you, sister.

758
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,910
Come on, Cri-Kee.

759
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:58,364
- Citizens, I need firepower.
- Who are you?

760
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:00,981
Your worst nightmare.

761
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:07,498
- On the roof!
- Look!

762
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:26,753
It looks like you're out of ideas.

763
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:33,186
Not quite. Ready, Mushu?

764
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,989
lam ready, baby!
Light me.

765
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:53,928
Get off the roof,
get off the roof!

766
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:15,989
You are a lucky bug.

767
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,592
That was a deliberate
attempt on my life!

768
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,302
Where is she?
Now she's done it.

769
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,774
What a mess! Stand aside!

770
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:33,737
That creature's
not worth protecting.

771
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,896
- She's a hero.
- 'Tis a woman.

772
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:39,392
- She'll never be worth anything.
- Listen, you pompous...

773
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:41,602
That is enough.

774
01:15:48,144 --> 01:15:50,224
Your Majesty, I can explain.

775
01:15:58,254 --> 01:16:01,504
I've heard a great deal
about you, Fa Mulan.

776
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,079
You stole your father's armor,
ran away from home,

777
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,652
impersonated a soldier,

778
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:12,082
deceived your commanding officer,

779
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:16,155
dishonored the Chinese Army,
destroyed my palace,

780
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:18,292
and...

781
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:21,297
you have saved us all.

782
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:56,244
My little baby is all grown up and...
and savin' China.

783
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:58,279
You have a tissue?

784
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,743
- Chi Fu?
- Your Excellency?

785
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,996
See to it that this woman
is made a member of my council.

786
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:10,300
A member... What? But...

787
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:14,389
There are no council positions
open, Your Majesty.

788
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:17,454
Very well.
You can have his job.

789
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:20,387
What? I...

790
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,558
With all due respect,
Your Excellency,

791
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:28,468
I think I've been away
from home long enough.

792
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:30,934
Then take this,

793
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:35,320
so your family will know
what you have done for me.

794
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,761
And this,

795
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:42,837
so the world will know
what you have done for China.

796
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:51,523
Is she allowed to do that?

797
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,625
You...

798
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:11,294
You fight good.

799
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,712
Thank you.

800
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,432
Khan, let's go home.

801
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:35,911
The flower that blooms in adversity

802
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:39,605
is the most rare and beautiful of all.

803
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:41,014
Sir?

804
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:45,576
You don't meet a girl like that
every dynasty.

805
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,948
- Mulan!
- Father.

806
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:22,518
I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

807
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:26,571
And the crest of the emperor.

808
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:30,292
They're gifts to honor the Fa family.

809
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:39,469
The greatest gift and honor

810
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:43,415
is having you for a daughter.

811
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:45,793
I've missed you so.

812
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,258
I've missed you too, Baba.

813
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:57,097
Great. She brings home a sword.

814
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,648
If you ask me,
she should've brought a man.

815
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,229
Excuse me.

816
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:03,547
Does Fa Mulan live here?

817
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:10,438
- Thank you.
- Sign me up for the next war.

818
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:16,105
Honorable Fa Zhou, I... Mulan!

819
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:19,953
You forgot your helmet.

820
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:24,675
Well, actually, it's your helmet,
isn't it? l mean...

821
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:30,047
- Would you like to stay for dinner?
- Would you like to stay forever?

822
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:32,509
Dinner would be great.

823
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:38,358
Come on. Who did a good job?

824
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,644
Come on. Tell me.
Who did a good job?

825
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:45,249
All right!
You can be a guardian again.

826
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:57,117
Take it, Cri-Kee!

827
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:02,308
You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.

828
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,369
Call out for egg rolls!

829
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,163
Guardians.

830
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:17,184
Thanks, Mushu.

831
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:23,577
Mushu!

832
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:24,099
Mushu!
