1
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:39,945
What's your name?

2
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:41,891
Mosquito

3
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,666
Why did those mad dogs pick on you?

4
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,115
For a chicken leg

5
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,409
Huh?

6
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,321
Want me to go with you?

7
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,357
No

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,700
Not the first time anyway

9
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,054
I can go by myself

10
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:44,974
Sorry

11
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,326
Three schools in two years, huh?

12
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,335
Missed classes for half semester
when you were in Grove Town

13
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,668
You been busy, huh?
Lots of business going on?

14
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,131
Nah

15
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,565
No?

16
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:11,686
I'm telling you,

17
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,165
you better behave,well

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,960
and finish school here

19
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,505
Don't mess around

20
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,588
Huh?

21
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:19,632
Uh-huh

22
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:20,866
Uh-huh, what you mean by uh-huh?

23
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,464
Taking shit uh-huh, huh?

24
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,548
Gambling, eh?

25
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,959
You've got some guts, huh?

26
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,488
Hands forward, forward

27
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,510
(The new guy)

28
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,501
(On the dike, tomorrow after school )

29
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,899
(Bring NT$3000 to pay your respect)

30
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:20,983
(Or else...)

31
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,250
What the fuck

32
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,005
Loser

33
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,264
You need some beating

34
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,187
Boss Dog Boy

35
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,695
You eat my lunch everyday

36
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,320
My nanny says I've become too skinny

37
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,334
Too skinny?

38
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,033
Your nanny's blind or somethin’

39
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,597
Talkin'shit

40
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,186
What you eating that fast for?

41
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,888
Hey, Grove guy

42
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,075
Haven't paid your bill this month?

43
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,243
It's OK, you can pay with a chicken leg

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,940
Collected by me, Mr. Dog Boy

45
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:31,314
Welcome, you're now listening to

46
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,091
Mr. Lee's "Hour of Sensibility"

47
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:39,408
This is a barbequed chicken leg
from the Grove guy

48
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,402
1986
"What the fuck is meaning?
All l know is brotherhood.”

49
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:25,878
Don't run!

50
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,404
Dice go!

51
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,035
You need only five

52
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,870
C'mon

53
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,664
Again, again

54
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,710
Hit it

55
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,762
So many of them picking on one?

56
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,131
Where the hell is this fag from?

57
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,793
Just got transferred

58
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,612
See how far you can go

59
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,739
Get him up

60
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,668
Go ahead and run

61
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,563
You fucker keep running!

62
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,505
You run fast

63
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,708
Playing dumb in front of your daddy?

64
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,550
Shit

65
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,142
What’re you doing?

66
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,837
What about that?

67
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,529
Not bad

68
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,182
Where's your manners?

69
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,117
Scar, cigarettes

70
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,219
This is a beauty salon, not a barber shop

71
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,104
What's wrong with him?

72
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,389
I'll tend to your wound in a minute

73
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:50,726
Scar

74
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,081
Sister Ling

75
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,175
What's this for, no

76
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,914
You have already sent
so many flower banquets

77
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,847
You also spent quite a lot
when you took over the business

78
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,646
How could you say no to my cash gift ?

79
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,203
Bye, Sister Ling

80
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,723
Pay 50 bucks to get through

81
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,086
Want to be friends?

82
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,539
Fuck off

83
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,706
Did you get that chick yesterday?

84
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:05,681
She ran away

85
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,309
Loser

86
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,514
What?

87
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,439
I beat up the newbie

88
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,150
what's that to do with you Temple Front?

89
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,515
Excuse me, Mr. Boss Dog Boy

90
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,691
Just a notice

91
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,876
From now on,
his business is my business

92
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,623
His enemy, is my enemy

93
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,882
Whatever people owes him

94
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,144
I'll get it back for him

95
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,563
Whatever he doesn't want from people

96
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,739
I will give it back for him

97
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,876
Would you please tell me

98
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,710
Did you pick on him yesterday?

99
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,092
Dragon Lee

100
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,447
Don't pick on me

101
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,455
when my cousin is in jail

102
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,835
Pick on you

103
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,415
Just like you called up those body
builders to pick on him yesterday?

104
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,050
Making him pay respect, huh?

105
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,320
This is your turf, huh?

106
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,384
Now, nobody is picking on anybody

107
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,747
Now I am asking you, fair and square

108
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,393
Did you pick on him yesterday?

109
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,357
How nice, everyone's here

110
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:35,837
I, Dragon Lee, is here,
no one dares to hit back, so be my guest

111
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,065
Do me a favor, the new guy

112
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,768
Can you make it quick,
10 minutes have passed

113
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,708
You don't really need that much thinking

114
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,265
If you don't fuck'em up today

115
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,705
One day they'll fuck you up

116
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,404
My name is Chou Yi-Mong,
friends call me Mosquito

117
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,410
I moved to Monga when I was 17

118
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,077
l became a gangster,
because of a chicken leg

119
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,635
All this fighting, is there a meaning to it?

120
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,272
What the fuck is meaning?

121
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,643
Your daddy only know brotherhood,
never heard of meaning

122
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,167
Since I was little,
l had no father, no friends

123
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,203
l was bullied by
all the neighbors and kids

124
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,699
Until 1 met my brothers

125
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,058
My life seemed to have some meaning

126
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,457
No

127
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,995
What the fuck is meaning?

128
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,673
All 1 know, is brotherhood

129
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,742
Dragon Lee

130
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,171
The only son of Geta,
the boss of Monga Temple Front

131
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,735
A street prince born with a silver spoon

132
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,682
As the son of a gangster boss

133
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:21,477
Naturally

134
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,824
all the kids respect him as the big brother

135
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,363
Since he's little

136
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,084
he's been the gangster force on campus,
maintaining the orders

137
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,257
So much so, that the word Brotherhood,
in his definition

138
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,116
Has everything to do with Power

139
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,055
( Protection fee, 500 )

140
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,738
However, the one who really has
what it takes to be a boss, is him

141
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,841
Monk, real name Ho Tien-Yo

142
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,916
His family owns
a Buddhist Accessory Shop

143
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,532
When he's 5, a fortune-teller

144
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,011
determined that this kid
was to become a gangster

145
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,679
( Your boy is destined to be a gangster )

146
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,275
His dad therefore asked his best friend
Geta to look after him

147
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,109
Monk is extremely intelligent

148
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,197
Showed amazing talent as early as
in elementary school

149
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,300
He can finish test papers
for 4 people at once

150
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,197
Each year,
he won six championships at school:

151
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,373
writing, speech, reading, spelling

152
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,012
calligraphy and art

153
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,899
( Boss, the high mountain tea
you ordered is here )

154
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,880
Because he has high IQ,
and he's resourceful and well-mannered

155
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:22,166
Comparing to any of us

156
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,021
Monk does everything with
more ease and professionalism

157
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,505
Growing up with Dragon

158
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,677
Monk only cares for Dragon

159
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,072
The way I see it

160
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,634
His definition of brotherhood is

161
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,200
Incomprehensible to others

162
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,868
A-Po, Huang Wan-Po

163
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,907
An underdog
who knows best about survival

164
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,936
(I've been a butcher all my life )

165
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,670
( How come my son is such a coward? )

166
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:50,186
He claims that he's killed 233 pigs

167
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,437
Done 107 women

168
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,746
Kicked 375 people's asses

169
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,418
(376,379... )

170
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:01,207
Brotherhood for him,
is a means to hustle around

171
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,956
A truth only idiots would buy into

172
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,541
The idiot A-Po refers to

173
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,499
Would be Monkey

174
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,916
Monkey, real name Hou Chun-Sheng

175
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,479
His dad died soon after he was born

176
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,098
His mom ran away with some man
(On my white horse )

177
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,904
His grandpa raised him

178
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,196
( Through three territories )

179
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,504
( This is my line, who the heck are you? )

180
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,025
(lam Chun-Sheng )

181
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:28,947
Just like me

182
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,138
Monkey was often bullied as a kid

183
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,537
What's different is

184
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:33,545
When he turned 10

185
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,273
He Suddenly realized
that he was good at fighting

186
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,212
Since then,
he's the one beating people up

187
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,104
No one can hit him

188
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,407
It was in the same year

189
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,532
That Dragon recruited him,
and he became a gangster kid

190
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,238
I took on three all by myself

191
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,086
You're talking shit

192
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,328
The highest record we ever made

193
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,997
was to pick up a mass fight
among all gangs in Monga

194
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,408
It was that night

195
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,029
that five of us became sworn brothers

196
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,697
and formed the Prince Gang

197
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,836
Were not born on the same day

198
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,688
But are willing to die on the same day

199
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,293
Shall anyone think twice, will be punished
by the Master God of Monga

200
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,418
To have the limbs broken
and die an ugly death

201
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,748
Hey.
What do you want to do the most in life?

202
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,699
Join the gang, be the boss

203
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,975
You wanna replace me?

204
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,790
If 1 become the boss,
then you'll be the boss's boss

205
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,725
Sweet talker

206
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,980
What if you ain't in the gang?

207
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,691
If Monk wasn't a gangster

208
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,073
he could get a PhD and win Nobel prize

209
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,452
Anyway he's gotta be someone big lah

210
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,064
If 1 ain't in the gang, what would I be?

211
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,967
Eighteen Copper Men conquer the world
with Shaolin Kung-Fu

212
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,637
Famous traditional kung-fu medicine

213
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,269
Go back to sleep

214
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,905
What about you,
what you wanna do the most?

215
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,540
Me, I wanna go to Japan

216
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,007
And do what?

217
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,629
Go see the cherry blossoms

218
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,591
So “romantico”

219
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:50,002
My dad sent home a postcard
from Japan before he died

220
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,036
On it,
there's cherry blossoms all over the sky

221
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,557
He got passed on some kind of disease
two months after he got there

222
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:03,888
He probably died not even

223
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,616
knowing I was born

224
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,826
Have you ever seen cherry blossoms?

225
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,193
Look, cherry blossom

226
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,928
Here, to your dad

227
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,326
Fuck! What you splashed on me with?

228
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:16,651
Pee, of course

229
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,706
Bitch, asshole

230
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,964
You can't get me, won't get me

231
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,469
Don't go.

232
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:02,374
Thanks

233
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,770
Hey

234
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,097
What you had was broken

235
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,582
Got you a new one

236
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,081
Takin’ off

237
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,217
Not sleeping yet?

238
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,536
What's going on?

239
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,822
How's school?

240
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,284
Ok, nothing special

241
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,850
Just the way it is

242
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,133
(Notification for Absence without Leave)

243
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,742
I've never asked you to get good grades

244
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,543
All l want is that you graduate

245
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,603
Graduate from high school, that's it

246
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,615
Is that too much to ask?

247
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:16,731
You hang out

248
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,809
with the Temple Front
hooligans all the time?

249
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,023
Will there be a future
for you sticking with them?

250
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,950
There's no such thing as future
for someone like me

251
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,466
Say that again

252
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:31,899
I wouldn't have survived school

253
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,587
if they didn't watch my back

254
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,009
You don't steal, rob,
or do anything unspeakable,

255
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,317
why do you need them to protect you?

256
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,953
What about you?
Aren't you doing the same thing?

257
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,512
We just moved here, and you already
hooked up with the Mainlanders

258
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,108
What kind of mindset's that?

259
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,656
Don't you also
need someone to watch your back?

260
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:55,882
We're sworn brothers now

261
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,238
I never had any friends since I was little

262
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,798
This is the first time

263
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:24,906
Happy birthday

264
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,350
How do you know it's my birthday?

265
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,264
I have my way to find out

266
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,960
Let's go celebrate

267
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,286
Move it

268
00:27:59,178 --> 00:27:59,968
How's it?

269
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,175
Take a look

270
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,253
Not bad huh, do you like it?

271
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:13,551
Thanks

272
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,195
Dragon, big bro

273
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,090
Come, come. Come on in

274
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,320
Woo-hoo! Love birds

275
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,169
Get lost

276
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:57,959
Ignore them

277
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:22,245
Mosquito, Mosquito

278
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,388
Drink up

279
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:26,557
l'll puke if I drink more

280
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,158
Are we brothers or not?

281
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:06,018
Monk, Mosquito, come on, dance

282
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,531
Hurry up

283
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,069
Get movin'

284
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,199
Let's go

285
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,750
Monkey

286
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:45,783
Dance with them

287
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:47,999
No, I can't dance

288
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,850
Hate, love, commotion in my heart

289
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:58,692
This trap, trap, trap, why me?

290
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:04,017
Hey, isn't it time to give our
b-day boy the present?

291
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,486
Mosquito

292
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,247
Aren't we going to get some squid soup?

293
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,625
Let's have it to go, you go get it

294
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:19,777
Oh

295
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,657
Remember to tell the owner it's
for the Temple Front

296
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,355
This way he'll add extra squid, hear me?

297
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,447
OK

298
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,454
Hi, 5 squid soups to go,
it's for the Temple Front

299
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,349
Five to go, for the Temple Front

300
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:09,654
Temple Front

301
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,770
Damn Temple Front,
don't run! Knock him dead!

302
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:20,901
Don't run!

303
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,138
Temple Front! Get him!

304
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,084
Don't go

305
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,398
Kill him!

306
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,470
Wow, they're coming, coming, coming

307
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:02,198
Wow, super fast, 9 minutes 35 seconds

308
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,466
Mosquito

309
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:29,462
(The priest undertaking fear
expel ceremony for Mosquito)

310
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,766
Hey, sorry about the squid soups

311
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,708
Should I go get them again?

312
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,050
Get them again?

313
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:54,752
What you laughing about?

314
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,846
Jeez, you're unbelievable

315
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:57,939
You almost got killed

316
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,433
and you're going back there again?

317
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,110
Hey Monk, enlighten him

318
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,312
This is the Temple Front, our turf

319
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,669
Monga, Since the Ching Dynasty
to the Japanese Era

320
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,768
has always been
the busiest commercial center of Taipei

321
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,839
It's like a gold mountain

322
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,971
full of opportunities and dreams

323
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,379
In places like this,
all kinds of people mixing together

324
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:22,554
Someone needs to maintain

325
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,420
the order and allocate the interests

326
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:27,165
That's where a "Block Boss" steps in

327
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,716
The streets and lanes are their borders

328
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,388
Each takes care of things big
and small on his own turf

329
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,241
Each protects the civilians on his turf

330
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,654
Some say there are

331
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,003
over 70 block bosses in Monga

332
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,861
And some say over 30

333
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,176
But no one knows

334
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,880
for sure the actual number

335
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:44,859
Haven't you been asking

336
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,426
why we fight all the time?

337
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:47,395
You get it now?

338
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,851
Boss Dragon

339
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,036
Anywhere in Monga

340
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,612
mention Dragon's dad's name

341
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,036
No one dares to touch you

342
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,198
Because we, the Temple Front,
are Monga's most powerful

343
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:56,887
If you run into those from the Back Alley,

344
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,278
No need to say anything, just hit 'em

345
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,041
Didn't we kick their ass the other day?

346
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,919
And also those at the night market tonight

347
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,031
Dragon Bro

348
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,167
Have a cigarette

349
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,778
No I'm good

350
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,054
Give it to others

351
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,936
Hey Dragon, what's your dad's name?

352
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,696
Didn't I just tell you, Geta (Wooden clogs)

353
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,901
The one that shielded off the sword
with two clogs

354
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,592
Hey Dragon, your dad is really cool

355
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,205
Hi, good day, good day

356
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,082
Boss Geta

357
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:31,113
Come here, eat

358
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,253
Time to eat lah

359
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,501
Lazy dude shits and pees a lot

360
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,144
You use the toilet whenever it's time to eat

361
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,089
My belly hurts, what can I do?

362
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,381
Hey your kid is big

363
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,971
you should go and register

364
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,067
She wouldn't marry me

365
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,148
Come on, meal time

366
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,865
The kitchen ceiling is still leaking

367
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,363
what did you do to fix it?

368
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:04,245
Look

369
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,046
Tomorrow,

370
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,156
if I still have to wear
this shower cap when I cook

371
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,269
You'll be the one that's leaking

372
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:12,816
Ok, ok, take a break

373
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,448
clean up and eat

374
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,493
Wow, braised pork

375
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,801
Oi, watch out for the hygiene,
not with your hands

376
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,587
Come and eat

377
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,683
Come on, eat lah

378
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,031
Come and eat

379
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,457
Is this the way of the gangster?
Not exactly what I imagined

380
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,626
This, is the real Taiwanese gangster

381
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,075
Vulgar and powerful

382
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,031
Ma'am

383
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,149
Mom

384
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,602
No, I'm good, you go ahead

385
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:47,518
Get you some rice?

386
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,292
No, l am fed up

387
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,874
I just lost 16,000

388
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,879
to that Mei-ji bitch

389
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,618
If 1 don't get it back next time
along with the interest

390
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,499
I'll write my name backwards

391
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,341
Mon, this is my sworn brother, Mosquito

392
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,255
Hi there

393
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,076
Alright, you guys carry on

394
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,957
Boss, it's taken care of

395
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,352
How'd it go?

396
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,890
Kept wailing

397
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,132
Ok lah, go sit down and eat

398
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:20,961
Have a seat

399
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,460
Riot at the Rocky Bay Prison

400
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:34,520
They even sent in the SWAT team

401
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,960
It's turned into such a big deal

402
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,250
Take some of this

403
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,009
This reduces your internal heat,
have some

404
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,282
Get some more

405
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:14,885
Dad you're home

406
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,341
You were saying

407
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,069
Wim-Kian's uncle

408
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,774
Uh-huh

409
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,374
Which uncle is it?

410
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,764
Well it's Dog Boy's dad

411
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,906
Oh, Doggy

412
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,556
Wim-Kian is raised by Doggy

413
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,917
He'll get even for sure

414
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,205
You better watch out

415
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,424
Boss

416
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,172
Uncle lost 200 grand
at the Temple Front bookie

417
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,169
He told them

418
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,007
to collect from you when you come out

419
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,114
But they insisted on
chopping down one of his fingers

420
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,189
Fuck

421
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,481
What you doing?

422
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,906
Hey where the hell are we going?

423
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,530
Just chill, you'll know in a minute

424
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:38,829
Where's Monk?

425
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,257
Boss Dragon

426
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,271
There's no way he'd come for this

427
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:42,975
He's not interested in women

428
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,915
Try saying that to him next time
if you got the balls

429
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:46,841
It is true

430
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:47,755
He is Monk

431
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,569
a monk should be vegetarian and celibate

432
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,369
Exquisite Tower

433
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,228
Tower is exquisite,
there are 13 stories in the Tower

434
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,388
A temple in front of the Tower,
an old monk in the temple

435
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,891
The old monk is the Master of six pupils

436
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,437
See?

437
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,190
Auntie has prepared

438
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,468
swallow nests and shark fins for you

439
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,505
Pick one you like and enjoy the tonic

440
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,565
Feed yourself well, so you'll be strong

441
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,421
Auntie, my dad doesn't let me
come to Treasure Borough,

442
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:23,500
you know that right?

443
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,545
I know lah

444
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:25,312
Cow Dung

445
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:25,899
Yes ma'am

446
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:26,817
No one knows

447
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:28,048
Boss Dragon was here, got it?

448
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:28,739
I know lah

449
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:31,790
Next!

450
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,667
Auntie, get him a good one

451
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:35,969
my treat

452
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,667
Sure, leave it to me

453
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,588
Little handsome, come, your turn

454
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,797
Wait, I'll wait, they go first

455
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:49,803
First timer, huh?

456
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,372
Auntie will get you
a pretty one in a minute

457
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,308
Make you lose your virginity tonight

458
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,676
Then take a red envelope for good luck

459
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,491
Auntie come in for a second

460
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,306
Take your pick

461
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,089
Don't be scared

462
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,644
You scared the shit out of me

463
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,449
Auntie,
how can you sell this kind of product?

464
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:36,866
What you lookin’ at?

465
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,588
I'll dig your eyes out

466
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,423
Her, I can do with her

467
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,497
Did you go to
Show Shang Elementary School?

468
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,508
Didn't you always carry your lunchbox

469
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,016
in a washing powder bag?

470
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:18,915
You're confusing me with someone else

471
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:32,872
You

472
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,030
Why do you want to be a hooker?

473
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:44,357
What about you?

474
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:46,986
Why do you want to be a gangster?

475
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,228
Can we talk first?

476
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,258
What's your name?

477
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,529
Whatever

478
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,285
I'm Mosquito

479
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,359
Music?

480
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,460
Whatever

481
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:04,651
Thanks, come again

482
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:12,512
Hey

483
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:15,579
My name is Ning

484
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,341
Oh

485
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,123
Stop pouting

486
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:00,913
I'm not pouting

487
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:01,888
If you wanna see "Fatal Attraction"

488
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,499
we can do it next time

489
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,761
How was it?

490
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,383
How was what?

491
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:07,867
Was it good?

492
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,659
With that birthmark girl yesterday

493
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:10,554
No

494
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:11,290
None of your business

495
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,605
I don't want next time.
l wanna see it today

496
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:17,226
Hey what's the fuss about?

497
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,568
Everybody wants to see this one

498
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:19,829
Everybody, everybody.
It's everybody again.

499
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:20,687
No idea

500
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,891
Fuck, mad woman

501
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,100
What do you want?
Picking on me or what?

502
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,434
lam not picking on you

503
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:33,286
If only you did what you promised

504
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,576
The "Project A" sequel is what ! wanna see

505
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,715
If you don't like it, then leave

506
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,840
Excuse me, I am Dragon's friend

507
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,278
You guys had a fight?

508
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,910
He asked me to come look for you

509
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:19,348
He wants to apologize

510
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,720
He didn't earlier

511
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,328
because the other guys were there

512
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,633
You understand, right?

513
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,961
Men don't like to look bad in front of friends

514
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,399
He asked me to come get you

515
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:28,582
He's waiting for you in the back

516
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,368
Come this way, in the back

517
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,082
This way

518
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,339
In the back

519
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,279
I just wanted to enjoy a movie with him

520
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:45,752
And he invited those guys again

521
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,613
I don't understand

522
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,357
Why does he have to be like
this all the time?

523
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:52,786
He's in the back

524
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,537
Come, come here

525
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:01,661
You know why?

526
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,203
Because Dragon Lee is a freakin’ fag

527
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,004
Without those guys around all the time

528
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,697
He'd be scared shitless

529
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,970
You got me?

530
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:15,881
Shush

531
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:42,696
Hey

532
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,357
Gotta go

533
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,506
See you tomorrow

534
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:52,062
Have you seen Hui?

535
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,627
Fuck, you're shitting me

536
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:05,619
Boss, I am not lying

537
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:06,666
that chick is real hot

538
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:07,704
Show me tomorrow then

539
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,558
Sure, I'll take you tomorrow

540
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,040
I have no idea what you're saying

541
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,069
I didn't do anything

542
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,672
Didn't do anything?

543
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,880
Then why did you run?

544
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:45,327
Gimme a break, you guys got weapons

545
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,015
Who wouldn't run when they see you?

546
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,371
Who knows,
maybe the Prince Gang is just

547
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,026
itching to beat someone up

548
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,027
Fuck, you're full of shit

549
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:53,973
A man is responsible for his actions

550
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,228
How come there's such garbage like you?

551
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,830
I didn't do nothing

552
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,212
I'm being framed

553
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,700
Some fucking bitch set me up

554
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,426
Shut his mouth

555
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,876
Hey you can't be serious

556
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:19,822
To be a man is to be serious

557
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,825
First, I will seal your mouth

558
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,113
And then left eye

559
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,305
Then right eye

560
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,317
Left ear

561
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,413
Right ear

562
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,334
Left nostril

563
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,207
Then drive you into the mountains

564
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:40,536
Dig a hole, throw you in there

565
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,051
Pour in vitriol, and then fill up the hole

566
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,377
Monk, you can't do this

567
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,239
What you gonna say to my cousin?

568
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,017
Why do I have to explain to Wim-Kian?

569
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,029
I don't belong to the Back Alley,
lam from the Temple Front

570
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,908
Are you fucked up in the head?

571
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,486
Besides, having done something like that

572
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,589
You are the one

573
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:01,637
who should figure out
what to say to Wim-Kian

574
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,930
Stay away from me

575
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:05,585
Don't you come closer

576
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,069
What the fuck,
what the fuck are you doing?

577
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,158
Fuck, what you doing

578
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:09,721
Seal it

579
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,057
Seal his mouth

580
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,357
Fuck, don't fuck with me

581
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:18,058
What the fuck

582
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,621
Seal the eyes

583
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:31,805
This is enough

584
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:39,899
Dragon, Dragon

585
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,460
Fuck, let go of me

586
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:42,439
Let go of me

587
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,250
He fucked my woman,
don't you know that?

588
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:45,455
He fucked my Hui

589
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,316
Yeah, I know

590
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:02,689
I'll do it

591
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:44,354
Hey

592
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:46,880
No need to worry

593
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:50,041
I'll take him to the doc I know he'll fix it

594
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:51,895
It'll be alright

595
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,418
Thank you, see you again

596
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,720
Thanks

597
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:30,085
Auntie, I want Ning

598
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,091
Ning is with a customer at the moment

599
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:33,876
I'll get you a prettier one

600
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,974
Hey A-mei

601
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:38,678
It's ok, I'll wait

602
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:40,272
So faithful

603
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:44,124
Handsome, come in, don't go away

604
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,366
Come again soon

605
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:25,692
Who did this?

606
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:27,375
If I collect less than 30 cards

607
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:29,218
One whip for one card short

608
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:48,548
Sorry

609
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,278
What you sorry for

610
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,370
You didn't turn me into this

611
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,502
What's up with you?

612
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,357
Can I spend the night here?

613
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,727
How many more do you need?
I'll buy them all

614
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:20,542
I bought a lot

615
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,274
Even one for Dog Boy

616
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,680
Sorry, I forgot that he can't eat

617
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,188
How could this happen?

618
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,218
Didn't you say it's no problem?

619
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:39,031
Could be too much in the nose

620
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:36,849
Oi

621
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,308
Where is it?

622
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:41,354
What?

623
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:42,738
The yo-yo

624
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:24,741
The five of you, try to fly

625
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:27,152
when you still don't know how to walk?

626
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,621
Blackie and I only went to the South
for a couple of days

627
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,732
You already made such a big mess

628
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,236
When the day comes that I'm gone

629
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,789
Would that mean
the end of Temple Front?

630
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:40,792
The Prince Gang my ass

631
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:43,998
Lost your mind for a Mainlander chick

632
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:47,544
Dragon Lee,
you really think you're a prince?

633
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,585
man's life is worth nothing for you?

634
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,460
You can kill
when you can't even kneel properly?

635
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,049
Look, if you fall again

636
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:03,586
I'll beat you to death

637
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,157
I'll be your page boy if I don't

638
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,065
Boss, I made this mess

639
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,228
It's got nothing to do with them

640
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:14,817
It's all my fault

641
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,205
Fine, get up

642
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:20,906
All of you, get up

643
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,220
All get up!

644
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,988
You are good

645
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:41,987
I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me

646
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:44,219
It's your fault

647
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:46,838
It has nothing to do with them

648
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:48,367
You are good

649
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:49,735
You are good

650
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:50,873
How come you're so good?

651
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:51,674
So good

652
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:52,792
You are really good

653
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,610
Really good

654
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:14,877
Dad

655
01:00:19,483 --> 01:00:20,153
You

656
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,182
Heading back?

657
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,220
Uh-huh

658
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:12,651
Boss Masa

659
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,189
Boss Masa

660
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:25,544
He almost wasted him. God forbid

661
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,689
He meant to kill him or what?

662
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:32,286
When kids make a mistake,
they should be disciplined

663
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,402
You haven't changed a bit, so naive

664
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,879
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

665
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:40,479
Sigh...

666
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,375
We're brothers for so many years

667
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,290
We're like family

668
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:50,353
Family? If only he felt the same way, too

669
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:52,464
Secretly hired someone

670
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:55,296
to chop off your hand,
and took your place

671
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:58,674
And now, he fucked up your son
when he got the chance

672
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:02,644
Don't talk about this in front of the kid

673
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:04,763
Come, come outside

674
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,576
Hey, why aren't you sleeping?
What's going on?

675
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,000
What he just said, is it true?

676
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:43,846
Chou Ling-Wan, your registered mail

677
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:44,730
Oh

678
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,498
Be right back

679
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:07,832
I'm takin’ off

680
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:10,336
Got enough money with you?

681
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:11,346
Yeah

682
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:12,641
Careful

683
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:13,786
I will

684
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:18,684
Sorry about that

685
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:19,444
No worries

686
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,939
Your son is very good-looking, going out?

687
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,565
Yeah

688
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,063
Pre-graduation trip

689
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:26,705
He's graduating?

690
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,353
You are really lucky

691
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,488
You're too kind

692
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,643
"1987"

693
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:36,538
“Together,
We Stepped into the World of Grown-ups
And There Was No Turning Back"

694
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:02,060
Sweeping Blade

695
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,415
Stabbing tube

696
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:04,463
Samurai 8-feet

697
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,374
Samurai 2-feet

698
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:06,245
Edged stiletto

699
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:08,707
Whenever you have time,

700
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,708
take them out, feel them and clean them

701
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,857
Befriend them

702
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:14,616
When you are in trouble

703
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:16,238
Your friends will support you

704
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,599
Get it?

705
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,140
Hurry up, you're falling behind

706
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,369
Son of a bitch, fuck

707
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,321
One, two, three

708
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,071
That's how it's done

709
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,288
Hey, I just took a piss

710
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:47,055
What age is it ?

711
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:48,937
They all use guns now

712
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,598
What's the point of practicing these?

713
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:52,877
Come on, when the guns are loaded

714
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:55,676
Do we have the time to turn around
and get our 2-feet, 8-feet?

715
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,002
Our asses are already getting shot at

716
01:09:58,428 --> 01:09:59,718
What the fuck did you say?

717
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:00,763
Boss Geta

718
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,849
Dad

719
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:04,351
Boss

720
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:07,324
Guns are evil things imported
from the West

721
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:09,477
They are for those who don't have balls

722
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,712
Weapon for the lowly

723
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:15,266
To establish oneself
in the underground society

724
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:18,342
One depends on his fists and knives

725
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,527
I won't let the five of you
lay your hands on guns

726
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:23,128
You hear me?

727
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:25,754
Hear me?

728
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:26,905
Yes

729
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:30,616
Let's go

730
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:34,946
Take your shit and let's go

731
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,614
Yay! The training camp is over!

732
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:40,471
Black Dog Bro on the mountain top

733
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:44,190
He is the young master of the ranch

734
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,557
Hard working night and day

735
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:51,481
His huge ranch takes up
the whole mountain

736
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:54,724
His singing is loud and cheerful

737
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,731
He sings non-stop all day long

738
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:02,018
His songs are so beautiful

739
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:05,518
His nice singing voice got him famous

740
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,225
l hear his voice but can't see him,
yo le yi li

741
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,852
Throughout the whole mountain
there is his voice, yo le yi li

742
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:16,425
The voice is pure and lovely, yo le yi li

743
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:20,376
Yo le yi, yo le yi li

744
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:23,608
Thank you

745
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:25,463
Applause please

746
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,565
Boss, what an incredible night

747
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:34,164
Both bosses of Monga Temple Front

748
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,353
and Back Alley are here

749
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:37,369
Masa is here?

750
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:38,677
Yeah

751
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:40,455
Good, I'll go have a drink with him later

752
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:41,880
Sure, sure

753
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:42,838
Hey

754
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:44,679
aren't the Back Alley guys our enemies?

755
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:45,917
Of course

756
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:49,102
Then why Boss Geta said he'd go drink
with the boss of Back Alley?

757
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,132
Oh, they are buddies

758
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:52,236
They are buddies?

759
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,617
Uh-huh

760
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:55,723
They were sworn brothers

761
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,375
Like the five of us

762
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:59,992
One day you'll get your own block,
I'll have mine

763
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,853
Our subordinates fight
when they see each other

764
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:04,498
But for us on the top, when we meet

765
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,357
having a drink is a must

766
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:09,518
You'd better watch out

767
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,026
I'm not scared of you

768
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:18,649
If you don't tell what's on your mind

769
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:23,695
Who will ever know?

770
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:31,078
Sometimes I really want to

771
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:37,221
Just let out all of my sorrow

772
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:43,280
Stepped into the underground

773
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:49,400
1 shouldn't have

774
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:55,569
Now that I want to undo my mistakes

775
01:12:56,472 --> 01:13:01,742
Who would understand?

776
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:07,835
My love if you know my heart...

777
01:13:18,928 --> 01:13:21,798
Hey, homeboy, what a coincidence

778
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:24,385
l was about to go have a drink with you

779
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:25,914
Who you with?

780
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,985
Wim-Kian, he just got out

781
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,348
Came to welcome him back

782
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,004
How long was he in there?

783
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:34,451
House Cleaning Operation,
it's been three years

784
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,767
Three years already

785
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:38,942
He brought a Mainlander with him

786
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,488
Said the Mainlander
took care of him in there

787
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:43,411
Brought him to introduce to us

788
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,927
Lately I heard those Mainlanders

789
01:13:46,289 --> 01:13:49,358
want a piece of Monga

790
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:54,619
Oh, gimme a break, don't think too much

791
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:58,061
I can't even speak "Mandorin"

792
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:01,380
With them,
there is nothing we can talk about

793
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:07,392
Hey homeboy, I'm thinking, seriously

794
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,450
Couple of events happened
to Wim-Kian’s household

795
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,907
If you can, would you come and say hello?

796
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:17,353
His uncle cheated in games,
I handled it by the book

797
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,200
His cousin raped a woman

798
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,089
I sorted it out for him, too

799
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,798
The street, and business, the rules,
I did everything right

800
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,254
Why should I apologize

801
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,522
to a youngster for things like these?

802
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,635
Nah, you know it

803
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,693
Wim-Kian is like a mad dog

804
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,196
I don't care what kind of dog he is

805
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,524
It's your dog, train it yourself

806
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,523
Geta, nowadays the Grey Wolf's gang

807
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:56,073
is doing very well

808
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:59,105
Boss Masa, please stop teasing me

809
01:14:59,562 --> 01:15:01,582
Did I say it wrong?

810
01:15:02,365 --> 01:15:04,644
Dragon, make a toast

811
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,983
Boss Geta's son

812
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:10,095
My son

813
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:11,982
Dragon, handsome fellow

814
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:13,335
Bro. Grey Wolf

815
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:20,063
Grey Wolf, he's the most promising among

816
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:21,986
the younger generation in Monga

817
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:23,608
We should watch our back

818
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,226
or soon we'll be history

819
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,723
Boss Geta, look

820
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,696
For the past 3 years when I was in there

821
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,488
thanks for taking care of our boss

822
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,533
And people in my household

823
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,040
One day I, Wim-Kian

824
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,736
will do my best to repay you

825
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,655
Now that you're out, you should be happy

826
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:45,848
Saying all this nonsense is useless

827
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,105
Alright, come on, drink up

828
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:49,561
Here, everyone, cheers

829
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,169
Cheers, everyone, drink up

830
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:51,894
Cheers

831
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,313
Wim-Kian

832
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,818
How's your boss doing overseas?

833
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:09,922
He's in good shape physically,
but he's kind of depressed

834
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:12,283
It's hard not to get depressed

835
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,745
Mainlanders are indeed different

836
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:19,984
That Grey Wolf,
he moves a finger and the cigarette comes

837
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,959
The glass gets refilled
as soon as it got empty

838
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:23,834
It's like they were telepathic

839
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:25,702
And the whole group

840
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,512
stood still in the back all night long

841
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:28,933
Tall and straight like the Military Police

842
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,771
My legs got sore by just looking at them

843
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,963
Sigh, Monga is hopeless

844
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:34,029
So maybe you should

845
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,550
join them if you like them so much

846
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:36,681
You shitting me?

847
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,389
They just look more impressive

848
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,011
Wouldn't we look cool if we act like them?

849
01:16:41,497 --> 01:16:43,017
I think they look phony

850
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:45,799
Yeah, bunch of fakes

851
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:48,269
You know that Grey Wolf?

852
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:50,571
You know him personally?

853
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:54,256
No, my mom does

854
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,542
Your mom's sleeping with him?

855
01:16:58,147 --> 01:16:59,227
Fuck, shut your face

856
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,157
Ah-ha, something fishy here

857
01:17:03,486 --> 01:17:04,796
If your mom doesn't want him

858
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:06,704
give him to my mom. He is her type.

859
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,049
Shut up

860
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:14,956
Is it good?

861
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:16,840
Hmn, it's good

862
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,948
Then I'll bring some more next time

863
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:22,157
OK

864
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:31,138
Did you have a tough time
in the mountains?

865
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,109
What's up with you?

866
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:40,941
You look not yourself today

867
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,255
l ran into someone I don't like

868
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:50,365
Who was it?

869
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:55,506
My mom's ex, before she married my dad

870
01:17:58,574 --> 01:18:00,384
My mom said she'd been
with him since she was 16

871
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,040
But one day

872
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,844
He left without a word

873
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:09,456
And disappeared until a few years ago

874
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:18,354
Are you gonna disappear
like him someday?

875
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,311
You're scared that I'll disappear?

876
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,349
Silly

877
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:35,085
Why call me silly

878
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:36,201
I won't

879
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,131
What did you say?

880
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,058
Something nice that
I'm not gonna say again

881
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,419
Hey boss, a barbequed chicken leg

882
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:30,510
OK, OK, right away

883
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:38,436
I'll get one more then

884
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:39,467
OK OK

885
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,011
Boss, have a chicken leg

886
01:19:57,393 --> 01:19:58,003
Oh

887
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,214
Come, sit here

888
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:10,528
You grew up without a father?

889
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,240
That obvious?

890
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,733
Leave us;
kids shouldn't listen to adults' discussion

891
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:24,709
OK

892
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:29,047
Boss Masa

893
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:33,804
l heard you've been working

894
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:35,992
with the Mainlanders,
why didn't you tell me?

895
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,787
Who is talking such nonsense?

896
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,829
Words spread fast

897
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,518
Gimme a break

898
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,076
I can't even speak Mandarin

899
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,431
how do I work with the Mainlanders?

900
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,370
You really buy that shit?

901
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,322
Seriously, no?

902
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:04,494
They did talk to me about it

903
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,950
But I haven't agreed

904
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,429
That means yes then,
and you're still playin' dumb with me?

905
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:15,592
I've told Wim-Kian about this

906
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:18,065
If Boss Geta doesn't agree

907
01:21:18,507 --> 01:21:20,257
then I won't do it

908
01:21:23,846 --> 01:21:25,625
Our Monga is an old town

909
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:29,849
We have our own way
and traditions in managing this place

910
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:32,382
We don't want to work with outsiders

911
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,851
Masa and I are no exception

912
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,366
l understand

913
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:50,114
How about this?

914
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,644
In the beginning I won't show up

915
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:56,652
And you two bosses
still handle everything

916
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:59,049
We can observe each other for a while

917
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,291
Until we've reached certain level of
understanding and trust

918
01:22:01,717 --> 01:22:02,977
Then we'll go from there

919
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:04,868
Moreover

920
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:06,954
The business I run outside of Monga

921
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:09,545
If you are interested, please let me know

922
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:11,514
I would love to have you join me

923
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,090
Thanks a lot

924
01:22:14,897 --> 01:22:16,126
I think we better stay in Monga

925
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:18,715
with our small business

926
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:21,571
We don't know much
about the outside world

927
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,880
We are not interested in running around

928
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,723
What about Boss Masa,
what do you think?

929
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:40,006
My position is very simple

930
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:41,976
Whatever Boss Geta says

931
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:44,317
I do my best to follow suit

932
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:52,765
Yeah, you are the shit now

933
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:56,528
Dozens of block bosses,
with losts of grease to go around

934
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:58,569
And then

935
01:22:58,941 --> 01:23:00,691
Fucking old asses getting in your way

936
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:01,459
Look at your bosses:

937
01:23:01,677 --> 01:23:03,666
drink all day, the women, a great life

938
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:06,572
Eventually, they will suck Monga dry

939
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:08,922
It's such a wonderful land, what a waste

940
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,694
Look at our Big Boss

941
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:19,613
He's got brains

942
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,894
He doesn't sleep,
he spends his days thinking

943
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,545
Thinking about how
to develop the organization

944
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:28,521
Now, as soon as he gives an order,
it'll be like cell division

945
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:32,264
We'll no longer be just a gang of hundreds

946
01:23:32,808 --> 01:23:34,798
But tens of thousands, I am telling you

947
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,023
Guns will be brought in by sea in boxes

948
01:23:37,446 --> 01:23:39,256
Halls will be established one after another

949
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:40,580
And you

950
01:23:41,884 --> 01:23:43,024
Hanging out on your block

951
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:46,012
Selling toilet paper and selected tea,
collecting fees

952
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:48,365
Getting turned in every now and then

953
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:51,221
Times are changing, bro

954
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,680
Do it right

955
01:23:55,097 --> 01:23:57,267
We set up a hall in Monga,
and you'll be the Boss

956
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,181
Each of us needs our own stage

957
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,050
The world is going to be ours

958
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:17,706
It's gonna be difficult
if there's only one hall for the entire Monga

959
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:21,071
The two major powers in Monga

960
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:23,266
Are our Back Alley and the Temple Front

961
01:24:23,692 --> 01:24:25,742
We've got our own blocks on each side

962
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,492
You won't have any problem with me

963
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:30,160
But if you wanna make this work

964
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:32,929
You'll have to include the Temple Front

965
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,425
Otherwise you'll have to
deal with all the blocks behind them

966
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:36,854
It won't be easy

967
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,363
It's gonna be a tough fight

968
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:46,383
You got someone from the Temple Front?

969
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,500
I still remember four years ago, right here

970
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:11,875
You were against over a dozen
from Da Dao Cheng

971
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,308
I saw them beating the life out of you

972
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,410
Still you wouldn't give in

973
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:20,236
l owe you for that

974
01:25:20,749 --> 01:25:22,148
No need to thank me

975
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:24,067
It was because you've got balls

976
01:25:26,822 --> 01:25:28,162
If you weren't tough enough

977
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:30,983
Even if you got beaten to death
in front of me 100 times

978
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:33,133
I wouldn't give a shit

979
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:38,672
Really, 1 owe you a lot

980
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:43,287
And that thing about the Dog Boy

981
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,148
lam fully aware

982
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,218
Dragon messed with
somebody's girlfriend four years ago

983
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,609
But you took on the heat

984
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:01,685
Can we spare Dragon?

985
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,262
What? You want to protect your brother?

986
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,074
Look

987
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:15,679
lam afraid that
we are losing the entire Monga

988
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:16,760
you know that?

989
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,300
It's like the last years of Ching Dynasty

990
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,082
All the foreign powers
have surrounded China with

991
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:24,284
their firearms, canons and ships

992
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:28,434
That old empress Tz'u-Hsi still thought
she could bring them all down

993
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:32,775
That's exactly what's happening in Monga

994
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:37,675
Our Boss Masa

995
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:40,479
puts on fancy clothes
and fools around everyday

996
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:44,463
And your Boss Geta is a stubbern old fool

997
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,150
The future is knocking on the door,
and Monga is still asleep

998
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,382
They all call me mad dog

999
01:26:56,178 --> 01:26:57,077
They are right

1000
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:02,137
But I had been thinking a lot
during the 3 years in prison

1001
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,956
My boss turned me in
during the Big Crackdown

1002
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,531
That Dragon, you took on the beating

1003
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,303
every time he screwed up

1004
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:18,268
That's the kind of fate for people like us

1005
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:25,945
Now the Mainlanders are asking nicely
to do business with us

1006
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:29,588
The proud old folks
refused right on the spot

1007
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,737
When the time comes,
who's put on the frontline?

1008
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,240
No one else but you and me

1009
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:40,321
It's guns in their hands

1010
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,520
You really think you can
fight them with a stabbing tube?

1011
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:46,743
Don't feel ashamed
to work with the outsiders

1012
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:48,346
You really think I'll let

1013
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,500
the Mainlanders take over Monga?

1014
01:27:52,234 --> 01:27:53,964
Look who's thinking for Monga

1015
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:57,471
Shoot, talking is useless

1016
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:05,881
Holy crap, all that wind, and now the rain

1017
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,795
Is the typhoon really coming?

1018
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:18,201
Boss Masa have a good night, come again

1019
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:22,123
And you, don't run around, be good

1020
01:28:36,378 --> 01:28:38,688
Ah, you came for Auntie Ai as well?

1021
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:44,949
Boss

1022
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:46,964
Boss Geta is here
with all of his Temple Front

1023
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:48,839
brothers, to pay their respect

1024
01:28:49,224 --> 01:28:51,804
Please bless them, so that they are safe,
healthy and prosperous

1025
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:03,599
Homeboy, rest in peace

1026
01:29:05,407 --> 01:29:07,217
l swear right here, on my name

1027
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:09,652
That I will find the murderer

1028
01:29:10,045 --> 01:29:11,335
To do your vengeance

1029
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,989
My condolence, take care

1030
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,090
Boss Geta

1031
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,115
I have mobilized everyone
in the Back Alley

1032
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:39,201
I've also notified Taoyuan,
Chungli and the South

1033
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:40,821
Boss, if you can help us find him

1034
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:42,632
I'd very much appreciate

1035
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:44,531
We have to get A-Chung

1036
01:29:44,913 --> 01:29:48,013
l want him kneel in front of our boss,
and pay back with his life

1037
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,204
I'll help you find A-Chung

1038
01:29:52,454 --> 01:29:55,063
But we don't need to kill him

1039
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:58,900
I'll find out if he's the murderer

1040
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:01,547
Who knows? Maybe it's your own man

1041
01:30:01,997 --> 01:30:03,957
who did this, then frame him

1042
01:30:05,267 --> 01:30:07,787
Boss, how can you say this?

1043
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:08,913
Are you saying that

1044
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:11,130
our men killed our own boss?

1045
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,123
Fuck, I'd say someone
from you Temple Front killed him

1046
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:19,366
Don't move!

1047
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:24,883
God is watching, we all know what we did

1048
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:49,040
Boss, got news from the Back Alley

1049
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:50,884
They said A-Chung
is spotted nearby the Watergate

1050
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:53,686
Now they and the Da Dao Cheng
people are all out to get him

1051
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:56,153
Boss

1052
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:58,836
l heard A-Chung is around Watergate

1053
01:30:59,087 --> 01:30:59,697
Everyone, go get him now

1054
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:01,005
OK let's go

1055
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,670
You go with them

1056
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:13,638
Boss, what about you?

1057
01:31:13,902 --> 01:31:15,832
There's nothing to worry about,
I'm on my own turf

1058
01:31:16,271 --> 01:31:17,441
Go, hurry

1059
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,780
Boss, you're closing

1060
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:28,262
Yeah

1061
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:32,062
Everybody's out to get A-Chung,
not much business around here

1062
01:31:33,755 --> 01:31:35,895
All of the Temple Front went?

1063
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,465
Your Boss Geta, I think he stayed

1064
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:46,616
Then please make two for me

1065
01:31:47,035 --> 01:31:48,325
Please

1066
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,520
OK

1067
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:05,134
Sorry, come early tomorrow

1068
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:08,340
We came all the way from the South,
can we just do a brief prayer?

1069
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:09,760
Oh

1070
01:33:57,432 --> 01:34:03,911
Boss, boss

1071
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:05,933
Anybody?

1072
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:07,971
Anybody here?

1073
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:09,859
Call the ambulance

1074
01:34:10,245 --> 01:34:11,945
Hurry call the ambulance

1075
01:34:20,522 --> 01:34:21,572
Boss

1076
01:34:27,362 --> 01:34:29,732
Somebody?

1077
01:34:31,366 --> 01:34:33,976
Call the ambulance

1078
01:34:44,946 --> 01:34:46,906
Anybody here?

1079
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:05,895
Boss Dragon is gone

1080
01:35:11,573 --> 01:35:13,243
I told Dragon not to come today

1081
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:16,040
If Dragon shows up today, he will die

1082
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,884
Those bastards want our Dragon dead

1083
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,110
They want us dead

1084
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,991
they want us at the Temple Front all dead

1085
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,083
Can't you see what's happening?

1086
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:26,700
I'll go find him

1087
01:35:27,622 --> 01:35:28,172
You stay right here

1088
01:35:28,423 --> 01:35:29,273
I don't want him back,
I don't want him here

1089
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,017
Don't you go get him

1090
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:32,702
our Geta will understand

1091
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:35,021
Madam, madam, calm down, have a seat

1092
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:38,942
I don't want him back

1093
01:35:39,601 --> 01:35:41,621
don't bring him back

1094
01:37:09,123 --> 01:37:09,442
Who is it?

1095
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,297
It's me, me

1096
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:14,601
It's OK now

1097
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:33,036
It's me

1098
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:47,049
It's time, can't wait anymore

1099
01:37:48,796 --> 01:37:50,316
Who will hold the memorial tablet then?

1100
01:37:54,135 --> 01:37:54,985
I'll do it

1101
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,968
Geta or Masa, take your pick

1102
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:39,339
Geta

1103
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:44,960
Goddamn sons of bitches

1104
01:38:45,353 --> 01:38:47,813
How dare you, getting all despicable
in front of Master God

1105
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:50,940
You two go from the back door

1106
01:38:52,894 --> 01:38:54,004
Go now

1107
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:05,675
If you don't kill them today

1108
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,930
One day they'll kill you

1109
01:41:12,366 --> 01:41:14,036
l want them to pay with their blood

1110
01:41:17,705 --> 01:41:19,105
Why are you pushing me?

1111
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:23,883
Motherfucker

1112
01:41:27,615 --> 01:41:28,985
You think we're their match?

1113
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:30,690
How on Earth do you think
we can do anything about it?

1114
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:32,948
Boss Geta is dead, Boss Masa is dead too

1115
01:41:33,654 --> 01:41:34,204
Aren't you humans?

1116
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:35,655
Don't you have any feelings?

1117
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:37,690
Do you even have feelings?

1118
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:39,232
Don't you be stirring things up

1119
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:40,893
How do we revenge
without knowing who did it?

1120
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:43,184
It's Wim-Kian, must be him

1121
01:41:43,631 --> 01:41:45,851
Everybody knows it,
but no one dares to touch him

1122
01:41:46,334 --> 01:41:47,324
Motherfucker

1123
01:41:47,635 --> 01:41:49,185
No! Stop it!

1124
01:41:49,804 --> 01:41:50,534
Monk

1125
01:41:52,473 --> 01:41:54,783
Stop it, Monk

1126
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:57,036
Stop it

1127
01:42:08,556 --> 01:42:10,486
At this point, revenge is suicide

1128
01:42:17,565 --> 01:42:19,585
Besides, Dragon can't stay in Monga

1129
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:27,294
You three

1130
01:42:28,042 --> 01:42:29,972
take Dragon to the Philippines,
lay low for a while

1131
01:42:31,012 --> 01:42:32,272
I'll stay and investigate

1132
01:42:33,614 --> 01:42:35,193
We need evidence

1133
01:42:38,386 --> 01:42:39,466
I'll stay too

1134
01:42:56,771 --> 01:42:59,141
Do you remember,
the night Boss Geta died

1135
01:43:00,074 --> 01:43:02,263
You were all sent to find that A-Chung

1136
01:43:04,645 --> 01:43:05,815
Have you ever thought

1137
01:43:06,147 --> 01:43:07,817
it could just be a smoke bomb?

1138
01:43:32,473 --> 01:43:32,933
A-Shing

1139
01:43:33,841 --> 01:43:35,151
The thing, I want it done tomorrow

1140
01:43:35,509 --> 01:43:37,439
OK, no problem, leave it to me

1141
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,928
Get some rest Boss, I'm heading off

1142
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:06,789
Monkey is involved in an armed assault

1143
01:44:07,174 --> 01:44:08,164
Now the police suspects that

1144
01:44:08,476 --> 01:44:09,175
the gun in his possesion

1145
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:11,313
is the same one that killed

1146
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:12,826
the Back Alley boss

1147
01:44:13,147 --> 01:44:14,607
You pathetic liars

1148
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:17,702
My Monkey is still at school

1149
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:19,832
What did you take me here for?

1150
01:44:20,221 --> 01:44:21,271
I gotta hurry home

1151
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:23,079
and cook for him

1152
01:45:06,767 --> 01:45:07,757
Fuck your sorry ass

1153
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:10,088
Dragon, don't do that

1154
01:45:11,038 --> 01:45:11,708
Let's go

1155
01:45:14,441 --> 01:45:15,260
Ignore 'em

1156
01:45:19,613 --> 01:45:21,073
Why are they like this?

1157
01:45:23,417 --> 01:45:25,347
Because Monkey killed Boss Masa

1158
01:45:26,554 --> 01:45:27,694
Apparently Boss Geta
ordered Monkey to do it

1159
01:45:27,955 --> 01:45:30,235
so he could take over the Back Alley

1160
01:45:30,724 --> 01:45:32,624
Then they in turn killed
Boss Geta and Blackie

1161
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,030
Temple Front did something like this

1162
01:45:35,429 --> 01:45:37,269
The gang has lost people's respect

1163
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:39,008
What are you talking about?

1164
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:42,111
Monkey didn't kill Boss Masa

1165
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:49,141
Then you go explain to everybody

1166
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:51,240
What is the reason that made

1167
01:45:51,579 --> 01:45:53,279
Monkey become the scapegoat?

1168
01:46:14,235 --> 01:46:15,105
Something to drink?

1169
01:46:15,402 --> 01:46:16,862
lam just here to ask you a question

1170
01:46:17,238 --> 01:46:18,348
Then I'm out of here

1171
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:21,671
Have a seat

1172
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:32,513
Hey you guys take a break,
Grey Wolf Bro. has a meeting

1173
01:46:46,634 --> 01:46:48,444
Why did you leave my mom
in the first place?

1174
01:46:51,005 --> 01:46:52,025
Something went wrong

1175
01:46:52,706 --> 01:46:53,666
Had to get away

1176
01:46:54,875 --> 01:46:56,425
Then why didn't you explain to her?

1177
01:47:00,547 --> 01:47:01,887
Because then she would
have waited for me

1178
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:04,760
Didn't want her to waste her youth waiting

1179
01:47:09,023 --> 01:47:10,723
Then, if you were given a second chance

1180
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,679
Would you stay with her?

1181
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:17,900
We only live once

1182
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:21,284
I've run out of my chances

1183
01:47:21,568 --> 01:47:22,438
Yes

1184
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:25,971
You still have a chance

1185
01:47:27,775 --> 01:47:29,964
If something happens to me,
please take good care of her

1186
01:47:31,512 --> 01:47:32,682
What are you talking about?

1187
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:35,968
I'm warning you

1188
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:38,690
Your mom went through hell to raise you

1189
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:40,586
You owe her your life

1190
01:47:40,587 --> 01:47:41,457
You get me?

1191
01:47:41,755 --> 01:47:44,625
But Boss Geta died in my arms

1192
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:48,816
I can never forget how he died in my arms

1193
01:48:02,276 --> 01:48:03,066
You know what?

1194
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:06,688
Whichever way the wind blows

1195
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:10,259
The grass bends along

1196
01:48:14,922 --> 01:48:17,291
When I was young
I thought I was the wind

1197
01:48:22,696 --> 01:48:24,476
But eventually it cost me dearly

1198
01:48:26,934 --> 01:48:28,774
Then I realized we're all just grass

1199
01:48:44,485 --> 01:48:46,325
You are still young, you've got options

1200
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:51,056
Go to the Philippines
and lay low for a while

1201
01:48:53,227 --> 01:48:55,367
What's gonna happen in Monga
nobody knows

1202
01:49:29,696 --> 01:49:30,456
I need to speak to Monk

1203
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:34,769
I've made up my mind,
I'll go to the Philippines too

1204
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,950
I'll be in the Philippines
for a couple months

1205
01:49:51,885 --> 01:49:54,055
You haven't served in the military,
how do you get out of the country?

1206
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:00,510
Unregistered boat

1207
01:50:09,703 --> 01:50:10,993
I will be back soon

1208
01:50:20,514 --> 01:50:22,534
I've asked Auntie how much you owe her

1209
01:50:26,887 --> 01:50:28,666
l'll figure out a way to get that money

1210
01:50:31,191 --> 01:50:32,361
When I come back

1211
01:50:34,328 --> 01:50:36,288
I'll get you out of here

1212
01:50:45,172 --> 01:50:47,281
I'll take you to the movies some time

1213
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:51,320
How's that possible

1214
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:54,398
If 1 get caught, they'll break my legs

1215
01:50:55,816 --> 01:50:57,486
Auntie promised me, personally

1216
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:01,228
She'll tell them
that you're going for abortion

1217
01:53:02,576 --> 01:53:02,956
Here

1218
01:53:03,176 --> 01:53:03,876
Cheers

1219
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:08,147
Grey Wolf, that's it then, we're heading off

1220
01:53:08,482 --> 01:53:09,472
Sure

1221
01:53:14,488 --> 01:53:15,338
Scar, see them to the door

1222
01:53:15,622 --> 01:53:16,142
Yes, sir

1223
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:17,470
That's it

1224
01:53:18,258 --> 01:53:19,428
There's no problem right?

1225
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:20,550
Don't worry

1226
01:53:35,942 --> 01:53:37,372
You need to do it nice and clean

1227
01:53:38,345 --> 01:53:40,455
Don't leave behind anything
that'd make us lose sleep

1228
01:53:42,115 --> 01:53:44,255
He already agreed to get on
the boat with them

1229
01:53:44,718 --> 01:53:47,178
And then,
what are we gonna do when he's back?

1230
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:46,943
Mom, I left some savings in your closet

1231
01:54:47,848 --> 01:54:48,838
Why in my closet?

1232
01:54:49,149 --> 01:54:52,139
Deposit it in the bank,
and you can earn interest

1233
01:54:56,022 --> 01:54:57,072
Then you do it for me

1234
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:34,477
Boss Geta, excuse me,
please lend me your 2-feet

1235
01:55:35,495 --> 01:55:38,365
Bless me, and help me to find the truth

1236
01:56:02,556 --> 01:56:04,285
Boy, go get the car

1237
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,160
I'm leaving everything to you

1238
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:54,849
OK, take care

1239
01:57:01,982 --> 01:57:02,802
Let's go yeah?

1240
01:57:03,483 --> 01:57:04,273
Wait

1241
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:08,313
Let's go pray to the Master God for a sec

1242
01:57:12,192 --> 01:57:13,622
What you talking this shit to me for?

1243
01:57:15,962 --> 01:57:17,982
I'm afraid you won't be able to
explain to Sister Ling

1244
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:21,120
Explain to whom?

1245
01:57:22,569 --> 01:57:24,649
I'm a goddamn gangster,
who am I answering to?

1246
01:57:26,006 --> 01:57:27,556
He's not my son for God's sake

1247
01:57:38,351 --> 01:57:40,340
Get the car; we're going to Monga

1248
01:57:46,459 --> 01:57:47,249
He's not here

1249
01:57:48,528 --> 01:57:50,698
Oh, earlier he told me
to deposit money for him

1250
01:58:02,709 --> 01:58:05,549
What's up with all this money?

1251
01:58:11,518 --> 01:58:13,738
All his regular clothes are gone

1252
01:58:26,566 --> 01:58:27,496
Why is the postcard I sent you

1253
01:58:27,801 --> 01:58:29,171
in Yi Mong's closet?

1254
01:58:44,751 --> 01:58:46,591
How could you keep me
in the dark for so many years?

1255
01:59:34,401 --> 01:59:36,800
Shut the door, go shut the door

1256
01:59:39,939 --> 01:59:40,869
What are you doing?

1257
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:41,904
Yeah, Mosquito, what you doing?

1258
01:59:42,075 --> 01:59:43,245
Stay where you are

1259
01:59:45,512 --> 01:59:47,062
l want to know something

1260
01:59:48,114 --> 01:59:49,284
Tell us

1261
01:59:49,616 --> 01:59:50,636
Are you sending us to the boat

1262
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:52,290
or to Hell?

1263
01:59:53,486 --> 01:59:54,066
What the fuck?

1264
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:55,400
There is no boat, right?

1265
01:59:55,722 --> 01:59:56,682
Mosquito, can you put down the knife first?

1266
01:59:56,990 --> 01:59:58,630
If there's a misunderstanding,
we can sort it out

1267
01:59:59,025 --> 02:00:00,315
There's no misunderstanding

1268
02:00:01,528 --> 02:00:02,958
Listen

1269
02:00:03,329 --> 02:00:05,259
Tonight, there is no boat but trap

1270
02:00:06,599 --> 02:00:08,679
Thre's no way we're
getting to the Philippines

1271
02:00:10,103 --> 02:00:10,893
Monk

1272
02:00:11,171 --> 02:00:12,461
Explain, what's going on?

1273
02:00:12,806 --> 02:00:13,885
What's the deal?

1274
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:15,377
Why did Mosquito say something like that?

1275
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:16,579
What's the situation?

1276
02:00:16,876 --> 02:00:17,866
Mosquito, have you lost your mind?

1277
02:00:18,178 --> 02:00:19,468
Say it!

1278
02:00:27,053 --> 02:00:28,952
We swore to be brothers,
at the very same place

1279
02:00:30,824 --> 02:00:32,494
And now one of you's
putting a knife against my neck

1280
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:34,702
Another one is starting to doubt me

1281
02:00:36,196 --> 02:00:36,956
What the fuck is this?

1282
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:39,839
If you've go the fucking guts,
tell the truth in front of the Master God

1283
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:41,934
If 1 misunderstood you

1284
02:00:42,202 --> 02:00:43,572
feel free to give me a stab

1285
02:00:45,004 --> 02:00:46,584
But if you are the traitor
who sold out the Temple Front

1286
02:00:46,973 --> 02:00:48,343
l want you to pay with your life

1287
02:00:48,708 --> 02:00:49,668
Sell out?

1288
02:00:50,744 --> 02:00:52,473
How could that be Monk?

1289
02:00:52,879 --> 02:00:53,839
Can you please stop this shit? OK?

1290
02:00:54,147 --> 02:00:55,667
Stop acting like this

1291
02:00:56,483 --> 02:00:57,213
I saw him with Wim-Kian

1292
02:00:57,484 --> 02:00:59,154
and Grey Wolf, with my own eyes

1293
02:01:10,563 --> 02:01:11,173
Your mama

1294
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:15,590
Not my day

1295
02:01:26,179 --> 02:01:27,319
Times are changing

1296
02:01:29,048 --> 02:01:30,718
The outside world is changing

1297
02:01:32,185 --> 02:01:33,885
If we are as stubborn as the old bosses

1298
02:01:34,287 --> 02:01:35,837
we'll be dead sooner or later

1299
02:01:36,222 --> 02:01:38,182
The entire Monga will fall into their hands

1300
02:01:39,659 --> 02:01:41,739
I met with Grey Wolf and Wim-Kian,
was to save Monga

1301
02:01:42,195 --> 02:01:43,014
To save

1302
02:01:45,431 --> 02:01:46,330
The Temple Front

1303
02:01:49,068 --> 02:01:50,528
So, did you kill my dad?

1304
02:01:52,939 --> 02:01:54,719
You're the one who killed my dad?

1305
02:02:03,483 --> 02:02:04,273
Kill them

1306
02:02:06,619 --> 02:02:08,018
Motherfuckers

1307
02:07:00,713 --> 02:07:01,793
Everything I do

1308
02:07:05,184 --> 02:07:06,444
is for you

1309
02:07:42,822 --> 02:07:43,722
Have you seen Mosquito?

1310
02:08:28,201 --> 02:08:28,931
Go get everybody

1311
02:08:29,202 --> 02:08:30,542
Should we go take a look?

1312
02:09:14,347 --> 02:09:16,047
If you got on the boat,
then we wouldn't end up like this

1313
02:09:17,883 --> 02:09:19,223
Why didn't you just get on the boat?

1314
02:09:20,186 --> 02:09:21,675
Why are you making me do this?

1315
02:10:03,729 --> 02:10:04,779
Go ahead and kill me

1316
02:10:06,432 --> 02:10:07,892
If you don't kill me today

1317
02:10:09,435 --> 02:10:11,215
I will kill you tomorrow

1318
02:10:13,806 --> 02:10:14,535
I never understood

1319
02:10:14,807 --> 02:10:17,057
what's the point in all this fighting

1320
02:10:19,211 --> 02:10:21,351
Now I am even more confused

1321
02:10:21,814 --> 02:10:22,894
You're my brother

1322
02:10:23,215 --> 02:10:25,085
but I have to kill you

1323
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,650
Because this is the street

1324
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:33,320
Because we're gangsters

1325
02:10:35,394 --> 02:10:36,884
Whoever gets in the way dies

1326
02:10:38,397 --> 02:10:40,387
There's no other choice

1327
02:10:42,635 --> 02:10:43,975
If this were the way of the street

1328
02:10:48,007 --> 02:10:49,876
Then I am not a gangster

1329
02:10:51,711 --> 02:10:53,441
lam in this for friendship

1330
02:10:55,448 --> 02:10:57,468
lam in this for brotherhood

1331
02:11:11,997 --> 02:11:16,477
Guns are weapons for the lowly

1332
02:11:34,687 --> 02:11:35,587
Monk

1333
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:39,660
You thought I was going to embrace you

1334
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:42,540
So you opened your arms

1335
02:11:44,096 --> 02:11:45,406
At that moment

1336
02:11:45,898 --> 02:11:48,478
You chose to believe in me, didn't you?

1337
02:11:50,269 --> 02:11:52,489
You thought you were in this as a gangster

1338
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:57,989
But like me, you're here for friendship
and brotherhood, too

1339
02:12:07,553 --> 02:12:10,423
You thought Geta was a decent man?

1340
02:12:12,658 --> 02:12:14,408
He wanted to become the Boss

1341
02:12:15,828 --> 02:12:17,378
So he chopped off my dad's arm

1342
02:12:19,865 --> 02:12:22,735
Did you know how he treated his brothers?

1343
02:12:56,435 --> 02:12:58,215
What's good in the cinema lately?

1344
02:12:59,905 --> 02:13:00,985
Dumb Recruit is pretty funny

1345
02:13:02,041 --> 02:13:02,911
Really

1346
02:14:19,518 --> 02:14:21,248
Mosquito, are you OK?

1347
02:14:26,492 --> 02:14:28,742
Dragon, Dragon

1348
02:14:29,461 --> 02:14:31,241
Hurry, let's go

1349
02:14:33,999 --> 02:14:35,139
Dragon

1350
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:02,860
Look, something happened

1351
02:15:03,195 --> 02:15:05,415
Go look for some guy called Mosquito

1352
02:15:32,758 --> 02:15:33,748
Where's my ear?

1353
02:15:53,245 --> 02:15:54,035
Some say

1354
02:15:54,713 --> 02:15:57,873
Joining the gang is like getting a bad lot

1355
02:15:58,784 --> 02:16:00,214
You end up either living in exile

1356
02:16:00,586 --> 02:16:02,226
Or getting brutally murdered on the streets

1357
02:16:03,522 --> 02:16:06,682
But that year, me and my brothers

1358
02:16:07,693 --> 02:16:09,243
we all believed joining the gang

1359
02:16:09,628 --> 02:16:10,798
using violence to gain control

1360
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:12,420
was the way to rule

1361
02:16:13,565 --> 02:16:16,844
The only way for survival

1362
02:16:24,977 --> 02:16:26,847
Why do the four of you want to recruit me?

1363
02:16:30,582 --> 02:16:32,132
Because it takes five fingers

1364
02:16:32,518 --> 02:16:33,888
to form a fist

1365
02:16:59,077 --> 02:17:03,438
“Monga,
in Ketagalan (aboriginal tribe lived in Taipei)
dialect, means canoe.
