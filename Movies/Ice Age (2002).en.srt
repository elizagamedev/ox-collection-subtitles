1
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,321
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

2
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,498
I'm just sayin’,
how do we know it's an ice age?

3
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,284
Because of all the ice.

4
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,266
Well, things just got a little chillier.

5
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,841
Help. Help.

6
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,285
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin’.

7
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,835
But, but, but, Dad.

8
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,625
No buts. You can play extinction later.

9
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:24,284
OK. Come on, guys.

10
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,815
So, where's Eddie?

11
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,506
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

12
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,851
Really?

13
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,950
I'm flying.

14
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,510
Some breakthrough.

15
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,131
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

16
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,261
Crazy mammoth.

17
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,426
Do the world a favor.
Move your issues off the road.

18
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,091
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

19
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,959
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

20
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,608
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

21
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,003
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

22
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,073
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

23
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,334
I'm up. I'm up.

24
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:36,725
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

25
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,867
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

26
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:46,227
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

27
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,459
They left without me.
They do this every year.

28
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,642
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

29
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:03,202
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

30
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,299
All right, I'll just go by myself.

31
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,597
Sick.

32
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,303
Wide body, curb it next time.

33
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,932
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

34
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,458
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

35
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,996
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

36
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,614
- 1 thought the frost wiped ‘em all out.
- All but one.

37
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,829
It makes me so... wanna... Yuck.

38
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,586
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin’, buddy?

39
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,513
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

40
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:49,495
It's just a fact. No offense. You probably
didn't even know what I'm talkin’ about.

41
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,074
Yummo.

42
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,089
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

43
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,597
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

44
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,767
He ruined our salad.

45
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,851
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...

46
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,097
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

47
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,881
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favorite.

48
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:21,183
Delicious. That's good eating.

49
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,932
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

50
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,871
Tasty, isn't it? Bon appétit.

51
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,482
Now?

52
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,025
Now.

53
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,736
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- 1 wanted to hit him at full speed.

54
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,960
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

55
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,572
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin’ a scene.

56
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,568
We'll just take our furry pifiata and go.

57
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,609
If it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

58
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,128
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

59
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,510
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

60
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,744
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

61
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,094
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

62
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,616
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

63
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,747
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

64
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,223
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

65
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,410
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

66
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,478
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

67
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,376
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

68
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,515
Get him.

69
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,562
A dandelion?

70
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,504
We did it.

71
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,488
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

72
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,813
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

73
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,587
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

74
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,703
- Wow, really?
-No.

75
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,098
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

76
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,122
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- 1 guess not. Bye.

77
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,109
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

78
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,713
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

79
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,341
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

80
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,885
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin’ about in the wild.

81
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,886
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

82
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,504
You're a very shrewd mammal.

83
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,463
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

84
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,669
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

85
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:29,621
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

86
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,572
Stop following me.

87
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:41,633
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

88
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,846
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

89
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:37,475
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?
- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

90
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:43,301
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

91
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,857
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

92
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,470
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabers.

93
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,819
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

94
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:59,288
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

95
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,549
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

96
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,483
Phew. I'm wiped out.

97
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,302
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

98
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,279
-I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

99
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:41,318
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

100
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,075
Fascinating.

101
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:48,201
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

102
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,704
Think I saw a spark.

103
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,010
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol’ pal?

104
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,740
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

105
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,283
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

106
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:15,217
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

107
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,202
You should see what they did last year.

108
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,027
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

109
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,894
and they gagged me with a field mouse,

110
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,527
covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

111
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,536
and... who needs ‘em, anyway?

112
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,495
So what about you? You have family?

113
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,768
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

114
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,794
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

115
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,048
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

116
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,341
Manny.

117
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,307
There's Diego. Fall back.

118
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,639
- Where's the baby?
- lost it over the falls.

119
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,409
You lost it?

120
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,838
- 1 want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.

121
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,477
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

122
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,998
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

123
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,579
It had better be alive.

124
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:22,329
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

125
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,932
Let's go.

126
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,577
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
“If you have an extra mating dance,

127
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,418
at least pick a female
with the same color pelt."

128
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,864
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me."

129
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,631
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

130
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,078
- Now get away from me.
- 1 think mating for life is stupid.

131
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,511
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

132
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,161
Manny?

133
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,863
Manny?

134
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,102
Look at that. He's OK.

135
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,187
She's gone.

136
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,196
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
-No.

137
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,283
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

138
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,067
But you can't leave him here.

139
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,517
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

140
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,671
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we."

141
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:01,178
There never was a "we." In fact,
without me, there wouldn't even be a"you."

142
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:08,841
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

143
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:14,252
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

144
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,966
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

145
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:22,231
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

146
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,722
No, we don't.

147
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,410
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

148
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,264
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

149
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,507
I'm gonna die.

150
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,545
Manny.

151
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,951
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

152
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,455
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

153
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,548
There is no “us.”

154
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,797
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

155
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,994
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

156
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,584
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

157
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,956
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

158
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,122
- Callin’ me a liar?
- 1 didn't say that.

159
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,291
You were thinkin’ it.

160
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,904
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

161
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,980
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

162
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:14,904
Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin’ for the
humans, you're wastin’ your time. They left.

163
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,585
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

164
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,674
I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

165
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:26,372
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

166
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,722
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

167
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,949
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

168
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,984
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

169
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:45,588
What are you doin’? Just drop it on the ledge.

170
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,851
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

171
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:51,525
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

172
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,746
Don't spear me.

173
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,903
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

174
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,470
That's perfect.

175
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,196
- 1 told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

176
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,982
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

177
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:42,754
They couldn't be far. I mean,
they went this way, or this way?

178
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,371
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

179
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,160
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

180
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,718
You didn't miss them by much.

181
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,061
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

182
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:59,494
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

183
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,618
You don't need this aggravation.

184
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,314
Give me the baby. I can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

185
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,252
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?

186
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,754
- [just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

187
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,448
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

188
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:25,186
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

189
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,591
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

190
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:34,201
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

191
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,389
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.

192
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:50,844
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

193
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,083
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

194
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,337
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

195
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:04,956
No. The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

196
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,824
and the baby, too.

197
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,548
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

198
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:16,894
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

199
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:21,023
”
Uber-tracker. Up front, where I can see you.

200
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,013
Help me.

201
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,154
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it anymore.

202
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:46,405
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

203
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,849
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

204
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,464
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down..."

205
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,954
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

206
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:58,051
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

207
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,694
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

208
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,493
So if he poops, where does it go?

209
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:09,708
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

210
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,141
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

211
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:16,678
you're small and insignificant,
and I'll pummel you if you don't.

212
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,396
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

213
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,131
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

214
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,108
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.

215
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,988
I'm gonna slip.

216
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,690
It's clean. Got ya!

217
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,074
Will you cut it out?

218
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,632
Do that again. He likes it.

219
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,894
It's makin’ me feel better too.

220
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,280
Here, you hold it.

221
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,572
Turn him towards me.

222
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,043
Where is the baby?

223
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,288
There he is.

224
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,150
Where is the baby?

225
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,812
There he is.

226
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,510
Stop it. You're scarin’ him.

227
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,122
- 1 bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

228
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:30,173
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

229
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,926
l ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

230
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,782
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.

231
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,318
Enough, enough, enough.

232
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,067
Food.

233
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,028
I don't know, but I've been told

234
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,178
I don't know, but I've been told

235
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,182
End of the world be mighty cold

236
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,407
End of the world be mighty cold

237
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,255
Prepare for the Ice age!

238
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,835
Protect the dodo way of life!

239
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:09,998
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!

240
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,899
Protect the dodo way of life!

241
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,286
Prepare for the Ice age!

242
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,325
-Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

243
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,821
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

244
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,744
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders. Intruder...

245
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,713
«burn and die.

246
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,856
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

247
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,218
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the Ice age.

248
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:44,356
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

249
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,797
So you got three melons?

250
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,100
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

251
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,944
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

252
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,928
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

253
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,391
Oh, no. No.

254
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,167
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

255
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,449
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

256
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,648
There goes our last female.

257
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,603
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

258
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,212
The last melon.

259
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,951
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

260
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,181
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

261
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:19,995
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

262
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,925
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

263
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,948
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

264
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,748
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

265
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,019
Bedtime, squirt.

266
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,591
The triumphant return.

267
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,443
Huh? Oh, that.

268
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,729
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

269
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,755
- He's asleep.
- 1 was talking to you.

270
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,879
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

271
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,195
All right, good night.

272
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,033
Will you stop it?

273
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,099
All right, all right. l was trying to relax.

274
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,888
Oy.

275
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,295
- What the... ?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

276
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,961
- I'm workin’ here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

277
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,132
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

278
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:07,145
- What are you two doin’ here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

279
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:12,316
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all."

280
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,636
I have a message for Soto.

281
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,225
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

282
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,685
And tell him I'm bringing...

283
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,371
a mammoth.

284
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,070
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

285
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,167
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

286
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,132
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

287
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:40,254
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

288
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:42,685
Get everyone ready.

289
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,424
Now.

290
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,553
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

291
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:14,625
Sid.

292
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,894
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.

293
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,846
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

294
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,988
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

295
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,522
Sabers were closing in on him.

296
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,491
- So 1 just snatched him.
- So brave.

297
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,183
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

298
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:41,466
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

299
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,299
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, l always say.

300
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,534
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

301
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,825
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...

302
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,676
Hey. Hi, Manny.

303
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,637
What's the matter with you?

304
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,100
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

305
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,877
Sexy.

306
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,549
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

307
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:21,096
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

308
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:25,207
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

309
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,910
- A good-lookin’ guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

310
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:33,401
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

311
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:37,112
- You have a cruel sense of humor.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

312
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,254
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

313
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,785
Manny, I need him.

314
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,361
So, ladies, where were we?

315
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,415
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

316
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:59,223
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

317
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:03,128
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

318
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:07,088
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin’ at, bone bag?

319
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,074
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

320
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:17,812
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

321
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,622
No fangs, no claws.

322
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,002
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

323
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,179
What's so threatening about you?

324
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,301
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

325
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,716
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

326
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,760
You think that's funny? How about this?

327
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,635
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

328
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,549
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.

329
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:08,025
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.

330
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,876
Help. Help.

331
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,252
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

332
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,281
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

333
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,663
Help.

334
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:22,178
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.

335
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,290
Over here.

336
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,494
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

337
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,528
Wait a minute.

338
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,013
He's dead all right.

339
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,261
Carnivores have all the fun.

340
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:56,253
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

341
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,005
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.

342
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,749
Manny. Manny.

343
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:06,868
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

344
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:10,131
You don't know where it's been.

345
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:13,892
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.

346
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,169
- 1 don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

347
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,792
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

348
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:27,234
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

349
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,682
Fellas.

350
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,076
Thanks for waiting.

351
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,804
Three, two, one...

352
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,883
Sure is faithful.

353
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,930
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

354
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:01,133
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.

355
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,884
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

356
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,523
Hiya, Manny.

357
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,642
Hi, Diego.

358
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,572
Hey, Sid.

359
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,508
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.

360
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,122
Ask him directions.

361
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,841
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.

362
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,990
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

363
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,110
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.

364
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:29,453
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

365
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,024
Let me try. Pack.

366
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:36,116
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

367
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,976
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

368
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:42,667
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

369
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,944
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

370
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,593
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

371
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,552
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

372
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,985
Pack of flying fish.

373
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,616
Great news. I found a shortcut.

374
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:51,402
- What do you mean, shortcut?
- 1 mean faster than the long way around.

375
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,933
I know what a shortcut is.

376
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,868
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss ‘em.

377
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,877
Through there? What do you take me for?

378
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:06,437
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

379
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,621
Ora nanny. I never get tired of peekaboo.

380
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,608
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

381
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,516
Sid, the tiger found a shortcut.

382
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,714
No, thanks. I choose life.

383
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,446
Then I suggest you take the shortcut.

384
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:28,269
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

385
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,914
Way to go, tiger.

386
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,500
Quick. Get inside.

387
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,816
OK, I vote shortcut.

388
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:21,942
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

389
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,825
Guys?

390
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,208
A fish.

391
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:45,432
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

392
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,965
I gotcha.

393
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:52,093
Captain, iceberg ahead.

394
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,625
Oh, no.

395
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,192
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

396
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,726
Tell the kid to be more careful.

397
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,839
Look, look. Tigers.

398
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:51,384
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

399
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:58,013
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

400
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,476
You're it.

401
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,682
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloths?

402
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,662
You never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

403
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:11,242
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

404
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,532
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

405
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,906
And he's got a family.

406
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,279
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

407
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,072
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

408
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:27,996
- Sid...
- Find a she-mmoth, have baby mammoths...

409
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:29,689
- Sid.
- What?

410
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:31,784
- Shut up.
- But...

411
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:01,807
Would you look at that.

412
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,839
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

413
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,629
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

414
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:11,759
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

415
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,129
You're almost home.

416
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:21,316
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a news flash

417
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,689
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.

418
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,012
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

419
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:36,161
Tell me that was your stomach.

420
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,502
I'm sure it was just thunder.

421
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:41,633
From underground?

422
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,106
Come on, keep up with me.

423
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,901
I would if you were moving.

424
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:12,423
- 1 wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

425
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:21,057
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

426
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:42,621
Hold Pinky.

427
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,214
Manny.

428
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:32,058
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.

429
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,845
What? What? I can't hear you.

430
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:39,227
You're standing on my trunk.

431
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,525
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

432
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,504
You could have died, trying to save me.

433
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:50,525
That's what you do in a herd.

434
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,814
You look out for each other.

435
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,300
Well, thanks.

436
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:01,701
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

437
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:23,301
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

438
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,120
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

439
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:33,290
First, I'll slice its hindquarters into sections.

440
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,380
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

441
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,251
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

442
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,578
- 1 told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

443
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:47,732
Mammoths don't go down easy.

444
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:50,392
There's only one way to do it.

445
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,057
First, you have to force it into a corner.

446
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:57,520
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

447
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:00,152
I'll go for the throat.

448
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:12,787
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

449
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:19,390
- How much further?
- Three miles.

450
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,759
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

451
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,495
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloths on the map.

452
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:35,566
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

453
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:37,926
And make him rounder.

454
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:44,031
- Perfect.
- 1 forgot how to laugh.

455
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:53,712
I'm a genius.

456
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:01,984
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

457
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:05,799
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

458
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:17,734
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

459
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,348
Lord of "Touch Me and You're Dead".

460
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:23,481
I'm just kiddin’, you little knucklehead.

461
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:26,330
Lovebirds.

462
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:28,547
Look at this.

463
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:34,553
I don't believe it.

464
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:52,647
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

465
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,292
Come to Uncle Sid.

466
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,292
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.

467
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,080
No, no, no. No, go to him.

468
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,350
Go to him.

469
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,151
OK.

470
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,964
Good job. Keep practicin’.

471
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:20,163
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

472
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:25,486
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

473
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,345
Look at that big pushover.

474
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:39,015
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

475
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:43,763
Yeah, Manny's... he’s a good guy.

476
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,551
Yeah, he is.

477
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:49,654
Well, good night.

478
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:26,945
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

479
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:32,028
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

480
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,999
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- 1 think he's starting to look like me.

481
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:38,403
Diego, what do you think?

482
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,447
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

483
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:46,179
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

484
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:48,953
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

485
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:53,326
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
along skinny neck and call you Mama.

486
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:59,203
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

487
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,009
Diego. You frozen back there?

488
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:27,332
- Get down.
- What?

489
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:29,640
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin’ on?

490
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:34,395
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

491
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,175
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

492
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:41,563
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

493
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:45,058
- 1 was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

494
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:48,062
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

495
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,281
No, you're not. Not yet.

496
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,990
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

497
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:57,421
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

498
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,750
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

499
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:03,001
Because I'm your only chance.

500
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,710
Hello, ladies.

501
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:24,636
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

502
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:30,888
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

503
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,270
Very nice.

504
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,602
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

505
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:41,777
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

506
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,830
You want to maul something, don't you?

507
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:49,299
- [wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

508
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:55,096
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

509
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:20,174
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

510
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,019
Loop-de-loop.

511
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,182
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

512
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:10,477
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

513
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,392
Get him.

514
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:19,494
Surprise!

515
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:28,824
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

516
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:32,946
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

517
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,835
There he is.

518
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:52,343
That's right. Where's the baby?

519
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,426
Survival of the fittest.

520
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,326
I don't think so. Yeah.

521
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:17,857
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

522
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:24,007
Fine. I'll take you down first.

523
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,170
We did it.

524
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,520
We were some team, huh?

525
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:01,575
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

526
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,608
I'm sorry I set you up.

527
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,008
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

528
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:13,501
Knock it off, squirt.

529
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,507
You gotta be strong.

530
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,029
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

531
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,217
Especially Sid.

532
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:26,973
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

533
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,260
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

534
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,770
Come on, Diego, come on.

535
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:35,016
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

536
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:40,073
Listen, you have to leave me here.

537
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:44,313
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

538
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:48,151
You didn't have to do that.

539
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:51,060
That's what you do in a herd.

540
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,970
Don't forget about us.

541
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,138
OK?

542
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:16,006
We won't forget about you.

543
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:58,362
Goodbye.

544
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:00,888
Goodbye. Goodbye.

545
01:12:01,284 --> 01:12:03,304
- Sid...
- Bye.

546
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,804
Bye.

547
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,966
That's right. Where's the baby?

548
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:14,585
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

549
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:34,665
Bye.

550
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:39,125
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

551
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,869
Diego? You're OK.

552
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:45,098
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

553
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,401
You're OK.

554
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:50,171
I could kiss ya.

555
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,061
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

556
01:12:54,437 --> 01:12:57,067
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

557
01:12:57,573 --> 01:13:01,473
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.

558
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:04,298
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.

559
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:08,221
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.

560
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,731
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

561
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:19,464
I'll show you my favorite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.

562
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:23,469
- Attractive.
- This whole Ice age thing is getting old.

563
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,996
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

564
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:30,160
- Keep dreamin’.
- No, really...

565
