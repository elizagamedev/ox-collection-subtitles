1
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,405
This is Agent Leland Turbo.

2
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,466
1 have a flash transmission
for Agent Finn McMissile.

3
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,346
Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.

4
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,275
You won't believe
what I found out here.

5
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:04,784
This is bigger than anything we've ever
seen, and no one even knows it exists.

6
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,805
Finn, l need backup, but don't call the
cavalry, it could blow the operation.

7
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,509
-And be careful. It's not safe out here.
-Let's go.

8
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,048
Transmitting my grids now. Good luck.

9
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,442
All right, buddy, we're here.

10
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:49,553
All right, buddy, we're here.

11
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,110
Right where you paid me to bring you.

12
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,179
Question is, why?

13
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,594
I'm looking for a car.

14
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,354
A car? Ha!

15
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,722
Hey, pal, you can't get any
further away from land than out here.

16
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,655
Exactly where I want to be.

17
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,361
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

18
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,459
What are you doing out here?

19
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,818
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.

20
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,831
Well, turn around
and go back where you came from.

21
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,988
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?

22
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,895
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.

23
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,772
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.

24
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,010
Buddy?

25
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,447
Incoming. All workers
report to the loading dock.

26
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,388
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.

27
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,906
All right, fellas, you know the drill.

28
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,772
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.

29
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,643
Come on, guys. These crates
aren't gonna unload themselves.

30
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,715
Too many cars here. Out of my way.

31
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,338
Professor Ziindapp?

32
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,409
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to
see this before we load it?

33
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,490
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to
see this before we load it?

34
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,250
Yes. Very carefully.

35
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,599
ATV camera.

36
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,081
-What does it actually do?
-This camera is extremely dangerous.

37
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,228
What are you up to now, Professor?

38
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,643
This is valuable equipment. Make sure
it is properly secured for the voyage.

39
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,873
-You got it.
-Hey, Professor Z!

40
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,375
This is one of those
British spies we told you about.

41
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,284
Yeah! This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

42
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,839
Agent Leland Turbo.

43
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,734
It's Finn McMissile!

44
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,774
He's seen the camera! Kill him!

45
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,856
All hands on deck! All hands on deck!

46
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,799
What?

47
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,268
Get to the boats!

48
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,738
-He's getting away!
-Not for long!

49
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,306
He's dead, Professor.

50
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,199
Wunderbar!

51
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,739
With Finn McMissile gone,
who can stop us now?

52
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,811
Mater, Tow Mater, that's who,
is here to help you.

53
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,139
-Hey, Otis!
-Hey, Mater.

54
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,340
-Hey, Otis!
-Hey, Mater.

55
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,538
I... Gosh. I'm so sorry.

56
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,081
I thought I could make it
this time, but...

57
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,522
Smooth like pudding, huh?

58
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,844
Who am I kidding?
I'll always be a lemon.

59
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,346
Well, dad-gum, you're leaking
oil again. Must be your gaskets.

60
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,969
Hey, but look on the bright side.

61
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,327
This is your tenth tow this month,
so it's on the house.

62
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,964
You're the only one
that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.

63
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,371
Don't sweat it. Shoot,
these things happen to everybody.

64
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,770
-But you never leak oil.
-Yeah, but I ain't perfect.

65
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,294
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust
is starting to show through.

66
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,421
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?

67
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,014
Not yet.

68
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:35,655
Not yet.

69
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,979
He must be crazy excited
about winning his fourth Piston Cup.

70
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,688
Four! Wow!

71
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,144
Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him,
but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,

72
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,531
‘cause we got a whole summer's worth
of best friend fun to make up for.

73
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,171
Just me and...

74
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,733
McQueen!

75
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,018
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-McQueen!

76
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:57,471
-Mater! I'm in no hurry!
-Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!

77
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:59,734
McQueen's back!

78
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,433
McQueen's back! McQueen's back!

79
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,444
McQueen's back!

80
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,115
Lightning! Welcome home!

81
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,858
-Good to have you back, honey!
-Congratulations, man.

82
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,319
Welcome home, soldier.

83
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,633
The place wasn't the same
without you, son.

84
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,390
What? Did he go somewhere?

85
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:18,471
What? Did he go somewhere?

86
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,648
It's good to be home, everybody.

87
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,532
-Mater!
-McQueen!

88
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,000
-Mater!
-McQueen!

89
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,254
Hey, how far did you make it
this time, Otis?

90
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,136
-Halfway to the county line.
-Not bad, man!

91
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,110
I know! I can't believe it either!

92
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,782
-McQueen! Welcome back!
-Mater, it's so good to see you.

93
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,429
You too, buddy.

94
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,787
Man, you ain't going to believe
the things I got planned for us!

95
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,256
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!

96
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:51,337
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!

97
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:56,295
-You ready to have some serious fun?
-I've got something to show you first.

98
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,359
Wow.

99
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,708
I can't believe
they renamed the Piston Cup

100
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,761
after our very own Doc Hudson.

101
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,406
I know Doc said these things
were just old cups,

102
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,286
but to have someone else win it
just didn't feel right, you know?

103
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,554
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.

104
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,904
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.

105
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,199
-What you got planned?
-You sure you can handle it?

106
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,684
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!

107
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,947
I can handle anything.

108
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,789
Mater?

109
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,941
Just remember, your brakes
ain't going to work on these!

110
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,198
-Mater?
-Relax.

111
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,697
These train tracks
ain't been used in years!

112
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,095
Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go!

113
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,737
Faster!

114
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,118
Wow.

115
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,493
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?

116
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,774
This is going to be good!

117
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,829
Did you see that?

118
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,403
This ain't going to be good.

119
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,081
Boy, this was the best day ever!

120
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,584
And my favorite souvenir,
this new dent.

121
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:28,188
-Boy, Mater, today was...
-Shoot, that was nothing.

122
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,561
Wait till you see
what I got planned for tonight!

123
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,824
Mater, Mater, whoa! I was thinking of
just a quiet dinner.

124
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,391
That's exactly what I was thinkin’.

125
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,888
-No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
-Even better!

126
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,272
You, me and Miss Sally
goin’ out for supper.

127
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,762
Mater, I meant it would be
just me and Sally.

128
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,123
You know, just for tonight.

129
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,276
We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.

130
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,396
Okay.

131
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,244
-Thanks for understanding.
-Yeah, sure.

132
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,774
-Y'all go on and have fun now.
-All right, then.

133
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,094
See you soon, amigo.

134
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,292
This is so nice.

135
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,097
I can't tell you how good it is
to be here alone,

136
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,117
just the two of us, finally.

137
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,082
-You and me.
-Good evening.

138
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,682
My name is Mater,

139
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,553
and I'll be your waiter.

140
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,988
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.

141
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,161
Mater? You work here?

142
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,915
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?

143
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,918
I snuck in here
when nobody was lookin’

144
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,534
and pretended to be your waiter
so I could hang out with you?

145
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,400
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?

146
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,200
Can I start you two lovebirds off
with a couple of drinks?

147
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,730
-Yes. I'll have my usual.
-You know what? I'll have that, too.

148
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,520
Right. Your usual.

149
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,216
-Thanks, man.
-Grazie, Guido.

150
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,978
Guido, what's McQueen's usual?

151
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,364
How should I know?

152
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,248
-Perfect. Give me two of them.
-Quiet! My program's on.

153
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,621
Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...

154
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,540
His story gripped the world.

155
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,822
Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod,

156
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,997
in an attempt to become the first car to
circumnavigate the globe without GPS,

157
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:19,138
in an attempt to become the first car to
circumnavigate the globe without GPS,

158
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,169
ironically ran out of gas,
and found himself trapped in the wild.

159
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,132
Feared dead,
he emerged 36 days later,

160
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,821
running on a fuel he distilled himself
from the natural elements!

161
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,215
Since then, he's sold his oil fortune,

162
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,297
converted himself from a gas-guzziler
into an electric car

163
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,361
and has devoted his life to finding
a renewable, clean-burning fuel.

164
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,517
Now he claims to have done it
with his allinol.

165
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,187
And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do

166
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:42,678
And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do

167
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,762
he's created a racing competition
like no other,

168
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,964
inviting the greatest champions

169
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,137
to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

170
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,365
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.

171
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,499
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

172
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:54,580
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

173
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,457
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.

174
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,097
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
“Fossil,” as in dead dinosaurs.

175
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:03,989
And we all know
what happened to them.

176
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,873
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.

177
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,957
After seeing allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix,

178
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,680
nobody will ever go back
to gasoline again.

179
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,070
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?

180
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,929
And on satellite,
a World Grand Prix competitor

181
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,064
and one of the fastest cars
in the world, Francesco Bernoulli.

182
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,551
It is an honor, Signore Dorado, for you.

183
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,584
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?

184
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,209
Of course we invited him,

185
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,611
but apparently after his very long
-
racing season

186
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,703
he is taking time off to rest.

187
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,109
The Lightning McQueen would not
have a chance against Francesco.

188
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,422
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.

189
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:44,222
In miles, that is like...
Way faster than McQueen.

190
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,527
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.

191
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,887
-Am 1 on? Hello?
-You're on. Go ahead.

192
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,656
-Hello?
-Go ahead.

193
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,999
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.

194
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,711
That Italian feller you got on there

195
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,898
can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.

196
00:14:59,899 --> 00:14:59,949
can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.

197
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,906
He's the bestest race car
in the whole wide world.

198
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,920
if he is, how you say,

199
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,762
“The bestest race car,"
then why must he rest? Huh?

200
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,468
‘Cause he knows what's important.

201
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,873
Every now and then he prefers
just to slow down, enjoy life.

202
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,194
You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!

203
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,203
This is not news to Francesco.

204
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,539
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.

205
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,441
After two laps, 1 am out cold.

206
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,752
That ain't what I meant.

207
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,989
What's going on over there?

208
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,485
He is afraid of Francesco.

209
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,038
That's that Italian formula car.

210
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,064
-His name is...
-Francesco Bernoulli.

211
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,617
-No wonder there's a crowd.
-Why do you know his name?

212
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,616
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not 10.

213
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,205
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.

214
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,646
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.

215
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,451
-Let me tell you something else.
-Mater?

216
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:52,502
-Let me tell you something else.
-Mater?

217
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,728
McQueen could drive circles
around you.

218
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,991
Driving in circles is all he can-a do,
no?

219
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,226
No.

220
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,238
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.

221
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,187
Any time, any track.

222
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,016
Mel, can we move on?

223
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,081
Francesco needs a caller
who can provide

224
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,242
a little more intellectual stimulation,
like a dump truck.

225
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,670
That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

226
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,006
Hey! Whoa!

227
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,382
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.

228
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,371
The Lightning McQueen, huh?

229
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,489
1 don't appreciate my best friend
being insulted like that.

230
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,852
McQueen, that was your best friend?

231
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:26,872
McQueen, that was your best friend?

232
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,766
This is the difference
between you and Francesco.

233
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,050
Francesco knows how good he is.

234
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,264
He does not need to surround himself
with tow trucks to prove it.

235
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,270
Those are strong words
from a car that is so fragile.

236
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:42,345
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!

237
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:43,954
Not so fast, McQueen!

238
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,505
“Not so fast." Is that your new motto?

239
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:46,616
“Not so fast." Is that your new motto?

240
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,199
Motto?

241
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,205
This sounds like something that needs
to be settled on the race course.

242
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,410
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.

243
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,918
I would love to,
but my crew is off for the season, so...

244
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,159
Pit stop.

245
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,464
You know what? They just got back.

246
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,196
Deal me in, baby.

247
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:11,396
Ka-chow! Yeah.

248
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:11,537
Ka-chow! Yeah.

249
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,077
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.

250
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,760
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.

251
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,952
Mater's going to have a blast, though.

252
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,908
You're bringing Mater, right?

253
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,290
You never bring him
to any of your races.

254
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,282
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.

255
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,555
Come on, it will be
the thrill of a lifetime for him.

256
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,884
-Your drink, sir.
-Mater.

257
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,429
I didn't taste it!

258
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,394
How'd you like to come
and see the world with me?

259
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,980
-You mean it?
-Yeah. You got me into this thing.

260
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,303
-You're coming along.
-All right!

261
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,578
Ka-chow!

262
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,856
Hey!

263
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:17,877
Hey!

264
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,561
Excuse me!

265
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,663
Domo arigato!

266
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,544
Yeah!

267
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,408
Guido, look. Ferraris and tires.

268
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,568
-Let's go!
-Look at this.

269
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,701
Okay, now, Mater, remember,
best behavior.

270
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,348
-You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
-Mater!

271
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,047
Hey, McQueen! Over here.

272
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,918
Hey, McQueen! Over here.

273
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,079
-Lewis!
-Hey, man.

274
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,717
-Jeff!
-Hey, Lightning.

275
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,539
Can you believe this party?

276
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,029
Hey.

277
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,328
You done good. You got all the leaves.

278
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,824
-Check out that tow truck.
-Man, I wonder who that guy's with.

279
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,770
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

280
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:38,791
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

281
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,811
Good job!

282
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,100
Mater! Listen,
this isn't Radiator Springs.

283
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,540
You're just realizing that?

284
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,082
That jet lag really done
a number on you.

285
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,912
Mater, things are different over here.

286
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,751
Which means maybe you should,
you know, acta little different, too.

287
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,901
-Different than what?
-Well, just help me out here.

288
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,668
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?

289
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,704
That's what a tow truck does.

290
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,489
-Yeah, I mean...
-Looky there.

291
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,818
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.

292
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,720
-Mater, no!
-Look at me. I'm helping you already.

293
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,510
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...

294
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,869
Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.

295
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,768
-Nice to meet you, Francesco.
-Nice to meet you, too.

296
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,731
You are very good-looking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.

297
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,761
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?

298
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,603
Anything for McQueen's friend.

299
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,848
Miss Sally is going to flip
when she sees this.

300
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,362
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.

301
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,278
She's a big fan of yours.

302
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,323
Hey, she has-a good taste.

303
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,502
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".

304
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,049
You're right. She's a huge fan!

305
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,043
She goes on and on
about your open wheels.

306
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,434
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going on and on.

307
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:52,011
Francesco is familiar
with this reaction to Francesco.

308
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,385
Women respect a car
that has-a nothing to hide.

309
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:55,857
Yeah...

310
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,515
-Let us have a toast.
-Let's.

311
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,627
I dedicate my win tomorrow
to Miss Sally.

312
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,969
Sorry.

313
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:05,028
l already dedicated
my win tomorrow to her.

314
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,543
So, if we both do it,
it's really not so special.

315
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,887
-Besides, I don't have a drink.
-I'll go get you one.

316
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,476
Do you mind if l borrow a few bucks
for one of them drinks?

317
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:17,116
-They're free.
-Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?

318
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,890
I should probably go keep an eye
on him. See you at the race.

319
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,070
Yes, you will see Francesco,
but not like this.

320
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,838
You will see him like-a this
as he drives away from you.

321
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,581
That's cute.

322
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,719
You had one of those made up
for all the racers?

323
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,345
No.

324
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,790
Okay.

325
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:39,062
-Ciao, McQueen!
-He is so getting beat tomorrow!

326
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,628
Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod.

327
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,516
It is my absolute honor
to introduce to you

328
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:51,667
the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

329
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,818
From Brazil, Number 8...

330
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,398
-Hello.
-Hello.

331
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,946
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

332
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,856
That's because it's air-cooled.

333
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,387
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell. Holley
Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.

334
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,638
-l have a message from London.
-Not here.

335
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,842
Try the canapés on the mezzanine.

336
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,109
The lab boys analyzed the photo
I sent?

337
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,502
What did they learn about the camera?

338
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,620
It appears to be
a standard television camera.

339
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,794
They said if you could get closer
photos next time that would be great.

340
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,519
This was London's message?

341
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,010
No. No, sir.

342
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,599
The oil platforms you were on,

343
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,441
turns out they're sitting on
the biggest oil reserve in the world.

344
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:52,887
How did we miss that?

345
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,682
They've scrambled
everyone's satellites.

346
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,170
The Americans discovered it
just before you did.

347
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,059
They placed an agent on that platform
under deep cover.

348
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:03,316
He was able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

349
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,769
Great.

350
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,030
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?

351
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,673
Nope, not yet.

352
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,318
The American is here tonight
to pass it to you.

353
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,090
He'll signal you when he's ready.

354
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,725
Good, good.

355
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:16,924
Oh, no.

356
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,524
-What is it?
-Change of plan.

357
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,589
-You're meeting the American.
-What? Me?

358
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,858
Those thugs down there
were on the oil platform.

359
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,810
If they see me,
the mission is compromised.

360
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:31,829
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.

361
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,440
You are now.

362
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,322
I'll take one of them. Thank you.

363
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,898
Never know which one McQueen
will have a hankering for.

364
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:48,994
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

365
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,431
-No, no, wasabi.
-Same old same old.

366
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,255
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!

367
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,455
Little more, please. It is free, right?

368
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,735
Keep it coming. A little more.

369
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,470
Come on, let's go. It's free.

370
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,351
You're gettin’ there. Scoop, scoop.

371
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,984
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

372
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,187
My condolences.

373
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,263
And now our last competitor.

374
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,820
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

375
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,313
Ka-chow!

376
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,834
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod.

377
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,417
l really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.

378
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,071
The pleasure is all ours, Lightning.

379
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,153
You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism

380
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,923
to this competition.

381
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,501
Somebody get me water!

382
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,014
Sweet relief. Sweet relief.

383
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:57,147
Whatever you do,
do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.

384
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,130
It has turned.

385
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,396
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.

386
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,918
-This is Mater. He's...
-l know him.

387
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,760
This is the bloke that called in
to the television show.

388
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,570
-You're the one I have to thank.
-No, thank you.

389
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,342
This trip's been amazin’.

390
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,947
He's a little excited, isn't he?

391
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,244
-Mater!
-But wait, I... Shoot.

392
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,734
-Mater.
-Has anyone got a towel?

393
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,303
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

394
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,615
-But I never leak oil. Never.
-Go take care of yourself right now!

395
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,830
Comin’ through! Leakin'’ oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.

396
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,798
I gotta go.

397
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,058
Sorry, ladies.

398
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,766
I'm leakin’. I never leak. I never leak.

399
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,609
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.

400
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,335
I never leak.

401
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,631
I never leak, I never leak, never...

402
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,882
Wow-wee!

403
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,251
What in the...

404
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,033
Hey, that tickles!

405
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:33,054
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.

406
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,219
Okay, so, the American has activated
his tracking beacon.

407
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,099
Roger that. Move in.

408
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:57,965
Stop! Hey!

409
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,778
-You've got to be joking.
-What's the problem?

410
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,458
-He's in the loo.
-So, goin!

411
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,312
-I can't go into the men's loo!
-Time is of the essence.

412
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,499
All right.

413
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,672
Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!

414
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,937
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!

415
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,813
No offense to your makes and models,

416
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,341
but you break down harder
than my cousin Betsy

417
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,427
after she got left at the altar!

418
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,949
What the... Whoa. Are you okay?

419
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,062
-I'm fine.
-Hey! Tow truck!

420
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,437
We'd like to get to our private business
here, if you don't mind.

421
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,228
Yeah, sorry.

422
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,902
Don't let me get in the way
of your private business.

423
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,408
A little advice. When you hear
a giggle and see that waterfall,

424
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,612
you best press that green button.

425
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,844
-Thank you.
-It's to adjust the temperature.

426
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,433
-Got it.
-And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.

427
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,079
Get out of here!

428
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,921
All right, then. And when she starts
gigglin’, prepare to be squirted.

429
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,962
‘Scuse me, ma'am.

430
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,021
Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.

431
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,350
-This cannot be him.
-ls he American?

432
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,076
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin’' to get funky.

433
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,533
-Extremely.
-Then it's him.

434
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,611
-Hello.
-Well, hello.

435
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,213
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

436
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,890
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's air-cooled.

437
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,918
Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station.

438
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,718
‘Course, Karmann Ghias
weren't the only ones.

439
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:46,457
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.

440
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,009
-Yeah, okay. I get it.
-And before both of them

441
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,878
there's the Type 2 buses.

442
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,379
-My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
-Listen!

443
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,962
We should find somewhere
more private.

444
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,707
Gee, don't you think that's a little...

445
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,690
You're right. Impossible to know
which areas here are compromised.

446
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,096
-So, when can I see you again?
-Well, let's see.

447
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,078
Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.

448
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,254
Got it.

449
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,701
We'll rendezvous then.

450
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:11,257
-There you are. Where have you been?
-What's a "rendezvous"?

451
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,410
-It's like a date.
-A date?

452
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:14,975
Mater, what's going on?

453
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,857
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.

454
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:19,917
Guido don't believe you.

455
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,872
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.

456
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:26,015
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!

457
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,158
See you tomorrow!

458
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,618
Guido still don't believe you.

459
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,073
I got to admit, you tricked us real good.

460
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,610
And we don't like being tricked.

461
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,502
What's so funny?

462
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,370
Well, l was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.

463
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,574
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
l hear this stuff is good for you.

464
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,574
So you think.

465
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,132
Allinol by itself is good for you.

466
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,469
But after microscopic examination

467
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,351
I have found
that it has one small weakness.

468
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,271
When hit with
an electromagnetic pulse,

469
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,006
it becomes extremely dangerous.

470
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,273
Smile for the camera.

471
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,445
Is that all you want? I got a whole act.

472
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:16,264
You were very interested
in this camera on the oil platform.

473
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:20,002
Now, you will witness
what it really does.

474
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,585
-Whatever you say, Professor.
-You talked up a lot of cars last night.

475
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,046
-Which one's your associate?
-Your mother.

476
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,517
No, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.

477
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,635
Could I start it now, Professor Z?

478
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:33,887
Go 50% power.

479
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:39,347
This camera is actually
an electromagnetic pulse emitter.

480
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,868
What about her? Did you give it to her?

481
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,303
The allinol is now heating to a boil,

482
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:49,877
dramatically expanding, causing the
engine block to crack under the stress,

483
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,762
forcing oil
into the combustion chamber.

484
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,788
How about him? Did you talk to him?

485
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,394
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.

486
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:01,717
You may be able to,
but after full impact of the pulse,

487
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,290
unfortunately, there will be
nothing to replace.

488
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,588
How about him? Does he have it?

489
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,931
That's him. He's the one.

490
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,879
-Roger that, Professor Z.
-No!

491
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,102
Yes, sir.

492
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,736
We believe the infiltrator has passed
along sensitive information.

493
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,468
I will take care of it
before any damage can be done.

494
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,461
The project is still on schedule.

495
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,924
You will find the second agent
and kill him.

496
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,361
Japan, land of the rising sun,

497
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,197
where ancient tradition
meets modern technology.

498
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,503
Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix.

499
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:52,553
Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix.

500
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,481
I'm Brent Mustangburger
with racing legends

501
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,620
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.

502
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,477
There's never been a competition
like this before.

503
00:32:59,478 --> 00:32:59,498
There's never been a competition
like this before.

504
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,601
First, allinol, making its debut tonight

505
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,670
as the required fuel
for all these great champions.

506
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,730
Second, the course itself.

507
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,353
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

508
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:09,404
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

509
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,630
David, how exactly
does this competition work?

510
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,592
All three of these street courses are
classic round-the-house racetracks.

511
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,894
This means that the LMP
and formula cars

512
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,450
should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion.

513
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,476
Look for Francesco Bernoulli,
in particular, to lead early.

514
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,485
And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars,

515
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,108
like Spain's Miguel Camino,
should make up ground

516
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,258
but 1 doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco

517
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,800
from absolutely running away with it.

518
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,792
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.

519
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,724
You forget the most important factor,

520
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,689
that early dirt track section
of the course.

521
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,888
The dirt is supposed to be
the equalizer in this race.

522
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,028
French rally car Raoul CaRoule

523
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,087
is counting on a big boost
through there.

524
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,155
And don't forget Lightning McQueen.

525
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,954
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,

526
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,543
was one of the greatest
dirt track racers of all time.

527
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,334
In my opinion, McQueen is the best
all-around racer in this competition.

528
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,773
Really, Darrell,
you need to clean your windshield.

529
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,568
You're clearly not seeing this
for what it is: Francesco's race to lose.

530
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,409
It's time to find out.
The racers are locking into the grid.

531
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:18,555
Speed. lam speed.

532
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:18,607
Speed. lam speed.

533
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:20,947
Really? You are speed?

534
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,776
Then Francesco is triple speed.

535
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,299
Francesco is triple speed.

536
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,567
Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

537
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:30,739
Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

538
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,369
It's-a really getting him into the zone.

539
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:36,435
He is so getting beat today.

540
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,993
-Your suspension sets look good.
-Tire pressure is excellent!

541
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,475
-He's got plenty of fuel.
-And he's awesome.

542
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:12,527
-He's got plenty of fuel.
-And he's awesome.

543
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,808
Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.

544
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,178
It's his cover.

545
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,142
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.

546
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,826
It must have cost him a fortune.

547
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,814
-But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
-There's probably heat on him.

548
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,984
-Be patient.
-Right, of course.

549
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,169
-He'll signal us when he can.
-Then we find out who's behind all this.

550
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:41,509
As they head into the palace hairpin,
Francesco builds an early lead.

551
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,330
Hang on, boys. Here comes the dirt.

552
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,083
Slipping and sliding, baby.

553
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,811
McQueen, it's time to make your move!

554
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,281
Get on the outside
and show ‘im what Doc taught you.

555
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:53,901
10-4, Mater.

556
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,796
Oh, boy! Francesco's brought
to a screeching halt!

557
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,980
Lightning McQueen
is the first to take advantage.

558
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,733
And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust.

559
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,832
Nice call, Mater. Keep it up.

560
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:09,854
Nice call, Mater. Keep it up.

561
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,296
McQueen looks happier than a roll bar
at a demolition derby!

562
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:18,974
Everyone's jostling for position
as we hit the asphalt again.

563
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,027
Francesco lost a lot of momentum
in the dirt.

564
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,904
He's got serious work ahead of
him if he wants to get back in this race.

565
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,125
The racers hit the Rainbow Bridge,
with its 360-degree loop.

566
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,236
-It is time.
-Roger that.

567
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,163
Miguel Camino has blown an engine!

568
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,652
Very unusual, Darrell.
He's been so consistent all year.

569
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,816
-You gotta be kidding me.
-What is it?

570
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,315
-The tow truck from the bathroom.
-The bathroom?

571
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,601
The one the American agent
passed the device to.

572
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,953
-What about him?
-He's in the pits!

573
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,971
Not for long.

574
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,223
-Hold on. I think I've got something.
-What is it?

575
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,904
The Pacer from the party last night.

576
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:21,956
The Pacer from the party last night.

577
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:25,257
I'm cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks.

578
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,174
Yep. His VIN numbers match.

579
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,439
Anyone with him? He won't be alone.

580
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,205
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.

581
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,845
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...

582
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,528
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?

583
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,384
Get him out of the pits. Now!

584
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:44,123
Some of them fellers is really loud!

585
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,642
-Can you hear me? Over.
-What?

586
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,371
Get out of the pit now!
Do you hear me?

587
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,821
Hey. I know you! You're that girl
from the party last night.

588
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,891
You wanna do our date now?

589
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,786
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

590
00:37:58,243 --> 00:37:59,942
Smoke from
number 10, Clutchgoneski!

591
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,239
There's no time for messing about!
Get out of the pits!

592
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,736
Is there going to be cable where you is
so I can watch the rest of the race?

593
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:11,003
-You're running out of time!
-They're coming. Get him out of there!

594
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,606
I'm trying. Get out now.

595
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:17,562
l usually like to have a proper detailin'’
done before I meet a lady friend.

596
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,976
-Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
-Then this shouldn't hurt.

597
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,382
Miss Shiftwell?

598
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,609
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages.

599
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,069
Multiple assailants
are closing in quickly.

600
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,448
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.

601
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,506
Hey, new lady friend,
you like flowers?

602
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:54,714
What?

603
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,043
No! Don't go in anywhere.
Just keep moving.

604
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,424
-Stay outside. Got you.
-Outside?

605
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,542
Whoa! McQueen
suddenly moves to the outside.

606
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,773
1 cannot believe what I saw.

607
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,481
That was a bonehead move
to open up the inside like that!

608
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,644
That might have cost McQueen
the victory!

609
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,546
This time, I'm going to make sure
you stay dead!

610
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,909
You're doing brilliantly.
Now just stay focused.

611
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,478
What's that? You want me
to head toward that ruckus?

612
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,018
No! Don't go down that street.

613
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,931
Wow! A live karate demonstration!

614
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,354
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.

615
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,413
And here they come, the two leaders.

616
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,759
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!

617
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,020
-It's close!
-Francesco's the winner!

618
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,082
McQueen's number two.

619
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,047
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?

620
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,718
Where did he go?

621
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,864
Our rendezvous has been jeopardized.
Keep the device safe.

622
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,557
-We'll be in touch.
-Dad-gum, did I miss our date?

623
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,603
-Francesco!
-Francesco, over here.

624
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,251
What was your strategy today?

625
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,826
Strategia?
Francesco needs-a no strategy.

626
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,149
It's-a very simple.

627
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,953
You start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then win.

628
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,804
Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.

629
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,003
You were in trouble for a while.

630
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,029
That dirt track section
had you crawling.

631
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:08,361
To truly crush one's dream, you must
first raise their hopes very high.

632
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:08,987
To truly crush one's dream, you must
first raise their hopes very high.

633
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,658
-Mater!
-Hey, McQueen! What happened?

634
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,683
Is the race over? You won, right?

635
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,196
Why were you yelling at me
while I was racing?

636
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,948
Yelling? You thought...
That's funny right there.

637
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,622
No, that's ‘cause
I seen these two fellers

638
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,745
doing some karate street performance.

639
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,394
It was nutso.
One of ‘em even had a flame-thrower.

640
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,817
A flame-thrower?
What are you talking about?

641
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,785
-I don't understand. Where were you?
-Going to meet my date.

642
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,127
Your date?

643
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,140
She started talkin’ to me as a voice
in my head, tellin’ me where to go.

644
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,679
-What?
-Wait a minute.

645
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,405
-I didn't screw ya up, did I?
-l lost the race because of you!

646
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,138
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

647
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,085
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flame-throwers?

648
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,501
This is exactly why I don't bring you
along to these things.

649
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,882
Maybe if I, l don't know,

650
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,767
talk to somebody and explained
what happened, I could help.

651
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:02,757
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!

652
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,692
Hey, there he is!

653
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,055
-McQueen, you had it in the bag!
-Yeah! What happened?

654
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:11,955
I made a mistake.

655
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,529
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.

656
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,581
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.

657
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:21,712
Look, we know what the problem is
and we've taken care of it.

658
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,671
Lightning McQueen loses
in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli

659
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:29,228
in the first race of
the World Grand Prix.

660
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:32,074
And three, count ‘em,
three cars flamed out

661
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:35,917
leaving some to suggest that their fuel,
allinol, might be to blame.

662
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,447
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.

663
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,977
There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out.

664
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,564
The jury may still be out on whether
allinol caused these accidents,

665
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,148
but one thing's for sure,

666
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,773
Lightning McQueen blew this race.

667
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,542
Team McQueen
can't be happy right now.

668
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,640
Welcome to
Tokyo International Airport.

669
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,232
-Come with me, please, sir.
-But I'm ‘onna miss my plane.

670
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,049
-Right this way.
-Doggone it.

671
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,048
This is about my hook, ain't it?

672
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,126
I know I should have checked it,
but I can't, really.

673
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,692
Look. It's attached to me.

674
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,042
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.

675
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,486
I never properly introduced myself.

676
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:46,045
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.

677
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,977
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.

678
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,707
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?

679
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,590
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.

680
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,082
I know some karate.

681
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,658
I don't want to brag or nuttin’,
but I got me a black fan belt.

682
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,622
-Wanna see some moves I made up?
-You're being followed.

683
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,651
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood

684
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,600
pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he stalls.

685
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,624
I call it, "What I accidentally did
to my friend Luigi once."

686
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,044
There he is!

687
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,139
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.

688
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,584
-Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
-Whoa!

689
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,424
Hang on!

690
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,886
This is first-class service.

691
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,518
You don't even have to go
through the terminal!

692
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,179
Your karate partners is back there.

693
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,731
They look like
they tryin’ to catch up!

694
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:45,304
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!

695
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,212
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

696
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,016
Is everything okay back there?

697
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,147
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.

698
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,970
Roger that.

699
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,897
‘Member that whole thing about me
not stoppin’ no matter what?

700
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,604
I knew I shoulda done carry-on!

701
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,129
Thanks, old boy.

702
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,889
-You got it, mate.
-Hey, doggonit!

703
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,128
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!

704
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,836
Come on! Get in here!

705
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:37,402
I tell you what, you really do
want this first date, don't ya?

706
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,335
That's a no-quit attitude right there.

707
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:41,975
What the...

708
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,202
Hold on, Sid.

709
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,038
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!

710
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,398
Hold on!

711
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,274
By the time you read this, ! will
be safely on an airplane flying home.

712
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,975
By the time you read this, ! will
be safely on an airplane flying home.

713
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,100
I'm so sorry for what I did.

714
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:24,071
“I don't want to be the cause
of you losing any more races.

715
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,722
“L want you to go prove to the world
what I already know.

716
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,029
“That you are the greatest race car
in the whole wide world.

717
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,712
“Your best friend, Mater."

718
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,825
I didn't really want him to leave.

719
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,120
Wait, there's more here.

720
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:41,106
“PS. Please tell the hotel

721
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,675
“[ didn't mean to order that movie.

722
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:47,968
“[ thought it was just a preview
and I didn't realize l was paying for it.

723
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:51,186
“PPS. That's funny right there. PP."

724
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:52,975
There are a few more pages
of PS's here.

725
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,406
There are a few more pages
of PS's here.

726
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:57,812
Well, at least 1 know
if he's at home, he'll be safe.

727
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:01,904
That's how I like to start the day.

728
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,529
You never feel more alive
than when you're almost dead.

729
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,735
Yeah. I hope that device didn't fall off.

730
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:08,431
Whoa!

731
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:10,866
That's the closest I ever been
to missin’ my flight.

732
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,861
That was...

733
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:12,942
That was...

734
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,244
-Still in one piece? Great.
-I've got to go to a doctor.

735
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:18,871
I get these sharp pains
in my undercarriage.

736
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:22,033
-Downloading the photo now.
-Let me introduce you two.

737
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,145
This here is Finn McSomethin’
or other.

738
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:27,105
He's a first-class VIP
airport whatchamacallit.

739
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,505
And, Finn, this here is my date.

740
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:32,372
I never did get your name.

741
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,852
Yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

742
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:35,873
Yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

743
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,856
It's Shiftwell. Holley...

744
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,551
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.

745
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,566
What is this?

746
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,552
That's one of the worst engines
ever made.

747
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:50,700
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

748
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,491
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

749
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,662
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what.

750
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,632
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.

751
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:59,341
Yes, okay, but whose engine is this?

752
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:01,947
It's kinda hard to tell from this picture,
ain't it?

753
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,806
-But you took it.
-Holley.

754
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:05,575
Right! Yes, of course.

755
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,573
A good agent gets what he can,
then gets out before he's killed.

756
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,036
Agent? You mean, like,
insurance agent? Like...

757
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:16,393
Like a good neighbor, Mater is there!

758
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,717
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!

759
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,887
In how many makes and models
did this type of engine appear?

760
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,407
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period.

761
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:30,156
At least 35,000 cars were made
with this engine.

762
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,548
-You're purty.
-Yes, thank you.

763
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,600
-And so nice.
-Just pay attention.

764
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:38,444
This seems like a dead end.

765
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,692
If there was something in the photo

766
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:42,945
that could narrow this down,
I'd be happier.

767
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,750
You might not be happy,
but I bet this feller is.

768
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,287
See how he's had
most of his parts replaced?

769
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,059
And see all them boxes over there?

770
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,171
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.

771
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:54,964
-Rare parts?
-That's something we can track.

772
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,075
-Rare parts?
-That's something we can track.

773
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,703
Exactly.

774
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:00,883
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.

775
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,312
I know of a black-market parts dealer
in Paris, a treacherous lowlife,

776
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:08,212
but he's the only car in the world
who can tell us whose engine this is.

777
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,909
What would you say to setting up
an informal task force on this one?

778
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,503
Wait. What?

779
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:15,621
You obviously have experience
in the field.

780
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,356
Yeah, I live right next to one.

781
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,019
I don't know.

782
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,921
l ain't exactly been much help
to anybody recently.

783
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,234
You're helping me. Please, Mater.

784
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,313
Well... Okay.

785
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,651
But you know
I'm just a tow truck, right?

786
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:33,161
Right. And I'm just
in the import-export business.

787
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:34,931
-Siddeley?
-Yes, Finn?

788
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:36,516
Paris. Tout de suite.

789
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,176
Yeah, two of them sweets for me,
too, Sid.

790
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,190
l always wanted to be a spy.

791
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:42,939
Really? Me, too.

792
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,870
-Afterburners, sir?
-ls there any other way?

793
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,514
Once we're inside, stay close.

794
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,889
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.

795
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:23,469
Got it.

796
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,391
Don't talk to anyone,
don't look at anyone,

797
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:28,442
and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?

798
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:30,386
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.

799
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,149
-Mater?
-Yeah, Finn?

800
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,281
-We're not here to go shopping.
-Shoppin'? What do you mean?

801
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,167
Why would I...

802
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:39,989
Dad-gum.

803
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,884
-Part for sales, monsieur.
-Monsieur, part for sale.

804
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,070
They got everything here. No!

805
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,599
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.

806
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:49,352
Sorry, fellers. l gotta go!

807
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,982
Do what?

808
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,732
Excuse me. What are you selling?

809
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:02,585
Headlights, monsieur, headlights?

810
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,413
-What in the...
-Two for one.

811
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,138
-I give you good price!
-I'm good!

812
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:13,992
-There you are.
-There is some great bargains here.

813
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,055
-Mater, get back!
-Imbécile!

814
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:24,924
Hey, wait for me!

815
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:51,884
-Have you lost your mind?
-But I thought...

816
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:53,612
This chap needs a tow. Hook him up.

817
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:54,761
Sure thing.

818
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:59,554
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!

819
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,018
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?

820
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:13,734
This is her first field assignment. She
didn't know you were my informant.

821
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,437
-Informant?
-A rookie, huh?

822
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,203
I never liked new car smell.

823
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,758
Tomber was doing 20-to-life
in a Moroccan impound

824
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:24,756
the first time I saved him,
if l recall correctly.

825
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:28,399
Speaking of recalls, you're getting up
there in mileage, aren't you?

826
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:31,665
All right, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old.

827
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,078
So, here you go, informant. Inform us.

828
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,179
That is the worst motor ever made.

829
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:42,243
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.

830
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,720
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?

831
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,495
They should. I sold them.

832
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,167
-To whom?
-No idea.

833
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,565
He's my best customer, but he always
does his business over the phone.

834
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,236
I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts.

835
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,372
Now I know.

836
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,314
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin’ truer than that.

837
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:02,337
-Lemon?
-Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.

838
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,773
Lemons is a tow truck's
bread and butter.

839
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:07,669
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers
we run into at the party

840
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,317
and the race and the airport.

841
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,455
Pull up the pictures
from the oil platform.

842
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,842
I want to know what other type of cars
were out there.

843
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:17,704
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.

844
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,075
Are these cars considered lemons?

845
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:21,691
Is the Popemobile Catholic?

846
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:25,439
Everyone involved in this plot
is one of history's biggest loser cars.

847
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:28,663
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.

848
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,817
-This explains it.
-What, Tomber?

849
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:35,306
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo
and Trunkov never get together,

850
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:38,016
but they are having a secret meeting
in two days.

851
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,195
-Where's this meeting taking place?
-Porto Corsa, Italy.

852
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,115
That's where the next race is!

853
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,820
There's a good chance
our mystery engine will be there, too.

854
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,750
Your chances are more than good.

855
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,458
I just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday. To Porto Corsa.

856
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,172
Contact Stevenson
and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon.

857
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:56,866
Good work.

858
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:05,252
That three-wheeled feller
had to be right about a big meetin’.

859
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:09,409
You never see this many lemons
in one town.

860
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,473
‘Less there's a swap meet.

861
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,332
How'd you get all them pictures?

862
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,250
l reprogrammed Porto Corsa’'s red light
cameras to do recognition scans.

863
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,955
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car
lever met, but you're the smartest, too.

864
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,366
Thank you... I think.

865
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:27,685
That's a familiar sight.
A Hugo bein’ towed.

866
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,718
But he looks absolutely perfect!

867
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,843
Of course! They must be the heads
of the lemon families.

868
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,737
Makes sense.
If l was rich and broke down every day,

869
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,363
I'd hire me to tow me
around all the time, too!

870
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:42,205
We've got to infiltrate that meeting
to find out who's behind all this.

871
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,950
Hang on a minute. Hold still.

872
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:53,492
Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

873
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:54,807
Thank you, Finn.

874
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,608
Boy, I sure wish my friends
could see me now.

875
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,323
Guido, your eyes do not deceive you.

876
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:08,776
We are in Italy. We are home.

877
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,856
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?

878
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,939
What? No friend of mine
will stay in a hotel in-a my village.

879
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:19,887
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino!

880
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,850
Luigi! Guido!

881
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,837
How do they do it?

882
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:38,232
These are the same ingredients
as back home, but it tastes so good.

883
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:41,488
-It's organic, man.
-Treehugger.

884
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:46,471
Hey, race car.

885
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,267
You look so down, so low.

886
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,162
Is like you have flat tires.

887
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:56,702
She said you look like
you are starving,

888
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,480
that she's gonna make you a big meal
and fatten you up.

889
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,062
No.

890
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,984
Mama Topolino, please,
you don't need to make a fuss.

891
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,040
Capisco. I understand.

892
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,736
Is a problem, yes,
between you and a friend?

893
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,428
How did you know that?

894
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,477
A wise car hears one word
and understands two.

895
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:16,339
That, and Luigi told me.

896
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:20,238
While Mama cooks,
come and take a stroll with me.

897
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:23,188
I brought my friend Mater along
on the trip

898
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:25,314
and I told him he needed
to act different,

899
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:26,959
that we weren't in Radiator Springs.

900
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:29,121
This Mater is a close friend?

901
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,096
He's my best friend.

902
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,560
Then why would you ask him to be
someone else?

903
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,069
What did I do?

904
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:42,094
I said some things during our fight.

905
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:45,122
You know, back when Guido and Luigi
used to work for me,

906
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,459
they would fight over everything.

907
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,836
They fight over what Ferrari
was the best Ferrari,

908
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:55,032
which one of them looked
more like a Ferrari.

909
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,622
There were even
some non-Ferrari fights.

910
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,795
So I tell them,
"Va bene, it's okay to fight.

911
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:05,188
“Everybody fights now and then,
especially best friends.

912
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,016
“But you got to make up fast.

913
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,968
“No fight more important
than friendship.”

914
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:23,466
-What does that mean?
-Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.

915
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,291
Now, mangia. Eat!

916
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,868
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

917
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:41,367
Thank you, Stevenson.

918
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,025
-That should just about do it.
-Perfect.

919
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:46,804
So, Mater, it's voice-activated.

920
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,720
But everything's voice-activated
these days.

921
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:52,787
What? I thought you was supposed
to be makin’ me a disguise.

922
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:56,366
Voice recognized.
Disguise program initiated.

923
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,840
Cool!

924
00:57:58,075 --> 00:57:59,595
Computer, make me a German truck.

925
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,629
-Request acknowledged.
-Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.

926
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,042
Make me a monster truck!

927
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:06,270
-Request acknowledged.
-What the...

928
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,550
I vant to siphon your gas!

929
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,926
-Now make me a taco truck!
-Request acknowledged.

930
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,161
-A funny car!
-Request acknowledged.

931
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:21,388
The idea is
to keep a low profile, Mater.

932
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,049
So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.

933
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,654
-And leave the rest to us.
-Now, hold still.

934
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,171
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.

935
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:29,342
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.

936
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,265
That's no good.

937
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,125
Hey. What are you doin’?

938
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:43,163
The disguise won't calibrate effectively
without a smooth surface to graft onto.

939
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,400
For a second there, I thought
you was tryin’ to fix my dents.

940
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,970
-Yes, I was.
-Then, no, thank you.

941
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,609
I don't get them dents buffed,
pulled, filled or painted by nobody.

942
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:56,233
-They way too valuable.
-Your dents are valuable? Really?

943
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,300
I come by each one of 'em with
my best friend, Lightning McQueen.

944
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:04,091
I don't fix these.
l wanna remember these dents forever.

945
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:09,271
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.

946
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,442
Friendships can be dangerous
in our line of work, Mater.

947
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,933
But my line of work
is towin' and salvage.

948
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,978
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's
is designing iPhone apps.

949
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:22,147
-No, I meant for real.
-It's okay. I'll work around the dent.

950
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:24,163
In the meantime,

951
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:28,113
you look a little light on weapons.

952
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:39,307
You are looking live at beautiful

953
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,023
Porto Corsa, Italy,
on the Italian Riviera.

954
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:46,756
What a magnificent setting for the
second race of the World Grand Prix!

955
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,851
Brent, they call this place
the "Gem of the Riviera,"

956
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:51,776
and it's easy to see why.

957
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,369
With its secluded beaches
and opulent casinos,

958
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,721
Porto Corsa truly is a playground
for the wealthy.

959
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:00,248
And everyone who's anyone
is here today,

960
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,410
from the ultra-rich and super-famous

961
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,016
to world leaders
and important dignitaries.

962
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,424
You aren't kidding, David.

963
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,150
You can't do a three-point turn
without bumping into some celebrity.

964
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,274
Welcome, everyone, to the second
race of the World Grand Prix,

965
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,096
Welcome, everyone, to the second
race of the World Grand Prix,

966
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:16,848
where the big news
continues to be allinol.

967
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,590
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press
earlier today

968
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,746
to answer questions about its safety.

969
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,165
An independent panel of scientists
has determined

970
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,894
that allinol is completely safe, okay?

971
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:28,404
Safe. There it is.

972
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:29,888
So the race will go on, folks.

973
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,923
But the question everyone is asking:

974
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:34,542
will the real
Lightning McQueen show up today?

975
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,365
He'd better.
Talk about a home track advantage.

976
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,431
Francesco Bernoulli
grew up racing on this course.

977
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:45,764
Signore e signori, in the
pole position, Numero Uno, Francesco!

978
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:48,763
Bellissima!
Thank you for your support!

979
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:51,647
And your big mistake, McQueen!

980
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:51,668
And your big mistake, McQueen!

981
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,801
In secondo position,

982
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:59,184
numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!

983
01:00:59,189 --> 01:00:59,209
numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!

984
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,102
McQueen-a, is-a everything okay?

985
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:04,918
If you're worried about your fuel, man,
don't. It's perfectly safe.

986
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,995
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.

987
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,366
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.

988
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,535
Francesco understands, McQueen.

989
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:12,631
Great, here it comes.

990
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,339
What do you got, Francesco?

991
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:17,888
For famous race cars like Francesco
and, well, you,

992
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,930
to be far away from home is not easy.

993
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:24,138
I think you forgot
the insulting part of that insult.

994
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:25,858
Is-a no insult.

995
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:28,866
When-a Francesco is away from home,
he misses his mama,

996
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,854
just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.

997
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:31,995
just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.

998
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:35,022
Gee, I maybe misjudged you,
because that's exactly...

999
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,445
Of course, l am at home,
and my mama is right here.

1000
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,620
Mama!

1001
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:44,625
Don't worry, Mama,
McQueen is very sad.

1002
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,731
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!

1003
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:50,727
And there's the insult we were missing.

1004
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,442
Darrell, the racers
are settling in as they head

1005
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,190
to the Italian countryside.

1006
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:14,609
Boy!

1007
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:17,218
This is going to be a great race.

1008
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:31,725
Gremlins. Man,
those are some ugly cars.

1009
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:34,051
Look like someone stole their trunks.

1010
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:41,452
My grand-a father has-a broken down.

1011
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:45,021
If-a one of-a you would help,
I would be so thankful.

1012
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:48,051
Sounds like you need
some roadside assistance.

1013
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,608
-She was talking to me.
-Really? Prove it.

1014
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:52,811
Don't-a fight over me.

1015
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:55,573
Signore Tow Truck, per favore.

1016
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,619
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.

1017
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,150
I don't know about this.
What if l screw things up?

1018
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,529
Impossible.

1019
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,448
Just apply the same level of dedication

1020
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,593
you've been using to play
the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.

1021
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:14,245
It's just that them guys look purty
tough and... Wait, did you say "idiot"?

1022
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,444
-ls that how you see me?
-That's how everyone sees you.

1023
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:19,263
isn't that the idea?

1024
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,432
1 tell you, that's the genius of it.

1025
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,287
No one realizes they're being fooled

1026
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,940
because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.

1027
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:27,679
Brilliant!

1028
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,741
-Why aren't you in disguise?
-l...

1029
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:36,006
-Come on! There's no time! Go!
-Okay. Okay.

1030
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:38,853
-Computer, disguise!
-Request acknowledged.

1031
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:47,152
It's the boss. He's coming.

1032
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:54,386
Ivan.

1033
01:03:56,966 --> 01:04:01,096
Ivan, why do you insult me so
by making me wait here?

1034
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,146
He's in.

1035
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,630
The racers are now
making their way around the hairpin

1036
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,892
and headed downhill
toward the casino bridge.

1037
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:37,186
No more bets, please.

1038
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,730
Come on, fuzzy dice!

1039
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,468
-Number four. Easy four.
-Yeah!

1040
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,500
Air freshener. Antenna balls.

1041
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,940
Spark-a plugs.

1042
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,551
This place looks like
it's made outta gold!

1043
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,973
That's because it is.
Now, be careful what you say.

1044
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:52,718
Why is that?

1045
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,389
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?

1046
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:56,770
You want me to stop talkin’ to ya
right now?

1047
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,560
You are acting strange today, Ivan.

1048
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,470
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

1049
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,999
“Alexander Hugo,
aka Chop Shop Alex."

1050
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:08,206
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.

1051
01:05:08,538 --> 01:05:11,968
But that makes sense, seein's how
you's wanted in France, Germany...

1052
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:14,410
Mater, stop it!

1053
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:14,491
Mater, stop it!

1054
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:16,221
Okay, okay, keep your voice down!

1055
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:17,915
You gonna make me arrested!

1056
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,674
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.

1057
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:22,347
He's so good!

1058
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,620
Victor!

1059
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:25,642
Victor!

1060
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,172
Hey, Victor!

1061
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:29,801
-There you are!
-Come in!

1062
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,689
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.

1063
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,287
It's good to see you.

1064
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,159
Is the big boss here yet?

1065
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:41,187
-No, not yet.
-He's supposed to be here any minute.

1066
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:46,312
Here we go.

1067
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,046
Guten Tag.

1068
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,951
It's just the professor.

1069
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,712
Ziundapp! When is he coming?

1070
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:56,688
He's already here.

1071
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:01,122
Welcome, everyone.

1072
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:01,144
Welcome, everyone.

1073
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:04,187
1 wish I could be with you
on this very special day,

1074
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:06,564
but my clutch assembly broke.

1075
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,033
-You know how it is.
-Forget about it.

1076
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:10,538
We know how you feel.

1077
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,667
-Descramble that voice.
-I'm trying.

1078
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,932
It's too sophisticated.

1079
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,294
We are here to celebrate.

1080
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:20,334
Today, all your hard work pays off.

1081
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,299
The world turned their backs
on cars like us.

1082
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:26,706
They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts.

1083
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:31,527
The only thing they haven't stopped
doing is laughing at us.

1084
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:36,382
They've called us terrible names:
jalopy, rust bucket, heap,

1085
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,779
clunker, junker, beater,
wreck, rattletrap,

1086
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,091
lemon.

1087
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,583
But their insults just give us strength.

1088
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:52,130
Because today, my friends,
that all ends!

1089
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,386
There's smoke on the casino bridge!

1090
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:56,582
Oh, no!

1091
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:58,213
It's Carla Veloso,
the Brazilian race car!

1092
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,096
-What just happened?
-I'm working on it.

1093
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,890
They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.

1094
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:10,821
They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.

1095
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:16,603
Another crash!
it's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.

1096
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,653
Embrace your inner lemon.

1097
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,397
Let it drive you.

1098
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,073
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.

1099
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:29,624
-Finn, it's the camera.
-Where?

1100
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,589
On the tower!

1101
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,810
This was meant to
be alternative fuel's greatest moment.

1102
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,728
But after today,
everyone will race back to gasoline.

1103
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:47,095
And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve

1104
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,656
will become the most powerful cars
in the world!

1105
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:51,467
Get out of the way!

1106
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:29,638
They will come to us,
and they will have no choice,

1107
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:29,779
They will come to us,
and they will have no choice,

1108
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:30,926
because they will need us.

1109
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,323
We figured you might stop by!

1110
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,430
And they will finally respect us!

1111
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:49,361
So hold your hoods high!

1112
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:52,759
After today, you will never again
be ashamed of who you are!

1113
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,130
No!

1114
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:56,152
No!

1115
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:59,134
Long live lemons!

1116
01:08:59,135 --> 01:08:59,155
Long live lemons!

1117
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,408
Number 7 is loose! Shu Todoroki!

1118
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:26,802
Finn?

1119
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:30,074
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!

1120
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,080
McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second!

1121
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:34,702
They have no idea
what happened behind them.

1122
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:34,813
They have no idea
what happened behind them.

1123
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,350
This is impossible!

1124
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:38,446
That's what I'm talking about!
Ka-chow!

1125
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,178
What happened?

1126
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,750
-Where are all the other cars?
-What is going on?

1127
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,033
Oh, no!

1128
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:54,874
Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London
still going to take place?

1129
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,711
1 suppose that...

1130
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,937
The show must go on, as they say.

1131
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,076
I can't believe this is really happening!

1132
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:03,302
Quiet!

1133
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,223
Will you require all the racers
to still run on allinol?

1134
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:11,376
1 cannot, in good conscience, continue
to risk the lives of any more race cars.

1135
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,911
The final race will not be run on allinol.

1136
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,562
There you have it, a clearly devastated
Sir Miles Axlerod

1137
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:22,615
announcing that he will not require the
cars to use allinol for the final race.

1138
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:24,251
A toast!

1139
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:27,917
To the death of allinol
and alternative fuel forever!

1140
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,104
Mater, abort the mission.

1141
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:34,314
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.

1142
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:36,998
How is your grandfather?

1143
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,202
Long live lemons!

1144
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,469
Isn't this a great party, lvan, huh?

1145
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,388
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

1146
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:45,456
You are not leaving, are you?

1147
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,625
Of course I ain't leaving.

1148
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:49,411
-I'm just in shock...
-McQueen?

1149
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:49,732
-I'm just in shock...
-McQueen?

1150
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:52,339
Crashes are a part of racing, I know,

1151
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:55,584
but something like that
should never happen.

1152
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:58,845
You can choose your fuel
for the final race. What it'll be?

1153
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:00,678
Allinol.

1154
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,160
After today?

1155
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:05,005
My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me.

1156
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:07,732
1 didn't stand by
a friend of mine recently.

1157
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,907
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

1158
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,606
So a surprising revelation
from Lightning McQueen.

1159
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:16,405
He will use allinol in the final race,
despite what occurred today.

1160
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:19,603
-... till Lightning McQueen is dead.
-Of course.

1161
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,860
Allinol must be finished for good.

1162
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:27,167
McQueen cannot win the last race.

1163
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,700
Lightning McQueen must be killed!

1164
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:31,136
No!

1165
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,994
It's the American spy!

1166
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:42,691
Dad-gum!

1167
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,742
Gatling gun. Request acknowledged.

1168
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,800
Down! Everybody, down!

1169
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,976
-Shoot! I didn't mean...
-Request acknowledged.

1170
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:04,201
Wait! Wait!
I didn't mean that kind of shoot!

1171
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,400
Correction acknowledged.
Deploying chute.

1172
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,330
Whoa!

1173
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,179
McQueen!

1174
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:19,765
Whoa! What's this?

1175
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,326
Whoa!

1176
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,197
McQueen! McQueen!

1177
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,473
Let me through! Let me through!

1178
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:38,245
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!

1179
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,298
You cannot-a come through here!
Back up.

1180
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:41,913
We have a lunatic at gate 9.

1181
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,380
I was disguised as a tow truck
to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting

1182
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:48,418
and my weapons system's done
misinterperated what I'm saying!

1183
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,445
-Lunatic at gate 9.
-McQueen! McQueen!

1184
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,711
-You are the champion!
-This way, signore.

1185
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,469
-McQueen!
-Mater?

1186
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,260
-McQueen.
-Give us a pose!

1187
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,821
-McQueen!
-Stop moving. Stop!

1188
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,245
Where you going?

1189
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:03,266
Where you going?

1190
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,229
Stop!

1191
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,943
-McQueen!
-That really sounded like...

1192
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:08,747
Mater!

1193
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:09,974
-Mater?
-Signore?

1194
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,089
McQueen! They're gonna kill you!

1195
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:13,515
Mater!

1196
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:15,456
Excuse me.

1197
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,275
No, where are you going?

1198
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:18,702
Scusi. Mater!

1199
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,331
-McQueen!
-Scusi.

1200
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:22,686
Mater! Mater!

1201
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,405
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.

1202
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,800
Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.

1203
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:29,707
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...

1204
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:33,606
That was me. I said, "You killed
out there today. You're the best."

1205
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,550
-What? I mean, thanks.
-Right this way, signore.

1206
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,156
l really thought I heard my friend.

1207
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:44,116
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.

1208
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:47,681
-Wait, what?
-The press is waiting.

1209
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:49,023
Come-a with me, please.

1210
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:54,499
Let me go!

1211
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,950
You actually care about that race car.

1212
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,476
A pity you didn't warn him in time.

1213
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,783
"Idiot"? Is that how you see me?

1214
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:11,835
That's how everyone sees you.
1 tell you, that's the genius of it.

1215
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,041
No one realizes they're being fooled

1216
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:16,750
because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.

1217
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,949
At the fool...

1218
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,105
Excuse me!

1219
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,197
Domo arigato!

1220
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:24,826
Yeah!

1221
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:24,877
Yeah!

1222
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,876
You done good. You got all the leaves.

1223
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:31,418
Check out that tow truck.
I wonder who that guy's with.

1224
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,669
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

1225
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:34,720
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

1226
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:37,547
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

1227
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,710
Somebody get me water! Sweet relief.

1228
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,476
Mater!

1229
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,119
But I never leak oil. Never.

1230
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,858
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

1231
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:57,940
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

1232
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,280
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw you up, did I?

1233
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:03,831
-l lost the race because of you!
-Maybe if I talked to somebody...

1234
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,743
I don't need your help!

1235
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:07,501
I don't want your help.

1236
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,532
Your help...

1237
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:12,072
Bang the gong. Get it on!

1238
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:14,311
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.

1239
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,837
This is exactly why I don't bring you
along to these things!

1240
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,191
Holley! Finn! Where are we?

1241
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,550
We're in London, Mater,
inside Big Bentley.

1242
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,059
This... This is all my fault.

1243
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:54,469
Don't be a fool, Mater.

1244
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,297
But lam, remember? You said so.

1245
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,152
When did l...

1246
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:02,644
Mater, l was complimenting you
on what a good spy you are.

1247
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:04,832
I'm nota spy!

1248
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,384
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time.

1249
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,670
l really am just a tow truck.

1250
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:14,625
Finn, he's not joking.

1251
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:18,407
-l know.
-You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.

1252
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,371
And what's happened to McQueen
is ‘cause I'm such a big one.

1253
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:24,755
This is all my fault.

1254
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,544
-Good. You're up.
-And just in time.

1255
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:33,236
Professor Z wanted you
to have a front-row seat,

1256
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:35,526
for the death of Lightning McQueen.

1257
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,965
-He's still alive?
-Not for much longer.

1258
01:16:51,674 --> 01:16:54,714
-We came as soon as you called.
-I called to talk to Mater.

1259
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,887
It never occurred to me
he wouldn't be there.

1260
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:58,963
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.

1261
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:01,894
And Sarge is in touch with his friends
in the British military.

1262
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,934
You just need
to focus on the race.

1263
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:07,032
I know but, Sally with everything
going on, I'm not sure...

1264
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:10,166
-Sir Axlerod.
-I'm sorry to interrupt.

1265
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:13,809
-It's all right.
-[ just wanted to personally thank you.

1266
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:18,173
Because after Italy, l was finished,
and then you gave me one last shot.

1267
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:19,671
Listen...

1268
01:17:19,902 --> 01:17:22,622
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but I hope you win today.

1269
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,294
You show the world
that they've been wrong about allinol.

1270
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,477
Mater would want you to race.

1271
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:29,498
Mater would want you to race.

1272
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:32,242
All right. For Mater.

1273
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,072
Here he comes.

1274
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:28,265
-What happened?
-I don't know, Professor.

1275
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:30,567
-What did you do?
-I didn't do nothing.

1276
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,570
I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?

1277
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:35,333
-You broke it!
-Quiet!

1278
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:37,751
-l understand, sir. Yes.
-What did he say?

1279
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:40,777
-We go to the back-up plan.
-Back-up plan?

1280
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,243
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.

1281
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,759
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow"

1282
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:49,129
he's going to go "ka-boom"!

1283
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,889
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.

1284
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:55,499
Wait, you could have!

1285
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:58,508
-Dad-gum lemons!
-Request acknowledged.

1286
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:01,285
What? You didn't think
we'd take your bullets?

1287
01:19:04,807 --> 01:19:06,587
That's right! You got nothing!

1288
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:10,120
Who's the lemon now, huh?

1289
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:14,181
Nice try, Mater.

1290
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:17,974
-Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.
-Request... Request... Request...

1291
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,248
Mater!

1292
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:27,491
I got to get y'all out of there.

1293
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:29,966
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.

1294
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,239
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.

1295
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,911
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.

1296
01:19:35,638 --> 01:19:37,538
-You can do that.
-What about you guys?

1297
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:40,896
-We'll be okay.
-Go and get some more dents, Mater.

1298
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:52,082
So, we'll be okay? Really?

1299
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,353
He wouldn't have left
if I'd told him the truth.

1300
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,884
Being killed by a clock.

1301
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,514
Gives a whole new meaning to
“Your time has come.”

1302
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:02,919
Time? That's it!

1303
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:13,249
-What are you doing?
-Trying to turn back time.

1304
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:19,889
If l can just reverse the polarity.

1305
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,489
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.

1306
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,592
What's everybody
on the wrong side of the road for?

1307
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:39,297
No!

1308
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,648
Drive! Burn rubber!

1309
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:50,307
We've got to get to the course.

1310
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,850
Calculate the fastest way to...

1311
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:55,587
Done.

1312
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:57,338
Miss Shiftwell.

1313
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,000
-They're standard issue now.
-You kids get all the good hardware.

1314
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,385
No, that's Mater's.

1315
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:06,748
I knew his escape was too easy.

1316
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,106
Come back here! Stop!

1317
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:24,545
-Mater?
-Everybody, get out now!

1318
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,396
-Mater?
-Everybody, get out now!

1319
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:28,223
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?

1320
01:21:28,684 --> 01:21:30,824
-We're here because of you, Mater.
-ls everything okay?

1321
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,710
No, everything's not okay.
There's a bomb in here.

1322
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:36,706
-Y'all got to get out. Now.
-A bomb?

1323
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:39,148
-Mater.
-Finn! You're okay.

1324
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:41,562
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

1325
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,313
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

1326
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:46,625
When we were knocked out,
they planted it in your air filter.

1327
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:51,825
Mater! There you are!

1328
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:54,391
-Stop right there!
-I've been so worried about you.

1329
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,540
-Don't come any closer!
-Are you okay?

1330
01:21:56,879 --> 01:21:59,189
No, I'm not okay! Stay away from me!

1331
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:00,905
No, wait! Wait!

1332
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:04,903
A tow truck has just raced
onto the track, driving backwards!

1333
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:06,481
Mater, wait!

1334
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:10,389
Normally an emergency vehicle on the
track means there's been an accident.

1335
01:22:10,826 --> 01:22:13,436
-Lightning McQueen is chasing him!
-Mater, wait!

1336
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:17,222
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you're going to get hurt real bad!

1337
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,835
I know I made you feel that
way before, but none of that matters!

1338
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:22,980
We're best friends!

1339
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:26,383
And McQueen seems to be having

1340
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,345
a conversation with the tow truck.

1341
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:31,076
1 don't know who that truck is, Brent,
but tell you what,

1342
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,702
he's got to be the world's best
backwards driver.

1343
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,603
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!

1344
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:41,532
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!

1345
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,817
You've always been the bomb
and you'll always be the bomb.

1346
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:47,737
-Stay away!
-No! Never!

1347
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:51,434
Almost there.

1348
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:55,243
I'm not letting you get away again!

1349
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:59,085
-Got to keep away from McQueen!
-Request acknowledged.

1350
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:00,535
Oh, my gosh.

1351
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:16,129
What is happening? It's a bad dream!

1352
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,163
And Lightning McQueen
just blasted away,

1353
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,672
hooked to the now rocket-propelled
tow truck.

1354
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:38,088
The Professor's on the run!

1355
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,810
-Someone's got to get McQueen.
-Get McQueen!

1356
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:45,287
-Holley, I'll get Zindapp. Help Mater.
-Got it!

1357
01:23:48,924 --> 01:23:50,654
What is happening?

1358
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,202
Hurry, Professor.

1359
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,643
You really think I'm going to let you
float away, Professor?

1360
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:50,157
-McQueen, let go!
-Never!

1361
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:54,977
-They're coming your way.
-Let's go!

1362
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:04,158
Give it up, McMissile.

1363
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:24,226
-Mater, stop!
-No way! You could get hurt.

1364
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:31,362
Oh, no.

1365
01:25:52,748 --> 01:25:53,918
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.

1366
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:55,483
Bomb?

1367
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:55,564
Bomb?

1368
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:58,411
Yeah, they strapped it to me
to kill you as a back-up plan.

1369
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:01,688
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?

1370
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:01,740
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?

1371
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:04,947
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?

1372
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,259
Death ray?

1373
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:07,695
Turn off the bomb, Ziindapp!

1374
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:10,483
Are you all so dense?
It's voice-activated.

1375
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:12,682
Everything is voice-activated
these days.

1376
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,869
Deactivate! Deactivate!

1377
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:14,920
Deactivate! Deactivate!

1378
01:26:15,237 --> 01:26:16,527
Voice denied.

1379
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:22,448
Did I forget to mention
that it can only be disarmed

1380
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,334
by the one who activated it?

1381
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,660
-Say it.
-Deactivate.

1382
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:29,009
Voice denied.

1383
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:35,454
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?

1384
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:38,815
-You read my mind.
-He was getting on my nerves.

1385
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,294
-What do we do?
-It's very simple. You blow up.

1386
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,328
I'm going out on a limb here. These are
the guys that want me dead, correct?

1387
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,738
-It's nothing personal.
-Fellers, listen.

1388
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:53,414
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.

1389
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:57,206
But becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams

1390
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,263
ain't gonna make you feel better.

1391
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:03,079
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.

1392
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:13,651
Pit stop.

1393
01:27:17,866 --> 01:27:19,596
Not today, boys.

1394
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:30,348
Retreat!

1395
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:35,115
Thanks for the help, Corporal.

1396
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,997
Anything for one of Pop's mates.

1397
01:27:44,226 --> 01:27:45,425
What's he saying? What's wrong?

1398
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:48,154
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.

1399
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:51,934
I get it. I get it!

1400
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,320
-l know what needs to be done.
-Then do it!

1401
01:27:54,703 --> 01:27:56,783
What? No. I can't do it.

1402
01:27:57,172 --> 01:27:58,951
Nobody takes me seriously.

1403
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:01,767
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.

1404
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,670
Yes, it is.

1405
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:06,459
Look, you're yourself
in Radiator Springs.

1406
01:28:06,882 --> 01:28:08,371
Be yourself here.

1407
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:10,493
And if people
aren't taking you seriously,

1408
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:13,222
then they need to change, not you.

1409
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:15,764
I know that
because I was wrong before.

1410
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:18,738
Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.

1411
01:28:19,194 --> 01:28:20,094
Thanks, buddy.

1412
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,498
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!

1413
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:24,858
Right. Hang on!

1414
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:28,464
Where's he going?

1415
01:28:30,105 --> 01:28:31,714
-Computer!
-Yes, Agent Mater?

1416
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,760
I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!

1417
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:36,293
Request acknowledged.

1418
01:28:39,948 --> 01:28:41,908
-Mater?
-Now I need you to do the chute!

1419
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:44,124
The second kind, not the first!

1420
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:45,849
Deploying chute.

1421
01:29:09,878 --> 01:29:11,248
Who's winning the race?

1422
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:17,924
-Back off! Back away!
-It's Lightning McQueen!

1423
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,753
No, it's okay! Tell ‘em, Mater. Explain.

1424
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:22,059
Okay.

1425
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,400
Somebody's been sabotaging

1426
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:25,828
the racers and hurtin’ the cars,
and I know who.

1427
01:29:26,261 --> 01:29:27,841
Wait. Your Majesty.

1428
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,370
Bomb! It's a bomb!

1429
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:33,202
-Everybody, down!
-Back up! Move it!

1430
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:37,373
Get off the stage! Move it!

1431
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:40,228
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!

1432
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:43,545
Mater, I don't know what you're doing,
but stand down now.

1433
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,065
This ain't nothing at all
like Radiator Springs.

1434
01:29:46,448 --> 01:29:48,588
Mater, just cut to the chase.

1435
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:50,294
Okay. It's him.

1436
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:53,769
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

1437
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:55,926
I figured it out when I realized

1438
01:29:56,258 --> 01:29:59,008
y'all attached this ticking time bomb
with Whitworth bolts,

1439
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:01,574
the same bolts that hold together
that old British engine

1440
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:02,813
from the photograph.

1441
01:30:04,299 --> 01:30:05,879
-Holley! Show that picture.
-Okay.

1442
01:30:06,201 --> 01:30:08,481
l remembered what they say
about old British engines:

1443
01:30:08,937 --> 01:30:11,187
if there ain't no oil under ‘em,
there ain't no oil in ‘em.

1444
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:13,166
What is he talking about?

1445
01:30:13,475 --> 01:30:15,785
It was you leaking oil
at the party in Japan.

1446
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:17,641
You just blamed it on me.

1447
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:20,286
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.

1448
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:23,815
Then you're fakin’ it.
You didn't convert to no electric.

1449
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:27,603
If we pop that hood,
we'll see that engine from that picture.

1450
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,623
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

1451
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:31,023
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

1452
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:33,617
Stay away!

1453
01:30:33,862 --> 01:30:37,262
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?

1454
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:40,852
To make allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil.

1455
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:43,829
He said it himself
with that disguised voice.

1456
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:47,642
Disguised voice? What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you are!

1457
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:50,519
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.

1458
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:53,166
One moment, I'd like to see
where this is going.

1459
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:55,962
Mater, he created allinol.

1460
01:30:56,318 --> 01:30:58,158
But what if he found that huge oil field

1461
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,690
just as the world was trying to find
something else?

1462
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:04,429
What if he came up with allinol
just to make alternative fuel look bad?

1463
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,520
“What if?”
You're basing this on a "what if"?

1464
01:31:07,996 --> 01:31:09,776
-Okay, that's it.
-Lads, clear out.

1465
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,911
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!

1466
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:14,981
-Keep away, you idiot!
-Mater!

1467
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:18,241
-Mater!
-Someone do something!

1468
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,344
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

1469
01:31:23,345 --> 01:31:23,365
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

1470
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:29,340
Bomb deactivated.
Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.

1471
01:31:37,192 --> 01:31:39,772
-The engine from the photo.
-It's a perfect match.

1472
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:42,496
How did the tow truck figure it out?

1473
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:42,517
How did the tow truck figure it out?

1474
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:45,850
It's official. You're coming to
all my races from now on.

1475
01:31:46,401 --> 01:31:48,571
Now you're talkin’!

1476
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:58,721
Mater, let's go. You're on.

1477
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:05,377
Your Majesty, may I present

1478
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:09,194
for the investiture of honorary
knighthood of the British Realm,

1479
01:32:09,758 --> 01:32:12,888
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.

1480
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:15,538
Go get 'em, buddy.

1481
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:27,027
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.

1482
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:32,187
Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater,
Your Majesty.

1483
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,640
I don't wanna hear
none of this "sir" business.

1484
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:36,625
By the way, have y’all met each other?

1485
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:38,531
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.

1486
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,523
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile,
McQueen. Queen, McMissile.

1487
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:49,538
So there we was,
my rocket jets going full blast,

1488
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:51,551
McQueen hanging on for dear life

1489
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:55,376
when suddenly them two nasty lemons
come out of nowheres, guns drawed.

1490
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,460
We was goners.

1491
01:32:57,772 --> 01:33:00,582
But then, out of nowhere
this beautiful spy car

1492
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,826
swoops in from the sky to save us!

1493
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:05,608
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.

1494
01:33:06,047 --> 01:33:07,857
Minny, please. Come on!

1495
01:33:08,216 --> 01:33:11,556
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.

1496
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,400
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit far-fetched.

1497
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:17,537
Holley! What are you doin’ here?

1498
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:20,409
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.

1499
01:33:20,862 --> 01:33:21,712
Finn!

1500
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,770
Our satellites picked up
an urgent communiqué.

1501
01:33:24,132 --> 01:33:25,682
So you got-a my email.

1502
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,700
Y'all is going to have a great time!

1503
01:33:28,036 --> 01:33:31,636
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.

1504
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,380
Don't tell nobody.

1505
01:33:33,741 --> 01:33:35,441
And this is Holley Shiftwell.

1506
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:37,507
-She's...
-I'm Mater's girlfriend.

1507
01:33:37,846 --> 01:33:39,486
It's so nice to meet you all.

1508
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:41,855
Guido believe you now.

1509
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:44,457
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.

1510
01:33:44,886 --> 01:33:46,406
-Yeah.
-Was that from when you swooped in

1511
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:48,181
and you saved them in London?

1512
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:50,240
-Van!
-What? I'm just asking!

1513
01:33:50,592 --> 01:33:54,692
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone
can get that fixed up for you in no time.

1514
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:58,233
Yeah, sure thing. No problemo.
Let me go get my tools.

1515
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:01,133
No. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.

1516
01:34:02,337 --> 01:34:05,997
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.

1517
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:08,568
Those two are perfect for each other.

1518
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,970
There's one thing I still don't get.

1519
01:34:11,346 --> 01:34:13,925
The bad guys hit me with the beam
from the camera, right?

1520
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:17,602
-So, why didn't I...
-Explode in a fiery inferno?

1521
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,883
-Yeah.
-We couldn't figure that out, either.

1522
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:22,941
Our investigation proved
that allinol was actually gasoline

1523
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:26,444
and Axlerod engineered it so when it
got hit by the beam, it would explode.

1524
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:30,711
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!

1525
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:38,061
If you're implying that I switched
that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel

1526
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:42,143
with my all-natural, sustainable,
organic biofuel

1527
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:47,160
just because I never trusted Axlerod,
you're dead wrong, man!

1528
01:34:47,882 --> 01:34:49,781
It was him!

1529
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:53,871
Once big oil, always big oil, man.

1530
01:34:54,489 --> 01:34:55,598
Tree-hugger.

1531
01:34:56,624 --> 01:34:59,693
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix
is about to begin.

1532
01:35:00,228 --> 01:35:03,388
All spectators, clear the starting line.

1533
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,596
I can't wait to get rockin’.
This is gonna be wicked!

1534
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:09,406
We should do this every year.

1535
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:12,454
Yeah, I just figured we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.

1536
01:35:12,941 --> 01:35:15,340
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.

1537
01:35:15,777 --> 01:35:18,677
-The way I like it.
-Francesco likes it like this, too.

1538
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:22,430
-Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
-Signorina Sally.

1539
01:35:22,984 --> 01:35:23,944
It is official.

1540
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:26,525
Lightning McQueen
is the luckiest car in the world.

1541
01:35:26,955 --> 01:35:28,684
Why, thank you.

1542
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:31,863
Which he will have to be to have
a chance against Francesco today!

1543
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,200
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?

1544
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,950
Just something I had made up
for the occasion.

1545
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:40,143
Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny.

1546
01:35:40,535 --> 01:35:43,055
Was-a funnier when ! did it,
but it's-a very funny.

1547
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:46,254
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?

1548
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,321
Try it. You'll like it.

1549
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:50,706
So, he's not so good-looking.

1550
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:53,129
-Yeah. Nice try.
-I'm serious!

1551
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:55,324
That's why I love you, Sally.

1552
01:35:55,683 --> 01:35:58,233
-Wish me luck!
-You don't need it!

1553
01:35:58,686 --> 01:36:01,875
That Francesco is fine-looking!

1554
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:03,652
And those open wheels.

1555
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:06,737
I'm gonna have to go get myself
some coolant.

1556
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:19,586
Go, Lightning!

1557
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,676
-Go, Stickers!
-Right on, man!

1558
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:41,544
-Go get ‘em, tiger!
-Bravo, bravo!

1559
01:36:41,863 --> 01:36:44,793
-Go, Lightning, go!
-Go, McQueen!

1560
01:36:46,434 --> 01:36:47,574
Finn? Time to go.

1561
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:50,205
Siddeley's gassed, geared
and ready to fly.

1562
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:53,822
-You're leavin’ already?
-We've got another mission.

1563
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:56,964
Just stopped by here
to pick something up.

1564
01:36:57,912 --> 01:37:01,102
Somethin’ tells me you're not
talkin’ about souvenir bumper stickers.

1565
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,789
Her Majesty asked for you
personally, Mater.

1566
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:07,025
-But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
-We know.

1567
01:37:07,555 --> 01:37:10,775
Spy or not, you're still the smartest,
most honest chap we've ever met.

1568
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:14,256
-Don't forget massively charming.
-Well, thanks.

1569
01:37:14,762 --> 01:37:17,482
But as much fun as it was
hangin’ with y'all, this...

1570
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:20,443
This is home.

1571
01:37:20,702 --> 01:37:23,222
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.

1572
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,311
You still owe me that first date.

1573
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,270
If there's ever anything I can do
for you, just let me know.

1574
01:37:28,876 --> 01:37:31,776
Well, l sure appreciate that. Thank you.

1575
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,969
Actually, there is one thing.

1576
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:39,848
I'll be doggone!

1577
01:37:44,559 --> 01:37:45,899
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1578
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,519
Thanks, Mater!

1579
01:38:01,909 --> 01:38:03,608
Impossible!

1580
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:05,579
Mater!

1581
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:08,063
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.

1582
01:38:08,483 --> 01:38:10,293
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!

1583
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:12,401
Not if l see you first!

1584
01:38:12,754 --> 01:38:14,483
Yippee!
