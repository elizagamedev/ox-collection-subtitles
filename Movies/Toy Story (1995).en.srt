1
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:29,012
All right, everyone!
This... is a stick-up!

2
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,043
Don't anybody move!

3
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,239
Now, empty that safe!

4
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,053
Money, money, money!

5
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,553
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

6
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,599
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

7
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,808
Help! Baa!
Help us!

8
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:50,184
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

9
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,534
Reach for the sky!

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,100
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

11
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,862
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

12
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,515
How'd you know it was me?

13
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,360
Are you gonna come quietly?

14
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,946
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

15
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,014
l brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field.

16
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,724
Well, l brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

17
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,926
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart!

18
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,126
Say goodbye to the wife
and Tater Tots.

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,970
You saved the day again, Woody.

20
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,640
You're my favorite deputy.

21
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,496
You've got a friend in me

22
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,604
You've got a friend in me

23
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,125
You've got a friend in me

24
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,382
Come on,
let's wrangle up the cattle.

25
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,641
When the road looks rough ahead

26
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,981
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

27
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,527
Round 'em up, cowboy!

28
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,559
Just remember
what your old pal said

29
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,239
Boy, you've got a friend in me

30
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,492
Yee-haw!

31
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,908
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

32
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,072
Hey, cowboy!

33
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:11,114
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than 1am

34
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,278
Big and stronger too

35
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,437
Come on, Woody.

36
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,655
Maybe

37
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:20,379
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

38
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,854
It's me and you, boy

39
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,875
And as the years go by

40
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,817
Whoa! Whoa!

41
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,424
Our friendship will never die

42
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,109
You're gonna see
It's our destiny

43
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,859
You've got a friend in me

44
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,381
All right!

45
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,796
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

46
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,332
Score!

47
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,637
- You got a friend in me
- Wow! Cool!

48
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,974
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!

49
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,577
Okay, birthday boy...

50
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,615
We saw that at the store!
l asked you for it!

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,640
- [hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so...

52
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,432
- One, two... Four.
- Oh, my gosh, you got...

53
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,081
- Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough.
- Could we leave this up 'til we move?

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,119
- Well, sure! We can leave it up.
- Yeah!

55
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,226
Now go get Molly. Your friends
are gonna be here any minute.

56
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,271
Okay. It's party time, Woody.

57
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,851
Yee...haw!

58
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,844
Howdy, little lady.

59
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,576
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

60
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,308
Come on, Molly.

61
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,943
Oh, you're getting heavy.

62
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,452
See you later, Woody.

63
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,815
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?

64
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,820
Okay, everybody,
coast is clear!

65
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,173
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

66
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,962
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.

67
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:12,655
Hey, Hamm.

68
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,893
- Look, I'm Picasso!
- [don't get it.

69
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,728
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin’ at, ya hockey puck?

70
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,484
- Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!

71
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,524
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

72
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,575
Hey, uh, Slinky?

73
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,064
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

74
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,373
- No. Slink...
- Oh, well, all right.

75
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,142
You can be red if you want.

76
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,603
- Not now, Slink. l got some bad news.
- Bad news?

77
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,125
Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.

78
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,290
Got it.

79
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,188
Be happy!

80
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,860
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium duty.

81
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,011
Hey.

82
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,201
Hey, Etch. Draw!

83
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,474
Oh! Got me again.

84
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,998
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.

85
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,061
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

86
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,758
Now, where is that... Oh.

87
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,287
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

88
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,022
- How're you doin’, Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

89
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,606
Il was close to being scared
that time.

90
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,858
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

91
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,347
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

92
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,671
Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

93
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,590
l wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

94
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,176
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin’.

95
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,199
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

96
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,115
Oh, yeah!

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,140
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

98
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,448
- Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
- Come on, come on.

99
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,832
Smaller toys up front.

100
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,527
Hey, Woody, come on.

101
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,555
Oh, thanks, Mike.

102
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,763
Okay... Whoa, whoa. Step back.

103
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,322
- For crying out loud.
- Thank you.

104
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,022
Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

105
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,188
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

106
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,484
Okay. First item today:

107
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,996
Oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

108
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,724
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

109
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,051
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

110
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,530
Do we have to hold hands?

111
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,943
You guys think this is a big joke.

112
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,438
We've only got one week
left before the move.

113
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,047
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

114
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,863
If you don't have one, get one!

115
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,990
All right, next. Oh, yes.

116
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,279
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting

117
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,913
was, I think, a big success.

118
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,969
And we wanna thank Mr. Spell
for putting that on for us.

119
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,845
- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
- You're welcome.

120
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,181
Okay. Oh, yes.
One minor note here.

121
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,348
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

122
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,868
Wait a minute here!

123
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,962
What do you mean the party's today?
His birthday's not ‘til next week!

124
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,739
What's goin’ on down there?
Is his mom losin’ her marbles?

125
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,412
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party before the move.

126
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,515
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.

127
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,994
Of course Woody ain't worried. He's
been Andy's favorite since kindergarten.

128
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,438
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.

129
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,937
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

130
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,617
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

131
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,263
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

132
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,366
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

133
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,310
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

134
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,776
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

135
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,207
This is Andy
we're talking about.

136
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,254
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

137
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,933
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

138
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,154
That's what we're made for, right?

139
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,786
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

140
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,043
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

141
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,248
Stay calm, everyone!

142
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,694
Hey!

143
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,873
Meeting adjourned.

144
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,229
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

145
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,518
I can't see a thing.

146
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,707
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

147
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,652
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.

148
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,089
- They're all in boxes, you idiot.
- They're getting bigger.

149
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,623
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

150
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:29,875
Hi!

151
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,566
- Spell: trash can.
- We're doomed!

152
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,397
All right! All right!

153
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,283
If l send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

154
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,074
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.

155
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,761
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

156
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:53,015
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

157
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,870
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!

158
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,456
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

159
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,647
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

160
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,948
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

161
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,249
Yeah!

162
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,330
Okay, come on, kids.

163
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,148
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

164
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,149
All right, gangway, gangway.

165
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,245
And this is how we find out

166
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,658
what is in those presents.

167
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,284
Okay, who's hungry?

168
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,425
Here come the chips!

169
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,850
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue!

170
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,502
What in the world... Oh!

171
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,737
I thought I told him
to pick these up.

172
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,968
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

173
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,141
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

174
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,671
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

175
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,867
Go on without me!
Just go!

176
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,816
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

177
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,489
Okay, everybody, come on.

178
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,459
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody...

179
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,359
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

180
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,713
Good. And... Which present
are you gonna open first?

181
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,674
- Mine!
- There they are.

182
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,873
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.

183
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,433
- This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet!
- Come in, Mother Bird.

184
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,475
Alf right, Andy's opening
the first present now.

185
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,289
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!

186
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,418
Hey, I can dream, can't I?

187
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,473
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

188
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,007
It's a... It's...
It's a... a lunch box.

189
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,232
- We've got a lunch box here.
- Alunch box?

190
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,235
- Lunch box?
- For lunch.

191
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,463
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...

192
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,462
- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?

193
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,079
Oh! Only one left.

194
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,616
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!

195
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,972
It's a big one. It's a...

196
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,398
- It's a board game! Repeat, Battleship!
- Whew!

197
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,717
Hallelujah!

198
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,696
- Yeah! All right!
- Hey, watch it!

199
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,741
Sorry there, old spud head.

200
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,400
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

201
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,099
So did I tell ya?
Nothin’ to worry about.

202
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,456
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

203
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,426
Wait a minute. Oh!

204
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,969
- What do we have here?
- Wait! Turn that thing back on!

205
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,696
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!

206
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,888
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

207
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,590
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

208
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,094
- Mom, what is it?
- It's a huge package.

209
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,795
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

210
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,006
-It'sa...
- Wow!

211
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,413
It's a what? What is it?

212
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,154
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!

213
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,012
- Now we'll never know what it is!
- Way to go, Rex!

214
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,744
No, no! Turn him around!
Turn him around!

215
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,584
He's puttin’ 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin’ 'em in backwards!

216
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,199
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

217
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,930
Let's go to my room, guys!

218
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,516
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

219
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,213
- There!
- Juvenile intrusion!

220
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,185
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

221
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,156
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

222
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,189
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

223
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,968
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

224
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,507
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

225
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,687
Hey, look, its lasers light up.
Take that, Zurg!

226
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,730
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

227
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,897
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

228
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,930
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

229
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,132
We've got prizes!

230
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,170
We've got prizes!

231
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,659
- What the heck is up there?
- Woody, who's up there with ya?

232
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,177
Woody?

233
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,365
- What are you doing under the bed?
- Nothin’. Nothin’.

234
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,305
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

235
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,965
Too much cake and ice cream,
Il suppose. It's just a mistake!

236
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,691
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

237
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,001
- Have you been replaced?
- What did I tell you earlier?

238
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,648
No one is getting replaced.

239
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,717
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there

240
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,417
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

241
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,572
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

242
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,001
Come in, Star Command.

243
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,413
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?

244
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,956
Why don't they answer? My ship!

245
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,125
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.

246
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,239
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

247
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,608
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

248
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,332
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

249
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,938
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

250
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,551
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

251
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,798
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

252
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,135
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

253
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,708
Hello!

254
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,123
Whoa! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

255
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,722
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

256
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,325
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

257
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,427
And this is Andy's room.
That's all l wanted to say.

258
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,122
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

259
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,531
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

260
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,103
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

261
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,066
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

262
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,629
My ship has crash-landed here
by mistake.

263
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,981
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

264
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,042
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

265
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,960
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

266
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,890
Well, let's see. We got double-A's.

267
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,636
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

268
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,954
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

269
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,737
- Do you know these life-forms?
- Yes! They're Andy's toys.

270
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,207
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

271
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,976
lam Buzz Lightyear.
Il come in peace.

272
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,342
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

273
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,929
Wh-why, thank you!

274
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,898
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

275
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,755
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

276
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,710
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

277
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,084
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

278
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,803
- Only it's...
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

279
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,222
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

280
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,546
Probably all copper wiring, huh?

281
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,505
So, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

282
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,603
Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

283
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,402
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit

284
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,304
of the Space Ranger Corps,

285
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,956
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion

286
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,955
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

287
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,837
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

288
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,949
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

289
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,539
I'm actually from a smaller company that
was purchased in a leveraged buyout.

290
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,212
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

291
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,473
Well, sure. Look at him. He's got more
gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.

292
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,510
Please be careful.

293
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,141
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

294
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,568
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

295
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,607
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

296
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,453
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

297
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,951
All right, that's enough!

298
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,909
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

299
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,759
- Toy?
- T-O-Y. Toy!

300
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,702
Excuse me, I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

301
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:51,076
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

302
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,901
Gettin’ kinda tense, aren't ya?

303
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,012
Mr. Lightyear, now, I'm curious.

304
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,844
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

305
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,024
He's not a Space Ranger!

306
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,307
He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!

307
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,044
Excuse me.

308
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,734
Oh, impressive wingspan!
Very good!

309
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,129
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

310
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,951
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

311
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,985
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

312
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,571
- You can't.
- Can.

313
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,143
Can't. Can't. Can't!

314
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,774
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

315
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:31,924
- Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
- All right, then, I will.

316
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,211
Stand back, everyone!

317
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,317
To infinity and beyond!

318
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,254
- Can!
- Whoa!

319
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,606
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

320
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,719
- [found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.

321
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,773
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

322
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,110
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

323
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,637
- Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!

324
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,247
You know, in a couple of days,

325
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,522
everything will be just the way
it was. They'll see.

326
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,779
They'll see.

327
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,004
I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

328
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,030
! was on top of the world
livin’ high

329
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,200
It was right in my pocket

330
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,674
! was livin’ the life

331
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:54,047
Things were just the way
they should be

332
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,285
When from out of the sky
like a bomb

333
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,651
Comes some little punk
in a rocket

334
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,235
Now alf of a sudden some
strange things are happening to me

335
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,436
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

336
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,739
Strange

337
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,254
Things are happening to me

338
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,550
Strange

339
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,953
Things

340
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:28,643
Strange things are happening to me

341
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,743
Ain't no doubt about it

342
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,693
! had friends
! had lots of friends

343
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,883
Now aif my friends are gone

344
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,241
And I'm doin’ the best l can

345
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,323
To carry on

346
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,598
- l had power
- Power

347
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,097
- l was respected
- Respected

348
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,386
But not any more

349
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,064
And I've lost the love of the one

350
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,891
Whom I adore

351
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:09,107
Let me tell you ‘bout it
Strange

352
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,195
Things are happenin’ to me

353
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:17,263
Strange

354
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,527
Things

355
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,597
Strange

356
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,413
Things are happenin’ to me

357
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,928
Ain't no doubt about it

358
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,087
Strange

359
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,764
Things

360
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:42,045
Strange

361
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,081
Things

362
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,129
Finally!

363
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,102
Hey, who's got my hat?

364
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,803
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

365
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,098
Gimme that!

366
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,866
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

367
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,836
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

368
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,715
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

369
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,055
Wow!

370
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,629
With permanent ink too!

371
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,219
Well, l must get back
to repairing my ship.

372
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,457
Don't let it get to you, Woody.

373
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,113
Let what? I don't...
What do you mean? Who?

374
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,936
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.

375
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,502
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

376
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,202
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right, that's it!

377
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,711
Unidirectional bonding strip.

378
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,096
Mr. Lightyear wants more tape.

379
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,694
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

380
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:45,388
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

381
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,158
What are you talking about?

382
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,649
Where's that bonding strip?

383
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,560
And another thing:

384
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:56,370
Stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!

385
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,082
Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?

386
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,955
Okay! Well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

387
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,885
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

388
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,525
The air isn't... toxic.

389
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:24,226
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet
on an uncharted planet!

390
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,400
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

391
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,694
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?

392
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,909
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

393
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,128
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

394
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,315
You're mocking me,
aren't you?

395
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,050
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

396
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,686
Where?

397
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,436
Yes!

398
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,430
It's Sid!

399
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,368
Don't move!

400
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:02,874
I thought he was at summer camp.

401
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,858
They must've kicked him out
early this year.

402
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,418
Oh, no, not Sid!

403
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,990
Incoming!

404
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,967
- Who is it this time?
- L... Lean't... can't tell.

405
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,193
- Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.

406
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:20,152
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch
one of these again.

407
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,336
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

408
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,631
What's going on?

409
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,139
Nothing that concerns you spacemen,
just us toys.

410
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,976
I'd better take a look anyway.

411
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,417
Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

412
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,912
That's why: Sid.

413
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,086
Sure is a hairy fellow.

414
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,187
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

415
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,737
That is Sid.

416
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,896
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.

417
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,953
He tortures toys, just for fun!

418
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,049
Well, then we've got
to do something.

419
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,158
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

420
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,094
- I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
- Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

421
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,872
Melt him with your scary laser.

422
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,849
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

423
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,616
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

424
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,856
Look out!

425
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,029
Yes! He's gone! He's history!

426
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,486
I could've stopped him.

427
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,565
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

428
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,545
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

429
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,921
The sooner we move, the better.

430
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,947
Yeah!

431
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,675
To infinity and beyond!

432
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,236
All this packing
makes me hungry.

433
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:48,031
What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?

434
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,026
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

435
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,407
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

436
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,399
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.

437
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,433
- Just one?
- One toy?

438
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,088
Will Andy pick me?

439
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,216
"Don't count on it"?

440
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,976
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.

441
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,639
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.
We've got trouble!

442
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,462
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.

443
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,237
A helpless toy, it's...
it's trapped, Buzz!

444
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,777
Then we've no time to lose.

445
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,969
I don't see anything!

446
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,207
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!

447
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,479
What kind of toy...

448
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,182
Buzz!

449
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,453
Buzz!

450
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,619
I don't see him in the driveway.

451
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:26,098
- [ think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Oh! Buzz!

452
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:32,694
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

453
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,215
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- What do you mean?

454
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,772
- [mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...
- No!

455
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,204
.. by Woody!

456
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,294
- What?
- Wait a minute.

457
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:46,608
You don't think I meant to knock Buzz
out the window, do you? Potato Head?

458
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,841
That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

459
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:51,851
Now, it was an accident, guys.

460
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,797
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.

461
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,020
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

462
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,877
Well, ye... N...
I don't like confrontations!

463
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,320
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

464
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,486
You don't deserve to... Hey!

465
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,445
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

466
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:13,838
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

467
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,359
So you got rid of him.

468
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,841
Well, what if Andy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

469
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,280
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

470
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,302
I don't think we should
give him the chance.

471
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,151
There he is, men. Frag him!

472
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,926
Let's string him up
by his pull string!

473
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,314
- [got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it!

474
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:29,904
Tackle him!

475
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,132
No, no, no! Wait!
Il can explain everything!

476
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,197
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.

477
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:36,516
Retreat!

478
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,873
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?

479
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,339
No, I haven't seen him.

480
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,812
- Andy, I'm heading out the door!
- But, Mom, I can't find him!

481
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,466
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

482
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,112
Oh, okay.

483
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,929
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

484
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,369
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

485
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,793
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

486
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,916
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

487
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,363
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

488
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,212
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

489
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,733
Oh, where could he be?

490
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,380
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.

491
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,573
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.

492
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:55,883
Funny, Mom.

493
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,028
Great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

494
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,591
Buzz!

495
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:09,548
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

496
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,038
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

497
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,091
Andy'll find you here,
he'll take us back to the room

498
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:20,705
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

499
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,873
Huh? Right? Buddy?

500
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,329
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

501
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,286
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

502
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:34,156
- Oh. Well, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet, are we?

503
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,570
No.

504
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,394
Okay, come on!

505
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,963
You want a piece of me?

506
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,775
Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

507
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,964
- Next stop.
- Pizza Planet! Yeah!

508
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:14,363
Wh... Doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?

509
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,925
I'm lost!

510
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,278
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

511
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:27,925
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

512
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,176
The local sheriff and l seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.

513
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,586
You!

514
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,728
- According to my navi-computer, the...
- Shut up!

515
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,074
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

516
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,571
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

517
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,224
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

518
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,250
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

519
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:09,593
Oh, yeah?

520
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,515
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your
stupid little cardboard spaceship

521
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,833
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

522
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,567
Don't talk to me
about importance!

523
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,645
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

524
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,975
What? What are
you talkin’ about?

525
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,857
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg

526
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,797
has been secretly building
a weapon

527
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,628
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

528
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,738
l alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

529
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,509
And you, my friend,
are responsible

530
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:40,048
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!

531
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,369
You... are... a... toy!

532
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,819
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a...

533
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:50,354
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

534
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:55,101
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity.

535
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,700
Farewell.

536
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,598
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!

537
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,985
"Rendezvous with Star Command."

538
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,521
- Hey, gas dude!
- You talkin’ to me?

539
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,634
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- Pizza Planet? Andy!

540
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,547
Do you know
where Cutting Boulevard is?

541
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,081
Oh, no!

542
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,044
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

543
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,073
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away!

544
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,487
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! I...

545
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,518
I found a spaceship!

546
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,068
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

547
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,212
Come on, man, hurry up! Like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

548
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,933
- Cutting Boulevard, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?

549
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,110
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin

550
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,603
once it jettisons its food supply?

551
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:47,905
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

552
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,657
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

553
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,913
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

554
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,162
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

555
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,536
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, bu...

556
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,831
Buzz! Buzz!

557
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,543
That's two lefts
and a right, huh?

558
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,388
- Thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah. And remember, kid...

559
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,270
Buzz!

560
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,284
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

561
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,503
Next shuttle lift-off
is scheduled for

562
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,879
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.

563
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,158
You are clear to enter.

564
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,077
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

565
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,751
The white zone
is for immediate pizza...

566
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:05,973
Sheriff!

567
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,952
There you are.

568
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,837
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

569
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,919
Great idea, Woody.

570
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:19,015
I like your thinkin’.

571
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,857
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

572
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,690
Now!

573
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,565
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

574
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:29,712
Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...

575
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,891
Hey, Mom,
can we have some tokens?

576
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:34,127
Watch where you're going!

577
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,136
Sorry.

578
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:45,606
Nine, eight, seven, six,

579
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,434
five, four, three,

580
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,758
two, one.

581
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,183
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

582
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:06,515
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?

583
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,605
- Andy!
- Now, we need to find a ship

584
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,510
- that's headed for Sector 12.
- Wait a minute. No, Buzz! This way.

585
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,066
- There's a special ship. I just saw it.
- You mean it has hyperdrive?

586
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,623
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

587
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,846
And Astro... turf!

588
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,712
- Where is it? I don't see the...
- Come on. That's it.

589
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,984
Spaceship!

590
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,165
All right, Buzz, get ready.
And...

591
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,732
- And the universe explodes!
- Okay, Buzz, when I say go,

592
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:35,080
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!

593
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,605
- No!
- Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

594
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,173
can Il have some alien slime?

595
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,812
This cannot be happening to me.

596
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,104
- A stranger.
- From the outside.

597
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,161
Greetings. ! am Buzz Lightyear.

598
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,397
Il come in peace.

599
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,011
Before your space journey,
re-energize yourself

600
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:11,115
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

601
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,806
This is an intergalactic emergency.

602
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,384
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 12.

603
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,958
Who's in charge here?

604
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,827
The claw!

605
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,841
The claw is our master.

606
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,296
The claw chooses who will go
and who will stay.

607
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,609
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

608
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,357
Take that!

609
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,183
Oh, no! Sid!

610
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:38,551
Get down!

611
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,215
What's gotten into you? I was...

612
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,100
You are the one that decided
to climb into this...

613
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,205
The claw, it moves.

614
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,507
l have been chosen!

615
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,249
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

616
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,075
Gotcha!

617
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,356
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!

618
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,572
Yes!

619
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,444
Buzz! No!

620
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,004
Hey!

621
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:30,678
He has been chosen!

622
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,625
- He must go.
- Hey!

623
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,644
- What are you doing?
- Do not fight the claw.

624
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,556
Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!

625
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:42,578
All right!
Double prizes!

626
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,803
Let's go home and... play.

627
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,379
Sheriff, l can see
your dwelling from here.

628
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,382
- You're almost home.
- Nirvana is coming.

629
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,848
- The mystic portal awaits.
- Will you be quiet?

630
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,614
You guys don't get it, do you?

631
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,982
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

632
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,852
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

633
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,935
Sit! Good boy.

634
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:22,217
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!

635
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,332
Ready, set, now!

636
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,242
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!

637
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,591
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?

638
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,077
- [don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

639
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,020
I don't know!

640
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,392
- Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
- What? Hey!

641
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,511
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!

642
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,743
I'll have to perform
one of my operations.

643
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,453
- No!
- No, not Sid's room. Not there.

644
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,632
Hey, give her back!

645
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,064
Sid! Sid!

646
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,703
Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, nurse.

647
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,957
Prepare the OR, stat!

648
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,948
Patient is... prepped.

649
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:07,891
No one's ever attempted a double
bypass brain transplant before.

650
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,639
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

651
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,453
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

652
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,988
Doctor, you've done it!

653
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,291
Hannah!

654
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,230
Janie's all better now.

655
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,527
- Mom! Mom!
- She's lying!

656
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,303
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

657
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:46,075
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

658
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,508
Locked.

659
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,810
There's gotta be another way
outta here.

660
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,337
Buzz? Was that you?

661
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,284
Hey, hi there, little fella.

662
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,602
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

663
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,303
Buzz!

664
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,139
They're cannibals.

665
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,687
Mayday, mayday.

666
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,892
Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.

667
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,285
Star Command, do you copy?

668
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,294
I've set my laser from stun to kill.

669
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,392
Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

670
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,854
Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

671
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,520
Buzz, is that you?

672
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,879
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

673
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,741
You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

674
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:42,895
Look, they're home.

675
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,872
Mom, have you seen Woody?

676
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,634
- Where was the last place you left him?
- Right here in the van.

677
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,997
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

678
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:58,204
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.

679
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:00,831
Woody's gone?

680
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,945
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

681
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,241
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

682
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,303
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

683
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,341
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.

684
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:21,180
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

685
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,562
I can see your will is strong.

686
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,096
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

687
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,599
Where are your rebel friends now?

688
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,293
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

689
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,798
All right!

690
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,219
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

691
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,944
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

692
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:09,154
Il sure hope this isn't permanent.

693
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,924
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.

694
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,946
The door. It's open!
We're free!

695
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,606
- Woody, we don't know what's out there!
- I'll tell you wha...

696
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,877
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!

697
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,250
Shield your eyes.

698
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,852
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. It should be good for...

699
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,353
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

700
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,007
- Get away!
- Hey! Hey! How're you doin’ that?

701
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:38,033
- Stop that.
- Back! Back, you savages! Back!

702
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:41,936
- Woody, stop it!
- Sorry, guys, but dinner's canceled!

703
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,200
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

704
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,280
There's no place like home.

705
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:04,126
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
you're gonna get us killed.

706
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,024
Don't tell me what to do.

707
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,596
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!

708
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,490
We got to get this wagon train
a-movin'!

709
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:35,902
Split up!

710
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:00,849
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.

711
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,779
- This is Star Command.
- Star Command!

712
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,720
- Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
- Buzz Lightyear responding.

713
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,333

729
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,710
And welcome back to the
Point Richmond Bowling Championship.

730
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:58,692
Out among the stars I sit

731
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,593
Way beyond the moon

732
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:07,367
In my silver ship I sailed

733
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:11,652
Toadream
that ended too soon

734
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,689
Now I know exactly

735
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,119
Who I am and what I'm here for

736
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,591
You are a toy! You can't fly!

737
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:27,894
And I will go sailing

738
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:31,884
No more

739
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:40,344
But no, it can't be true

740
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:43,615
! could fly if l wanted to

741
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,311
Like a bird in the sky

742
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,327
If l believed I could fly

743
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:52,517
Why, I'd fly

744
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,430
To infinity and beyond!

745
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:14,772
Clearly, I

746
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:19,482
Will go sailing

747
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:22,444
No more

748
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:37,180
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

749
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,701
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

750
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,124
What, dear? What was that?

751
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,890
Never mind!

752
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,646
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

753
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:58,165
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.

754
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:02,179
Really?
That is so interesting.

755
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,910
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?

756
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:07,113
Buzz!

757
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,621
It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.

758
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:13,444
- Oh, no!
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.

759
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,714
It goes quite well with your head.

760
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,227
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

761
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,080
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

762
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,513
I'll be right back.

763
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,394
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?

764
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,424
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?

765
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:36,618
Gone! It's all gone.

766
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,474
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. See ya.

767
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:40,807
What happened to you?

768
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,441
One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.

769
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:47,801
And suddenly you find yourself
suckin’ down Darjeeling with

770
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,609
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

771
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,043
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

772
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,091
Let's get you outta here, Buzz.

773
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:59,973
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

774
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,497
- lam Mrs. Nesbitt!
- Snap out of it, Buzz!

775
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,966
I'm sorry. I...
You're right.

776
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,008
lam just a little depressed.
That's all.

777
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,590
I can get through this.

778
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,710
Oh, I'm a sham!

779
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,504
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz.

780
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,953
I can't even fly out of a window.

781
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,189
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

782
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,400
- The apron is a bit much.
- "Out the window"!

783
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,592
Buzz, you're a genius!

784
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:32,708
Come on, come on. This way.

785
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,720
Years of academy, training, wasted!

786
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,047
B-3.

787
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,968
Miss! G-6.

788
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,411
You sunk it. Are you peeking?

789
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,673
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

790
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,283
- Give me the nose. Come on.
- How about three out of five?

791
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:53,204
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

792
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,707
- Son of a building block. It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.

793
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,863
- Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!

794
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:00,252
- Woody?
- You're kidding!

795
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,087
- Woody?
- We're gonna get outta here, Buzz.

796
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,307
Buzz?

797
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,854
- Hey, look!
- Woody!

798
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:13,776
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

799
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,411
- [knew you'd come back, Woody.
- What are you doin’ over there?

800
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,827
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

801
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,926
Here! Catch this!

802
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:24,536
- Whoa! I've got it, Woody.
- He got it, Woody.

803
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,465
Good goin’, Slink. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin’.

804
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,075
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How ‘bout we don't?

805
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,654
- Hey!
- Potato Head.

806
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,409
Did you all take stupid pills
this morning?

807
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,441
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?

808
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,509
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

809
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,518
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it...
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.

810
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,179
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

811
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,435
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

812
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:51,945
Tell the nice toys that you're...
that you're not dead.

813
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,542
Tell the nice toys that you're...
that you're not dead.

814
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:59,226
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

815
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,424
That's very funny, Buzz.

816
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:04,843
- This is serious!
- Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

817
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,032
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

818
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,221
Oh! Hi, Buzz!

819
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:13,311
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

820
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:16,784
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,846
Hey, look! It's Buzz!

Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys

00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,384
Give me five, man!

824
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,259
Something's screwy here.

825
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,714
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?

826
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,779
You bet. Give me a hug.

827
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,252
Boy, I love you too.

828
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,228
See? It is Buzz.

829
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,920
- Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
- Wait just a minute.

830
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,542

00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,688

Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!

841
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:14,188
No! No! Come back!

842
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,288
Slinky!

843
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,269
Buzz! Go away!

844
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,042
You disgusting freaks!

845
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,825
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!

846
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:42,035
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

847
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,199
What are you doin'?

848
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,700
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

849
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,216
But they're cannibals.

850
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,725
We saw them eat
those other toys.

851
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,255
Sorry. I thought
that you were gonna...

852
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:10,134
You know, you know, eat my friend.

853
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,298
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

854
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,126
- What's wrong?
- Sid?

855
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,588
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

856
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,219
- Sid! Buzz, come on!
- You left that door open.

857
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:22,932
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me!

858
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:27,732
It came!
It finally came!

859
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,105
"The Big One."

860
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,253
"Extremely dangerous.

861
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,975
Keep out of reach of children."

862
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:46,013
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

863
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:49,067
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

864
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,640
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

865
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,185
Now. Yes.

866
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,872
Oh, no!

867
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,259
Oh, man!

868
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,784
Sid Phillips reporting.

869
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,912
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed

870
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:43,727
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

871
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,891
Tomorrow's forecast: sunny.

872
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:49,767
Sweet dreams.

873
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,662
l looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

874
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,029
But what if we
leave them behind?

875
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,728
Oh, don't worry, honey.

876
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:06,013
I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz
before we leave tomorrow.

877
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:15,801
I need air!

878
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:17,995
Will you quit movin' around?

879
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:21,592
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.

880
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,332
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

881
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,175
Everyone else was picked.

882
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,323
Oh, Woody.

883
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:39,162
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

884
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,887
Hey, Buzz!

885
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:05,105
Hey. Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

886
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:10,850
Oh, come on, Buzz, l...

887
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:15,141
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

888
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:19,572
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

889
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,040
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.

890
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:26,117
Then I'll get that rocket off you,
and we'll make a break for Andy's house.

891
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,443
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

892
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:33,693
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

893
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,214
No, Woody. For the first time
lam thinking clearly.

894
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:40,818
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

895
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:44,694
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

896
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,928
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

897
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,660
Bein’ a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

898
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:51,797
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

899
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:55,321
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

900
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,009
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

901
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,715
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

902
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,115
But why would Andy want me?

903
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:08,348
Why would Andy want you? Look at you!
You're a Buzz Lightyear.

904
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,642
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

905
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:15,279
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

906
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,752
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

907
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:22,979
You are a cool toy.

908
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:28,788
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

909
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:32,082
I mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have

910
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,442
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

911
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,192
All can do is...

912
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:42,482
There's a snake in my boots.

913
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,955
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me

914
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,838
when he's got you?

915
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:52,238
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

916
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:18,192
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.

917
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,235
You should get outta here
while you can.

918
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:34,525
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were...

919
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,515
Come on, sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

920
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,691
Now let's get
you out of this thing.

921
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,910
Yes, sir!

922
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,820
Come on, Buzz.
We can do it.

923
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:53,495
Woody, it's the moving van.

924
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:56,104
We gotta get outta here now.

925
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,051
Come on, Buzz.

926
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:05,551
All right.

927
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,797
- Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.

928
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,404
I want to ride the pony.

929
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:24,991
Woody? Woody?
Are you all right?

930
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:27,869
I'm fine. I'm okay.

931
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:42,249
Oh, yeah!
Time for lift-off!

932
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,482
To infinity and beyond!

933
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:59,377
Back, back.

934
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,749
Down, down!

935
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:03,792
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

936
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,636
Guys!

937
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,370
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

938
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:16,368
There's a good toy down there, and he's
gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes.

939
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,010
All because of me.
We gotta save him.

940
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,090
And...
But I need your help.

941
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:34,294
Please. He's my friend.

942
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,134
And he's the only one I've got.

943
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:53,204
Thank you.
Okay, I think 1 know what to do.

944
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,893
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

945
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,029
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

946
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,653
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

947
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:17,103
Launch pad is being constructed.

948
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,044
All right, listen up.

949
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,822
I need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.

950
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,609
Legs, you're with Ducky.

951
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,071
RollerBob and I don't move
‘til we get the signal. Clear?

952
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,592
Okay. Let's move!

953
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,026
Wind the frog.

954
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:18,096
Wait for the signal.

955
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,053
Go!

956
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,428
All right, let's go!

957
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,560
I'll get it!

958
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:44,936
Now!

959
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,428
I'm coming. I'm coming.

960
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,705
Scud!

961
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,465
Stupid dog.

962
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:12,821
Lean back!

963
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:21,263
Mission Control, is the
launch pad construction complete?

964
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,271
Roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

965
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:27,501
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

966
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,224
Countdown will commence
momentarily.

967
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,486
- Stand by.
- Let's go.

968
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:35,735
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind.

969
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,889
Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.

970
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:42,468
- What?
- It's okay. Everything's under control.

971
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,290
Woody, what are you doing?

972
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:50,145
Houston. All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...

973
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:54,424
Hey? How'd you get out here?

974
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:58,121
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

975
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,441
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

976
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,940
Roger. Permission granted.

977
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:10,402
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.

978
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,290
And counting.
Ten, nine,

979
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:17,241
eight, seven, six,

980
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:20,167
five, four, three, two,

981
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:24,683
- one!
- Reach for the sky!

982
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,999
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

983
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,296
What?

984
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:33,533
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

985
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,280
- It's busted.
- Who are you callin’ busted, buster?

986
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:39,438
That's right

987
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:43,266
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.

988
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,180
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid,

989
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:48,326
or smashed or ripped apart.

990
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:51,455
- "We"?
- That's right! Your toys!

991
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:53,995
Mama!

992
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,250
Mama!

993
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,839
Mama! Mama!

994
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:22,714
Mama!

995
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,890
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

996
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:32,175
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.

997
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:37,735
We toys can see everything.

998
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,939
So play nice.

999
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:51,828
We did it! We did it! Yes!

1000
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,742
The toys!
The toys are alive!

1001
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,984
Nice toy.

1002
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,013
What's wrong, Sid?

1003
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:04,685
Don't you want to play with Sally?

1004
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:07,458
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.

1005
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,377
Comin’ out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

1006
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:13,453
Woody.

1007
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:15,297
Thanks.

1008
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,030
Everybody say, "Bye, house!”

1009
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,355
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, house.

1010
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:25,994
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

1011
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,512
Quick!

1012
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:38,018
Just go. I'll catch up.

1013
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:00,221
Come on!

1014
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:17,565
You can do it, Woody!

1015
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,645
I got it!

1016
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:23,538
I made it.

1017
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:30,941
Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

1018
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,687
- Down!
- Hold on, Woody!

1019
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:37,198
I can't do it.

1020
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:40,693
Take care of Andy for me!

1021
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:42,424
No!

1022
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,113
Buzz!

1023
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,609
Are we there already?

1024
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,215
- Woody?
- How did you...?

1025
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,654
- How'd he get here?
- Where have you...?

1026
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:17,936
What happened?

1027
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,054
- What's goin' on?
- What's he takin'?

1028
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,230
There you are!

1029
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,078
Hey. What's he doing?

1030
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,000
He's at it again!

1031
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:43,007
- Get him!
- Come on!

1032
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:52,574
No, no!

1033
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,866
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1034
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,027
Pig pile!

1035
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,277
- Get outta that car!
- Move it!

1036
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,548
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1037
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,647
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1038
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,989
- No!
- Toss him overboard!

1039
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:43,737
No, no, no! Wait!

1040
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,352
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!

1041
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,527
Oh! Woody!

1042
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,859
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
- Look out!

1043
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,679
Now let's catch up
to that truck.

1044
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:15,572
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.

1045
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:17,722
- What?
- And Buzz is with him!

1046
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:22,911
It is Buzz!

1047
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:25,169
Woody was telling the truth.

1048
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:28,235
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt.

1049
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:31,704
We're almost there!

1050
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:35,698
Rocky, the ramp!

1051
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,151
Look out!

1052
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,117
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1053
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:56,521
- Attaboy, Slink!
- Oh! Woody!

1054
01:11:57,213 --> 01:11:58,322
Woody! Speed up!

1055
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:00,478
- Speed up!
- The batteries!

1056
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,077
They're runnin’ out!

1057
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:10,447
Hakuna Matata

1058
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,776
What a wonderful phrase

1059
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:22,300
- L can't hold on much longer.
- Slink! Hang on!

1060
01:12:37,954 --> 01:12:39,683
Great!

1061
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:43,099
Woody! The rocket!

1062
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:46,179
The match! Yes!

1063
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:48,409
Thank you, Sid!

1064
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:58,014
No! No, no! No!

1065
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,004
No! Oh, no!

1066
01:13:01,444 --> 01:13:04,544
No, no, no, no, no,

1067
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,797
no!

1068
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,806
No!

1069
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:21,670
- Woody! What are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz!

1070
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:24,803
You did it!

1071
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:26,901
Next stop: Andy!

1072
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:30,715
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1073
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:44,097
I should have held on longer.

1074
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:47,683
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin’ up fast!

1075
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,769
Woody!

1076
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:00,291
Take cover!

1077
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:09,326
This is the part
where we blow up!

1078
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:11,522
Not today!

1079
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,845
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin’!

1080
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:28,064
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1081
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:35,116
To infinity and beyond!

1082
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,357
Buzz, we missed the truck.

1083
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,319
We're not aiming for the truck.

1084
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:53,334
Hey, wow!

1085
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,436
- What? What is it?
- Woody! Buzz!

1086
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:57,458
Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?

1087
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,690
- Here in the car!
- See?

1088
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:03,539
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left ‘em.

1089
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:15,277
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.

1090
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,977
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.

1091
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,062
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.

1092
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:27,498
Whoa! It's time!

1093
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:30,735
Oh, Bo.

1094
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:33,043
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1095
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:36,146
Merry Christmas, sheriff.

1096
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:38,849
Say, isn't that mistletoe?

1097
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:44,467
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.

1098
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:47,837
That way I could play
the dominant predator.

1099
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,360
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

1100
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:52,738
Molly's first present
is Mrs. Potato Head.

1101
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:55,089
Repeat: a Mrs. Potato Head.

1102
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:57,147
Way to go, Idaho!

1103
01:15:57,453 --> 01:15:59,623
Gee, I'd better shave.

1104
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:05,540
Come in, Frankincense.

1105
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,781
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1106
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,800
- It's...
- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,

1107
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,349
- 1 can't quite...
- you are not worried, are you?

1108
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,025
- Me? No, no.
- Make out...

1109
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:16,290
No. No, no, no, no.

1110
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:18,949
A large box... It's...

1111
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:21,711
- Are you?
- Now, Buzz,

1112
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:26,651
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1113
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:28,749
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1114
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,418
Wow! A puppy!

1115
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:49,529
You've got a friend in me

1116
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,833
You've got a friend in me

1117
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,224
When the road looks rough ahead

1118
01:16:58,681 --> 01:17:03,021
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

1119
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:06,786
You just remember
what your old pal said

1120
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,749
Boy, you've got a friend in me

1121
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,580
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1122
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:23,032
You've got a friend in me

1123
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,857
You've got a friend in me

1124
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:32,471
- You got troubles
- And I got ‘em too

1125
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:36,558
There isn't anything
! wouldn't do for you

1126
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,779
If we stick together
we can see it through

1127
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:43,152
‘Cause you've got a friend in me

1128
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:47,611
You've got a friend in me

1129
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:53,268
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than 1am

1130
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,446
Bigger and stronger too

1131
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:57,832
Maybe

1132
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:02,960
But none of them will ever love you
the way I do

1133
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,992
It's me and you, boy

1134
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:09,402
And as the years go by

1135
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,575
Our friendship will never die

1136
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:18,900
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1137
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:22,932
You've got a friend in me

1138
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,715
You've got a friend in me

1139
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:29,876
You've got a friend in me
