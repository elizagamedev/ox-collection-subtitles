1
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,818
Yes, Marlin. No, I see it.
It's beautiful.

2
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,464
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

3
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,473
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

4
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:55,238
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

5
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,556
Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

6
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,844
-My man delivered.
-And it wasn't so easy.

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,059
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

8
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,637
You better believe they did--
every single one of them.

9
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,746
You did good.

10
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,345
And the neighborhood
.
IS awesome.

11
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,140
So, you do like it, don't you?

12
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,422
No, no. I do, I do.
I really do like it.

13
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,466
But, Marlin, ! know that
the drop off is desirable...

14
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,845
with the great schools
and the amazing view...

15
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,925
but do we really need
so much space?

16
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,186
but do we really need
so much space?

17
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,720
Coral, honey, these are our kids
we're talking about.

18
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,996
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.

19
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,258
They'll wake up,
poke their little heads out...

20
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,434
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

21
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,365
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,690
You'll wake the kids.

23
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,586
Oh, right, right.

24
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:55,735
Look. They're dreaming.

25
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,250
We still have to name them.

26
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,102
You want to name
all of them right now?

27
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:03,224
All right, we'll name
this half Marlin Junior...

28
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,527
and this half Coral Junior.

29
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,076
-OK, we're done.
-l like Nemo.

30
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,858
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

31
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,481
but I'd like most of them
to be Marlin Junior.

32
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:18,144
Just think, in a couple of days,
we're going to be parents.

33
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,202
What if they don't like me?

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,780
-Marlin.
-No, really.

35
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:26,369
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.

36
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,170
What?

37
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,541
-You remember how we met?
-I try not to.

38
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,311
Well, l remember.
"Excuse me, miss...

39
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,692
“can you check and see
if l have a hook in my lip?"

40
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,106
You got a little closer
because it was wiggling.

41
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,178
-Get away, get away!
-Here he is. Cutie's here.

42
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,273
Where did everybody go?

43
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,148
Coral, get inside the house.

44
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,055
No, Coral, don't.
They'll be fine.

45
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,661
Just get inside--
You, right now.

46
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,250
Coral!

47
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,338
There, there, there.

48
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,787
It's OK. Daddy's here.

49
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,794
Daddy's got you.

50
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,818
I promise, I will never
let anything happen to you...

51
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,959
Nemo.

52
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,148
First day of school!

53
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:16,939
First day of school!

54
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,543
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.

55
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,110
I don't want to go to school--
five more minutes.

56
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,825
Not you, Dad, me.
Get up, get up.

57
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,562
It's time for school,
time for school.

58
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,298
All right, I'm up.

59
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,751
-Nemo!
-First day of school!

60
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,899
Nemo, don't move.

61
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,432
You'll never get out
of there yourself.

62
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,536
I'll do it.

63
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,569
-You feel a break?
-No.

64
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,361
Sometimes you can't tell
‘cause fluid rushes to the area.

65
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,539
-Are you woozy?
-No.

66
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,835
-How many stripes do I have?
-I'm fine.

67
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,727
-Answer the stripe question.
-Three.

68
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,272
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.

69
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,943
have one, two, three--
That's all l have?

70
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,870
You're OK.
How's the lucky fin?

71
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,715
-Lucky.
-Let's see.

72
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,837
Are you sure you want to go
to school this year?

73
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,612
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

74
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,638
Come on, Dad,
it's time for school.

75
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,239
Forgot to brush.

76
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,353
Do you want this anemone
to sting you?

77
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,748
-Yes.
-Brush.

78
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,534
-OK, I'm done.
-You missed a spot.

79
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,075
-Where?
-There.

80
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,536
-Where?
-There.

81
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,387
Right there.
And here and here.

82
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:29,722
All right, we're excited.

83
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,743
All right, we're excited.

84
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,474
The first day of school.
Here we go.

85
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,456
We're ready to learn
to get some knowledge.

86
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,838
What's the one thing we have
to remember about the ocean?

87
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,303
-It's not safe.
-That's my boy.

88
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,623
First, we check to see
that the coast is clear.

89
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,045
We go out...and back in.

90
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,390
And then we go out...
and back in.

91
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,366
And then one more time--
out and back in.

92
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,386
And sometimes, if you want
to do it four times--

93
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,724
-Dad...
-All right, come on, boy.

94
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,503
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

95
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,260
-I highly doubt that.
-Have you ever met a shark?

96
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,082
No, and I don't plan to.

97
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,134
-How old are sea turtles?
-I don't know.

98
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,050
Sandy Plankton
from next door...

99
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,131
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

100
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,322
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

101
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,658
If lever meet a sea turtle,
I'll ask him.

102
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,670
After I'm done
talking to the shark, OK?

103
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,439
Hold on. Wait to cross.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,280
Hold on. Wait to cross.

105
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,505
Hold my fin.

106
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,981
Dad, you're not
going to freak out...

107
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,929
like you did at
the petting zoo, are you?

108
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,644
That snail was about to charge.

109
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,157
l wonder where
we're supposed to go.

110
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,796
Bye, Mom!

111
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,861
I'll pick you up after school.

112
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,582
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!

113
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,625
Come on,
we'll try over there.

114
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,143
Excuse me, is this where
we meet his teacher?

115
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,655
Well, look who's out
of the anemone.

116
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:51,637
Yes. Shocking, I know.

117
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,128
Yes. Shocking, I know.

118
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,788
-Marty, right?
-Marlin.

119
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,060
-Bob.
-Ted.

120
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,991
Bill.
Hey, you're a clownfish.

121
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,527
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.

122
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,019
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

123
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,764
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

124
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,370
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

125
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,470
-Come on, clownie.
-Do something funny.

126
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,925
All right, 1 know one joke.

127
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,827
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea--

128
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,172
He doesn't walk up,
he swims up.

129
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,104
Actually,
the mollusk isn't moving.

130
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,496
He's in one place,
and then the sea cucumber...

131
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,259
Well, they--I'm mixed up.

132
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,871
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

133
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,173
None of them were walking,
so forget that I--

134
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:28,724
None of them were walking,
so forget that I--

135
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,562
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

136
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,453
All right, you kids!

137
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,231
Ooh, where'd you go?

138
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:39,516
Dad, can I go play, too?
Can I?

139
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:43,328
I would feel better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

140
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,124
That's where I would play.

141
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,069
-What's wrong with his fin?
-He looks funny.

142
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,480
Hey, what'd I do?

143
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,532
Be nice.
It's his first time at school.

144
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,174
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

145
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,536
-Dad...
-See this tentacle?

146
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,712
It's actually shorter
than all my other tentacles...

147
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,881
but you can't really tell.

148
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,319
Especially when
I twirl them like this.

149
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,019
I'm H-2-O intolerant.

150
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,965
I'm obnoxious.

151
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,845
Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones

152
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,004
Let's name the zones
of the open sea

153
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,478
Mr. Ray!

154
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,212
-Come on, Nemo.
-You better stay with me.

155
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,238
Mesopelagic, bathyal,
abyssalpelagic

156
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,520
All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see

157
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,900
l wonder where
my class has gone?

158
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,860
We're under here!

159
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,749
There you are.

160
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,381
Climb aboard, explorers.

161
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,752
Oh, knowledge exploring

162
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,257
Is, oh, so lyrical

163
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,622
When you think thoughts
that are empirical

164
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:45,971
Dad, you can go now.

165
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,872
-Hello. Who is this?
-I'm Nemo.

166
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,509
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

167
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,452
-OK.
-You live in what kind of home?

168
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,319
An anemon-none.

169
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,314
A nemenem-menome.

170
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,259
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

171
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,369
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

172
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,097
I find if he's having
trouble swimming...

173
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,069
I let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.

174
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,481
Dad, it's time
for you to go now.

175
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,619
Don't worry. We're gonna stay
together as a group.

176
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,022
OK, class,
optical orbits up front.

177
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,978
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeal ganglion...

178
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,524
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

179
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:20,953
Aw, man!

180
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,593
Aw, man!

181
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,636
Bye, Nemo!

182
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,154
Bye, Dad!

183
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,819
Bye, son!

184
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,810
Be safe.

185
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,315
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

186
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,717
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

187
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,996
l had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

188
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,295
They got to grow up--
The drop off?

189
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,127
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

190
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,411
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

191
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,957
Hey, Marty, calm down.

192
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,139
Don't tell me
to be calm, pony boy.

193
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,471
Pony boy?

194
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,305
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

195
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,919
Pity.

196
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,276
Let's name the species,
the species, the species

197
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,529
Let's name the species
that live in the sea

198
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,701
There's

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,810
Porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa

200
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,911
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

201
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,544
Gastropoda, arthropoda,
echinoderma

202
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,047
And some fish like you and me

203
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,991
Come on, sing with me.

204
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,456
Just the girls this time.

205
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,448
Oh, seaweed is cool

206
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,830
Seaweed is fun

207
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,312
It makes its food

208
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,573
OK, the drop off.

209
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,852
All right, kids,
feel free to explore...

210
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,184
but stay close.

211
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,295
Stromalitic cyanobacteria!
Gather.

212
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,302
An entire ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

213
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,132
There are as many protein pairs
contained in this...

214
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,513
Come on, let's go.

215
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,042
Come on, sing with me!

216
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,234
There's porifera, coelenterata

217
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,836
Hydrozoa, scyphozoa

218
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,648
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

219
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,339
Hey, guys, wait up!

220
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,464
Cool.

221
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,824
Saved your life!

222
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,113
You guys made me ink.

223
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,093
What's that?

224
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,363
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

225
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,492
He said it was called a butt.

226
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,396
That's a pretty big butt.

227
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,457
Look at me.
I'm going to touch the butt.

228
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,346
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.

229
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,581
Beat that.

230
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,147
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

231
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,665
My dad says it's not safe.

232
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,579
-Nemo! No!
-Dad?

233
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,228
You were about
to swim into open water.

234
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,516
No, I wasn't--

235
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,314
Good thing I was here.
If l hadn't shown up--

236
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,563
-He wasn't going to go.
-He was too afraid.

237
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,015
No, I wasn't.

238
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,470
This does not
concern you, kids...

239
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,758
and you're lucky
I don't tell your parents.

240
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,220
You know you can't swim well.

241
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,115
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?

242
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,934
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

243
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,430
I was right. You'll start school
in a year or two.

244
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,156
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean--

245
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:12,991
You're not ready, and you're not
coming back until you are.

246
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,661
You're not ready, and you're not
coming back until you are.

247
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,737
You think you can do these
things, but you just can't!

248
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,865
Il hate you.

249
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,578
There's...

250
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,547
nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

251
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,916
Excuse me.
Is there anything I can do?

252
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,916
lam a scientist, sir.
Is there any problem?

253
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,049
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt things.

254
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,835
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

255
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,734
for him to be out here
unsupervised.

256
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,532
l can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

257
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,395
I'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

258
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,278
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

259
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:44,856
I'm not saying
you're not looking.

260
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,727
I'm not saying
you're not looking.

261
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,472
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!

262
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,740
Nemo!

263
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,789
What do you think you're doing?

264
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,494
You'll get stuck out there...

265
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,940
and I'll have to get you
before another fish does.

266
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,084
Get back here!

267
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,973
Il said get back here now!

268
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,629
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

269
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,890
Don't you dare!

270
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,962
If you put one fin
on that boat...

271
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,564
Are you listening to me?

272
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,979
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

273
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,890
He touched the butt.

274
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,528
You paddle your little tail
right back here, Nemo.

275
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:25,917
That's right.

276
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,589
You are in big trouble,
young man.

277
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,414
Do you hear me? Big...

278
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,307
Big...

279
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,452
Daddy! Help me!

280
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,355
I'm coming, Nemo!

281
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,715
Get under me, kids!

282
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,909
Dad!

283
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,264
Daddy!

284
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,313
Nemo!

285
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,055
Hold on.

286
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,059
Oh, no.

287
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,526
No, it's gone. It's gone.

288
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,023
No, no, it can't be gone.

289
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,267
No, no! Nemo!

290
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,313
No, please, no!

291
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,221
Has anybody seen a boat?

292
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,116
Please! A white boat!

293
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,834
They took my son!

294
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,511
My son! Help me, please.

295
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:19,531
My son! Help me, please.

296
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,248
-Look out!
-What?

297
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,281
Sorry. I didn't see you.

298
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,487
-Sir? Are you OK?
-He's gone, he's gone.

299
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,183
There, there. It's all right.

300
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,501
-He's gone.
-It'll be OK.

301
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,823
No, no. They took him away.
I have to find the boat.

302
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,106
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

303
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,418
-You have?
-It passed by not too long ago.

304
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,814
-A white one?
-Hi. I'm Dory.

305
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,185
Where? Which way?

306
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,271
It went this way.

307
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,803
It went this way. Follow me.

308
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,968
Thank you,
thank you so much.

309
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,401
No problem.

310
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,402
Wait!

311
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,520
-Will you quit it?
-What?

312
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,245
I'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?

313
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,051
You got a problem, buddy?

314
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,601
You got a problem, buddy?

315
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,224
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?

316
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,230
I'm scared now. What?

317
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,772
-Wait a minute.
-Stop following me, OK?

318
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,878
What? You're showing me
where the boat went.

319
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,898
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

320
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,069
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

321
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,943
It passed by not too long ago.
It went this way.

322
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,599
It went this way. Follow me.

323
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,674
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

324
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,993
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

325
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,119
I did? Oh, no.

326
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,565
If this is some kind of
practical joke, it's not funny.

327
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,901
And I know funny.
I'm a clownfish.

328
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,206
No, it's not. I know it's not.
I'm so sorry.

329
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,263
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

330
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,025
Short-term memory loss.
I don't believe this.

331
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,167
No, it's true. I forget things
almost instantly.

332
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,909
It runs in my family.
At least, I think it does.

333
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,252
Where are they?

334
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,642
Can I help you?

335
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,983
Something's wrong
with you--really.

336
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,986
You're wasting my time.

337
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,057
I have to find my son.

338
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,926
Hello.

339
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,904
Well, hi!

340
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,850
Name's Bruce.

341
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,809
It's all right.
I understand.

342
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,341
Why trust a shark, right?

343
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,592
So, what's a couple
of bites like you...

344
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,469
doing out so late?

345
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,490
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.

346
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,739
Great!
Then how'd you morsels...

347
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,918
like to come to a little
get-together I'm having?

348
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,401
You mean, like a party?

349
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:17,156
Yeah, right. A party.
What do you say?

350
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,590
I love parties.
That sounds like fun.

351
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,002
Parties are fun,
and it's tempting, but--

352
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,758
Oh, come on, I insist.

353
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,075
OK. That's all that matters.

354
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,004
Hey, look, balloons.
It is a party.

355
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,356
Mind your distance, though.

356
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,015
Those balloons
can be a bit dodgy.

357
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,398
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

358
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,937
Anchor! Chum!

359
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,757
There you are, Bruce.
Finally.

360
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,473
-We got company.
-It's about time, mate.

361
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:04,703
We've already gone
through the snacks...

362
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,224
We've already gone
through the snacks...

363
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,706
and I'm still starving.

364
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,869
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

365
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,695
Come on,
let's get this over with.

366
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,544
Right, then.

367
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,799
The meeting has officially
come to order.

368
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,425
Let us all say the pledge.

369
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,600
lam a nice shark,
not a mindless eating machine.

370
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,498
If lam to change this image...

371
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,997
I must first change myself.

372
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,726
Fish are friends, not food.

373
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,266
Except stinkin’ dolphins.

374
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:34,124
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.

375
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,053
"Look at me.
I'm a flippin’ little dolphin.

376
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,762
"Let me flip for you.
Ain't l something?"

377
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,283
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5--

378
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,099
Bring a Fish Friend.

379
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,650
Do you all have your friends?

380
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:44,896
Got mine.

381
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,785
-Hey, there.
-How about you, Chum?

382
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,061
l seem to have
misplaced my friend.

383
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,354
That's all right, Chum.

384
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,895
I had a feeling
this would be a difficult step.

385
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,464
You can help yourself
to one of my friends.

386
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,799
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum, eh?

387
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,722
I'll start the testimonies.

388
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,924
Hello. My name is Bruce.

389
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,342
Hello, Bruce.

390
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,434
It has been three weeks
since my last fish.

391
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,756
On my honor, or may I be
chopped up and made into soup.

392
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,636
-You're an inspiration!
-Amen.

393
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,470
Right, then. Who's next?

394
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,818
Pick me, pick me.

395
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,653
Yes. The little Sheila
down the front.

396
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,725
Come on up here.

397
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,658
Hi. I'm Dory.

398
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,030
Hello, Dory.

399
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,136
I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

400
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,689
-That's incredible.
-Good on you, mate.

401
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,943
I'm glad I got that
off my chest.

402
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,401
All right, anyone else?

403
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,879
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

404
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,195
Me? I don't have a problem.

405
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,704
Oh, OK.

406
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,306
Denial.

407
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,150
Just start with your name.

408
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,779
OK. Hello.

409
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,865
My name is Marlin.
I'm a clownfish.

410
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,942
-A clownfish? Really?
-Tell us a joke.

411
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,871
I love jokes.

412
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,750
I actually do know one
that's pretty good.

413
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,936
There was this mollusk...

414
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,274
and he walks up
to a sea cucumber.

415
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,204
Normally, they don't talk,
sea cucumbers...

416
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,192
but in a joke,
everyone talks...

417
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,154
so the sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

418
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,516
Daddy!

419
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,042
Nemo!

420
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,900
Nemo! Nemo! I don't get it.

421
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,980
For a clownfish,
he's not that funny.

422
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,854
No, he's my son.

423
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,923
He was taken by these divers.

424
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,585
Oh, my. You poor fish.

425
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,682
Humans--
think they own everything.

426
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,063
Probably American.

427
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,121
Now, there is a father--
Looking for his little boy.

428
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,932
Now, there is a father--
Looking for his little boy.

429
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,549
What do these markings mean?

430
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,945
I never knew my father!

431
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,373
-Group hug.
-We're all mates here, mate.

432
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,780
I can't read human.

433
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,078
We got to find a fish
that can read this.

434
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,999
-Hey, look, sharks.
-No, no, no, Dory!

435
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,140
-Guys, guys.
-No, Dory.

436
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,610
That's mine.
Give it to me.

437
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,098
Gimme!

438
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,039
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

439
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,548
I'm so sorry.

440
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,056
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

441
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,429
Dory, are you OK?

442
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,732
That's good.

443
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,694
Intervention!

444
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,239
-Just a bite.
-Hold it together, mate!

445
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,905
Remember, Bruce,
fish are friends, not food!

446
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,399
-Food!
-Dory, look out!

447
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,070
-Food!
-Dory, look out!

448
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,331
-Aah!
-I'm having fish tonight!

449
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,204
Remember the steps, mate!

450
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,202
Just one bite!

451
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,860
G'day.

452
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,465
There's no way out!

453
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,206
There's got to be a way
to escape!

454
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,961
Who is it?

455
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,162
Dory, help me find a way out!

456
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,553
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.

457
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:58,094
-There's got to be a way out!
-Here's something.

458
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,937
"Es-cap-e."
l wonder what that means.

459
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,647
Funny. It's spelled
just like "escape."

460
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,985
Let's go.

461
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,896
Here's Brucey!

462
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:08,803
Wait a minute. You can read?

463
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,798
Il can read?
That's right. 1 can read!

464
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,953
Well, then, here.
Read this now.

465
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,684
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

466
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,137
Don't fall off the wagon!

467
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,797
Oh, no, it's blocked!

468
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:25,938
Oh, no, it's blocked!

469
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,175
No, Bruce, focus.

470
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,239
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

471
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,879
He's really a nice guy.

472
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,321
I need to get that mask.

473
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,259
You want that mask? OK.

474
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,167
Quick, grab the mask!

475
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,904
Oh, no. Bruce?

476
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,653
What?

477
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,029
Swim away! Swim away!

478
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:58,983
Is the party over?

479
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,240
Nice.

480
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,599
Dad?

481
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,633
Daddy?

482
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,340
Barbara.

483
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,218
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

484
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,107
And I'm going to need
a few more cotton rolls.

485
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,836
Hello, little fella.

486
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,339
Beauty, isn't he?

487
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:56,691
I found that guy
struggling for life...

488
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,379
out on the reef,
and I saved him.

489
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,464
So, has that Novocaine
kicked in yet?

490
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,569
I think so.
We're ready to roll.

491
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,536
Bubbles!

492
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,101
My bubbles.

493
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,536
He likes bubbles.

494
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,362
Bonjour.

495
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,890
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

496
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:32,227
-He's scared to death.
-l want to go home.

497
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,437
Do you know where my dad is?

498
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,156
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

499
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,549
Pet store?

500
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,100
Yeah, you know, like,
I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

501
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,837
-Pet Palace.
-Fish-O-Rama.

502
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,358
-Mail order.
-Ebay.

503
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,939
-So, which one is it?
-I'm from the ocean.

504
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,146
The ocean. The ocean?

505
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,580
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!

506
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,116
-Oui.
-Clean him!

507
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,654
Oui.

508
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,342
-Ocean.
-La mer. Bon.

509
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,023
Voila. He is clean.

510
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,627
Wow. The big blue.
What's it like?

511
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,601
-Big and blue?
-I knew it.

512
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,942
If there's anything you need,
just ask your Auntie Deb.

513
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,088
Or if I'm not around,
you can talk to my sister Flo.

514
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,055
Hi. How are you?

515
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,646
Don't listen to anything
my sister says.

516
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,485
She's nuts.

517
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,703
We got a live one.

518
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:28,538
-Can't hear you, Peach.
-I said we got a live one.

519
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,677
-Boy, oh, boy.
-What do we got?

520
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,289
Root canal--and by the looks
of those x-rays...

521
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,808
it's not going to be pretty.

522
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,014
Dam and clamp installed?

523
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,802
-What did he use to open?
-Gator-Glidden drill.

524
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,517
He seems to favor
that one lately.

525
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,339
I can't see, Flo.

526
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,599
You're getting
a little too--

527
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:46,947
Now he's doing
the Schilder technique.

528
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,362
He's using a Hedstrom file.

529
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,497
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

530
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,111
It has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.

531
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,782
-No, no, K-Flex.
-Hedstrom.

532
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,497
-K-Flex!
-Hedstrom!

533
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,552
There I go.
A little help, over here.

534
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,491
I'll go deflate him.

535
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,981
All right.
Go ahead and rinse.

536
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:08,214
The human mouth
is a disgusting place.

537
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,756
-Hey, Nigel.
-What did I miss?

538
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,045
Root canal--a doozy.

539
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,656
Root canal?
What did he use to open?

540
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,674
-Gator-Glidden drill.
-He's favoring that one.

541
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,593
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portal terminus.

542
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,719
-Hello. Who's this?
-New guy.

543
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,306
The dentist
took him off the reef.

544
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,583
An outie. From my neck
of the woods, eh?

545
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,216
Sorry if l ever took
a snap at you.

546
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,721
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat.

547
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,947
No, no! They're not your fish.
They're my fish.

548
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,706
Come on, go. Go on, shoo!

549
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,843
The picture broke.

550
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,895
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

551
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,476
She's going to be
eight this week.

552
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:44,979
Hey, little fella.

553
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,740
Say hello
to your new mummy.

554
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,162
She'll be here Friday
to pick you up.

555
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,103
You're her present.

556
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,173
It's our little secret.

557
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,804
Well, Mr. Tucker,
while that sets up...

558
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,763
I'm going to see a man
about a wallaby.

559
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,507
Oh, Darla.

560
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,412
What?
What's wrong with her?

561
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,043
She wouldn't stop
shaking the bag.

562
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,720
-Poor Chuckles.
-He was her present last year.

563
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,293
Hitched a ride
on the porcelain express.

564
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,382
She's a fish killer.

565
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,677
I can't go with that girl.

566
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,540
I have to get back
to my dad.

567
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,221
Daddy! Help me!

568
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:24,749
He's stuck.

569
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,860
Nobody touch him.

570
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,131
Nobody touch him.

571
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,369
Can you help me?

572
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:38,943
No. You got yourself
in there.

573
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,374
No. You got yourself
in there.

574
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,072
You can get yourself out.

575
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:44,304
-Gill--
-I want to see him do it.

576
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,985
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

577
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,947
I can't. l have a bad fin.

578
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,223
Never stopped me.

579
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,812
Just think about
what you need to do.

580
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,442
Come on.

581
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:10,890
Perfect.

582
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,276
You did it!

583
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,027
Good squirming.

584
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,439
Wow. From the ocean--
just like you, Gill.

585
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:18,936
Yeah.

586
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,197
I've seen that look before.

587
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,980
What are you thinking about?

588
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,771
I'm thinking...

589
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,153
tonight, we give the kid
a proper reception.

590
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,087
So, kid,
you got a name or what?

591
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,698
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

592
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:35,166
Nemo. Nemo.

593
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,337
Nemo. Nemo.

594
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,331
Are you gonna eat that?

595
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,788
Careful with that hammer.

596
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,173
What does it say? Dory!

597
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,789
A sea monkey has my money.

598
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,990
Wake up. Get up. Come on.

599
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,153
Come on!

600
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,084
-Yes, I'm a natural blue.
-Get up!

601
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,683
Look out! Sharks eat fish!

602
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,812
Dusty.

603
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,780
The mask. Where's the mask?

604
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,873
No! No, not the mask!

605
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,359
Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

606
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,937
It just keeps going on,
doesn't it?

607
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,295
Echo! Echo!

608
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,702
Hey, what you doing?

609
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,000
It's gone.
I've lost the mask.

610
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,971
-Did you drop it?
-You dropped it!

611
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,660
That was my only chance
of finding my son.

612
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,915
Now it's gone.

613
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,200
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills...

614
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,103
when life gets you down,
know what you got to do?

615
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,478
-I don't want to know.
-Just keep swimming.

616
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,828
Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming

617
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,238
What do we do?
We swim, swim

618
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:29,777
Dory, no singing.

619
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,930
I love to swim

620
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,426
When you want to swim

621
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,505
See, I'm going to get
stuck now with that song.

622
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,027
-Now it's in my head.
-Sorry.

623
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,288
Dory, do you see anything?

624
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,016
-Something's got me.
-That was me. I'm sorry.

625
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:49,224
-Who's that?
-Who could it be? It's me.

626
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,537
Are you my conscience?

627
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,281
Yeah. I'm your conscience.

628
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,190
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

629
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,567
-Can't complain.
-Yeah? Good.

630
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,399
Now, Dory,
I want you to tell me--

631
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,167
Do you see anything?

632
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,576
I see a... see a light.

633
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:10,303
-A light?
-Yeah. Over there.

634
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,695
-Hey, conscience, am I dead?
-No. I see it, too.

635
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,550
What is it?

636
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:28,055
It's so pretty.

637
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,893
I'm feeling...happy...

638
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,581
which is a big deal for me.

639
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,418
I want to touch it.

640
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,261
Hey, come back.
Come on back here.

641
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,956
I'm gonna get you.

642
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,739
I'm gonna get you.

643
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,101
I'm gonna swim with you.

644
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,492
I'm gonna get you.

645
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,213
I'm gonna be
your best friend.

646
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,616
Good feeling's gone.

647
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,034
I can't see!
I don't know where I'm going!

648
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,006
-The mask!
-What mask?

649
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,298
OK, I can't see a thing.

650
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,001
-Oh, gee.
-Hey, look, a mask.

651
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,777
Read it!

652
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,448
I'm sorry,
but if you could just...

653
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,221
bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.

654
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:17,572
bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.

655
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:20,235
That's great.
Keep it right there.

656
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,965
Just read it!

657
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,153
OK, OK. Mr. Bossy.

658
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,967
"P." OK. "P. Sher...

659
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,187
"Sher--P. Sher--
P. Shirley? P.--"

660
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,492
The first line's
"P. Sherman."

661
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,737
"P. Sherman"
doesn't make any sense!

662
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,004
OK. Second line. "42."

663
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,043
Don't eat me.
Don't eat me.

664
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,416
Light, please!

665
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,075
The second line's
"42 Wallaby Way."

666
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,787
That's great.
Speed read. Take a guess.

667
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,593
No pressure. No problem.
There's a lot of pressure.

668
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,051
Pressure! Take a guess
now with pressure!

669
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,120
-"Sydney"! It's "Sydney"!
-Duck!

670
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,495
I'm dead. I'm dead,
I'm dead, I'm dead.

671
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,142
I died. I'm dead.

672
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,265
We did it, we did it

673
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,009
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

674
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,865
No eating here
tonight, whoo!

675
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,323
Eating here tonight

676
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,665
No, no, no,
eating here tonight

677
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,150
You on a diet

678
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,852
Dory! What did the mask say?

679
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,841
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

680
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,970
l remembered what it said!

681
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,458
I usually forget things,
but l remembered it!

682
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,264
Wait. Where is that?

683
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,725
I don't know.
But who cares? I remembered.

684
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,170
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

685
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,259
l remembered it again!

686
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,529
Nemo.

687
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,134
Suivez-moi.

688
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,020
Follow me.

689
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,266
State your name.

690
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,354
Nemo.

691
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,699
Brother Bloat, proceed.

692
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,549
Nemo, newcomer
of orange and white...

693
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,256
you have been called forth...

694
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,708
to the summit of
Mount Wannahockaloogie...

695
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:47,721
to join with us in
the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

696
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,148
-We want you in our club, kid.
-Really?

697
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,433
If you are able
to swim through...

698
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:59,794
the Ring of Fire!

699
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,458
Turn on the Ring of Fire!

700
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,147
You said you could do it.

701
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,135
The Ring of Fire!

702
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,226
Bubbles, let me--

703
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,785
Isn't there another way?
He's just a boy!

704
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:39,026
From this moment on,
you will be known as Sharkbait.

705
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:40,854
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

706
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,602
Welcome,
Brother Sharkbait.

707
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:43,933
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

708
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,902
-Enough with the Sharkbait.
-Sharkbait!

709
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,830
Ooh...ba-ba-do.

710
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,462
Sharkbait's
one of us now, agreed?

711
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,504
-Agreed.
-We can't send him to his death.

712
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,636
Darla's coming in five days.

713
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,301
So, what are we going to do?

714
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,783
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do--

715
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,506
we're gonna get him
out of here.

716
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,957
-We'll help him escape.
-Escape? Really?

717
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,596
We're all gonna escape.

718
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,118
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.

719
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,257
Sorry,
but they just never work.

720
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,680
Why should this
be any different?

721
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,031
Why should this
be any different?

722
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,154
-Because we've got him.
-Me?

723
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,384
-You see that filter?
-Yeah.

724
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,406
You're the only one who can get
in and out of that thing.

725
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,637
We need you to take
a pebble inside there...

726
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,140
and jam the gears.

727
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,058
You do that,
and this tank's gonna get...

728
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,060
filthier and filthier
by the minute.

729
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,382
Pretty soon, the dentist'll
have to clean the tank...

730
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,251
and when he does, he'll take us
out of the tank...

731
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:34,007
put us in
individual baggies...

732
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,819
then we'll roll ourselves
down the counter...

733
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,534
out the window,
off the awning...

734
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,235
into the bushes,
across the street...

735
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,647
and into the harbor!

736
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,560
It's foolproof.
Who's with me?

737
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,179
-Aye!
-Aye!

738
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,644
I think you're nuts.

739
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,477
No offense, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

740
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,966
He's fine. He can do this.

741
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,332
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

742
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:02,732
Let's do it.

743
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,344
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

744
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,877
Where are you going?

745
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,531
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

746
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,203
If you ask
where I'm going...

747
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,961
I'll tell you
that's where I'm going.

748
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,500
It's P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

749
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,261
Where? I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

750
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,883
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

751
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,575
Excuse me.

752
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,531
Hi.
Do you know how to get--

753
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,396
Hello? Wait.
Can you tell me--

754
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:28,599
Hey! Hold it!
I'm trying to talk to you!

755
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,120
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.

756
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,433
I need to--
And they're gone again.

757
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,551
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

758
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,263
Why do I have to tell you
over and over again?

759
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,255
I'll tell you again.
I don't get tired of it--

760
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,090
OK, all right.
Here's the thing.

761
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:50,306
I think it's best
if l carry on from here by...

762
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,214
by myself.

763
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,467
OK.

764
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,140
You know, alone.

765
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,166
Without--
I mean, not without you.

766
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,415
But I don't
want you...with me.

767
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,908
Am l...

768
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,247
I don't want to hurt
your feelings.

769
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,889
-You want me to leave?
-l mean, not--Yes.

770
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,404
I just can't afford
any more delays...

771
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,544
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

772
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,401
Sometimes it's a good thing.

773
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,299
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

774
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,078
You mean...

775
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,770
You mean you don't like me?

776
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,592
No, of course I like you.

777
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,217
It's because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

778
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,483
It's a complicated emotion.

779
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:31,035
Don't cry. I like you.

780
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:35,362
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

781
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,627
I don't remember.
Were you?

782
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,565
No, no, no. We're just--

783
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,381
Do you guys know
how I can get to--

784
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,682
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

785
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,402
Hey, hey.
You like impressions?

786
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,755
Just like in rehearsals,
gentlemen.

787
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,444
So what are we?
Take a guess.

788
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:52,816
I've seen one of those.

789
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,941
I'm a fish with a nose
like a sword.

790
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,976
-Wait, wait--
-It's a swordfish!

791
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,881
Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

792
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,113
Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

793
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,688
Where's the butter?

794
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,149
It's on the tip of my tongue!

795
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,104
-Lobster.
-Saw that!

796
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,000
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.

797
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,488
-Clam!
-Close enough!

798
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,323
Oh, it's a whale of a tale
I'll tell you, lad...

799
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:12,598
They're good.

800
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:13,904
Will somebody please
give me directions?!

801
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,178
"Will somebody please
give me directions?!"

802
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,281
I'm serious!

803
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,149
Thank you.

804
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,564
Oh, dear. Hey!
Hey, come back!

805
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,044
-Hey, what's the matter?
-What's the matter?

806
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:28,506
-Hey, what's the matter?
-What's the matter?

807
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,343
While they're doing their
silly little impressions...

808
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:34,245
lam miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

809
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:35,926
I bet that's frustrating.

810
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,380
Meanwhile,
my son is out there.

811
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,338
-Your son Chico?
-Nemo?

812
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:40,854
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

813
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,789
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

814
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,371
Well, I'm helping you.

815
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,034
Wait right here.

816
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,780
-Guys!
-Is he bothering you again?

817
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,476
No, no. He's a good guy.

818
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:54,671
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

819
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:55,722
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

820
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,427
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

821
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,186
Sydney? Oh, sure!

822
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,066
Ted here's got relatives
in Sydney.

823
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,743
-Don't you, Ted?
-Sure do!

824
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,584
Oh! Hey!
They know Sydney!

825
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:07,665
Oh! Hey!
They know Sydney!

826
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,028
You wouldn't know how
to get there, would you?

827
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,983
You want to follow the E.A.C.

828
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,625
That's the East
Australian Current.

829
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,421
Big current.
Can't miss it.

830
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,270
It's in...that direction.

831
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:20,333
And then you follow that
for about...

832
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,148
I don't know.
What do you guys think?

833
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,420
About three leagues?

834
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,761
That little baby will put you
right past Sydney.

835
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,897
Great! That's great!
Dory, you did it!

836
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,918
Oh, please,
I'm just your little helper.

837
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,226
-Helping along. That's me.
-Fellas, thank you.

838
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,735
Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

839
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:40,846
Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

840
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:42,862
Hey, ma'am.
One more thing.

841
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:46,251
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

842
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,394
Trench...
through it, not over it.

843
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:51,029
I'll remember. Hey, hey!

844
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,787
Hey, wait up, partner!
Hold on!

845
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,499
Wait, wait, wait!
I gotta tell you something.

846
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:02,625
Nice trench.

847
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,658
-OK, let's go.
-No, no. Bad trench.

848
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,477
Come on, we'll swim over
this thing.

849
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,589
Whoa, partner.
Little red flag going up.

850
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:20,078
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

851
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:21,988
Are you looking at this thing?

852
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,536
It's got death
written all over it.

853
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,250
I really, really, really
think we should swim through.

854
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:28,591
And I'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

855
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,630
-Trust me on this.
-Trust you?

856
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,542
Yes, trust.
It's what friends do.

857
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,473
Look! Something shiny!

858
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,289
-Where?
-It just swam over the trench.

859
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:41,541
-Come on, we'll follow it!
-OK!

860
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:44,653
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

861
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,056
Exactly. And look at that--
there's the current.

862
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,799
We should be there in no time.

863
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,735
Hey, little guy.

864
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,540
You wanted to go
through the trench.

865
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,572
I shall call him Squishy,
and he shall be mine.

866
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,761
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

867
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,390
Come here, little Squishy.

868
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:06,088
-That's a jellyfish!
-Bad Squishy!

869
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,049
Get away!

870
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,326
-Let me see that.
-Don't touch it.

871
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,691
l won't touch it.
I just want to look.

872
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,790
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

873
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,419
It did.
It's just that--

874
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,136
Hold still.

875
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,672
I live in this anemone...

876
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,114
and I'm used
to these kind of stings.

877
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:24,538
Come here. It doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.

878
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,542
But now we know, don't we...

879
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,721
that we don't want
to touch these again.

880
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,685
Let's be thankful this time
it was just a little one.

881
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:35,642
Don't move.

882
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:38,435
-This is bad, Dory.
-Hey, watch this!

883
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,336
-This is bad, Dory.
-Hey, watch this!

884
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,591
You can't catch me

885
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,200
Don't bounce on the tops!

886
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,161
They will...not sting you!

887
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,921
-The tops don't sting you!
-Two in a row! Beat that!

888
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:55,864
Dory, listen to me.
l have an idea--a game.

889
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,544
-A game?
-Yes.

890
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,162
-I love games! Pick me!
-Here's the game.

891
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:03,564
Whoever can hop the fastest
out of these jellyfish wins!

892
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:05,457
Rules, rules, rules!

893
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,946
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

894
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,939
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!

895
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,781
Wait! Not something about ‘em,
it's all about ‘em!

896
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,220
Wait, Dory!

897
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:15,105
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

898
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,366
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

899
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:22,264
Wait a minute! Dory!

900
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:27,085
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.

901
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,978
But we're having fun
at the same time.

902
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,480
I can do this.
Just be careful.

903
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:32,358
Yeah, careful I don't
make you cry when I win!

904
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,643
I don't think so!

905
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,248
Give it up, old man.

906
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,419
You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

907
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,461
The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

908
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,903
-Hungry?
-Yeah.

909
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,501
‘Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

910
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:48,771
Duck to the left!
Right there!

911
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,549
The clownfish is the winner!

912
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:56,568
We did it! Look at us!

913
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,515
Dory?

914
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:01,981
Oh, no.

915
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,240
Dory! Dory!

916
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,433
Am I disqualified?

917
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:20,533
No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!

918
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:23,555
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

919
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,524
P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...

920
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,461
That's it!

921
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:32,284
-Wallaby Way...
-Stay awake!

922
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,670
Stay awake!
Stay awake!

923
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,295
Stay...awake!

924
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:44,162
-Awake.
-P. Sherman.

925
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,225
-Awake.
-42 Wallaby Way.

926
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:51,201
Wake up. Nemo...

927
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:51,612
Wake up. Nemo...

928
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,397
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

929
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,586
Yeah.

930
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:10,017
Yeah.

931
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,631
You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

932
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,058
He's not looking for me.

933
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,320
He's scared of the ocean.

934
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:21,134
Peach, any movement?

935
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,949
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's gotta be soon.

936
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:25,675
Keep on him.

937
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,828
My first escape--
landed on dental tools.

938
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,468
l was aiming for the toilet.

939
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:33,726
Toilet?

940
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,191
All drains
lead to the ocean, kid.

941
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:39,417
Wow. How many times have
you tried to get out?

942
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,250
I've lost count.

943
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,185
Fish aren't meant
to be in a box, kid.

944
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:44,914
It does things to you.

945
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:47,026
Bubbles! Bubbles!

946
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,404
Potty break! He grabbed
the "Reader's Digest."

947
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,716
-We have 4.2 minutes!
-That's your cue, Sharkbait.

948
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:55,184
-You can do it, kid.
-We gotta be quick.

949
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:55,631
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

950
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,772
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

951
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,652
and I'll talk you
through the rest.

952
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:02,394
-OK.
-It'll be a piece of kelp.

953
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,348
Nicely done!

954
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,070
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah!

955
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,508
Here comes the pebble.

956
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:24,219
Now, do you see
a small opening?

957
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,843
Inside it,
you'll see a rotating fan.

958
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:33,246
Wedge that pebble into the fan
to stop it turning.

959
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,562
-Careful, Sharkbait!
-I can't do it!

960
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:42,218
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

961
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,996
He'll be fine. Try again!

962
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:46,618
OK.

963
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,154
That's it, Sharkbait.

964
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,507
Nice and steady.

965
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:55,627
I got it! 1 got it!

966
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,260
-He did it!
-That's great, kid!

967
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:00,558
Now swim up the tube and out.

968
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,515
Oh, no! Gill!

969
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:21,935
-Sharkbait!
-Oh, my gosh!

970
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,199
Get him outta there!

971
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,607
-What do we do?
-Oh, no!

972
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,686
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!

973
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,189
Help me!

974
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,473
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

975
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:37,997
-No! No! No!
-Feed me more!

976
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,848
-That's it!
-Sharkbait! Grab it!

977
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,607
I got it!

978
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,554
Pull!

979
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,819
Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

980
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,927
No. We're done.

981
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,959
Dude.

982
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,895
Dude.

983
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:22,259
Focus, dude. Dude.

984
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:25,915
He lives. Hey, dude!

985
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:29,322
What happened?

986
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,363
Saw the whole thing, dude.

987
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,295
First, you were all,
like, "Whoa!"...

988
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:34,986
and then we were
all, like, "Whoa!"...

989
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,895
and then you were,
like, "Whoa."

990
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:38,421
What are you talking about?

991
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:41,649
You, mini-man.
Takin’ on the jellies.

992
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,589
You got serious
thrill issues, dude.

993
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,699
Awesome.

994
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:49,161
Oh, my stomach.

995
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,236
Oh, man. No hurlin’
on the shell, dude, OK?

996
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,558
Just waxed it.

997
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,703
So, Mr. Turtle--

998
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:57,092
Whoa, dude.
Mr. Turtle is my father.

999
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,674
The name's Crush.

1000
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,932
Crush? Really?

1001
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:05,351
OK, Crush. I need to
the East Australian Current.

1002
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,036
E.A.C.?

1003
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,924
Oh, dude.

1004
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:11,273
You're ridin’ it, dude!

1005
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,904
Check it out!

1006
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,792
OK, grab shell, dude!

1007
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:38,821
Grab what?!

1008
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,312
Grab what?!

1009
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,538
Righteous! Righteous!

1010
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,035
-Yeah!
-Stop!

1011
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:53,057
-Yeah!
-Stop!

1012
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,809
So...

1013
00:52:58,142 --> 00:53:01,241
what brings you on this fine day
to the E.A.C.?

1014
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,992
Dory and I need
to get to Sydney.

1015
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,308
Dory! Is she all right?

1016
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:08,197
Oh, little blue.

1017
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,920
She is sub-level, dude.

1018
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:17,069
Dory! Dory! Dory!

1019
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,821
I'm so sorry.

1020
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,131
This is all my fault.
It's my fault.

1021
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:32,542
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!

1022
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,323
There you are!

1023
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:38,366
Catch me if you can!

1024
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:40,828
Dory?

1025
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,761
Nice wave!

1026
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,223
Up you go!

1027
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,454
Up you go!

1028
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:00,949
-Oh, my goodness!
-Kill the motor, dude.

1029
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:04,234
Let us see what Squirt does
flying solo.

1030
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,504
That was so cool!
Hey, Dad, did you see that?

1031
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,038
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?

1032
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,967
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1033
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,700
So give me some fin.

1034
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,158
Noggin.

1035
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,562
-Dude.
-Dude.

1036
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:28,995
Oh...intro.

1037
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,869
Jellyman, offspring.

1038
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:32,945
Offspring, Jellyman.

1039
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:36,337
-Jellies?! Sweet.
-Totally.

1040
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:39,647
Apparently, must've done
something you liked...dudes.

1041
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:42,217
You rock, dude!

1042
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:46,705
Curl away, my son.
It's awesome, Jellyman.

1043
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,777
The little dudes
are just eggs.

1044
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,569
We leave 'em
on a beach to hatch...

1045
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:51,931
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1046
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,232
they find their way back
to the big ol’ blue.

1047
00:54:54,558 --> 00:54:56,608
-All by themselves?
-Yeah.

1048
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,557
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

1049
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,043
Well, you never really know.

1050
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,221
But when they know,
you'll know, you know?

1051
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,132
Hey, look, everybody.

1052
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,710
I know that dude!
It's the Jellyman!

1053
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,856
Go on. Jump on him!

1054
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,955
-Turtle pile!
-Wait, wait, wait!

1055
00:55:18,382 --> 00:55:20,192
-Are you funny?
-Where's your shell?

1056
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,294
-I need to breathe!
-Are you running away?

1057
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:24,046
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

1058
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:26,018
-Did they sting you?
-One at a time!

1059
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,750
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1060
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,211
Sorry, I was a little vague
on the details.

1061
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:31,581
So, where are you going?

1062
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,402
You see, my son was taken.

1063
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,154
My son was taken away from me.

1064
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,522
-No way.
-What happened?

1065
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,736
No, no, kids.
I don't want to talk about it.

1066
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:43,088
Please?

1067
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:44,577
Please?

1068
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:47,176
Well, OK.

1069
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,881
I live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

1070
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,161
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.

1071
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,560
And my son Nemo...

1072
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:57,616
See, he was mad at me.

1073
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,317
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

1074
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:00,866
if l hadn't been
so tough on him.

1075
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,171
I don't know.

1076
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,109
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

1077
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,913
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

1078
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,607
and I tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

1079
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:11,517
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

1080
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,818
They couldn't stop ‘em.
And then Nemo's dad...

1081
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,567
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

1082
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,080
.. three ferocious sharks.

1083
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:20,115
He scares away the sharks
by blowing ‘em up!

1084
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,580
Golly, that's amazing.

1085
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,207
And then dives
thousands of feet...

1086
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:24,967
.. Straight down
into the dark.

1087
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,505
It's wicked dark down there.

1088
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,207
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

1089
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:29,912
And the only thing
they can see down there...

1090
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,673
..is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

1091
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:33,652
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

1092
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,124
And then he has
to blast his way...

1093
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,754
So, these two little fish
have been...

1094
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:40,428
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1095
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:40,480
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1096
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,580
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

1097
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,240
That should put him
in Sydney Harbor...

1098
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:45,607
..in a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like...

1099
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,552
this guy is gonna
stop at nothing...

1100
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,268
..till he finds his son.
Il sure hope he makes it.

1101
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:53,271
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

1102
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,828
Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1103
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:11,281
Would you just shut up?!

1104
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,018
You're rats with wings!

1105
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,540
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

1106
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,815
-Nemo?!
-He was taken off the reef...

1107
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:19,794
-Take it! You happy?
-Mine! Mine! Mine!

1108
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,663
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

1109
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,150
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1110
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:28,346
Mine?

1111
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:30,538
Last I heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

1112
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,987
Brilliant!

1113
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:47,663
Is he doing OK?

1114
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:48,124
Is he doing OK?

1115
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:51,041
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r--

1116
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,988
It's OK. I know who
you're talking about.

1117
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:03,516
Gill?

1118
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,669
Gill?

1119
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:10,258
Hey, Sharkbait.

1120
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,580
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the--

1121
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,789
No, I'm the one
who should be sorry.

1122
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:17,402
l was so ready
to get out...

1123
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:20,191
so ready to taste that ocean...

1124
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:23,584
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

1125
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:27,514
Nothing should be worth that.

1126
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:30,878
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1127
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,595
All right.
Hey, hey, hey--

1128
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,411
What the--

1129
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,929
That's one way to pull a tooth.

1130
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,260
Darn kids.

1131
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:48,484
Good thing I pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1132
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,877
Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

1133
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:54,471
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

1134
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,641
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1135
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,990
-I've got to speak with him.
-What is it?

1136
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,142
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

1137
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:03,748
-looking for you.
-My father? Really?

1138
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:07,737
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish--

1139
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,468
Sharks? That can't be him.

1140
00:59:10,814 --> 00:59:13,094
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

1141
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,350
-Tuna? Trout?
-Marlin?

1142
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,262
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

1143
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:19,801
It's my dad!
He took on a shark!

1144
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:22,207
l heard he took on three.

1145
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:25,015
-Three sharks?
-That's 4,800 teeth!

1146
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,235
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

1147
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:29,491
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1148
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,000
Really?

1149
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:32,781
He's swimming,
giving it all he's got...

1150
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,846
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

1151
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,127
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

1152
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,930
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

1153
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,620
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

1154
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,058
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

1155
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:48,192
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A.C...

1156
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:51,688
and the word is he's headed
this way right now...to Sydney!

1157
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,355
What a good daddy!

1158
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:55,807
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

1159
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,058
He's swimming to the filter!

1160
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:02,607
-Sharkbait!
-Not again!

1161
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,913
Sharkbait!

1162
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:08,504
No!

1163
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:09,755
You got your whole life
ahead of you!

1164
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,050
-We'll help you, kid!
-Get him out!

1165
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,106
Get him out of there!

1166
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:19,778
Come on, kid!
Grab the end!

1167
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:22,296
Sharkbait!

1168
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,432
-No!
-Can you hear me?

1169
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,031
Nemo! Can you hear me?

1170
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:28,036
Yeah, I can hear you.

1171
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:30,024
Sharkbait, you did it!

1172
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,633
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs!

1173
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,198
That took guts, kid.

1174
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,389
All right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

1175
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:39,875
before Darla gets here.

1176
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,560
This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time...

1177
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,294
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

1178
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,663
-Jacques? No cleaning.
-I shall resist.

1179
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,317
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

1180
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:50,759
Think dirty thoughts.

1181
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,877
We're gonna make
this tank so filthy...

1182
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:55,403
the dentist
will have to clean it.

1183
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,592
Good work!

1184
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,613
All right, we're here, dudes!

1185
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:09,773
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

1186
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,509
Where? I don't see it!

1187
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:13,875
Right there!
I see it! I see it!

1188
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,954
The swirling vortex of terror?

1189
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:19,394
-That's it, dude.
-Of course it is.

1190
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:23,249
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

1191
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,970
Do you have your exit buddy?

1192
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:27,395
Yes!

1193
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:31,743
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

1194
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,455
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!

1195
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:39,176
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1196
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:42,243
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

1197
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,502
Remember--
rip it, roll it, and punch it!

1198
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:48,686
He's trying to speak to me,
I know it!

1199
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,945
You're really cute, but I don't
know what you're saying!

1200
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,485
Say the first thing again.

1201
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:55,897
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1202
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,840
That was...fun!

1203
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,185
I actually enjoyed that.

1204
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:16,928
Hey, look, turtles!

1205
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,747
Most excellent!

1206
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,686
Now turn your
fishy tails around...

1207
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:24,748
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

1208
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,075
No worries, man!

1209
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,187
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

1210
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,729
-Bye!
-Bye, Jellyman!

1211
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,102
You tell your little dude
I said hi, OK?

1212
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,437
See ya later, dudes!

1213
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,139
Bye, everyone!

1214
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:39,437
Nemo would have loved this.

1215
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,685
Crush, I forgot!

1216
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,496
How old are you?

1217
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:48,418
150, dude!
And still young! Rock on!

1218
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:52,505
150! 150!
I gotta remember that.

1219
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:01,352
-We going in there?
-Yep.

1220
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,520
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1221
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:08,763
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

1222
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:11,915
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1223
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,489
Dory...

1224
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:24,609
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1225
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,598
How about we play a game?

1226
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,694
OK, I'm thinking
of something orange...

1227
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,417
and it's small--

1228
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,662
-It's me.
-Right!

1229
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,108
It's orange and small--

1230
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:39,721
It's me.

1231
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,586
All righty, Mr. Smartypants.

1232
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:42,584
And it's orange and small
and white stripes--

1233
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:44,665
And it's orange and small
and white stripes--

1234
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,948
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1235
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:49,477
-That's just scary.
-Wait, wait, wait.

1236
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,436
I have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

1237
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:53,035
That means
we've passed it before...

1238
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:54,462
and that means
we're going in circles...

1239
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,034
and that means
we're not going straight!

1240
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,173
We've got to get
to the surface.

1241
01:03:58,468 --> 01:03:59,868
Weill figure it out
up there. Let's go!

1242
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:02,033
-Hey! Relax.
-What?

1243
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,799
Take a deep breath.

1244
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:07,375
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1245
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:08,957
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1246
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,992
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

1247
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:13,361
-There's nobody here!
-There has to be someone.

1248
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,203
It's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

1249
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,636
Let's see.
OK, no one there.

1250
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:22,875
Nope. Nada.

1251
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:26,408
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse--

1252
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:28,273
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

1253
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,931
I'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

1254
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,246
It's a fish we don't know.
If we ask it directions...

1255
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:34,349
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

1256
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,807
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1257
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,720
I don't want to play
the gender card right now.

1258
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:40,674
Let's play
the "Let's Not Die" card.

1259
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,614
-You want to get out of here?
-Of course I do.

1260
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,749
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

1261
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,932
Dory, you don't
fully understand--

1262
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,968
Come on. Trust me on this.

1263
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:02,131
All right.

1264
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:05,002
Excuse me!
Little fella?

1265
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:08,270
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1266
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:09,231
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1267
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,186
Hello.

1268
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:12,814
-His son Bingo--
-Nemo.

1269
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,702
-Nemo was taken to--
-Sydney.

1270
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,922
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

1271
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:21,049
that we get there
as fast as we can...

1272
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,157
so can you help us out?

1273
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:26,553
Come on, little fella.
Come on.

1274
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,863
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1275
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:35,293
I don't think
that's a little fella.

1276
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:39,462
Big fella. Whale. OK.
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1277
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,076
We need...

1278
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:47,106
-Dory?
-to find his son.

1279
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:49,984
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1280
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,613
Can you give us directions?

1281
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,484
Can you give us directions?

1282
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,833
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

1283
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:59,312
-See, he's swimming away.
-Come back.

1284
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,779
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

1285
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,231
Maybe a different dialect.

1286
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:06,291
Dory!

1287
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:09,433
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

1288
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:10,165
-Maybe I should try humpback.
-Don't try humpback.

1289
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:13,706
-Maybe I should try humpback.
-Don't try humpback.

1290
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:16,287
-You actually sound sick.
-Maybe louder?

1291
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:17,896
Don't do that!

1292
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,627
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1293
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:21,046
It doesn't sound orca.

1294
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:23,294
It sounds like nothing
I've ever heard.

1295
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:26,180
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1296
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,381
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1297
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:30,214
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1298
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,720
-Swim away!
-Oh, look, krill!

1299
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,526
Move, Dory, move!

1300
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:39,138
Move, Dory, move!

1301
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,564
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

1302
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:51,417
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1303
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:54,571
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1304
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:56,758
Jacques,
I said no cleaning.

1305
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,663
lam ashamed.

1306
01:06:58,915 --> 01:07:01,085
Look! Scum angel!

1307
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,288
Bubbles!
I love the bubbles!

1308
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,782
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1309
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,573
9:00 and cue dentist.

1310
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:17,921
Hello, Barbara.
Sorry I'm late.

1311
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,604
OK, here we go.
Here we go, OK.

1312
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,490
Little Davey Reynolds...

1313
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:24,139
Walks to the counter,
drops the keys...

1314
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,214
Bloat, that's disgusting!

1315
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,289
Tastes pretty good to me.

1316
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,900
Don't you people realize
we are swimming In our own--

1317
01:07:33,283 --> 01:07:34,243
Here he comes!

1318
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:39,319
Crikey. What a state.

1319
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,820
Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1320
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,941
-10:00, luv.
-Leave it open, would you?

1321
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:50,381
I've gotta clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

1322
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,540
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

1323
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:56,085
He's gonna clean the tank!

1324
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,123
We're gonna be clean!

1325
01:07:58,374 --> 01:07:59,834
You ready to see your dad, kid?

1326
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,776
-Uh-huh.
-Of course you are.

1327
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:04,355
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's out there...

1328
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:05,279
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1329
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:07,621
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1330
01:08:07,984 --> 01:08:10,064
Yeah.

1331
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:26,881
Here comes the big one.

1332
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,350
Come on! You gotta try this!

1333
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,568
-Will you just stop it?
-Why? What's wrong?

1334
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,022
We're in a whale,
don't you get it?

1335
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,358
-Whale?
-A whale!

1336
01:09:36,538 --> 01:09:38,938
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!

1337
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:41,738
Wow, a whale.
I speak whale.

1338
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,161
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!

1339
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,290
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!

1340
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:52,466
I have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

1341
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,623
Hey...

1342
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:08,992
you OK?

1343
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:17,974
There, there.
It's all right.

1344
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,081
It'll be OK.

1345
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,309
No. No, it won't.

1346
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:24,578
Sure it will. You'll see.

1347
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:30,277
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

1348
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,050
That's a funny thing
to promise.

1349
01:10:34,497 --> 01:10:35,697
What?

1350
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,038
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

1351
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,507
Then nothing
would ever happen to him.

1352
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,270
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1353
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,061
What's going on?

1354
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,340
Don't know. I'll ask him.

1355
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:07,458
-Dory...
-What's going on?

1356
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:15,637
I think he says we've stopped.

1357
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:18,742
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.

1358
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:21,635
You'll make things worse.
What is that noise?

1359
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:28,542
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1360
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:33,277
The water's going down.
It's going down!

1361
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:38,853
Really? You sure about that?

1362
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,871
Look!
Already it's half empty!

1363
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:42,714
I'd say it's half full.

1364
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,255
Stop that! It's half empty!

1365
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:50,313
OK, that one
was a little tougher.

1366
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,308
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1367
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:53,599
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1368
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,576
or he wants a root beer float.

1369
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,308
Of course he wants us
to go there!

1370
01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:59,246
That's eating us!

1371
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:02,125
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?

1372
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:04,508
Tell him I'm not interested
in being lunch!

1373
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,991
-OK. He--
-Stop talking to him!

1374
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:14,482
What is going on?

1375
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,684
I'll check. What--

1376
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,429
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!

1377
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,852
-Yes, I can!
-No, you can't!

1378
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,301
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo!

1379
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:33,236
-OK.
-Dory!

1380
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:39,312
He says it's time to let go.

1381
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,518
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1382
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,251
How do you know?

1383
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,212
How do you know something bad
isn't gonna happen?

1384
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:48,299
I don't!

1385
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:13,340
We're alive!

1386
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:17,511
Look! Sy-d-ney--Sydney!

1387
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,034
Sydney! Sydney again!

1388
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,501
You were right, Dory!
We made it!

1389
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:27,414
We're gonna find my son!

1390
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:30,772
Thank you, sir!

1391
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:33,463
Thank you, sir!

1392
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:36,046
Wow. I wish
l could speak whale.

1393
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:38,399
All we gotta do is find
the boat that took him.

1394
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,434
-Right!
-We can do this!

1395
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:55,429
Morning.

1396
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,451
Morning.

1397
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,637
It's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!

1398
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:02,969
The sun is shining,
the tank is clean...

1399
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,962
and we are getting out--
The tank is clean.

1400
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,625
The tank is clean!

1401
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:10,378
But how?

1402
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,983
Boss must've installed it
while we were sleeping.

1403
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:16,389
-What are we gonna do?
-What's it say, Peach?

1404
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,357
I can't hear you, Peach.

1405
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,695
The Aquascum 2003 is
an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

1406
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,754
maintenance-free,
salt water purifier...

1407
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,656
that is guaranteed to extend
the life of your aquarium fish.

1408
01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:28,143
Stop it!

1409
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:29,641
The Aquascum
is programmed to scan...

1410
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:31,885
your tank environment
every five minutes?!

1411
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,691
Scan? What does that mean?

1412
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:39,174
Temperature--82 degrees...

1413
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,195
Temperature--82 degrees...

1414
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:41,836
PH balance--normal.

1415
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:44,188
Nice.

1416
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:48,523
Curse you, Aquascum!

1417
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,958
That's it for the escape plan.
It's ruined.

1418
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:52,513
Then what are
we gonna do about--

1419
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:53,188
Darla!

1420
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:54,529
Darla!

1421
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:57,036
Stay down, kid!

1422
01:14:57,393 --> 01:14:59,123
False alarm.

1423
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:01,235
My nerves can't take
much more of this.

1424
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,490
What'll we do
when that brat gets here?

1425
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:05,759
-I'm thinking.
-Gill!

1426
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,848
-Nemo! I'm coming!
-Help me! Help me!

1427
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,701
Swim down! Come on, kid!

1428
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:14,519
-Everybody jump in!
-Swim down!

1429
01:15:14,744 --> 01:15:15,884
-That's it!
-What the--?

1430
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,140
Good work!

1431
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:20,722
Gill!

1432
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,349
-Nemo!
-Sharkbait!

1433
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:25,575
-Roll, kid!
-Lean! Lean!

1434
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:32,599
Whoops. That would've been
a nasty fall.

1435
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:35,208
Gill!
Don't let me go belly-up!

1436
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,584
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won't go belly-up.

1437
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,009
I promise.
You're gonna be OK.

1438
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,052
Darla!

1439
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:52,058
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1440
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,218
No, but the boat
has to be here somewhere.

1441
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:56,353
Come on, Dory.
We're gonna find it.

1442
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,052
I'm totally excited.
Are you excited?

1443
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:00,972
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.

1444
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,833
Duck!

1445
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:06,081
That's not a duck.
It's a...pelican!

1446
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:18,708
No! I didn't come this far
to be breakfast!

1447
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:28,785
Hey, Nigel.
Would you look at that?

1448
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,318
What? What?

1449
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:33,039
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

1450
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,732
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

1451
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,842
Yeah, right. Yeah.

1452
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:41,317
Don't everybody
fly off at once.

1453
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:47,447
All right, Gerald.
Fish got your tongue?

1454
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:50,438
Love a duck!

1455
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:50,759
Love a duck!

1456
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,330
I gotta find my son Nemo!

1457
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:55,295
Nemo? He's that fish!

1458
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,961
The one that's been fighting
the whole ocean!

1459
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:00,504
I know where your son--

1460
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:03,907
Wait! Come back! Stop!

1461
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:06,113
Dory, keep going!
He's crazy!

1462
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:07,972
I got something to tell you!

1463
01:17:12,528 --> 01:17:13,838
Mine.

1464
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,200
Don't make any sudden moves.

1465
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:25,420
Hop inside my mouth
if you want to live.

1466
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:29,165
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?

1467
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:30,665
Mine?

1468
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:31,112
Because I can take you
to your son.

1469
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:34,073
Because I can take you
to your son.

1470
01:17:34,517 --> 01:17:36,857
-Yeah, right.
-No. I know your son.

1471
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:39,589
He's orange with
a gimpy fin on one side.

1472
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:40,975
That's Nemo!

1473
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,497
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1474
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:47,550
Fasten your seat belts!

1475
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:54,031
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1476
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:11,482
Everybody hold on!

1477
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:26,042
Too loud!
Too loud for me!

1478
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,362
Twinkle, twinkle,
little star

1479
01:18:28,671 --> 01:18:31,191
Find a happy place!
Find a happy place!

1480
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:33,794
Darla, your uncle
will see you now.

1481
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:38,365
All right, let's see
those pearly whites.

1482
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:42,494
I'm a piranha.
They're in the Amazon.

1483
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:46,072
And a piranha's a fish,
just like your present.

1484
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,406
I get fishy, fishy

1485
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:52,378
Oh, no. Poor little guy.

1486
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:54,405
-He's dead.
-Sharkbait!

1487
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:55,713
Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1488
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,298
Must've left your present
in the car, sweetie.

1489
01:18:57,533 --> 01:18:59,553
I'll go and get it.

1490
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:01,388
-He's still alive!
-He's not dead!

1491
01:19:01,637 --> 01:19:03,416
What's happening?
Why is he playing dead?

1492
01:19:03,706 --> 01:19:05,346
He's gonna get flushed
down the toilet.

1493
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,718
-He's gonna get out of here!
-He's gonna get flushed!

1494
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:09,593
What a smart little guy!

1495
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,215
Oh, no! Not the trash can!

1496
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:12,587
Nemo! No!

1497
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:15,771
-Hey! I found his dad!
-Where's Nemo?

1498
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:17,418
-Dentist!
-He's over there!

1499
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:20,610
What's a dentist?
Nigel, get in there!

1500
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,535
-I can't go in there!
-Yes, you can! Charge!

1501
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:27,835
What the--?

1502
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:31,577
Darla, sweetie, look out!

1503
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:37,204
Hold still!

1504
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:39,206
Easy! Easy!

1505
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:41,823
Hold still!

1506
01:19:42,011 --> 01:19:44,791
Nobody's going to hurt you!

1507
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,362
Nemo.

1508
01:19:53,689 --> 01:19:54,799
Oh, my goodness.

1509
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,660
Gotcha! Keep down!

1510
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,035
Nemo!

1511
01:19:58,227 --> 01:19:59,747
Daddy?

1512
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:03,365
Out with you! And stay out!

1513
01:20:03,866 --> 01:20:05,036
Daddy?

1514
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:06,464
Fishy?

1515
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:09,419
Fishy! Wake up!

1516
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:10,858
Oh, no!

1517
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,260
To the top of
Mount Wannahockaloogie!

1518
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:15,719
Why are you sleeping?

1519
01:20:16,045 --> 01:20:18,185
-Hurry!
-Bloat!

1520
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,390
Ring of Fire!

1521
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:25,883
Fishy!

1522
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:31,502
Crikey! All the animals
have gone mad!

1523
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,812
Get it out!

1524
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:38,415
-Smack her in the head!
-Go, Gill, go!

1525
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:40,517
Fish in my hair!

1526
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:42,003
Gill!

1527
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:46,154
Sharkbait...
tell your dad I said hi.

1528
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:52,857
Go get ‘em!

1529
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,540
He did it!

1530
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,367
-I'm so happy!
-Is he gonna be OK, Gill?

1531
01:21:02,758 --> 01:21:04,718
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.

1532
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:06,547
Fishy!

1533
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:16,353
Daddy!

1534
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:54,931
I'm so sorry.

1535
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:57,911
Truly, lam.

1536
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:58,642
Truly, lam.

1537
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,028
-Hey.
-Dory...

1538
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,143
if it wasn't for you...

1539
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,896
I never would've even
made it here.

1540
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,022
So, thank you.

1541
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:28,896
Hey, wait a minute.

1542
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:31,394
Wait. Where are you going?

1543
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:34,877
It's over, Dory.
We were too late.

1544
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:39,540
Nemo's gone,
and I'm going home now.

1545
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:42,344
No. No, you can't.

1546
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:46,043
Stop!

1547
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:49,413
Please don't go away.

1548
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,365
Please?

1549
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:54,063
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

1550
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:57,566
And if you leave, I just...

1551
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,740
l remember things
better with you.

1552
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,638
I do. Look--
P. Sherman, 42...

1553
01:23:03,045 --> 01:23:05,625
42...

1554
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:08,444
l remember it.
I do. It's there.

1555
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,657
I know it is because
when I look at you...

1556
01:23:10,953 --> 01:23:12,213
I can feel it.

1557
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:17,521
I look at you
and I...I'm home.

1558
01:23:20,062 --> 01:23:21,462
Please...

1559
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:24,007
I don't want that to go away.

1560
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:26,446
I don't want to forget.

1561
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:31,639
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.

1562
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:46,355
-Manna from heaven.
-Sweet nectar of life!

1563
01:23:48,891 --> 01:23:51,880
-This is our spot!
-Get outta here!

1564
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,054
Yeah, that's it, fella.

1565
01:23:57,266 --> 01:23:58,696
Just keep on swimmin’.
You got that.

1566
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:00,714
Too right, mate!

1567
01:24:01,003 --> 01:24:02,143
I got a live one here!

1568
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:03,597
Have you seen my dad?

1569
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:05,765
Gotcha! Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

1570
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:07,384
You let him go!

1571
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:13,695
Dad! Dad!

1572
01:24:14,283 --> 01:24:15,713
Dad!

1573
01:24:29,298 --> 01:24:31,987
Excuse me.

1574
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,481
Are you all right?

1575
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:35,979
I don't know where I am.
I don't know what's going on.

1576
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:38,858
I think I lost somebody,
but I can't remember.

1577
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,841
It's OK.
I'm looking for someone, too.

1578
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:45,518
Hey, we can look together.

1579
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,897
I'm Dory.

1580
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:49,236
I'm Nemo.

1581
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,378
Nemo? That's a nice name.

1582
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:04,309
-Dad!
-Dad!

1583
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,510
Wait a minute.
Is it your dad or my dad?

1584
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:08,972
-My dad.
-Got it. Dad!

1585
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:11,294
-Where are we, anyway?
-Dad! Dad!

1586
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:15,037
Oh. Syl--Shi--Sydney.

1587
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:19,294
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1588
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,398
Nemo!

1589
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:23,730
It's you! You're Nemo!

1590
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:25,512
Yes, yes, I'm Nemo!

1591
01:25:25,754 --> 01:25:28,034
You're Nemo!
You were dead. I saw you.

1592
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:30,060
And here you are!
I found you.

1593
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:32,724
You're not dead.
And your father--Your father!

1594
01:25:33,095 --> 01:25:35,175
You know my father?!
Where is he?

1595
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:37,987
This way!
He went this way. Quick!

1596
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:42,546
Have you seen
an orange fish swim by?

1597
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:44,851
-It looks just like him!
-But bigger!

1598
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:46,253
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.

1599
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:47,731
But I'm not tellin’ you
where he went...

1600
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:52,943
and there's no way
you're gonna make me.

1601
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:55,152
Mine.

1602
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,264
All right! I'll talk!

1603
01:25:57,552 --> 01:26:00,187
He went to the fishing grounds.

1604
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:00,208
He went to the fishing grounds.

1605
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:05,899
Hey, look out!

1606
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,351
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get home.

1607
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:12,978
Dad! Dad!

1608
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:14,697
Nemo?

1609
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,073
-Daddy!
-Nemo?

1610
01:26:17,406 --> 01:26:19,173
-Dad!
-Nemo's alive!

1611
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:19,374
-Dad!
-Nemo's alive!

1612
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:21,191
Dory? Nemo!

1613
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:22,526
Daddy!

1614
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:24,731
Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!

1615
01:26:25,047 --> 01:26:28,267
-Dad!
-Nemo! Thank goodness.

1616
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,330
It's all right, son.
It's gonna be OK.

1617
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:36,720
Turn around!
You're going the wrong way!

1618
01:26:37,092 --> 01:26:38,291
Look out!

1619
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,803
Oh, my--

1620
01:26:57,846 --> 01:27:00,976
Help! Help!

1621
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:02,849
-Dory!
-Come on!

1622
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:04,315
Help! Help!

1623
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,919
Help! Get us out!

1624
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:08,869
No, no, no! Dory!

1625
01:27:09,124 --> 01:27:11,754
-Dad, I know what to do!
-Nemo! No!

1626
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,559
We have to tell all the fish
to swim down together!

1627
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:17,300
-Get out of there now!
-I know this will work!

1628
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:19,366
No, l am not
gonna lose you again!

1629
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:22,654
There's no time!
It's the only way to save Dory!

1630
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,662
I can do this.

1631
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:28,878
You're right.

1632
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:30,786
I know you can.

1633
01:27:31,046 --> 01:27:33,596
-Lucky fin!
-Now, go! Hurry!

1634
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:36,442
Tell all the fish to swim down!

1635
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:39,778
Well? You heard my son!
Come on!

1636
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:44,000
Dory, you have
to tell everybody to...

1637
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:45,699
Swim down together!

1638
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,916
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

1639
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:50,219
Swim down!

1640
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:55,916
Everybody swim down!

1641
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,324
Come on,
you have to swim down!

1642
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:01,043
Down! Swim down!

1643
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:06,668
Swim down! Swim down!

1644
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:16,933
Don't give up!
Keep swimming!

1645
01:28:17,259 --> 01:28:19,399
Just keep swimming!

1646
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:25,362
That's it!

1647
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,253
It's working!

1648
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:35,601
Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1649
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:37,881
Just keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1650
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,470
Come on, Dad!

1651
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:41,870
-You're doing great, son!
-That's my dad.

1652
01:28:42,217 --> 01:28:44,237
Let's get to the bottom!
Keep swimming!

1653
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:46,773
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1654
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:49,052
Almost there!
Keep swimming!

1655
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:54,064
Keep swimming!

1656
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:57,521
Keep swimming!

1657
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:12,738
-Dory! Where's Nemo?
-There!

1658
01:29:14,883 --> 01:29:17,572
Oh, no. Nemo!

1659
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:25,562
Nemo?

1660
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:29,482
Nemo?

1661
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:33,308
It's OK. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

1662
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,260
Daddy?

1663
01:29:39,441 --> 01:29:40,781
Oh, thank goodness.

1664
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:44,259
Dad...I don't hate you.

1665
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:46,356
Oh, no, no, no.

1666
01:29:46,615 --> 01:29:48,955
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1667
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:01,046
-Hey, guess what?
-What?

1668
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:04,499
Sea turtles--l met one.

1669
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:08,656
And he was 150 years old.

1670
01:30:09,204 --> 01:30:12,864
-150?
-Yep.

1671
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:17,658
Sandy Plankton said
they only live to be 100.

1672
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,650
Sandy Plankton?

1673
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:21,631
Do you think I would
cross the entire ocean...

1674
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,757
and not know as much
as Sandy Plankton?

1675
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:26,392
He was 150! Not 100!

1676
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:30,155
Who is this Sandy Plankton
who knows everything?

1677
01:30:32,394 --> 01:30:32,927
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1678
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:35,617
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1679
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:38,751
-I'm gonna win!
-No, you're not!

1680
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:42,477
-I did it!
-Aw, my own son beats me!

1681
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:45,141
Climb aboard, explorers.

1682
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:48,223
The sea cucumber looks over
to the mollusk and says...

1683
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:51,163
"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

1684
01:30:53,148 --> 01:30:55,108
Hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1685
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:58,523
-Exchange student.
-I'm from the E.A.C., dude!

1686
01:30:58,987 --> 01:31:01,297
-Sweet!
-Totally.

1687
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:03,385
Seriously, Marty.

1688
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:05,388
Did you really do all
the things you say you did?

1689
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,150
Pardon me.

1690
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:09,765
Hello.

1691
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,591
Don't be alarmed.

1692
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:15,143
We wanted to make sure our
newest member got home safely.

1693
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:17,687
-Thanks, guys.
-See you next week.

1694
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:21,046
-Keep up with the program.
-Remember, fish are friends...

1695
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:23,589
Not food! Bye!

1696
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:25,552
Hold on, here we go!

1697
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,304
Next stop--knowledge!

1698
01:31:27,549 --> 01:31:29,719
Bye, son! Have fun!

1699
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:31,191
Bye, Dad!

1700
01:31:31,386 --> 01:31:34,406
Oh! Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.

1701
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,804
Love you, Dad.

1702
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,913
I love you, too, son.

1703
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:49,424
Dad? You can let go now.

1704
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:53,151
Sorry. Go have an adventure.

1705
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:55,601
Good-bye!
See ya later, dudes!

1706
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:58,117
-Bye, Elmo!
-Nemo.

1707
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:01,486
-Bye, Nemo!
-See you after school, Dory!

1708
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:02,349
Bye, Dad!

1709
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,430
Bye, Dad!

1710
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,693
Bye, son.

1711
01:32:23,972 --> 01:32:26,602
Barbara,
I don't understand it.

1712
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,088
Here this thing has
a lifetime guarantee...

1713
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:30,491
and it breaks!

1714
01:32:30,678 --> 01:32:32,698
l had to clean the tank myself,
take all the fish out...

1715
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:35,094
put ‘em in bags, and--

1716
01:32:35,417 --> 01:32:37,607
Where'd the fish go?

1717
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:44,277
-Come on, Peach!
-Hurry!

1718
01:32:44,526 --> 01:32:46,135
-You can do it!
-That's it.

1719
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:47,654
Just a little further.

1720
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:49,822
That's the shortest
red light I've ever seen!

1721
01:32:50,131 --> 01:32:51,621
