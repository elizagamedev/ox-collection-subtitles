1
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,573
Buy N Large is your superstore

2
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,433
We got all you need
and so much more

3
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,124
Too much garbage in your face?
There's plenty of space out in space!

4
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,945
BNL star liners leaving each day.

5
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,760
We'll clean up the mess
while you're away!

6
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,195
The jewel of the BNL fleet, the Axiom.

7
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,548
Spend your five-year cruise in style,

8
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,067
waited on 24 hours a day
by our fully automated crew,

9
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,131
while your captain and autopilot

10
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,196
chart a course for
nonstop entertainment, fine dining,

11
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,372
and with our all-access hoverchairs,
even Grandma can join the fun.

12
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,447
There's no need to walk.

13
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,915
The Axiom.
Putting the star in executive star liner.

14
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,359
Because at BNL,
space is the final fun-tier!

15
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,631
Who are you?

16
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,682
Who are you?

17
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,136
Who are you?

18
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,059
Directive?

19
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,445
Directive?

20
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:02,957
-Directive?
-Directive?

21
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,727
Classified.

22
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,956
Name?

23
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,746
-WALL-E.
-WALL-E.

24
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,383
WALL-E.

25
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,129
EVE.

26
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,185
EVE.

27
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:29,602
"EVE. EVE."

28
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,375
EVE.

29
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,143
EVE.

30
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,435
"EVE."

31
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,745
EVE!

32
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,740
WALL-E! WALL-E!

33
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,250
EVE.

34
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,623
Here.

35
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:04,772
Look.

36
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,045
Pop.

37
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:08,996
You pop.

38
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,358
WALL-E?

39
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,727
EVE!

40
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,424
EVE.

41
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,054
EVE?

42
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,761
EVE!

43
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,654
EVE!

44
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,523
EVE!

45
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,465
EVE!

46
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,676
EVE!

47
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,280
EVE!

48
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,149
EVE!

49
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,017
No!

50
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,227
EVE.

51
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,220
EVE.

52
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,264
EVE.

53
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,163
Foreign contaminant.

54
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,698
Foreign contaminant.

55
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,467
EVE!

56
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:42,596
Foreign contaminant.

57
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,100
EVE.

58
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,379
EVE!

59
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:45,955
I've been in my cabin all morning,

60
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:50,444
so let's hover over to the driving range
and hit a few virtual balls into space.

61
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,091
No, we did that yesterday.
I don't want to do that.

62
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,774
-Well, then what do you want to do?
-l don't know. Something.

63
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:09,354
Look, I'm tired of having
the same argument over and over.

64
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,466
Bot, over here.

65
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,975
-I'm in a tunnel. I can't hear you.
-There you are.

66
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,608
Buy N Large.
Everything you need to be happy.

67
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,725
Your day is very important to us.

68
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,879
Hey, drink-bot.

69
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,261
Here, take the cup. Hey, take the cup!

70
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,116
Please remain stationary.

71
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,052
A service-bot will be here
to assist you momentarily.

72
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,745
Stewards! Hello!

73
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,471
-Please remain stationary.
-Help.

74
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,953
A service-bot will be here
to assist you momentarily.

75
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,670
What's that? What's going on?

76
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,528
WALL-E.

77
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,348
-John.
-EVE?

78
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,811
No. John.

79
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:18,792
EVE!

80
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,283
Bye, WALL-E.

81
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,631
"A" is for Axiom,
your home sweet home.

82
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,294
"B" is for Buy N Large,
your very best friend.

83
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,614
Time for lunch in a cup.

84
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,223
Feel beautiful.

85
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,846
-It's the new you. Stunning.
-You look great.

86
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,456
-l know, honey. Men.
-Men.

87
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,377
Attention, Axiom shoppers. Try blue.

88
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,279
It's the new red.

89
00:40:58,423 --> 00:40:59,593
Love blue.

90
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,846
Date? Don't get me started on the date.

91
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,388
Every holo-date I have been on
has been a virtual disaster.

92
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:12,182
If 1 could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.

93
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,650
There are no good men out there.

94
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,349
I know. I know because I've...
What the...

95
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,715
Yoo-hoo. WALL-E.

96
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,984
-Mary.
-EVE.

97
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,081
Sure. You go ahead.

98
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:40,827
EVE.

99
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:48,959
Shade!

100
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,984
I didn't know we had a pool!

101
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,636
Captain, you are needed on the bridge.

102
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,344
All hands on deck!

103
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,067
Morning.

104
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:43,118
Just a trim?

105
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,163
Il see. I know, honey. I know.

106
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,213
I'm good, lam good.
You look gorgeous.

107
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,080
-Sir?
-Coffee.

108
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,560
Sir, the annual...

109
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,787
Protocol, Auto. First things first.

110
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,394
Computer, status report.

111
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,557
-Mechanical systems.
-Unchanged.

112
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,839
-Reactor core temperature.
-Unchanged.

113
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:42,642
-Passenger count.
-Unchanged.

114
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:44,907
-Regenerative food buffet.
-Unchanged.

115
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,982
-Jacuzzi pH balance.
-Unchanged.

116
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:49,098
-Atmospheric conditions.
-Unchanged.

117
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,323
-Captain.
-Laundry service volume.

118
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:52,515
-Unchanged.
-Okay, Auto.

119
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,410
-Sir, the annual reconnaissance...
-12:30!

120
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,880
Auto, why didn't you wake me
for morning announcements?

121
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:02,301
Honestly, it's the one thing
I get to do on this ship.

122
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:13,476
Well, good morning, everybody,

123
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:18,794
and welcome to day 255,642
aboard the Axiom.

124
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:22,303
As always, the weather is a balmy
72 degrees and sunny and...

125
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,901
Oh, I see the ship's log is showing
that today is our 700th anniversary

126
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:29,546
of our five-year cruise.

127
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,165
Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be
proud to know that 700 years later

128
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:37,739
we'd be doing the exact same thing
they were doing.

129
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:41,303
-Fore!
-So, be sure next mealtime

130
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:47,179
to ask for your "free
septuacentennial cupcake in a cup."

131
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,215
Wow, look at that!

132
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,230
Also today we have a...

133
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,428
Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button?

134
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,779
Captain, Probe One
has returned positive.

135
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,571
Positive?

136
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:12,719
EVE.

137
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:17,085
But no probe's

138
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:20,765
ever come back positive before.

139
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,213
Buy N Large

140
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,623
Greetings and congratulations,
Captain.

141
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:37,147
If you are seeing this,

142
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:40,525
that means your
Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,

143
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:43,995
or EVE probe, has returned from Earth

144
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:48,282
with a confirmed specimen
of ongoing photosynthesis.

145
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,216
That's right.
It means it's time to go back home.

146
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,799
Home? We're going back?

147
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,947
Now that Earth has been restored
to a life-sustaining status,

148
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,403
by golly,
we can begin Operation Recolonize.

149
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,073
Simply follow
this manual's instructions

150
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:17,212
to place the plant
in your ship's holo-detector

151
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:20,692
and the Axiom will immediately
navigate your return to Earth.

152
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:23,877
It's that easy.

153
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,861
Now, due to the effects
of microgravity,

154
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:31,475
you and your passengers may have
suffered some slight bone loss.

155
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,000
But I'm sure a few laps
around the ship's jogging track

156
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,364
will get you back in shape in no time.

157
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:39,623
We have a jogging track?

158
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:44,107
If you have any further questions,
just consult your operation manual.

159
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,635
See you back home real soon.

160
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,305
"Operate Manuel."

161
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:57,779
Manuel, relay instructions.

162
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:00,930
Manuel?

163
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,632
Wow. Will you look at that?

164
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:13,352
Let's see.

165
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,320
EVE.

166
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,745
WALL-E!

167
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,757
EVE.

168
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,435
Well, let's open her up.

169
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,010
"Step one.
Voice command, 'Confirm acquisition.”

170
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,102
Confirm acquisition.

171
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,192
Voice authorization required.

172
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,342
Accepted.

173
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,698
-Where's the thingy?
-Plant.

174
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,010
Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?

175
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,209
Maybe we missed a step.

176
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:19,906
-Show me how you change...
-Plant.

177
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,147
-Okay.
-WALL-E. WALL-E.

178
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,956
-EVE?
-Plant!

179
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,276
Why don't you scan her to be sure?

180
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:41,288
Contains no specimen.
Probe's memory is faulty.

181
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:46,071
-So then, we're not going to Earth?
-Negative.

182
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,590
I guess things go back to normal, huh?

183
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:49,923
Correct, Captain.

184
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,024
-Well, false alarm!
-False alarm.

185
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,199
The probe must be defective.

186
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:00,545
GO-4, send her to the repair ward,

187
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,049
and have them run diagnostics on her.
Make sure she's not...

188
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,163
WALL-E.

189
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,973
Have WALL-E cleaned.

190
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,702
EVE.

191
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:32,612
Analyze.

192
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:37,585
Analysis. Foreign contaminant.
Substance is a three-phase system

193
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,660
composed of various combinations
of naturally derived solids.

194
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,987
Subject is most commonly referred to
as soil, dirt, or earth.

195
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:47,346
"Earth"?

196
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:51,431
Define "earth."

197
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,865
Earth, the surface of the world
as distinct from the sky or sea.

198
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,692
Wow.

199
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,167
Define "sea."

200
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,817
Sea, an expanse of salt water

201
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,009
that covers most of the Earth's surface
and surrounds its landmasses.

202
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:25,048
Foreign contaminant.

203
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:49,923
EVE.

204
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,812
Just a trim?

205
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,790
You look gorgeous.

206
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:15,828
Fore!

207
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:18,765
Fore!

208
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,020
Fore!

209
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:31,814
EVE!

210
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:35,803
Clear, clear, clear.

211
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:12,917
EVE! EVE!

212
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,660
WALL-E.

213
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,363
WALL-E!

214
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,014
WALL-E!

215
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:14,403
Oh, my.

216
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:16,816
Halt!

217
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,444
WALL-E!

218
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:30,916
Caution. Rogue robots.

219
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,076
Caution. Rogue robots.

220
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,402
Caution. Rogue robots.

221
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,598
WALL-E!

222
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:44,444
Halt! Halt!

223
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,124
Caution. Rogue robots.

224
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:54,577
WALL-E!

225
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:00,386
Clear.

226
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,801
Caution. Rogue robots.

227
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,040
EVE.

228
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:37,587
EVE?

229
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:43,962
Earth.

230
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,466
Earth.

231
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,014
Directive.

232
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,807
WALL-E.

233
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:19,729
WALL-E!

234
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,223
Plant!

235
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:51,761
WALL-E.

236
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,846
-EVE.
-WALL-E!

237
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:13,052
Cruising speed.

238
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,801
You are now free
to move about the cabin.

239
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:30,332
Twenty seconds to self-destruct.

240
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,289
Ten seconds to self-destruct.

241
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:47,033
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

242
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:51,158
six, five, four,

243
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:53,575
three, two...

244
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,771
No. No.

245
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,126
WALL-E!

246
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,471
WALL-E!

247
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,285
EVE.

248
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,204
WALL-E.

249
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:44,353
EVE.

250
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,130
WALL-E!

251
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:09,098
WALL-E.

252
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:54,319
Oh, so many stars.

253
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,505
-Hey! Hey! That's what's-his-name!
-Hey! What the...

254
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,958
-Look! Look at that.
-What?

255
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:05,911
Hey.

256
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,328
I know that guy. It's WALL-E.

257
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:13,563
-Hey, WALL-E! It's your buddy John.
-Hi, WALL-E!

258
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:20,386
Hi.

259
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:22,520
Hi.

260
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,909
Define "hoedown."

261
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,988
Hoedown, a social gathering at which
lively dancing would take place.

262
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:43,717
Auto, Earth is amazing!
These are called "farms."

263
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:47,203
Humans would put seeds
in the ground, pour water on them,

264
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:49,551
and they grow food, like pizza.

265
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:51,433
Good night, Captain.

266
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:57,900
Computer.

267
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:00,656
Define "dancing."

268
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:04,791
Dancing, a series of movements
involving two partners

269
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:08,582
where speed and rhythm
match harmoniously with music.

270
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:16,382
EVE.

271
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,104
Home.

272
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:32,252
The lido deck is now closing.
The lido deck is now closing.

273
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:37,506
-Stop that.
-Make me.

274
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:41,287
-I didn't know we had a pool.
-No splashing. No diving.

275
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:44,609
-Go on.
-No splashing. No...

276
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:14,663
EVE.

277
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,515
Directive.

278
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:40,292
Prepare for landing.

279
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,522
"We're here, everybody."

280
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,781
"Yay, Captain! Captain, we're home!
It's so beautiful!"

281
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:50,928
"No. It's nothing.
l was pleased to do this.

282
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:53,451
"It's all about you people.
It's not about me."

283
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,616
How?

284
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,430
How did you find it?

285
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:10,716
We can go back home!
For the first time! What's it like now?

286
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:14,924
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
l want to see for myself.

287
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,870
Wait. That doesn't look like Earth.

288
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,685
Where's the blue sky?

289
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,764
Where's the grass?

290
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,699
I know that song.

291
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,189
They're

292
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:00,716
dancing.

293
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,549
Yes, dancing.

294
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:14,124
You made it somehow, huh, little guy?
You didn't give up, did you?

295
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:19,541
Okay, then. Come on.

296
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:22,968
Wait a minute.

297
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:44,383
EVE?

298
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,585
EVE!

299
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,370
WALL-E.

300
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,024
EVE. EVE.

301
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:10,939
EVE.

302
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:13,359
Pathetic.

303
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:17,946
EVE.

304
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:27,766
EVE!

305
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:48,327
Foreign contaminant.

306
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:58,903
There you go, little guy.

307
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,745
You came a long way
for a drink of water.

308
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:04,562
Just needed someone
to look after you, that's...

309
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:19,897
We have to go back.

310
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,705
-Auto, come down here.
-Aye, aye, sir.

311
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:26,464
WALL-E.

312
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,137
WALL-E.

313
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:34,581
Auto, EVE found the plant.
Fire up the holo-detector.

314
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:37,424
Not necessary, Captain.
You may give it to me.

315
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:40,881
-You know what? I should do it myself.
-Captain.

316
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,375
Sir, l insist you give me the plant.

317
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:48,909
-Auto, get out of my way.
-We cannot go home.

318
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:52,749
-What are you talking about? Why not?
-That is classified, Captain.

319
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,329
-Give me the plant.
-What do you mean, "classified"?

320
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:57,002
You don't keep a secret
from the captain.

321
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,240
Give me the plant.

322
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,531
-Tell me what's classified.
-The plant.

323
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,906
Tell me, Auto! That's an order.

324
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:07,879
Aye, aye, sir.

325
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:16,678
Buy N Large is your superstore
We got all you need

326
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,983
Just cut it off, will you?

327
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:23,716
Hey, there, autopilots.
Got some bad news.

328
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:29,629
Operation Cleanup has, well, failed.

329
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,847
Wouldn't you know,
rising toxicity levels have made life

330
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:35,804
unsustainable on Earth.

331
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,849
"Unsustainable"? What?

332
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,731
Darn it all, we're going to have
to cancel Operation Recolonize.

333
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:45,314
So just stay the course.

334
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:48,880
Rather than try and fix this problem,

335
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,132
it'll just be easier
for everyone to remain in space.

336
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:53,655
"Easier"?

337
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,303
-Mr. President?
-I think...

338
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:56,455
Sir, time to go.

339
01:07:56,673 --> 01:08:00,622
Okay. I'm giving
Override Directive A113.

340
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,497
Go to full autopilot.

341
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:06,937
Take control of everything,
and do not return to Earth.

342
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:10,850
Repeat, do not return to Earth.
Let's get the heck out of here.

343
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,747
Now, the plant.

344
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,857
No. Wait a minute.

345
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,276
Computer, when was that message
sent out to the Axiom?

346
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:24,805
Message received in the year 2110.

347
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:28,270
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

348
01:08:29,471 --> 01:08:31,461
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

349
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,181
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."

350
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:38,951
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

351
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:42,579
-It's living proof he was wrong.
-lrrelevant, Captain.

352
01:08:43,086 --> 01:08:46,596
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

353
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,299
Home, Auto.

354
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:51,837
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

355
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:53,535
That's all I've ever done.

356
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,696
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

357
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,250
On the Axiom you will survive.

358
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:03,766
-[ don't want to survive. I want to live!
-Must follow my directive.

359
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:27,055
I'm the captain of the Axiom.
We are going home today.

360
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:34,389
GO-4?

361
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:37,071
Hey! That's not...

362
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,657
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

363
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:49,618
