1
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,120
Once upon a time
in a kingdom far, far away,

2
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,370
the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.

3
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,660
And throughout the land,
everyone was happy

4
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,280
until the sun went down

5
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,009
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment

6
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,120
that took hold each and every night.

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,990
Desperate, they sought the help
of a fairy godmother

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,010
who had them lock the young princess
in a tower,

9
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,600
there to await the kiss...
of the handsome Prince Charming.

10
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,670
lt was he who would chance
the perilous journey

11
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,330
through blistering cold
and scorching desert

12
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,679
traveling for many days and nights,

13
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,790
risking life and limb

14
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,130
to reach the Dragon's keep.

15
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,530
For he was the bravest

16
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,449
and most handsome

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,050
in all the land.

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,610
And it was destiny that his kiss

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,770
would break the dreaded curse.

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,180
He alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,600
to enter the princess's chambers,
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,829
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her...

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,100
What?

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,340
- Princess Fiona?
- No!

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,440
Oh, thank heavens. Where is she?

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,460
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?

27
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,820
It's so good to be home!

28
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,470
Just you and me and...

29
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,380
- Two can be as bad as one
- Donkey?

30
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,260
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two
a sight for sore eyes!

31
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,640
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

32
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
And look at you, Mrs Shrek.
How about a side of sugar for the steed?

33
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,160
What are you doing here?

34
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,200
Taking care of your love nest for you.

35
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,099
You mean like... sorting the mail
and watering the plants.

36
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,210
- And feeding the fish!
- [don't have any.

37
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,270
You do now. I call that one Shrek
and the other Fiona.

38
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,140
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

39
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,880
Look at the time.
I guess you'd better be going.

40
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,510
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

41
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,590
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?

42
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,980
Oh, yeah, that.

43
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,300
I don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.

44
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
I thought I'd move in with you.

45
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,830
You know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.

46
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,590
But Fiona and I are married now.

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,740
We need a little time, you know,
to be together.

48
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,920
Just with each other.

49
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,359
Alone.

50
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,990
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

51
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,679
I will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

52
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,520
- Donkey!
- Yes, roommie?

53
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,830
You're bothering me.

54
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,830
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...

55
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,750
Me and Pinocchio was going
to catch a tournament, anyway.

56
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,030
See y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

57
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,830
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?

58
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
I think remember.

59
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,300
Donkey!

60
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,469
I know, I know! Alone!
I'm going! I'm going.

61
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,849
What do you want me
to tell these guys?

62
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,270
Enough, Reggie.

63
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,659
"Dearest Princess Fiona.

64
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,560
"You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away...

65
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,020
"for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage...

66
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,500
"at which time the King

67
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,090
"will bestow his royal blessing...
upon you

68
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,370
"and your...

69
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,440
"Prince Charming.

70
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,760
"Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away.

71
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,359
"aka Mom and Dad."

72
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,950
Mom and Dad?

73
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,969
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?

74
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,950
- We're not going.
- What?

75
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,770
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...

76
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,690
shocked to see you like this?

77
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,220
Well, they might be a bit surprised.

78
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,270
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

79
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,610
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.

80
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think
I'll be welcome at the country club.

81
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,250
Stop it. They're not like that.

82
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,470
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

83
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,840
Come on! You could at least
give them a chance.

84
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,000
To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks?

85
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,740
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

86
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,600
Oh, great. Now I need their blessing?

87
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,260
If you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

88
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,320
Who says I want
to be part of this family?

89
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,169
You did! When you married me!

90
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,200
Well, there's some fine print for you!

91
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,390
So that's it. You won't come?

92
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,040
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going! And that's final!

93
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,640
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!

94
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,920
Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.

95
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,180
Alf right, hit it! Move ‘em on! Head 'em up!
Head ‘em up, move ‘em on! Head ‘em up!

96
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,870
Rawhide! Move ‘em on!
Head ‘em up!

97
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,200
Move ‘em on! Move ‘em on!
Head ‘em up! Rawhide!

98
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,209
Ride ‘em up! Move ‘em on!
Head ‘em up! Move ‘em on! Rawhide!

99
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,729
Knock ‘em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make ‘em tea! Buy ‘em drinks!

100
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,480
Meet their mamas!
Milk ‘em hard!

101
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,480
Rawhide!

102
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,400
- Are we there yet?
- No.

103
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,210
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

104
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,410
- OK, are we there yet?
- No.

105
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,410
- Are we there yet?
- No!

106
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

107
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,600
- Really?
- No!

108
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,000
- Are we there yet?
- No!

109
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,710
- Are we there yet?
- No, we are not!

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
- Are we there yet?
- No!

111
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,500
Are we there yet?
That's not funny.

112
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,520
That's really immature.

113
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
This is why nobody likes ogres.

114
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,030
All right! Your loss!
I'll just stop talking.

115
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,910
Finally!

116
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,420
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!

117
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,329
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.

118
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,390
That's where we're going.
Far, far...

119
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,270
away!

120
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,540
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so damn bored.

121
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,209
Well, find a way to entertain yourself.

122
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,500
For five minutes...

123
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,290
Could you not be yourself
for five minutes!

124
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,470
Are we there yet?

125
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,110
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!

126
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,460
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

127
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,319
Hey, good looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

128
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,190
Pantyhose!

129
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,360
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

130
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,580
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.

131
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,020
Swimming pools! Movie stars!

132
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,050
Announcing the long-awaited return

133
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,189
of the beautiful Princess Fiona
and her new husband.

134
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,860
Well, this is it.

135
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,770
- This is it.
- This is it.

136
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,160
This is it.

137
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,040
Why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.

138
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,850
So, you still think this is a good idea?

139
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,280
Of course! Look!
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

140
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,430
- Who on earth are they?
- [ think that's our little girl.

141
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,810
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.

142
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,050
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

143
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,220
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

144
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,939
Happy now?
We came. We saw them.

145
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,650
Now let's go before they light the torches.

146
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,500
- They're my parents.
- They locked you in a tower.

147
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,150
That was for my own...

148
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,630
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

149
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,209
We have to be...

150
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,000
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

151
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,330
Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be...

152
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,329
A disaster! There is no way...

153
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,010
- You can do this.
- l really...

154
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,980
Really...

155
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,560
don't... want... to... be...

156
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,850
Here!

157
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,130
Mom...

158
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,440
Dad...

159
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,570
I'd like you to meet my husband...

160
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,390
Shrek.

161
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,070
It's easy to see
where Fiona gets her good looks from.

162
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,400
Excuse me.

163
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,810
Better out than in,
l always say, eh, Fiona?

164
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,200
That's good.

165
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,870
I guess not.

166
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,770
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

167
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,610
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

168
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,720
- [had the hardest time finding this place.
- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

169
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,740
No, Dad! It's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.

170
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,040
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: the noble steed.

171
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,199
Waiter!
How about a bowl for the steed?

172
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,850
Oh, boy.

173
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,400
Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs Q.

174
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,290
No, no. Darling.

175
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,150
So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.

176
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,200
Shrek owns his own land.

177
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,460
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

178
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,190
It's in an enchanted forest...

179
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,230
abundant in squirrels

180
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,189
and cute little duckies and...

181
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,290
What? I know you ain't
talking about the swamp.

182
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,670
An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original.

183
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,329
l suppose that would be
a fine place to raise the children.

184
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,050
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

185
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,470
Indeed. I just started eating.

186
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,990
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, OK?

187
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,830
- For his type, yes.
- My type?

188
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,320
I got to go to the bathroom.

189
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,510
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.

190
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,650
Mexican food! My favorite.

191
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,089
Let's not sit here with our tummies
rumbling. Everybody dig in.

192
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,720
Don't mind if! do, Lillian.

193
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,190
l suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be...

194
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,680
Ogres, yes!

195
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,530
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

196
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,500
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

197
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,500
That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

198
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,619
Oh, no. We usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

199
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,359
- Shrek, please!
- Lonly did that because I love her.

200
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,810
Aye, day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

201
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,830
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

202
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,020
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

203
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,649
- Harold!
- Shrek!

204
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,790
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

205
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,010
- Mom!
- Harold...

206
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,900
Donkey!

207
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,350
Your fallen tears have called to me

208
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,929
So, here comes my sweet remedy

209
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,080
! know what every princess needs

210
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,750
for her to live life happily

211
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,720
Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you.

212
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,770
You're all grown up.

213
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,230
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!

214
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,290
I'm your fairy godmother.

215
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,040
l have a fairy godmother?

216
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,860
Now don't worry.
I'm here to make it all better.

217
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,040
With just a...

218
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,090
Wave of my magic wand
Your troubles will soon be gone

219
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,709
With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash

220
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,969
A high-priced dress made by mice no less

221
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,070
Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress,

222
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,050
Your worries will vanish,
your soul will cleanse

223
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,899
Confide in your very own
furniture friends

224
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,830
We'll help you set a new fashion trend

225
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,649
- I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
- The kind of girl a prince would date!

226
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,060
They'll write your name
on the bathroom wall...

227
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,120
"For a happy ever after,
give Fiona a call!"

228
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,810
A sporty carriage to ride in style
Sexy man boy chauffeur, "Kyle"

229
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,409
Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away

230
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,170
And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé!

231
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,700
Nip and tuck, here and there
to land that prince with the perfect hair

232
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,139
Lipstick liners, shadows blush
To get the prince with the sexy tush

233
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,200
Lucky day, hunk buffet
You and your prince take a roll in the hay

234
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,340
You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to this tune

235
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,010
Don't be drab, you'll be fab
Your prince will have rock-hard abs

236
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,610
Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!

237
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,140
Nip and tuck, here and there
To land that prince with the perfect hair

238
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,270
Stop!

239
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,620
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,

240
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,460
but I really don't need all this.

241
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,500
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.

242
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,070
Oh! You got a puppy?
All l got in my room was shampoo.

243
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,720
Fairy Godmother, furniture...

244
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,190
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

245
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,580
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

246
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,520
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

247
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,060
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!

248
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,110
She's just trying to help.

249
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,140
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

250
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,899
- What?
- [don't want to leave.

251
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,420
When did you decide this?

252
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,960
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...

253
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,129
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.

254
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,439
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me,

255
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,830
happiness...

256
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,550
is just a teardrop away.

257
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,980
Thanks, but we've got all the happiness
we need.

258
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,870
Happy happy happy...

259
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,250
So I see. Let's go, Kyle.

260
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,000
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

261
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,560
I told you coming here was a bad idea.

262
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,210
You could have tried
to get along with my father.

263
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,320
Somehow I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing... even if I did want it.

264
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,330
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

265
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Sure. Do you want me to pack for you?

266
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,540
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

267
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,540
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

268
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,150
Here's a news flash for you!

269
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,700
Whether your parents like it or not...
lam an ogre!

270
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,980
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

271
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,430
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

272
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,090
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"

273
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,240
- [knew this would happen.
- You should. You started it.

274
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,210
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

275
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,640
I think, Harold...
you're taking this a little too personally.

276
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,080
This is Fiona's choice.

277
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,110
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

278
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,040
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

279
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,929
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

280
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,220
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

281
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,210
Oh, you act as if love is totally
predictable.

282
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,949
Don't you remember
when we were young and...

283
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,889
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

284
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,020
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

285
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,600
It's not the same!

286
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,209
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

287
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,690
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

288
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,690
Fine! Pretend
there's nothing wrong!

289
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,420
Isn't it all wonderful! I'd like to know
how it could get any worse!

290
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,659
- Hello, Harold.
- What happened?

291
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,140
Nothing, dear! Just the old
hunting wound playing up a bit!

292
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,409
- I'll just stretch it out here for a while.
- You better get in.

293
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,610
We need to talk.

294
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,060
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
just off to bed.

295
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,140
Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

296
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,860
So, how about...
We make this a quick visit. What?

297
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,889
Oh, hello.

298
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,050
So, what's new?

299
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,439
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

300
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,980
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.

301
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,230
When did you get back?

302
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,090
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

303
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,460
After l endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

304
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,490
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

305
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,950
Mommy can handle this.

306
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,730
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

307
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,610
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

308
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,140
And what does he find?

309
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,449
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

310
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,540
is already married.

311
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,909
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

312
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,720
Stop the car!

313
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,000
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

314
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,220
Where are we?

315
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,010
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?

316
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,280
My diet is ruined! I hope you're happy.

317
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,890
Two Renaissance Wraps,
no mayo... chili rings...

318
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,190
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

319
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,360
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

320
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,940
Sourdough soft taco, then?

321
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,140
No, really, I'm fine.

322
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,620
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.

323
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,100
Here you are, dear.

324
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,790
We made a deal, Harold, and l assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

325
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,200
Indeed not.

326
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,500
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

327
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,980
- Yes.
- Oh, believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

328
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,620
Not only for your daughter

329
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,840
but for your Kingdom.

330
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,270
What am I supposed to do about it?

331
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,680
Use your imagination.

332
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,990
Come on in, Your Majesty.

333
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,140
I like my town

334
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,260
With a little drop of poison

335
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,090
Nobody knows...

336
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,050
Excuse me.

337
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,290
Do I know you?

338
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,060
No, you must be mistaking me
for someone else.

339
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,570
Excuse me.
I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

340
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,800
There you are. Right.

341
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,920
You see, I need to have someone
taken care of.

342
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,240
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.

343
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,350
He's an ogre.

344
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,680
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

345
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,580
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that, and, frankly...

346
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,980
he don't like to be disturbed.

347
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,760
Where could I find him?

348
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,950
Hello?

349
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,760
Who dares enter my room?

350
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,210
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting...
but I'm told you're the one to talk to

351
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,230
about an ogre problem?

352
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,410
You are told correct.

353
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,990
But for this, l charge
a great deal of money.

354
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
Would this be enough?

355
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,350
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty.

356
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,850
Just tell me where I can find this ogre.

357
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,610
Dear Knight, I pray that you take
this favor as a token of my gratitude.

358
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,590
Dear Diary...

359
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,189
Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,

360
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,760
but Dad says I can't go.
He never lets me out after sunset.

361
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,360
Dad says I'm going away for a while.

362
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,720
Must be like some finishing school.

363
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,560
Mom says that when I'm old enough

364
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,740
my Prince Charming will rescue me
and bring me back to my family.

365
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,790
And we'll all live happily ever after.

366
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,620
Mrs Fiona Charming.

367
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,460
Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

368
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,620
No, no.
l was just reading a scary book.

369
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,680
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.

370
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,419
I don't know what came over me.

371
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,590
Do you suppose we could pretend
it never happened and start over...

372
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,540
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please. Call me Dad.

373
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,600
Dad. We both acted like ogres.

374
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,070
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.

375
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,350
Excellent idea! l was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

376
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,610
A little father-son time?

377
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,730
I know it would mean
the world to Fiona.

378
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,889
Shall we say,
7:30 by the old oak?

379
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,430
Face it, Donkey! We're lost.

380
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,850
We can't be lost. We followed
the King's instructions exactly.

381
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
"Head to the
darkest part of the woods..."

382
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,350
"Past the sinister trees
with scary-looking branches."

383
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,379
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!

384
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,380
You were the one who said
not to stop for directions.

385
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,560
Great. My one chance
to fix things up with Fiona's dad

386
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,770
and I end up lost in the woods with you!

387
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,970
Don't get huffy!
I'm only trying to help.

388
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,970
I know! I know.

389
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,290
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

390
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,460
I just really need to make
things work with this guy.

391
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,270
Yeah, sure. Now let's go
bond with Daddy.

392
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,440
Well, well, well, Donkey.

393
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,700
I know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?

394
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,710
l ain't purring.

395
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,350
Sure. What's next? A hug?

396
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,810
Donkeys don't purr. What do you think
lam, some kind of a...

397
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,550
Fear me! If you dare!

398
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,719
Hey, look! A little cat.

399
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,840
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.

400
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,929
Come here,
little kitty, kitty.

401
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,560
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.

402
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,659
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!

403
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

404
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,040
Shrek! Hold still!

405
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,700
- Did miss?
- No. You got them.

406
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,700
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...

407
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,180
Puss... In Boots.

408
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,969
I'll kill that cat!

409
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,790
- Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!

410
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,800
What should we do with him?

411
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,919
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

412
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,470
l implore you! It was nothing personal,
Sefior. l was doing it only for my family.

413
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,490
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!

414
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,020
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers...

415
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,240
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

416
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,250
The rich King? Si.

417
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,800
So much for Dad's royal blessing.

418
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,009
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.

419
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,639
Gee, thanks.

420
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,550
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if l were some sort of Prince Charming.

421
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,350
That's what the King said.

422
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,730
Sorry. I thought that question
was directed at me.

423
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,730
Fiona knows you'd do anything for her.

424
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,710
Well, it's not like I wouldn't
change if I could.

425
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,790
I just wish I could make her happy.

426
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,420
Hold the phone...

427
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,380
Happiness.

428
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,370
A teardrop away.

429
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,310
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!

430
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,010
Ah, man, where do I begin?

431
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,020
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

432
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,759
Then this fool had a party and he have
the guests trying to pin the tail on me.

433
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,720
Then they got drunk and start beating me
with a stick, going "Pifiata!!"

434
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,360
What is a pifata, anyway?

435
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,670
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

436
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,270
Don't go projecting on me. I know
you're feeling bad, but you got to let...

437
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,460
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...

438
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,560
What? Is it on? Is iton?

439
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,390
This is Fairy Godmother.

440
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,609
I'm either away
from my desk or with a client.

441
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,750
But if you come by the office, we'll be
glad to make you an appointment.

442
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,830
Have a "happy ever after.”

443
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,120
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

444
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,460
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

445
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,870
Ain't no stoppin’ us now! Whoa!
We're on the move!

446
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,290
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

447
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,110
On my honor, Il am obliged to accompany
you until l have saved your life

448
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,250
as you have spared me mine.

449
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,370
The position of annoying talking animal
has already been taken.

450
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,230
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?

451
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,049
Come on, Donkey. Look at him...

452
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,980
in his wee little boots.

453
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,980
You know, how many cats can wear boots?

454
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,790
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?

455
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,620
Listen. He's purring!

456
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,480
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

457
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,900
Lighten up? I should lighten up.
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

458
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,060
They're both festive, aren't they?

459
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,300
What do you think, Harold?

460
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,250
Yes, fine. Fine.

461
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,560
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

462
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,009
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it matters.

463
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,610
How do we know there will
even be a ball?

464
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,330
Mom. Dad.

465
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,650
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

466
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,430
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

467
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,180
l haven't. You should ask your father.

468
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,460
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

469
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,590
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Yes!

470
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,730
Exquisite. What do you call this dish?

471
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,600
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

472
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,279
Yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.

473
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,200
- Dad? Have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.

474
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,990
I'm sure he just went off to look for a nice...
mud hole to cool down in.

475
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,620
You know,
after your little spat last night.

476
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,740
You heard that, huh?

477
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,470
The whole kingdom heard you.

478
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,080
l mean, after all it is in his nature to be,

479
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,810
well, a bit of a brute.

480
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,520
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

481
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,990
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

482
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,180
Shrek loves me for who lam.

483
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,250
I would think you'd be happy for me.

484
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,549
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

485
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,360
Maybe you should do the same.

486
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,490
No, really?

487
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,990
That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.

488
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,010
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

489
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,270
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

490
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,780
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell? Spell.

491
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,670
He makes me laugh.

492
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,030
Hi. I'm here to see the...

493
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,920
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.

494
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,100
Jerome! Coffee and
a Monte Cristo. Now!

495
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,110
Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away.

496
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,920
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, OK?

497
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,900
That's OK.
We're from the union.

498
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,279
The union?

499
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,240
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

500
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,350
Oh! Right.

501
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,190
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

502
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,750
A little. We don't
even have denial.

503
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,560
They don't even have dental.

504
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,810
We'll just have a look around.

505
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,060
I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother
didn't know we were here.

506
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,529
Know what I'm saying? Huh?

507
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,419
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

508
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,440
A drop of desire.

509
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,290
Naughty.

510
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,000
A pinch of passion.

511
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
And just a hint of...

512
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,020
lust!

513
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,640
Excuse me.

514
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,960
Sorry to barge in like this...

515
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,939
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

516
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,649
It seems that Fiona's not exactly happy.

517
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,660
And there's some question
as to why that is?

518
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,730
Let's explore that, shall we?

519
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,130
Princess. Cinderella.

520
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,070
Here we are. "Lived happily
ever after." Oh...

521
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,340
No ogres!

522
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,839
Let's see. Snow White.

523
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,270
A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres.

524
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,690
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!

525
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,670
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.

526
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,609
The Golden Bird,
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...

527
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,290
No, no, no, no, no!

528
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,370
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.

529
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,330
All right, look, lady!

530
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,720
Don't you point...
those dirty green sausages at me!

531
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,990
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.

532
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,610
Oh! Sorry.

533
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,660
That's OK. We were just leaving.

534
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,370
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

535
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,270
Just go.

536
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,680
Come on, guys.

537
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,690
TGIF, eh, buddy?

538
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,080
Working hard or hardly working,
eh, Mac?

539
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,410
Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your
cat cheeks out of my face! Man, that stinks!

540
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,379
You don't exactly smell like
a basket of roses.

541
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,500
- One of these has got to help.
- l was just concocting this very plan!

542
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,140
Already our minds are becoming one.

543
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,310
If we need an expert on licking ourselves,
we'll give you a call.

544
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,210
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

545
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,220
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

546
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,450
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

547
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,790
No problema, boss.

548
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,760
In one of my nine lives... 1 was the great cat
burglar of Santiago de Compostela.

549
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,310
Shrek, are you off your nut?

550
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,930
Donkey, keep watch.

551
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,850
Keep watch? Yeah, I'll keep watch.

552
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,529
I'll watch that wicked witch come and
whammy a world of hurt up your backside.

553
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,500
I'll laugh, too.
I'll be giggling to myself.

554
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,270
- What do you see?
- "Toad Stool Softener"?

555
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,089
I'm sure a nice BM
is the perfect solution for marital problems.

556
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,690
"Elfa Seltzer"?

557
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,509
- "Hex Lax"?
- No! Try "handsome".

558
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,030
Sorry. No handsome.

559
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,070
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?

560
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,319
What does it do?

561
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,430
It says "Beauty Divine."

562
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,650
In some cultures, donkeys are
revered as the wisest of creatures.

563
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,520
Especially us talking ones.

564
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,930
That'll have to do. We've got company.

565
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,400
Can we get on with this?

566
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,089
Hurry!

567
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,780
Nice catch, Donkey!

568
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,690
Finally! A good use for your mouth.

569
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,040
Come on!

570
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,330
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!

571
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,070
And somebody bring me something
deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

572
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,540
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.

573
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,880
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.

574
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,150
Whoa, what happened here?

575
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,640
The ogre, that's what!

576
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,250
What? Where is he, Mom?

577
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,690
I shall rend his head from his shoulders!

578
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,080
I will smite him where he stands!

579
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,770
He will rue the very day he stole
my kingdom from me!

580
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,259
Put it away, junior!
You're still going to be king.

581
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,689
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter.

582
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,940
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.

583
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,360
What?

584
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,009
ldo believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

585
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,230
"Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.

586
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,930
"For you and your true love.

587
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,570
If one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine.

588
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,350
"Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."

589
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,880
- You both will be fine?
- [ guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.

590
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,440
Hey, man, this don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

591
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,380
Drop that jug o' voodoo
and let's get out of here.

592
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,710
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?

593
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,610
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.

594
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,730
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!

595
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,020
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion...

596
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,090
allow me to take the first sip.

597
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,240
It would be an honor to lay my life
on the line for you.

598
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,820
I don't think so.
If there'll be any animal testing, I'll do it.

599
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,950
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

600
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,880
How do you feel?

601
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,830
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?

602
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,140
You still look like an ass to me.

603
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,049
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

604
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,790
Here's to us, Fiona.

605
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,240
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- l know.

606
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,220
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- l know.

607
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,030
- No more itchy butt crack?
- l know!

608
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,250
- But you love being an ogre!
- l know!

609
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,799
But I love Fiona more.

610
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,860
Shrek, no! Wait!

611
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,170
Got to be... l think you grabbed
the "Farty Ever After" potion.

612
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,649
Maybe it's a dud.

613
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,070
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

614
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,010
What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.

615
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,570
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die!

616
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,550
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!

617
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,710
I'm melting!

618
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,300
It's just the rain, Donkey.

619
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,590
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy...

620
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,920
and Fiona's father hired a sleazy
hit man to whack you.

621
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,030
It'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...

622
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,690
The sun will come out

623
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,990
tomorrow!

624
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,690
Bet your bottom...

625
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,510
Bet my bottom?

626
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,920
I'm coming, Elizabeth!

627
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,420
Are you all right?

628
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,970
Hey, boss. Let's shave him.

629
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,480
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.

630
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,380
What is it, darling?

631
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,160
I've been thinking
about what you said.

632
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,010
I'm going to set things right.

633
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,420
Excellent! That's my girl.

634
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,120
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.

635
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,340
I'm going to go find him.

636
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,799
And then we'll go back
to the swamp where we belong.

637
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,399
Fiona, please!

638
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,549
Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.

639
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,220
Look, told you he was here. Look at him!
Quiet. Look at him.

640
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,380
Good morning, sleepyhead.

641
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,540
We love your kitty!

642
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,030
- My head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.

643
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,780
Thanks.

644
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,569
Acute button nose?

645
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,960
Thick, wavy locks?

646
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,799
Taut, round buttocks?

647
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,680
I'm...

648
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,520
- Gorgeous!
- I'll say.

649
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,510
I'm Jill. What's your name?

650
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,960
- Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?

651
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,410
- You're tense.
- l want to rub his shoulders.

652
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,110
- [got it covered.
- [don't have anything to rub.

653
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,820
Get in line.

654
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,160
Have you seen my donkey?

655
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,700
Who are you calling Donkey?

656
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,310
- Donkey? You're a...
- Astallion, baby!

657
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,430
l can whinny. I can count.

658
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,609
Look at me, Shrek! I'm trotting!

659
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,220
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

660
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,339
"Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr Boss, it's very bad."

661
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,720
"Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping.

662
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,300
"Not intended for heart patients
or those with... nervous disorders."

663
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,120
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place!

664
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,740
What?

665
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,120
"To make the effects
of this potion permanent

666
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,540
"the drinker must obtain
his true love's kiss by midnight."

667
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,970
Midnight? Why is it always midnight?

668
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,710
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!
- I'll be your true love.

669
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,290
I'll be true... enough.

670
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,520
Look, ladies, I already have a true love.

671
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,630
And take it from me, Boss. You are
going to have one satisfied Princess.

672
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,920
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.

673
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,350
Inside you're the same
old mean, salty...

674
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,470
- Easy.
- ...cantankerous, foul,

675
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,240
angry ogre you always been.

676
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,410
And you're still the same
annoying donkey.

677
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,160
Yeah.

678
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,200
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.

679
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,000
First things first. We need to get
you out of those clothes.

680
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,410
- Ready?
- Ready!

681
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,170
Driver, stop!

682
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,070
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

683
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,430
I'm blind! Tell the truth. Will I
ever be able to play the violin again?

684
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,360
You poor creature!
Is there anything I can do for you?

685
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,960
Well, there is one thing.

686
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,149
Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

687
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,799
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

688
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,450
Father? Is everything all right, Father?

689
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,180
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.

690
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,669
Unless, of course,
I can't find you or if I forget.

691
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,020
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

692
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,109
Hello, handsome.

693
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,210
- Princess!
- Donkey?

694
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,540
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?

695
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,890
What potion?

696
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,790
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...

697
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,100
Now, we're sexy!

698
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,930
For you, baby... l could be.

699
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,280
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

700
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,569
He went inside looking for you.

701
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,660
You want to dance, pretty boy?

702
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,730
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

703
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,390
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

704
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,240
What happened to your voice?

705
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,030
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

706
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,770
But not the way I feel about you.

707
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,560
Charming?

708
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,880
Do you think so?

709
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,520
Dad? I was so hoping you'd approve.

710
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,120
- Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

711
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,440
I know you never get a second chance
at a first impression

712
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,950
but, well, what do you think?

713
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,110
Oh, shoot! I don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

714
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,800
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

715
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,830
I just wanted her to be happy.

716
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,120
And now she can be.

717
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,370
Oh, sweetheart.

718
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,669
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

719
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,640
But look at me.
Look what I've done for her.

720
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,970
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

721
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,880
She's a Princess.
And you're an ogre.

722
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,850
That's something no amount of potion
will ever change.

723
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,020
But...

724
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,510
I love her.

725
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,480
If you really love her...

726
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,279
you'll let her go.

727
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,930
What's going on?
Where are you going?

728
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,960
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this, would you, Harold?

729
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,109
People just ain't no good

730
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,930
! think that's well understood

731
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,800
There you go, boys.

732
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,759
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

733
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,170
Why the long face?

734
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,530
It was all just a stupid mistake.

735
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,910
l never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

736
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,090
l hate Mondays.

737
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,520
I can't believe you're gonna walk away
from the best thing that happened to you.

738
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,200
What choice do I have?

739
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,460
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

740
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,710
Come on. Is he really
that good-looking?

741
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,110
Are you kidding? He's gorgeous!

742
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,360
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

743
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,100
He sounds dreamy.

744
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,009
Shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

745
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,490
Look, guys. It's for the best.

746
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:16,040
Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets
the man she's always dreamed of.

747
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,259
Everybody wins.

748
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,520
Except for you.

749
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,939
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

750
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,430
And that's why I have to let her go.

751
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,180
Excuse me, is she here?

752
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,319
She's in the back.

753
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,340
Hello again.

754
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,390
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

755
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,940
You better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

756
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,870
I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

757
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,540
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

758
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,660
I mean, how charming can I be... when
l have to pretend I'm that dreadful ogre?

759
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,029
No! No, it's nobody's fault.

760
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,060
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off. OK?

761
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,210
- What?
- You can't force... someone to fall in love!

762
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,470
I beg to differ. I do it all the time!

763
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,200
Have Fiona drink this and she'll
fall in love with the first man she kisses.

764
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,000
Which will be Charming.

765
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,810
- No.
- What did you say?

766
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,330
I can't. l won't do it.

767
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,049
Oh, yes, you will.

768
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,160
If you remember...
l helped you with your happily ever after.

769
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,620
And I can take it away just as easily.

770
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,819
Is that what you want? Is it?

771
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,290
- No.
- Good boy.

772
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,870
Now we have to go. I need to do
Charming's hair before the ball.

773
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,150
He's hopeless. He's high in the front.

774
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,150
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

775
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,109
Thank you, Mother.

776
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,160
Mother?

777
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,810
Mary! A talking horse!

778
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,040
The ogre!

779
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,330
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

780
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,520
Well, the abs are fab and it's gluteus
to the maximus here at tonight's

781
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,070
Far, Far Away Royal Ball blowout!

782
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,180
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

783
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,220
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

784
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:20,350
Everyone who's anyone has turned out
to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

785
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,490
And, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous!

786
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,000
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

787
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,580
What the heck are the crumbs for?

788
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,410
And right behind them, Tom Thumb
and Thumbelina!

789
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,630
Oh, aren't they adorable!

790
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,830
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

791
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,140
Tired old thing.

792
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,509
Who's this? Who's this? Who is this?

793
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,770
It's the one, it's the only...

794
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,259
It's the Fairy Godmother!

795
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,339
Hello, Far, Far Away!

796
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,670
Can I get a whoop whoop?

797
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,120
May all your endings be happy and...

798
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,770
Well, you know the rest!

799
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,130
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

800
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,100
after these messages.

801
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,800
I hate these ball shows.

802
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,680
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to "Wheel of Torture"!

803
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,170
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until l see Shrek and Fiona.

804
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,000
Whizzes on you guys.

805
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,110
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

806
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,300
No, to your left. Your left!

807
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,150
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here's a good show!

808
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,480
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.

809
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,960
It's time for the men in steel
to teach these madcap mammals...

810
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,390
their "devil may mare" attitudes
just won't fly.

811
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,160
Why you grabbing me? Police brutality!

812
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,439
I have to talk to Princess Fiona!

813
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,480
We warned you!

814
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,870
Will they get away with it?
Or did someone let the cat out of the bag?

815
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,100
You, capitalist pig dogs!

816
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,840
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.

817
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,830
Find Princess Fiona!

818
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,630
I'm a donkey!

819
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,090
Tell her Shrek...
I'm her husband, Shrek!

820
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,750
Quick! Rewind it!

821
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,430
I'm her husband, Shrek!

822
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:37,870
Darling?

823
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,720
I thought I might find you here.

824
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,980
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

825
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,680
I'm not going.

826
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,520
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

827
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,260
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

828
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,310
I mean, look at him.

829
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,180
Yes, he is a bit different, but...

830
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,800
people change for the ones they love.

831
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,870
You'd be surprised how much I changed
for your mother.

832
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,790
Change?

833
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,940
He's completely lost his mind!

834
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,260
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

835
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,180
I mean, you might find you like
this new Shrek.

836
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,339
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.

837
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,509
I'd give anything to have him back.

838
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,430
Darling! That's mine. Decaf.

839
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,460
Otherwise I'm up all night.

840
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,690
Thanks.

841
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,780
I got to get out of here! You can't lock
us up like this! Let me go!

842
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:48,870
And my Miranda rights? You should say
I have the right to remain silent.

843
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,440
Nobody said I have the right
to remain silent!

844
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,010
You have the right to remain silent.

845
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,540
What you lack is the capacity.

846
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,870
I must hold on before I, too,
go totally mad.

847
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,290
Shrek? Donkey?

848
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,780
Too late.

849
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,740
Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here!

850
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,090
Fire in ze hole!

851
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,550
Look out below!

852
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,600
Quick! Tell a lie!

853
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,240
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!

854
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,129
Say something crazy like
"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!"

855
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,350
lam wearing ladies' underwear.

856
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,490
- Are you?
- [most certainly am not!

857
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,649
It looks like you most certainly am are!

858
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,330
- Lam not!
- What kind?

859
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,850
- It's a thong!
- They're briefs!

860
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,290
- Are not.
- Are too!

861
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,990
- Are not!
- Are too!

862
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,750
Here we go. Hang tight.

863
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,790
Hey, wait!

864
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,960
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

865
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,110
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?

866
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,670
- Sorry, boss.
- We've got to stop that kiss!

867
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,740
I thought you was going to let her go.

868
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,970
l was, but I can't let them
do this to Fiona.

869
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,020
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!

870
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,170
We'll never get in. The castle is guarded
and there is a moat and everything!

871
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,259
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek... without a Popsicle stick.

872
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,150
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?

873
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,589
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane. Why?

874
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,150
Because we'll need flour.

875
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,080
Lots and lots of flour.

876
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,770
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

877
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,810
It's alive!

878
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,310
Run, run, run, as fast you can!

879
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,270
Go, baby, go!

880
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,480
There it is, Mongo! To the castle!

881
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,510
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!

882
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,840
Mongo! Down here! Look at the pony!

883
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,710
That's right! Follow the pretty pony!

884
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,400
Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!

885
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,150
Ladies and gentlemen.
Presenting... Princess Fiona

886
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,450
and her new husband...
Prince Shrek.

887
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,300
Shrek, what are you doing?

888
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,920
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.

889
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,529
Is that glitter on your lips?

890
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:19,359
Cherry flavored. Want to taste?

891
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,160
- What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...

892
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,049
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

893
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:30,549
Ladies and gentlemen.

894
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,660
I'd like to dedicate this song to...

895
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,990
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

896
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:41,839
Fiona, my Princess.

897
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,290
Will you honor me with a dance?

898
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,950
Where have all the good men gone

899
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,980
And where are all the gods?

900
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,710
Where's the streetwise Hercules

901
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,260
To fight the rising odds?

902
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,990
Since when do you dance?

903
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,630
Fiona, my dearest...
if there's one thing I know,

904
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,810
it's that love is full of surprises.

905
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,420
Late at night
Il toss and turn

906
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,080
And I dream of what I need...

907
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,080
Hit it!

908
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,269
! need a hero!

909
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,990
All right, big fellow! Let's crash this party!

910
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,230
Man the catapults!

911
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,859
Aim! Fire!

912
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,700
- Brace yourselves!
- Purty!

913
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,170
Not the gumdrop button!

914
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,070
Incoming!

915
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,730
All right!

916
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:07,000
Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy

917
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,679
Go, Mongo! Go!

918
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,250
Man the cauldrons!

919
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,840
After you, Mongo.

920
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,260
- That's it! Heave!
- Ho! Watch out!

921
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,910
More heat, less foam!

922
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,550
Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above

923
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,450
Out where the lightning splits the sea

924
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,950
! could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me

925
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,930
Heave!

926
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,380
Be good.

927
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,520
He needs me! Let me go!

928
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,220
Puss!

929
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,860
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

930
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,900
Today, I repay my debt.

931
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,130
En garde!

932
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,080
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast

933
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,470
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

934
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,890
- 1 need a hero
- Stop!

935
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,860
Hey, you! Back away from my wife.

936
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,139
You couldn't just go back to your swamp...
and leave well enough alone.

937
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,690
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!

938
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,860
Pinocchio! Get the wand!

939
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,630
l see London! I see France!

940
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,549
I'm a real boy!

941
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,259
Donkey!

942
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,860
I'm a real boy.

943
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,070
That's mine!

944
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,610
Pray for mercy, from Puss...

945
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,210
And Donkey!

946
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,969
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!

947
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:59,120
You were supposed
to give her the potion!

948
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,940
Well, l guess I gave her the wrong tea.

949
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,530
Mommy!

950
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,600
Mommy?

951
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,730
I told you...

952
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,550
ogres don't live happily ever after.

953
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,120
Oh, Dad!

954
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,940
- ls he...?
- Yup.

955
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,030
He croaked.

956
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,429
I'd hoped you'd never see me like this.

957
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,660
And he gave you a hard time!

958
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,890
No, no, he's right. I'm sorry.

959
01:14:59,040 --> 01:14:59,950
To both of you.

960
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,650
l only wanted what was best for Fiona.

961
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,790
But I can see now

962
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,580
she already has it.

963
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,850
Shrek, Fiona...

964
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,160
will you accept
an old frog's apologies

965
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,840
and my blessing?

966
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,530
I'm sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be
the man you deserve.

967
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,650
You're more that man today
than you ever were. Warts and all.

968
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,050
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

969
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,339
Midnight!

970
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,660
Fiona... is this what you want?

971
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,960
To be this way forever?

972
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,950
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now

973
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,080
we can stay like this.

974
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,370
You'd do that?

975
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,889
- For me?
- Yes.

976
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,700
l want what any princess wants.

977
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,690
To live happily ever after...

978
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,160
with the ogre I married.

979
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,929
Whatever happens, I must not cry!

980
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,110
You cannot make me cry!

981
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,110
You still look like a noble steed to me.

982
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,679
Now, where were we?

983
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,120
l remember.

984
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,180
Isn't we supposed
to be having a fiesta?

985
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,809
Puss and Donkey, y'all...

986
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,360
Here we go!

987
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,880
Hey gorgeous!

988
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,879
Sing it one more time now!

989
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,820
Donkey, that's Spanish!

990
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,099
Alf by myself

991
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,950
Don't wanna be

992
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,460
All by myself anymore

993
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,960
We are off to the Kit-Kat Club.
Come on, join us.

994
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:00,010
Thanks, compadre.
I'm... I'm not in the mood.

995
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,260
We will cheer you up!
Find you a nice burro!

996
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,230
Hey, baby!

997
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,160
Hey, that's my girl! Yeah! All right!

998
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,730
Baby, where you been?

999
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:18,340
I'm sorry, too. I should have stayed.
But Shrek had this thing he had to do.

1000
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,180
What? Say it one more time.

1001
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,540
What you talking about?
Are you serious?

1002
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,520
Look at our little mutant babies!

1003
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,000
I got to get a job.
