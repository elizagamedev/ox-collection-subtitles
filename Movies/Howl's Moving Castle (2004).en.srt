HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE

00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:40,686
Miss Sophie

5
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,098
I've closed up the shop

6
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,593
You should come too, Sophie

7
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,666
I'll just finish this
Go have some fun

8
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,942
All right, then. I'm off

9
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,279
I'm going

10
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,284
Look, it's Howl's castle

11
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,910
What? Howl? Where, where?

12
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,965
Look how close it is

13
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,064
Oh, no

14
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,106
l wonder if Howl's in town

15
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,366
It took off

16
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,937
No, just hiding
from all the soldiers

17
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,650
Say. did you hear?
Remember Martha, from South Haven?

18
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,212
They say Howl tore her heart out

19
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,338
How scary...

20
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,762
Don't worry, he's not going
to want yours

21
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,030
Hurry up

22
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,253
Really?

23
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,878
Oh, cut it out...

24
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,878
Hey there little mouse,
lost your way?

25
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,157
Oh, no... I'm fine

26
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,663
Then how about a cup of tea?

27
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,135
Care to join me?

28
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:44,823
No thank you, I'm busy

29
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,455
She sure is a cute little mouse

30
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,878
Say, how old are you?
You live around here?

31
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,871
Let me pass!

32
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,122
See, it's those whiskers of yours

33
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,797
She's even cuter when she's mad

34
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,341
Hey, there, I'm sorry

35
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,746
Where' ve you been?

36
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,165
Who are you?

37
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm with her

38
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,491
Why don't you two take
a little walk

39
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,169
What the...?
Hey, wha...

40
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,638
Don't hold it against them

41
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,904
They're harmless

42
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:22,089
Where to? I'll be your escort

43
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,806
No. really, I'm only going to Cesari's

44
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,484
Act normal
I'm being followed

45
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:28,941
Just walk

46
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,980
Sorry, 1 got you involved

47
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,089
This way

48
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:05,675
Hold on

49
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,975
Drop your legs. keep walking

50
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,649
That's right, don't be frightened

51
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,804
Very nice

52
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,483
I'll draw them off

53
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,395
Wait here until the coast is clear

54
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,054
Yes

55
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,190
That's my girl

56
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,184
Any chocolate Letties?

57
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,775
Look this way, Lettie

58
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,860
Hey. make room

59
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,031
Let's go for a walk, Lettie

60
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,142
My sister?

61
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,451
Come back soon, Lettie

62
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,477
Sophie?

63
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,863
How did you land
on the veranda like that?

64
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,478
Have you become an angel?

65
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,504
It feels like I'm in a dream...

66
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,853
Lettie, why not use the office?

67
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,249
Thanks, but ! should really
be working

68
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,000
What?
You sure he wasn't a wizard?

69
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,281
He was so kind...

70
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,240
He rescued me...

71
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,035
Don't tell me he's stolen your heart

72
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,586
If that was the wizard Howl,
he'd have eaten it right up

73
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,674
Don't worry,
Howl's only after beauties

74
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,741
There you go again

75
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,859
Listen to me,
we live in dangerous times

76
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,936
They say even the Witch of the Waste
is back on the prowl

77
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,193
Sophie?

78
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,933
Oh, you...

79
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,570
Lettie, the Madeleines are done

80
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,900
Okay, be right there

81
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,344
All right

82
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,715
I'm going home

83
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,969
It's a relief to know
you're doing well

84
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,164
Hello, Lettie

85
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,431
Nice to see you

86
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,110
Listen. are you going to spend
your whole life in that shop?

87
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,148
It meant so much to Papa
Besides, I'm the eldest

88
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,292
That's not what I meant
Are you sure you want to be a hatter?

89
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,163
Well, I...

90
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,508
Bye, Lettie

91
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,966
Come by the shop next time

92
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,054
Sure

93
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,198
I'll be on my way

94
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,806
Sophie. you've got to
look out for yourself

95
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,271
Sorry, the shop's closed

96
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,863
I thought I'd locked the door

97
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,608
What a cheap shop,
full of cheap little hats

98
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,944
And you're quite cheap-looking yourself

99
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,948
This is just a simple hat shop

100
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,301
I think you had better leave

101
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,624
You're very brave, taking on
the Witch of the Waste

102
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,971
The Witch of the Waste?

103
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,720
You won't be able to tell anyone
about that spell

104
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,330
My regards to Howl

105
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,878
Is this really me!

106
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,138
I've got to stay calm

107
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,453
I've got to calm down

108
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,312
It's no use panicking, Sophie

109
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,536
I'll be fine, I'll be fine

110
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:18,254
I've got to calm down

111
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,466
I'm back!

112
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,991
Welcome home, Ma'am!

113
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,623
- Welcome home
- How do you like it?

114
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,561
It's all the rage in Kingsbury

115
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,939
Amazing

116
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,011
It suits you

117
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,129
Don't you think it's wonderful?

118
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,381
Sophie!

119
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,906
Mrs. Hatter, Sophie hasn't come down
to work yet

120
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,069
Il wonder what's the matter?

121
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,098
Sophie!

122
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,689
Don't come in

123
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,005
I've got an awful cold

124
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,934
I don't want you to catch it

125
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,636
You sound just awful...

126
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,718
Like some 90 year-old woman

127
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,487
I'll stay in bed today

128
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,330
You sure? All right, then

129
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,634
Here we go...

130
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,685
You'll be fine, old lady

131
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,673
You're still healthy. and these clothes
finally suit you

132
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,730
But I can't stay here

133
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,589
Ouch, ouch

134
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,560
It's not easy being old

135
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,253
They're saying this war
is going to be terrible...

136
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,335
Like a hand, granny?

137
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,184
Such a gentleman,
but I'll manage

138
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,021
Sure, old lady,
but where are you off to?

139
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,752
Just a bit farther than where
you're going

140
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,559
I don't recommend it, granny

141
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,223
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead

142
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,290
Thank you

143
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,206
Going to the Folding Valley,
at this hour?

144
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,779
Says her youngest sister's there

145
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,809
I've hardly made any progress at all

146
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,913
Thank goodness I've still got my teeth

147
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,464
That'll make a good cane

148
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,590
Up we go

149
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,113
Might be a bit too thick

150
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,379
Ouch, ouch

151
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,771
What a stubborn branch

152
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,495
Never underestimate
Grandma Sophie

153
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,454
Heave

154
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:08,154
A scarecrow, eh?! thought you were
working for the Witch

155
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,611
But how do you stand by yourself?

156
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,353
Your head's a turnip

157
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,936
I've always hated turnips

158
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,730
At least you're not
upside down anymore

159
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,676
So long

160
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,641
It's so cold

161
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,387
The town's still so close

162
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,208
Don't follow me
You don't owe me a thing

163
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,886
You must be a magical whatever-you-are

164
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,762
I've had enough of witches and spells!

165
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,168
Just go stand wherever you like!

166
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,589
This is a perfect cane
Thank you kindly

167
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,886
While you're at it, could you bring me
a house to sleep in?

168
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,918
Seems you get more cunning with age

169
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,775
What a huge battleship

170
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,329
I never realized how weak you feel
when you get old

171
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:18,043
I smell smoke
Maybe there's a cabin

172
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,617
Turnip-head, isn't that Howl's Castle?

173
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,667
This is hardly what I meant
when I asked for shelter!

174
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,338
What is this?

175
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,947
You call this a castle?

176
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,165
Is that the way in?

177
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,029
Just wait up there

178
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,866
Hey, there!

179
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,799
Are you going to let me on, or not!

180
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,256
My shawl!

181
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,808
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip
I'm going in

182
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,382
Thank you

183
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,110
Even Howl wouldn't want
an ancient heart like mine

184
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,889
This time, it's really goodbye

185
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,754
You may be a turnip,
but you're a good turnip

186
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,958
May you find happiness

187
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,157
What is this place?
Just looks like a dilapidated heap

188
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:15,407
Well. one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore

189
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,511
That's some spell you're under

190
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,400
It won't be easy to break

191
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,622
The fire talked

192
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,097
And you can't even
tell anyone about it

193
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,193
You're Howl?

194
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:43,508
Wrong. I'm the fire demon, Calcifer!

195
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:48,275
Well. then, Calcifer, can you break
the spell I'm under?

196
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,371
Easy

197
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,829
If you break the spell that chains me
to this place,

198
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,495
I'll break your spell in a flash

199
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,015
In other words, bargain with a demon

200
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,631
You sure you can keep that promise?

201
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,303
Demons don't make promises

202
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,488
I suggest you look elsewhere

203
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,793
But I'm an exploited demon

204
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,262
I'm chained here by a contract with Howl,
who works me to death

205
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,463
I'm the one who keeps
this castle moving

206
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:20,099
My, you've got it rough

207
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,606
If you figure out the secret contract.
the spell will break

208
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,731
If you do that,
I'll break your spell, too

209
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:32,147
All right
A bargain, eh?

210
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,157
Granny

211
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,625
Granny

212
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,274
Boy...
I've got my doubts about her

213
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,187
Hey, who's this?

214
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,919
Porthaven!

215
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,224
When did she get in?

216
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,756
Stand by

217
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,699
Why. Mayor. sir

218
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,517
The sun is already high
Is Master Jenkins at home?

219
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,015
The Master is out

220
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,687
l answer in his stead

221
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,080
An invitation from His Majesty

222
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,690
It has come to war

223
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,408
His Majesty desires every wizard

224
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,404
and magician, even the witches,
to aid our homeland

225
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,790
His presence is imperative
That is all

226
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,283
War. how awful

227
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,116
And who might you be?

228
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,488
Calcifer let me in

229
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,707
Don't look at me
She wandered in from the Wastes

230
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,467
The Wastes?

231
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,612
That's strange
You're not a witch, are you?

232
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,649
A witch could never get in

233
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,122
Porthaven, again

234
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,451
A customer?

235
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:53,988
Stand by

236
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,392
State your purpose

237
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,187
Mama sent me

238
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,199
The usual spell?

239
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,737
Behave yourself, now

240
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,216
It's not the Wastes

241
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:28,011
Granny, are you a witch, too?

242
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,647
That's right,
I'm the scariest witch in the land

243
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,875
Sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it

244
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,355
Sure

245
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,235
Many thanks

246
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,462
l can't have you making up things

247
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,514
You should give up that disguise

248
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,426
It's not a disguise, it's magic

249
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,128
The Kingsbury door

250
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:56,921
Stand by

251
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,958
Is this the residence of
Wizard Pendragon?

252
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,387
It is, indeed

253
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,442
l bear an invitation
from His Majesty

254
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:13,885
Please inform Master Pendragon
that he is required at the Palace

255
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,040
Our thanks to you

256
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,230
A city fit for a king

257
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,060
Get back in or you'll lose your nose

258
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,518
Stop wandering around

259
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,556
That's enough!
I'm going to get really mad

260
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,720
This is a magic house, isn't it?

261
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,899
Oh, boy!

262
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,953
Where does the black one lead?

263
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,545
Only Master Howl knows

264
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,437
I'm having my breakfast

265
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,076
But you've got bacon and eggs

266
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,046
We can't use the fire
when Master Howl's away

267
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,639
I'll cook for you

268
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,210
But you can't

269
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,402
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl

270
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,319
That's right. l won't cook for you

271
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:06,269
Oh, here's my hat

272
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,405
All right, Calcifer
Be a good fire, now

273
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,045
Forget it, I'm a demon

274
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,766
l answer to no one

275
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,280
You'll do as I say,
or I'll pour water on you

276
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,377
Or would you rather ! told Howl
about our bargain?

277
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,484
Hey! Hey!
I never should've let this old lady in

278
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,825
So, what'll it be?

279
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:38,164
That's right, there's a good fire

280
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,126
Hey! Hey!
I'll burn the bacon

281
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,722
Calcifer's doing what she says

282
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,491
I'd like some tea, too
Have you got a kettle?

283
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:49,976
Sure

284
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,178
Welcome home, Master Howl

285
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,413
You have letters from the king

286
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,175
To Jenkins and to Pendragon

287
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,749
Calcifer, you're so obedient

288
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,919
She bullied me

289
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:25,078
Not an easy thing to do

290
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,187
Who exactly are you?

291
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,136
I'm Grandma Sophie

292
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,029
You see, I'm your
new cleaning lady

293
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,889
Give me that

294
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,791
Pass me two more bacon slices
and six more eggs

295
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,557
Yummy

296
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,805
Yummy

297
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,880
And who hired you to clean?

298
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,237
Why, I hired myself

299
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,719
I've never seen such a filthy house

300
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,592
Hmm

301
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,560
Markl, plates

302
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,472
You're all ganging up on me

303
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,421
Please join us, Sophie

304
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,565
Sit over here

305
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,455
Pick one

306
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,833
Everything else is dirty

307
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,835
I've got my work cut out for me

308
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,249
Markl

309
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:06,364
Yes

310
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,060
Sophie

311
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,531
Thank you

312
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,424
Brethren, let us partake
of our daily bread

313
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,740
Our daily bread

314
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,164
Haven't had a real breakfast
in a long while

315
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,800
So many manners to teach...

316
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,651
So, what's that in your pocket?

317
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,119
What?

318
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:44,628
l wonder what it is

319
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,129
Let me

320
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,793
It's scorched into the table
Master Howl, this is...

321
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,447
Ancient sorcery

322
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,979
And powerful, too

323
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:00,808
The Witch of the Waste?

324
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:05,297
“He who catches a falling star.
oh heartless man”

325
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,877
“Your heart shall be mine...”

326
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,550
Well, so much for the table

327
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:25,192
Wow, it's gone!

328
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,700
The scorch mark has vanished.
but not the spell

329
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,887
Brethren, continue your meal

330
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,141
Calcifer, move the castle
100 kilometers

331
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,772
And send hot water to the bath

332
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,118
Not that, too!

333
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,881
Do you work for the
Witch of the Waste?

334
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:54,004
Don't be stupid! The witch...

335
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:01,446
Actually...
the witch... I...

336
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,851
Confound it!

337
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,667
Damn that Witch of the Waste
Wait ‘till get my hands on her!

338
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,964
Let me finish eating this

339
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,457
Bugs, you'd better scurry away
or I'll sweep you out

340
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,166
Every last one of you. mocking me

341
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,145
There's a spell] need

342
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:33,467
Later

343
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,581
A witch rages within

344
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,714
Sophie

345
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,637
Sophie, I'm going out

346
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,881
I'll die without some fresh wood

347
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,404
What, what are you doing?

348
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,893
I'll fall, Vl fall
I'm in peril

349
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,327
I'm sweeping the ashes

350
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,539
Won't be a minute

351
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,473
Oh, no
Oh, no

352
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,328
I'm in danger

353
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:07,895
I'm in danger...

354
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,496
I'll go out

355
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,344
Oh, no
I'm slipping...

356
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,696
Hurry. Sophie

357
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,781
Try not to torment my friend

358
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,406
Master Howl, are you going out?

359
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:03,104
Markl, tell our cleaning lady
not to get too carried away

360
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,113
What'd you do, Sophie?

361
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,642
She abused me

362
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,801
If I die, Howl goes with me

363
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,557
I'm the cleaning lady

364
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,839
It's my job to clean

365
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,828
No, not the 2nd floor!

366
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,286
If were you, I'd put your
precious things away in a hurry

367
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,467
Save my room for later

368
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,638
My little outburst gave me back
my strength

369
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,625
What a strange house

370
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,851
Amazing!

371
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,136
Calcifer, Calcifer!

372
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,384
Are you moving the castle?

373
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,970
What a lot of fuss! Of course I am

374
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,726
You're incredible, Calcifer

375
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,075
Your magic's first class
I misjudged you completely

376
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,431
You think so?

377
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,538
You really think so!

378
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,947
Oh, no, not yet!

379
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,745
How beautiful

380
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,942
It's called Star Lake

381
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,917
Something's stuck in there

382
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,359
Oh, dear
Lend me a hand, Markl

383
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:34,741
Sure

384
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,072
And up!

385
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,667
A scarecrow

386
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,692
He's called Turnip, the Turnip-head

387
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,651
You sure like being upside down

388
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,026
The odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me

389
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,111
He followed me here

390
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,437
Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

391
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:08,035
That's right, I'm the cleanest witch
in the land

392
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,235
Turnip, don't pull it so tight

393
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,944
Seems like he likes doing the wash

394
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,383
They'll dry in no time

395
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,181
Turnip must belong to the demons

396
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:01,060
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him

397
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,002
You're right,
maybe he's a demon of the dead

398
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,703
But he led me
to this wonderful place

399
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,949
I've put away all the laundry, Sophie

400
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:57,479
Why, thank you
We'd better be getting back

401
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,799
How mysterious

402
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,151
I've never felt such peace

403
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,296
Stinks

404
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,988
You reek of burnt flesh and steel

405
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,689
Keep flying and one day you
won't be able to change yourself back

406
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,858
Isn't it great! Sophie did this for me

407
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,927
The fighting is fierce

408
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,502
The country's ablaze, from the
southern coast to the northern border

409
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,479
Il hate the fire in gunpowder

410
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,229
They have no manners

411
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,986
My own kind attacked me

412
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,554
The Witch of the Waste?

413
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,872
Hack wizards masquerading
as monsters

414
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,500
They'll cry plenty later on,

415
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,873
when they can't regain human form

416
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,422
No. they'll just forget
they ever knew how to cry

417
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,252
Aren't you supposed to report
to the king yourself?

418
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,851
Yes, well...

419
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,486
Hot water for my bath

420
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,395
Oh, no, not again

421
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:09,732
Is that Howl?

422
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,007
Yeah, wasting my hot water again

423
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,205
I'm sure Howl won't eat any breakfast

424
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:21,531
No matter

425
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,166
Morning

426
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,187
It's lovely shopping in the morning

427
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,209
I've never seen the ocean

428
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,915
Such beautiful, sparkling water

429
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:35,024
Same as it always is

430
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,259
I myself hate potatoes

431
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:47,580
Pay up

432
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,055
Thank you

433
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:50,347
Thanks

434
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,520
Fish, all fresh off the boat

435
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,036
That one's tasty

436
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,437
I myself hate fish

437
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,843
The fleet's come home

438
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,075
Is that the smoke?

439
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,916
There's been another battle

440
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,005
Really? Sorry. lady, later

441
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:07,774
That ship's on fire!

442
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,065
Sophie. let's go get a closer look

443
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:36,094
No, I've no stomach for such things
Let's go home

444
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,551
Our most advanced battleship.
reduced to this

445
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:46,511
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby

446
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,328
Don't move

447
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,589
They work for the Witch of the Waste

448
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:57,781
They're gone

449
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,079
Don't people notice
those terrible monsters?

450
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,750
Look! Up there!

451
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:09,729
That's what dropped those bombs!

452
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,791
An enemy airship, Sophie

453
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,585
Sophie, flyers

454
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:22,781
lgnore the flyers
They're enemy propaganda!

455
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:29,392
Are you OK, Sophie?

456
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,483
A glass of water, please

457
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:38,732
Sure

458
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,174
Sophie, what did you do
to the bathroom shelves? Look!

459
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,359
My hair's turned this weird color!

460
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,330
What... what beautiful hair

461
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,620
Take a good look!

462
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,978
You mixed up everything on
the shelves and ruined the spells

463
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,836
I didn't mix up anything,
I simply cleaned up

464
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:12,904
Cleaning, always cleaning

465
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:16,394
I told you not to get
too carried away

466
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,204
It's hopeless

467
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:21,687
How huniliating

468
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,084
It's not so very bad

469
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,731
This new shade's quite lovely
in its way

470
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:40,534
I'm done for. What's the point
in living, if you aren't beautiful...

471
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,153
Stop, Howl! Cut it out!

472
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,620
He's calling on
the spirits of Darkness

473
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,638
He did this last time
a girl ditched him

474
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,162
Please, Howl, that’s enough

475
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,964
You can just dye your hair again

476
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,951
I've had enough of you. Howl!

477
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:26,004
I've never once been beautiful!

478
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,725
I've had enough of this place!

479
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:12,627
Thank you, Turnip
You're a kind scarecrow

480
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:15,737
Please come back. Sophie
Howl's in trouble!

481
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,287
Cut it out, Howl
I'm going out

482
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,888
Sophie!

483
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,370
Get over here

484
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:27,821
My, he's dramatic

485
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,152
Is he dead?

486
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:32,187
Don't worry
A tantrum never killed anyone

487
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,165
Help me, Markl

488
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,606
Get that hot water running. Markl

489
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,685
C'mon, you can still walk

490
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,129
You look after him now. Markl

491
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:58,457
Sure

492
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,910
I'll have to clean all over again

493
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,759
I'm coming in

494
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,592
Here's some hot milk
Drink up

495
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,451
I'll leave it here
Drink it while it's hot

496
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:50,196
Don't leave me, Sophie

497
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,889
Try a little milk?

498
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,927
The Witch of the Waste
is searching for my house

499
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,618
You're right, 1 saw her cronies
down at the port

500
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,968
The truth is, I'm a coward

501
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:24,545
All this junk is just sorcery
to keep her away

502
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:26,578
I'm scared to death

503
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:31,388
Tell me, why is
the Witch of the Waste after you?

504
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:36,193
She seemed quite interesting,
so l approached her

505
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,870
But she terrified me
and l ran away

506
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,120
Now the king's ordered
me to report to him

507
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,830
As Jenkins and as Pendragon...

508
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,416
How many names do you use, Howl?

509
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,955
Enough to guarantee my freedom

510
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,566
Can't you refuse the king?

511
00:50:57,955 --> 00:50:59,005
See that...

512
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:03,393
The oath ! took at
the Sorcery Academy

513
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,443
Say. Howl
Why not visit the king?

514
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,299
What!

515
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,508
Just say it to his face

516
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:16,173
“Stop this foolish war
lrefuse ta help you"

517
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,199
Sophie, you don't know
what they're like

518
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:26,556
But he's the king, right? A king thinks
only of what's best for his people

519
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:28,865
l know!

520
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,149
You'll go in my place, Sophie!

521
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,704
Pretend you're Pendragon's mother

522
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,060
Just tell him your son is
an idle good-for-nothing

523
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,170
Maybe Madam Suliman
will even give up on me

524
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:44,607
Madam Suliman?

525
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:49,752
You're wearing that hat?

526
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:52,224
After all the magic 1 spent
making your dress pretty...

527
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,480
Off leo

528
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:54,731
Sure

529
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,815
See you later!

530
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:07,379
This charm
assures your safe return

531
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,207
Don't worry. I'll follow you in disguise

532
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,173
There
Off you go!

533
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,843
I'm sure this will never work

534
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:36,941
I don't suppose he's following me,
disguised as a crow

535
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,283
I'm sure Howl would pick
a more dramatic disguise

536
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,053
Not that...

537
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,249
The Palace is so far away

538
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:53,077
Howl?
Don't tell me you're Howl

539
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:01,654
Disguising yourself as an old dog.
of all things

540
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,359
Do you know how exhausting
it is to be old?

541
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:10,625
How nice to see you
The little hatter, right?

542
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,810
The Witch of the Waste!

543
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:15,777
Thank you so much for
delivering my note to Howl

544
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,352
How's Howl doing?

545
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,508
Quite terrified

546
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,666
Thanks to him,
I've become a cleaning lady

547
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,741
My how delightful

548
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,793
By the way. what brings you
to see the king?

549
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:36,343
Job hunting
I'm sick of working for Howl

550
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:37,834
And yourself?

551
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,919
The king invited me

552
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:45,418
It seems that idiot. Suliman,
finally needs my power

553
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:49,216
Why don't you break the spell
you put on me

554
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:51,387
That's impossible

555
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:55,228
My gifts lie in casting spells,
not breaking them

556
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:57,996
See you later, then

557
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,732
Hey, wait a minute
dust wait!

558
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,710
If you weren't here,
I'd have hit her with my cane

559
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,354
What's wrong with you?

560
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:28,596
Madam, vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point

561
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:30,526
Please continue on foot

562
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,485
That Suliman

563
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:36,243
Using magic to force me
to climb these stairs

564
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:49,798
We'll catch up
Pay her no mind

565
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:17,932
Heavy. why are you so heavy?

566
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,647
You... Hey... Wait

567
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,649
What is it?

568
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:37,614
Suddenly remembered...
how to break my spell?

569
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,478
I told you...

570
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,002
I don't know how

571
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:45,037
Then, start studying up

572
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,843
I don't get it

573
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,019
Where does she get all that energy?

574
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,287
I have to put you down

575
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:15,202
Why don't you call it a day?
You can't make it

576
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:20,576
It's been 50 years now,
since they drove me out of here...

577
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:25,718
I've been longing for this day...
Ever since

578
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,026
Good luck to you. then

579
00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:31,154
Still. I'm not nice enough
to help you out

580
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:33,519
Come, Howl

581
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,668
You heartless wench

582
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,360
Next time I'll turn you feeble, too

583
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,450
Hurry up!

584
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,473
Madam, follow me

585
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:08,706
First. you should help her

586
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:11,816
We are forbidden to assist anyone

587
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,102
But the king himself invited her

588
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,702
Hang in there!

589
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:20,342
Just a little farther

590
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:23,475
And you call yourself a witch?

591
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,612
Who asked you?

592
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:31,136
You suddenly look older

593
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:35,286
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

594
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,547
Pull yourself together

595
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,959
Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

596
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:47,381
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

597
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,521
Pendragon...
That name sounds familiar

598
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:55,288
Of course it does
That was the name of my hat shop

599
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:56,792
It was?

600
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,047
Please wait here

601
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:06,729
A chair!

602
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:08,637
It's mine!

603
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,467
Howl, get back here

604
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,297
Madam, this way please

605
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,736
l understand you're Howl's mother

606
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,741
Yes
My name is Pendragon

607
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:40,712
I'm sure you're weary
Please have a seat

608
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:42,495
Yes

609
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:55,556
lam Madam Suliman, His Majesty's witch

610
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,355
Um, that dog is...

611
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:05,517
Ah. you mean Heen?

612
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,925
He does my errands
l asked him to escort you

613
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:15,593
Howl won't join us, then?

614
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:20,084
You see, he sends his mother
to make excuses

615
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:23,033
I'm sure he'd be utterly useless
to His Majesty

616
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,834
What a shame

617
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:30,064
He was my last apprentice...

618
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:34,231
A student of such marvelous gifts

619
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:38,304
I rejoiced in finally finding
a worthy heir

620
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,926
But then, a demon stole his heart,

621
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,334
and he abandoned me

622
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,453
He turned his magic
to purely selfish uses

623
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,466
Mrs. Pendragon

624
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,641
That boy is dangerous

625
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,640
His power is too great
for one with no heart

626
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:06,069
If he follows that path he'll wind up
like the Witch of the Waste

627
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,300
Bring her

628
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:15,426
What happened?

629
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,364
I just restored her to her real age

630
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,357
All her powers are gone

631
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,579
Once upon a time,
she was a magnificent witch

632
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,947
She made a bargain with a demon

633
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,280
who consumed her, body and soul,
long, long ago

634
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,214
Our kingdom can no longer afford
to turn a blind eve

635
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,564
to disreputable wizards and witches

636
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,912
If Howl comes here
to serve the kingdom,

637
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,976
I will teach him how to break
with the demon

638
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:50,130
If not. I'll strip him of his powers
as l have taken hers

639
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,668
Now just a minute

640
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:57,064
Now [ understand why Howl
refused to come here

641
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,264
Something's not right

642
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:03,352
Forcing your aged guests to climb
stairs. dragging them into strange rooms

643
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,150
It's like a trap

644
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,412
You call Howl heartless!

645
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:11,561
Yes, he's selfish and cowardly
and unpredictable

646
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,968
But he's straight as an arrow
He only wants to be free

647
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,225
Howl won't turn into an evil monster

648
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:21,091
He'll battle the demon on his own

649
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,141
I believe in him

650
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:26,303
Mrs. Pendragon...
You're in love with Howl

651
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:30,163
Howl...
Howl's coming?

652
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:33,554
l want Howl's heart, ! want it

653
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:37,234
That's enough from you
Howl's not coming

654
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,062
Howl will most certainly come

655
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,535
Now, I've found his weakness

656
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:52,524
Your Majesty

657
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,162
As you are

658
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:55,804
How are you feeling?

659
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,239
Thank you for asking

660
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,490
Meetings bore me
flew out for a breather

661
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:02,621
How lovely

662
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,308
These are?

663
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,854
This is Wizard Howl's mother

664
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,442
I see

665
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:16,495
l appreciate it. but] don't intend
to win any war with magic

666
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:21,703
It's true that Suliman's powers
shield our palace from bombs

667
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,609
But they just fall on neighboring towns

668
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,308
That's how magic works
Right, Suliman?

669
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:29,631
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty

670
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:31,423
Suliman!

671
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:38,051
This is the final battle
This time, we'll beat them to a pulp

672
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:45,171
Suliman, you've outdone yourself
with that double. Await good news

673
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:46,922
Thank you kindly

674
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,397
Have my generals assembled?

675
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,113
It's been awhile, Howl

676
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,459
Delighted to see you doing so well

677
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,698
l saw right through you

678
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,703
I've kept my oath

679
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,503
I've no wish to fight you

680
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,292
I'll take my mother

681
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:09,214
won't let you go

682
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,767
Don't look down,
you'll be dragged down

683
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:37,030
It's time 1 showed your mother
what you really are

684
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:33,338
Howl, don't! It's a trap

685
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:47,758
Hold tight

686
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:57,202
Sophie. sit up front

687
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:02,595
Oh, no. Sophie,
you brought the whole gang along

688
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:05,527
Nice doggie

689
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:09,039
You're just Suliman's spy

690
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,895
Oh, well, too late to toss you now

691
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,668
Sophie. you steer

692
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,103
What! I can't possibly!

693
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:17,839
They're after us

694
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,939
I'll tackle them. Fly straight
to the castle in the Wastes

695
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,052
What! That's impossible!

696
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,098
Don't worry, the ring will guide you

697
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:33,571
Summon Calcifer with your heart

698
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,319
Summon Calcifer?

699
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:39,815
It's glowing

700
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,967
Follow the light
You'll be there by nightfall

701
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,530
Why send me to Suliman
if you were coming yourself?

702
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,234
Your presence gave me
the courage for it

703
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,772
She's too terrible to
face on my own

704
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:57,180
You've saved me
l was in grave danger back there

705
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:01,016
Don't let go!

706
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,307
- You're good
- Stop joking!

707
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:13,477
We've got a lead now

708
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:16,517
l can give you 5 minutes of invisibility,
now's your chance

709
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,690
Howl!

710
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:35,719
No, thank you

711
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:39,448
Thank you. That's the most fun
I've had in ages

712
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,946
I supposed Howl thinks
he's escaped...

713
01:08:43,685 --> 01:08:46,055
His mother's awfully young

714
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,229
We're not far
That's my hometown

715
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,992
Don't look so friendly
I don't trust you

716
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,135
The castle
They've come to meet us

717
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:19,103
Sophie!

718
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,176
Markl, help!

719
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:23,154
don't know how to stop this thing!

720
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,058
Sophie!

721
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:39,474
Doggie

722
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:42,541
Markl

723
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:44,809
I'm home

724
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,987
Sophie, are you hurt?

725
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:49,194
You're home!

726
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,992
Thank you for coming to meet us

727
01:11:21,911 --> 01:11:25,071
Oh, no, you've gone too far

728
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,950
l wonder if Howl's back

729
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:41,743
Howl?

730
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,910
Howl? Is it you?

731
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,258
Are you hurt? In pain?

732
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,260
Stay away

733
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:56,477
l want to help you

734
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:58,582
I want to break the spell you're under

735
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:02,932
You can't even break your own spell

736
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,572
But I love you!

737
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:07,812
Too late

738
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:13,318
Howl!

739
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,059
Howl must be back

740
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:32,313
Sophie. you'd better figure out
how to break my spell quick

741
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:35,206
We're both running out of time

742
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:38,071
Meaning Howl will turn into
a monster? Is it true?

743
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,637
l can't tell you that
I'm a demon

744
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:45,933
Calcifer, Suliman told me,

745
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,945
Howl has given you
something very precious

746
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,088
What is it?
Where is it?

747
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,910
That's confidential information

748
01:14:54,357 --> 01:14:56,577
And if ] threaten
to dump water over you?

749
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,393
How dare you!
Howl will die with me

750
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:20,955
Good morning. Turnip

751
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,351
We've got to be brave

752
01:15:26,489 --> 01:15:28,358
Ready. Sophie!

753
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:31,721
OK! Open wider, Calcifer

754
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:35,972
Here goes! Push!

755
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:37,895
Heave!

756
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:50,135
I... said... move!

757
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,110
Come on!

758
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:17,530
They call it a castle, but once
you get inside, it's a junk heap

759
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:22,326
It's time to eat!

760
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,378
Here, old girl

761
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:34,257
But. Sophie
she's the Witch of the Waste

762
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,067
No need to worry

763
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,228
Why's she staring at me?

764
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,777
Such a pretty fire

765
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:44,816
Howl

766
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:46,023
Hello, everyone

767
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,138
Welcome home

768
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,268
Master Howl,
can we keep this puppy?

769
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:52,749
An old Witch and
Madam Suliman's dog

770
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:55,259
Why'd you let them in, Calcifer?

771
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:59,358
Don't look at me!
They blew in with Sophie

772
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:04,265
Sophie. always dramatic...

773
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,110
So you're Turnip

774
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,718
You're under quite a spell, too

775
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,815
Seems everyone in our little family
is complicated...

776
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:17,127
He's so handsome

777
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:20,693
This is a busy day
We're moving

778
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:22,157
Moving?

779
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:25,181
Oh, good. There aren't any shops,
here in the middle of nowhere

780
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:29,035
Madam Suliman can track us down
in no time, here

781
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:33,342
But you'll have to stay behind
The magic in your spell's too risky

782
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:41,321
All right, that's done

783
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:44,051
Take it away. Calcifer

784
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:00,764
Excellent

785
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,476
Stay right where you are

786
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,781
Be gentle...

787
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,540
Here goes

788
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,621
We've moved
You can get up now

789
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:04,131
Amazing, Master
It's so grand

790
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:07,317
What a pretty fire

791
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,000
This is...

792
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:26,362
l added a bathroom
For our growing family

793
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:30,165
Sophie, come here!
Sophie!

794
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:36,092
l added a bedroom, too
Go in

795
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,469
This is... why?

796
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:51,731
I thought it would suit you
Do you like it?

797
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:56,485
Yes, it's perfect
for a housekeeper

798
01:19:57,026 --> 01:19:59,635
I got you new clothes, too
Open them later. Next

799
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:03,233
Sophie! Come here!
Quick!

800
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:05,723
A courtyard!

801
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,311
There's a shop, too

802
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,630
Let's go, Heen!

803
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:13,316
See that new color on the dial?
There's a new exit

804
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:19,501
My gift to you. Sophie
Step outside

805
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,920
It's my secret garden

806
01:20:47,743 --> 01:20:49,113
Beautiful

807
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,633
Did you make it with your magic?

808
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:56,769
Only a little, to help the flowers

809
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,448
Thank you, Howl!

810
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,204
It's like I'm dreaming

811
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:34,434
Sophie

812
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:39,968
How mysterious
I feel I've been here before

813
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:42,358
l could cry with happiness

814
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:43,885
Come

815
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:53,331
Look

816
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,257
A sweet little house

817
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:02,249
My favorite hideaway

818
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:06,335
When I was little I spent
my summers there alone

819
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:09,583
Alone?

820
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:13,602
My Uncle, the Wizard,
left it to me in secret

821
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:16,585
Make yourself at home there, Sophie

822
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:21,635
What's wrong?

823
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:23,368
I'm scared

824
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,264
I'm afraid you'll go off and disappear
somewhere, once I'm inside

825
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,338
Howl, tell me the truth

826
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:34,293
I don't mind if you're a monster

827
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,445
l want to make sure that
you'll all live comfortably

828
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:47,883
Why not a flower shop,
with all these flowers?

829
01:22:48,664 --> 01:22:50,744
You'd be good at it. Sophie

830
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:53,106
And then. you'd go away?

831
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:57,864
Il want to help you, Howl

832
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:01,943
I'm not beautiful
and I'm only good at cleaning...

833
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,121
Sophie, you are beautiful

834
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:12,768
The good thing about being old
is that you've so little to lose...

835
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,475
Why's that flying here?

836
01:23:28,804 --> 01:23:29,564
A battleship?

837
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,141
On its way to burn cities and people

838
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:32,823
The enemy's? Ours?

839
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:34,825
What difference does it make?

840
01:23:47,623 --> 01:23:48,702
Murderers

841
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:58,855
Look at all those bombs

842
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:16,297
It stopped

843
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,951
Did you do that?

844
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:20,532
I'm just tinkering
It won't crash

845
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:25,119
Howl!

846
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,677
Oops, looks like they're onto us

847
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:40,359
Madam Suliman's deputies
Let's go back

848
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:42,802
Run! Move those legs

849
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:58,339
Hurry on in!

850
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:00,264
No! Don't let go!

851
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:11,335
What happened. Sophie?

852
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,264
I've had it with this place!

853
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:25,993
Good night, Sophie

854
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:27,461
Good night

855
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:33,564
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie
Sometimes, he's gone for days on end

856
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:36,429
Thank you, Markl

857
01:25:36,932 --> 01:25:37,802
Need the toilet?

858
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:39,233
I'm fine

859
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:40,991
Good night

860
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:42,620
You're in love

861
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:48,604
Sighing away like that

862
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,242
I thought so

863
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:04,741
Were you ever in love?

864
01:26:05,127 --> 01:26:07,707
Of course ! was
I'm still in love

865
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,093
What?

866
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:12,468
Men. why ever should we want them...

867
01:26:12,968 --> 01:26:14,958
But a young man's heart is so delicious!

868
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:17,047
Unbelievable

869
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,923
And so adorable, too

870
01:26:23,612 --> 01:26:24,922
What is that?

871
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:26,383
Air raid siren

872
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:28,339
Air raid?

873
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:33,451
It's not for here
But best not go out tonight

874
01:26:35,457 --> 01:26:39,497
Suliman's creatures are searching
high and low for our house

875
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:46,564
What a good fire,
hiding us so well

876
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,480
Sophie. a stranger got in!

877
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:33,217
Mother

878
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:35,518
Sophie!

879
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:40,679
Where have you been!
l searched for you everywhere!

880
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,763
But, oh, look how you've aged!

881
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,433
It's all my fault

882
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:50,747
I'm so sorry, Sophie!

883
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:53,023
Mother...

884
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:57,687
l barely recognize the house

885
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,656
Who is that?

886
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:01,755
Oh, your landlady

887
01:28:02,144 --> 01:28:04,954
Sophie. I've got a new husband!

888
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,110
He's such a wonderful man
And he's rich, too!

889
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:09,980
We can all live together again

890
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,642
You'll never have to clean again

891
01:28:13,522 --> 01:28:16,272
But I'm happy here...

892
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,098
Really?

893
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:19,323
Oops, ! forgot

894
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:21,998
My car's waiting
I've got to run

895
01:28:26,568 --> 01:28:29,668
I'm so glad ! found you again

896
01:28:30,205 --> 01:28:32,015
We'll really catch up next time

897
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:34,364
In the meantime, you take care

898
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:43,848
A peeping-bug, eh?
The oldest trick in the book, Suliman

899
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:45,852
All yours, Cal

900
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:57,644
May you find happiness, Mother

901
01:28:58,033 --> 01:29:00,343
Thank you
You too, Sophie

902
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:07,513
I've done what I was told
Take me back to my husband

903
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,589
Yes. I'm sure Madam Suliman
will be pleased

904
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,723
Forgive me, Sophie...

905
01:29:18,954 --> 01:29:20,244
Look at all these people

906
01:29:21,056 --> 01:29:23,955
They're all running away
The town will be empty

907
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:26,449
Do you wish to run, too?

908
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:29,661
That's what that lady spoke of...

909
01:29:30,332 --> 01:29:33,292
So, she did
I'm glad we made up

910
01:29:33,969 --> 01:29:35,699
Don't go, Sophie!

911
01:29:36,905 --> 01:29:39,804
l love you. Sophie
Please stay

912
01:29:41,643 --> 01:29:44,163
Il love you, too, Markl
Don't worry. I won't go

913
01:29:44,613 --> 01:29:45,783
Really!

914
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:48,251
Are we a family?

915
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,223
Yes, we're family

916
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:52,229
Oh, good!

917
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:02,969
I'll never let Suliman
get hold of Howl

918
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,147
But the paper says we won

919
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:25,007
Only fools swallow such lies

920
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,581
How strange
l can't get Calcifer going

921
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:32,265
Grandma, will you stop that?

922
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:34,001
Such an awful stink

923
01:30:34,329 --> 01:30:36,959
Why deny an old lady her pleasures

924
01:30:37,966 --> 01:30:39,606
Open the window, Markl

925
01:30:43,672 --> 01:30:45,722
wouldn't open that now...

926
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:51,742
In Calcifer's present state.
he can't possibly keep them out

927
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,272
Markl!

928
01:31:06,161 --> 01:31:07,361
Close it quick!

929
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:16,345
Look after Grandma, Markl
I'll check on the shop

930
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:39,123
How dare you. now? If you've
energy to spare, put out the fires

931
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:04,809
Howl!

932
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,910
Dramatic as usual...

933
01:32:33,415 --> 01:32:34,175
Howl!

934
01:32:36,451 --> 01:32:38,531
I'm sorry
l had too many enemies, tonight

935
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:42,147
Howl, oh, Howl

936
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,240
Master Howl!
Sophie!

937
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:06,869
Calcifer, be strong

938
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:15,675
Madam, was that a gift
from Suliman?

939
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:19,251
That granny fed me something nasty

940
01:33:20,228 --> 01:33:22,338
Why. if it isn't Howl

941
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:26,418
I feel we need a nice long chat

942
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:30,779
Likewise, Madam
But we've no time, now

943
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,530
How unlike you
You're not running away

944
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:37,604
Until later, then

945
01:33:38,713 --> 01:33:41,433
Stay here, Sophie
Calcifer will protect you

946
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:43,586
I'll see to things outside

947
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:46,620
Wait. Howl!

948
01:33:46,888 --> 01:33:49,198
Don't go! Please stay

949
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:52,981
Another round of bombs is coming
Even Calcifer can't stop those

950
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:55,498
Let's run away
Don't fight

951
01:33:56,164 --> 01:33:58,414
I'm through running away

952
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:02,117
I've finally found someone
l want to protect...

953
01:34:02,604 --> 01:34:03,624
You

954
01:34:08,543 --> 01:34:09,442
Howl!

955
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:35,459
That's our town

956
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:41,255
There's Howl

957
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:51,735
Howl!

958
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:03,459
Sophie!
Turnip...

959
01:36:07,562 --> 01:36:09,052
Markl. come inside!

960
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:12,110
Move? You're nuts
There's nothing there

961
01:36:12,634 --> 01:36:15,564
No, as long as we stay here,
Howl will keep fighting

962
01:36:16,371 --> 01:36:17,801
He's better off a coward

963
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,476
Grandma, get up

964
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:21,147
Going for a stroll?

965
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:23,459
Suliman will find us, right away

966
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:26,968
She already has. At this rate,
Howl will never make it back alive

967
01:36:27,482 --> 01:36:28,622
Sophie!

968
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:30,053
The castle's falling apart

969
01:36:30,385 --> 01:36:32,225
That's all right
Markl, take Grandma

970
01:36:32,587 --> 01:36:33,457
Sure

971
01:36:35,857 --> 01:36:37,167
You. too, hop up now

972
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:40,915
l can't! My contract says
l can't leave the fireplace

973
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,046
If you two can't solve this.
I'll do it for you

974
01:36:44,599 --> 01:36:46,059
Watch it!

975
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:48,437
Cut it out! Cut it out!

976
01:36:49,704 --> 01:36:51,603
If l leave, the house will collapse

977
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:52,763
Fine!

978
01:36:56,744 --> 01:36:57,943
We're out

979
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,129
I'd better go last

980
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:04,322
Even I don't know what'll happen...

981
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,504
I told you, it would collapse

982
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:37,053
Rain!

983
01:37:39,821 --> 01:37:41,191
Is that heading for town?

984
01:37:41,489 --> 01:37:42,888
Look after Grandma, Markl

985
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,891
Turnip, find us a way in

986
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,269
Don't worry, Grandma
I'll take care of you

987
01:37:51,466 --> 01:37:53,396
Markl. we can get in here

988
01:38:03,411 --> 01:38:05,751
The roof's leaking
I'll go out

989
01:38:06,581 --> 01:38:07,721
Wait here

990
01:38:07,982 --> 01:38:10,032
It's wet, here...

991
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,197
Hurry

992
01:38:19,527 --> 01:38:20,957
Too damp

993
01:38:24,799 --> 01:38:26,379
Bring Grandma here, Markl

994
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:28,514
The castle's empty

995
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:32,196
Il told you. if we'd stayed put,
Howl and ! could've handled it

996
01:38:34,776 --> 01:38:37,146
Calcifer, please
You're my last hope

997
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:40,509
l want to go to Howl
Move the castle

998
01:38:41,983 --> 01:38:45,113
I know you can do it
You're so strong

999
01:38:45,987 --> 01:38:48,887
But there's no chimney here...

1000
01:38:49,524 --> 01:38:50,754
And the wood's damp...

1001
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:55,402
As the saying goes, “The best
blaze brightest in adversity”

1002
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:58,460
I've heard that, but...

1003
01:38:58,900 --> 01:38:59,950
You really think so?

1004
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:01,901
You're so pretty, Cal

1005
01:39:02,236 --> 01:39:03,346
Sit here, Grandma

1006
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:06,281
Then, give me something of yours,
Sophie

1007
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:07,661
Of mine?

1008
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:10,095
l can't do it alone
How about your eyes?

1009
01:39:10,511 --> 01:39:11,531
My eyes?

1010
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,086
This?

1011
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:21,119
Amazing, Calcifer!
You are the best!

1012
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:24,449
Imagine what I could do with
your eyes and your heart

1013
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:27,562
Heart! You have a heart?

1014
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:32,221
Oh, my!

1015
01:40:44,839 --> 01:40:47,009
There's Howl
He's trapped

1016
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,200
Hurry, Calcifer!

1017
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,359
Don't!

1018
01:40:57,318 --> 01:40:58,188
Grandma!

1019
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,060
Stop it!

1020
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,785
Howl's heart

1021
01:41:04,292 --> 01:41:06,162
Cut it out!

1022
01:41:15,102 --> 01:41:15,972
Grandma!

1023
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:19,952
It's hot, hot!

1024
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:21,811
Let go!

1025
01:41:22,443 --> 01:41:23,813
You'll die, Grandma

1026
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:26,010
No, it's mine!

1027
01:41:44,532 --> 01:41:45,872
Sophie!

1028
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:50,880
Sophie!

1029
01:41:51,739 --> 01:41:54,669
She's so mean
That's mine

1030
01:42:38,386 --> 01:42:41,546
Oh, no. Heen. look what I've done
l poured water on Calcifer

1031
01:42:45,026 --> 01:42:47,516
What if I've killed Howl, too...

1032
01:43:14,388 --> 01:43:16,758
It's moving...
Is Howl alive?

1033
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:18,861
Show me where he is

1034
01:43:40,848 --> 01:43:42,218
The castle door...

1035
01:45:00,694 --> 01:45:01,564
Heen...

1036
01:45:37,264 --> 01:45:38,084
Howl...

1037
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:59,101
This must be Howl's childhood...

1038
01:47:18,499 --> 01:47:20,108
Howl!
Calcifer!

1039
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:25,505
It's Sophie! Wait for me!
I promise I'll come back for you

1040
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:29,191
Wait for me in the future!

1041
01:48:02,543 --> 01:48:05,093
I'll walk there
Heen, I'll walk

1042
01:48:05,846 --> 01:48:07,276
Il can't stop crying

1043
01:48:31,905 --> 01:48:33,105
Howl

1044
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:42,360
I'm sorry ] took so long

1045
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:45,320
You've been waiting all this time

1046
01:48:50,224 --> 01:48:52,564
Take me to Calcifer

1047
01:49:55,823 --> 01:49:56,723
Is he dead?

1048
01:49:56,957 --> 01:49:58,567
No, he's fine

1049
01:50:03,197 --> 01:50:04,367
Grandma...

1050
01:50:04,631 --> 01:50:07,821
Don't look at me
I don't have anything

1051
01:50:08,669 --> 01:50:09,539
Please

1052
01:50:12,072 --> 01:50:13,362
Grandma

1053
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:18,560
You want it that badly?

1054
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:19,999
Yes

1055
01:50:21,048 --> 01:50:24,617
Oh, well, in that case...
You'd better take good care of it

1056
01:50:25,586 --> 01:50:26,816
There

1057
01:50:28,222 --> 01:50:30,242
Thank you, Grandma

1058
01:50:46,607 --> 01:50:47,837
Calcifer

1059
01:50:49,209 --> 01:50:51,608
Sophie. ..
I'm all worn out

1060
01:50:52,045 --> 01:50:55,035
If l give Howl's heart back,
will it kill you?

1061
01:50:55,549 --> 01:50:57,769
Probably not, if you do it, Sophie

1062
01:50:58,819 --> 01:51:02,509
After all. we both survived
the water you dumped on me

1063
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:04,433
I'd better try, then

1064
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:10,894
It's all warm and fluttery
like a little bird

1065
01:51:11,398 --> 01:51:13,328
It's still only a child's heart

1066
01:51:14,568 --> 01:51:17,228
May Calcifer live a thousand years,

1067
01:51:17,704 --> 01:51:20,393
and may Howl recover his heart...

1068
01:51:32,586 --> 01:51:33,456
I'm alive!

1069
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:35,087
I'm free!

1070
01:51:41,828 --> 01:51:43,528
He moved, he's alive!

1071
01:51:48,235 --> 01:51:49,844
You broke Calcifer's spell!

1072
01:52:04,985 --> 01:52:05,804
Turnip!

1073
01:52:18,999 --> 01:52:20,228
Turnip, are you OK?

1074
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,230
I'll get you a new stick, right away

1075
01:52:25,105 --> 01:52:26,855
Thank you, Turnip

1076
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:36,452
Thank you, Sophie

1077
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:39,681
I'm a prince from the next kingdom

1078
01:52:40,053 --> 01:52:42,013
A cruel spell turned me
into a scarecrow

1079
01:52:42,522 --> 01:52:45,758
“beyond these tears”
A spell that only your beloved's
kiss could break

1080
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:45,858
“beyond these tears”

1081
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:48,894
“beyond these tears”
Exactly. And if Sophie hadn't saved me,
l would have died

1082
01:52:48,895 --> 01:52:50,325
Exactly. And if Sophie hadn't saved me,
l would have died

1083
01:52:50,831 --> 01:52:53,199
“my flickering smile”
My, you're good-looking

1084
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:53,299
“my flickering smile”

1085
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:55,670
“my flickering smile”
What a racket
What's the fuss?

1086
01:52:56,937 --> 01:52:57,670
I feel terrible
Like I'm trapped under a stone

1087
01:52:57,671 --> 01:52:59,304
“holds the promise of love”
I feel terrible
Like I'm trapped under a stone

1088
01:52:59,306 --> 01:52:59,705
“holds the promise of love”

1089
01:52:59,706 --> 01:53:02,041
“holds the promise of love”
Oh, yes, a heart's a heavy burden

1090
01:53:02,042 --> 01:53:02,474
Oh, yes, a heart's a heavy burden

1091

1099
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:14,887
“even though I'm alone now”

1100
01:53:14,888 --> 01:53:17,889
“even though I'm alone now”
You'd best go home and
make them stop this war

1101
01:53:17,891 --> 01:53:18,023
You'd best go home and
make them stop this war

1102
01:53:18,025 --> 01:53:18,691
“this day is born aglow”
You'd best go home and
make them stop this war

“this day is born aglow”

1104
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:20,326
“this day is born aglow”
That's exactly what I shall do

1105
01:53:20,327 --> 01:53:20,893
“this day is born aglow”

1106
01:53:20,894 --> 01:53:23,584
“this day is born aglow”
When the war is over. I shall return

1107
01:53:24,064 --> 01:53:24,697

in this world”

1108
01:53:24,698 --> 01:53:26,565
“with the light of our yesterdays”

“with the light of our yesterdays”

1112
01:53:29,536 --> 01:53:31,237

contact me now?

“you brush past my face”

1124
01:53:58,665 --> 01:53:59,264
Well, there it is

1125

Well, there it is

1126

Bring the Prime Minister and
the Minister of Defense

1128

Let's put an end to this foolish war

1129
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:10,919
It's Calcifer!

1130
01:54:11,912 --> 01:54:13,962
You didn't have to come back
