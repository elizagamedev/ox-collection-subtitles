1
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,985
Long ago, in ancient China,

2
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,334
the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.

3
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,899
They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city

4
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,463
for they had invented fireworks.

5
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,669
But their son, Lord Shen,

6
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,165
saw darker power in the fireworks.

7
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,003
What had brought color and joy

8
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:53,322
could also bring darkness
and destruction.

9
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:57,361
Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer.

10
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:02,621
She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path,

11
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,820
he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,759
The young ford
set out fo change his fate.

13
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,623
But what he did next only sealed it.

14
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,616
Shen returned to his parents
full of pride.

15
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,884
But in their faces, he saw only horror.

16
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,616
He was banished from the city forever.

17
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,969
But Shen swore revenge.

18
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,023
Someday he would return

19
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,936
and all of China would bow at his feet.

20
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,418
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

21
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,292
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

22
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,684
China will be mine.

23
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,866
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

24
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,949
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

25
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,075
Enough talk. Let's fight!

26
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,495
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

27
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,853
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

28
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,535
Thirty-three. Stop him!

29
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:54,984
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!

30
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,358
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!

31
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,271
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!

32
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,815
How is he doing that with his face?

33
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,129
Thirty-eight bean buns!

34
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,842
Yes! New record! You monster!

35
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,344
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

36
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,724
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

37
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,153
Do it.

38
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,694
No problem!

39
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,418
Yeah!

40
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,998
Give me a minute.

41
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,667
Yeah!

42
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,773
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

43
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:34,876
Your training has paid off.

44
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,159
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

45
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,266
You'll save those for me, right?

46
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,190
Flippety-do.

47
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,378
Inner peace.

48
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,770
Inner peace.

49
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,962
Inner peace.

50
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,584
Master Shifu.

51
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,393
Master Shifu, what do we got?

52
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,371
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

53
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,435
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
‘Cause I am in a mood.

54
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,239
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

55
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,547
What are you doing?

56
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,862
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

57
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,443
Awesome!

58
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,291
How did you do that?

59
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,320
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

60
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:19,209
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

61
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:24,653
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

62
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,152
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

63
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,448
.. without the slightest taste
of food or water.

64
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:37,533
Or?

65
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,878
Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

66
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,433
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

67
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,621
was the worst day of my life.

68
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,964
By far.
Nothing else came close.

69
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,289
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

70
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,158
- OK.
-..[ have ever experienced.

71
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,031
But once I realized the problem
was not you, but within me,

72
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,619
I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

73
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,691
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

74
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,044
My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

75
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,466
so alll need to do
is just get this thing going.

76
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,776
Inner peace, you're going down.

77
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,762
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

78
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,080
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

79
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,015
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.

80
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,515
Danger.

81
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:33,253
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

82
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,974
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

83
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,859
No snack stops this time.

84
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,705
Snack stops.

85
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,621
Wait, are you serious?

86
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,192
Get all the metal you can find!

87
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,631
Grab the metal!

88
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,354
Help, help, help, help. Help!

89
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,827
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

90
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,260
Oh, no.

91
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,493
Wings of Justice!

92
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,781
The Dragon Warrior!

93
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,119
A panda? That's impossible.

94
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,238
My fist hungers for justice.

95
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,131
That was my... fist.

96
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,556
- Get ‘em!
- Come on!

97
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,239
Take that!

98
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,240
Po! Incoming!

99
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:34,222
Thanks, Mantis!

100
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,476
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

101
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,410
Feet of Fury!

102
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,102
Tigress! Monkey!

103
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,281
Viper! Mantis!

104
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,296
Bunny! What?

105
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,379
Oh, sorry.

106
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,466
Help!

107
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,462
- Crane, go!
-I'm on it!

108
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,223
Is everyone OK?

109
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,765
That was awesome!

110
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,660
I got this.

111
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,246
Po!

112
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,016
Chew on that, tubby!

113
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,521
Help.

114
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,841
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

115
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,251
I think I saw...

116
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,680
I think...

117
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,393
I gotta go.

118
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:41,503
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

119
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,858
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

120
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,640
If you need anything, just ask.

121
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,494
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

122
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,937
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

123
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,641
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

124
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,266
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

125
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,121
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

126
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,812
He doesn't work here anymore.

127
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,338
He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

128
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,245
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

129
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,506
Po!

130
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,966
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

131
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,405
- Should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

132
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,838
I would have saved you
some stinky tofu.

133
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,415
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

134
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:34,442
In honor of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

135
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,935
With purchases.

136
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,520
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

137
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,294
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

138
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,364
Ah, well, maybe a little.

139
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,109
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

140
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,143
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

141
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,852
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?

142
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,078
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

143
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,532
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

144
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,826
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

145
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,999
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

146
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,016
I had this crazy vision.

147
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,734
I think l saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

148
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,718
Mom? A baby?

149
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,978
- Dad?
- What...?

150
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,449
How do I say this?

151
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,959
Where did I come from?

152
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:34,182
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

153
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,175
- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

154
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,839
I know it's not.

155
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,923
I think it’s time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

156
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,355
OK.

157
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:54,043
You might have been kind of a...

158
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,504
..adopted.

159
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,459
- 1 knew it.
- You knew?

160
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,461
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

161
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,474
But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

162
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,656
Why didn't you say anything?

163
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,565
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

164
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,636
Actually... you came from this.

165
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,460
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

166
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,402
Time to make the noodles.

167
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,355
! went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.

168
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,450
There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.

169
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,260
Only there were no radishes.

170
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,740
Just a very hungry baby panda.

171
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,543
There was no note.

172
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,704
Of course, you could have eaten it.

173
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,520
! waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.

174
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,876
! brought you inside.

175
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,794
Fed you.

176
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,977
Gave you a bath.

177
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,921
And fed you again.

178
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,042
And again.

179
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,820
And tried to put some pants on you.

180
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,204
And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.

181
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,614
To make my soup without radishes.

182
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,887
And to raise you as my own son.

183
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,261
Xiao Po, my little panda.

184
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,819
And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life

185
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,415
have been that much sweeter.

186
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,468
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

187
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,819
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

188
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:30,309
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

189
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,720
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

190
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,151
It was imported, too.

191
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,400
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

192
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,478
Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

193
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,449
but look how it turned out.

194
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,093
You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

195
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,061
I know. I just have so many questions.

196
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,668
Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

197
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,587
Why didn't I like pants?

198
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,881
And who am I?

199
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,003
Good. Watch your form.

200
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,235
Good.

201
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,441
Better. Elbow.

202
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,701
Straighten it out!

203
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,672
Shen?

204
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,694
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

205
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,407
Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

206
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,024
- Your house?
- Yes.

207
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,648
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

208
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,796
There you are, Soothsayer.

209
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:16,825
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

210
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,079
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

211
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,991
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

212
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:28,427
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

213
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,487
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters’ Council,

214
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,323
and we will protect it. Even from you.

215
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,829
I'm so glad you feel that way.

216
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,883
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

217
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,176
What's in the box, Shen?

218
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,697
You want to see? It's a gift.

219
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,645
It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

220
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,641
Part of you here, part of you there

221
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,467
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

222
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,861
You insolent fool!

223
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,294
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

224
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,291
You are no match for our kung fu.

225
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,534
l agree.

226
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,429
But this is.

227
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,052
Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

228
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,728
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

229
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,309
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

230
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,405
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

231
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,712
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

232
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,184
That's impossible.

233
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,672
Rhino's Horn Defense
is impervious to any technique.

234
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,207
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

235
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,948
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

236
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:10,155
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

237
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,817
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

238
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,884
Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

239
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,135
OK, here we go! Here we go!

240
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,937
Wait a second.
How can I! do this?

241
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,711
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

242
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,900
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

243
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,262
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

244
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,747
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

245
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:43,878
Peace on.

246
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,963
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

247
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,254
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

248
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,408
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

249
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,797
And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

250
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,167
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

251
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,404
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

252
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,323
l also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

253
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,059
just in case you get lonely.

254
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,911
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

255
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,656
And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

256
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,025
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

257
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,953
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

258
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,370
You have a job to do... far from home,

259
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,206
in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

260
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:35,110
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

261
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,014
- Don't go, Po!
- 1 gotta go.

262
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,373
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

263
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,551
And if I don't... what am I?

264
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,247
You're my son.

265
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,206
Right?

266
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,375
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

267
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,087
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

268
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,504
He'll be back before
you can say “noodles.”

269
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,283
Noodles.

270
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,551
Come on, guys, let's go!

271
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,993
Yeah!

272
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,347
Yeah...

273
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:26,116
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

274
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,341
Mama?

275
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,228
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

276
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,791
Mom! Dad!

277
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,119
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

278
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,592
Honey, what are you doing here?

279
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:06,854
But I thought...

280
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,732
We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

281
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,940
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

282
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,572
does better kung fu.

283
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,519
No. No, no, no.

284
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:23,705
Wait!

285
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:30,942
No.

286
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,957
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

287
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,473
Inner pea...

288
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,427
Pea...

289
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,408
Inner peace.

290
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:21,206
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!

291
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,483
I'm... training.

292
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,892
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

293
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,957
- 1am ready.
- OK.

294
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,160
So serious.

295
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,929
I think I prefer the mast.

296
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:54,516
Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

297
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,427
Now I feel nothing.

298
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,376
That's severely cool.

299
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,471
Again!

300
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:09,975
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

301
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,106
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

302
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,336
Is there any, you know, faster way?

303
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,151
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

304
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,381
No. Besides...

305
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,254
...[ don't think
hard style is your thing.

306
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,412
Po, why are you really out here?

307
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,029
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

308
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,120
Your dad? The goose.

309
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,939
That must have been quite a shock.

310
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,081
Yeah.

311
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,973
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

312
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,116
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

313
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,356
Souls of platinum.

314
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:00,808
Like you.

315
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,860
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

316
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,408
- 1 was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

317
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,119
Nothing. Nothing.

318
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,404
Po's having daddy issues.

319
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,530
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

320
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,157
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

321
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,102
- 1 don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

322
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,425
Po is the one freaking out.

323
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,751
-I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

324
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,117
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

325
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,896
- What?
- We're here.

326
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,122
Gongmen City.

327
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,930
My father's throne.

328
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:57,073
He used to let me play here beside him,

329
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,566
promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

330
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,099
A little to the left.

331
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,296
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

332
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,599
Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

333
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,235
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

334
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,116
And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

335
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,614
Perfect!

336
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,752
With the weapon by my Si...
A little bit more.

337
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:34,384
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

338
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,714
We move out in three days,

339
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,458
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

340
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,314
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

341
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:46,794
Fortune?

342
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,429
Future. I was going to say future.

343
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,900
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

344
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:00,172
If you continue on your current path...

345
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:06,458
. you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

346
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:11,225
I see...

347
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,974
I see...

348
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,033
I see pain... and anger.

349
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,240
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!

350
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,760
Followed by denial.

351
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,318
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

352
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,534
- what's happening right...
- Now?

353
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,813
The most important time is now.

354
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,518
But if you really want
to see the future...

355
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,144
Oh, what do you see?

356
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,868
A peacock...

357
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,964
.. iS defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

358
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,450
Nothing has changed.

359
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,462
That's impossible, and you know it.

360
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,783
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

361
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,457
Who?

362
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,412
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

363
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,074
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

364
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,923
Big and furry.

365
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,072
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

366
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,871
There are no more pandas.

367
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,362
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

368
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,456
Why is it that you cannot?

369
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,490
Find this panda and bring him to me!

370
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,562
Yes, sir!

371
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,314
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

372
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:47,319
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

373
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,847
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

374
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,076
Will you stop that!

375
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:11,227
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

376
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,997
Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

377
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,259
“We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

378
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,432
and we are here
to bring you to justice!"

379
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,443
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

380
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,552
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

381
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,735
I do not like that guy.

382
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,263
We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

383
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,063
Got it. Stealth mode.

384
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,763
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

385
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,649
Now, where'd those noodles go?

386
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,955
Hello. I couldn't help but...

387
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,033
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

388
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,181
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

389
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,257
OK.

390
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,688
Guys! Guys?

391
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,557
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

392
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,245
So that was stealth mode, huh?

393
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,774
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

394
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,380
...gold in there, come on!

395
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,120
This rice is raw!

396
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,695
You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

397
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,961
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

398
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,918
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

399
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,611
How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

400
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,870
- Wait, I have a better idea.
-...two...

401
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,341
one.

402
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,093
- Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,746
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

404
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,699
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

405
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,367
but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

406
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,492
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

407
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,309
Right.

408
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,076
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

409
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,516
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

410
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,522
What? They're still alive?

411
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,644
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

412
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,433
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

413
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,393
OK, let's go!

414
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,458
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

415
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,144
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

416
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,523
- Get them!
- Sorry!

417
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:58,886
Take that!

418
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:00,613
- Keep going!
- Faster!

419
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,780
Hey, stop!

420
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,851
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!

421
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,200
Surround him.

422
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,082
Now!

423
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,962
Gotcha!

424
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,321
What? Where'd he go?

425
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,106
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

426
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:41,076
-Is “there” a part of "everywhere"?
- I... [guess.

427
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,010
Then search there!

428
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,213
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

429
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,546
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

430
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,716
Look. Gongmen Jail.

431
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,151
Aw, it's cute.

432
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,675
Cute, huh?

433
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,485
Nice work, Po.

434
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,435
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

435
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,876
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

436
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,371
Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

437
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,487
Master Ox! Master!

438
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,329
The ferocious Master Croc!

439
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:36,549
And Master Storming Ox.

440
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,336
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

441
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:42,594
We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

442
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,294
Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

443
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,542
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

444
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,804
We're coming for you, Shen!

445
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:00,379
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

446
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,482
I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

447
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,357
Of course we do.

448
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:08,106
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

449
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,319
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

450
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,259
by not protecting Gongmen City?

451
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:16,714
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

452
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,759
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

453
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,636
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

454
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,488
...by the unstoppable weapon.

455
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,943
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you

456
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,566
from telling me
something's unstoppable!

457
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,062
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

458
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,952
I'd like to see you get me out!

459
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,833
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

460
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,928
Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

461
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,754
The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

462
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,915
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

463
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,748
Yes!

464
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,800
All right, let's go!

465
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,952
I get the top bunk.

466
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,939
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

467
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,927
L..

468
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,181
You...

469
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,269
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

470
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:37,866
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

471
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:41,273
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

472
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,263
With despair for dessert.

473
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,385
We'll take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

474
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:50,401
for justice and honor
that kung fu still lives!

475
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,241
Yeah!

476
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,537
Monkey?!

477
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,386
You! You're mine!

478
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,448
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

479
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,403
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

480
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,652
Get him!

481
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,850
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

482
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,096
Stop him!

483
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,406
Faster!

484
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,857
Yeah! Go, go!

485
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,585
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

486
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,592
- Viper!
- Hang on!

487
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,687
- What?
- Watch out!

488
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,436
Uncool! Very uncool!

489
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,525
Try this!

490
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,054
Guys, guys, guys!

491
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,841
Maybe something smaller!

492
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,416
No, no! Oh, no, no.

493
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,650
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

494
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,118
Fire!

495
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,368
We've lost them.

496
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,274
Again! Again!

497
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,755
Crane, catch!

498
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,286
Gotcha!

499
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,443
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
give me a shove!

500
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,192
Mantis, now!

501
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,214
Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

502
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,839
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

503
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,310
Your turn!

504
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,687
Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?!

505
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,960
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

506
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,507
Yes! Taste the defeat!

507
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,283
Let me tell you something.

508
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,282
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

509
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,038
Guess nobody told you,

510
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,980
if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

511
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:09,237
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

512
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,310
We surrender!

513
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,772
You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

514
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,643
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

515
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:27,903
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

516
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,491
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

517
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,871
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

518
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,935
These are the best cuffs!

519
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,046
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

520
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,353
No, no, no...

521
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:54,392
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

522
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,243
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

523
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:02,337
- You are afraid for a reason.
- 1am not afraid.

524
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,390
He is coming to me in chains.

525
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,087
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

526
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,625
Don't even think about it.

527
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,651
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

528
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,204
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

529
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,497
This plan's nothing like that plan.

530
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,766
- How?
- ‘Cause this one's going to work.

531
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,357
Keep moving.

532
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,531
Ah, my old enemy...

533
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,195
.. Stairs.

534
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,592
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

535
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,266
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

536
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:41,985
Someone might want to clean that up.

537
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,666
Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

538
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,533
Greetings, panda.

539
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,948
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

540
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,195
Hey.

541
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:55,167
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

542
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,076
Hey... enough with the poking around.

543
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,006
Strong. Healthy.

544
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:03,848
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

545
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,488
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

546
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,351
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

547
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:12,544
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

548
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,551
Bring the prisoners to me.

549
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,356
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

550
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,946
Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

551
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:24,751
Sparrow kick!

552
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,718
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

553
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,153
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

554
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,500
I do not. I know he is.

555
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:50,198
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

556
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,865
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

557
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,575
I did not have a lifetime.

558
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,600
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

559
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:02,162
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

560
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:05,097
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

561
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,686
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

562
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,426
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

563
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,815
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

564
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,181
Know what? What's so funny?

565
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,370
The very thing
that you clearly do not know!

566
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:22,352
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

567
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,924
First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

568
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,127
And then the lady over here,
I think it’s a guy, ‘cause he's got...

569
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,055
The only reason you are still alive

570
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:37,758
is that I find your stupidity
mildly amusing.

571
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,439
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

572
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,653
Who do you think you are, panda?

573
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,448
Who do you think I am, peacock?

574
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,259
Why are we laughing?

575
00:44:58,563 --> 00:44:59,583
Take aim.

576
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:12,669
Fire.

577
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:19,381
Well, light the... thing!

578
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,284
I did!

579
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,864
Fear the bug!

580
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:38,428
Get the weapon!

581
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,275
Tigress!

582
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:16,596
You... You were there.

583
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,520
Yes. Yes, I was.

584
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,508
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

585
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,753
Fire!

586
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,507
Oh. No, he’s got way more.

587
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:49,272
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

588
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:50,837
Coming!

589
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,019
- Watch out!
- Po!

590
00:46:57,615 --> 00:47:00,134
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

591
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,991
Use the ropes.

592
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:12,904
Run, run, little panda!

593
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:27,132
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- 1 got it, I got it!

594
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,107
Bring it down!

595
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,772
- We're trapped!
- This way!

596
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:40,767
Goodbye!

597
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,164
Fire!

598
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,027
Get back!

599
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,990
The only way out is up.

600
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,206
What?

601
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,909
Follow me! Come on!

602
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:15,595
Where are they going?

603
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,415
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

604
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,376
Here we go!

605
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,187
- You idiot!
- My nose!

606
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,660
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!

607
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,524
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

608
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,685
Right now?
‘Cause it's the middle of the year,

609
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:03,545
so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

610
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:08,393
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

611
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,696
Happy New Year, sir.

612
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,535
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

613
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:20,153
Now!

614
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,158
Now, now, now, now, now!

615
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,990
Move! Move, move, move, move!

616
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,145
This way.

617
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,361
Let's go.

618
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:55,885
Oh, you!

619
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,023
What did you do?
It's chaos up there.

620
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,889
What happened to stopping Shen?

621
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:02,962
Yeah.

622
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,502
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

623
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,777
I meant for him to get away.

624
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,816
‘Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

625
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,683
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

626
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,678
That makes no sense.

627
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,577
What do you mean? Sure it does.

628
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:24,879
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

629
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,236
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

630
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:29,877
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

631
00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:32,005
The truth.

632
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,843
Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

633
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,686
- Real far.
- What?

634
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,042
You're staying here.

635
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,918
Wait! I have to go ba...

636
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,193
You're staying here!

637
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,885
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

638
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,413
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

639
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,350
Guys? Don't.

640
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,688
Ready.

641
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,359
Look!

642
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,243
Stay down.

643
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:25,737
-l have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

644
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,569
He was there! OK?

645
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,831
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

646
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,581
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

647
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,335
Who I am.

648
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,051
Look, I'm going.

649
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,077
I have to know.

650
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,320
The hard core can't understand.

651
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,232
Tigress, no!

652
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,365
The hard core do understand.

653
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:03,628
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

654
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:08,959
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

655
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,207
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

656
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,131
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

657
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,117
You're better off here.

658
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:31,831
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

659
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,300
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

660
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:38,333
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

661
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,966
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

662
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:46,085
A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

663
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,069
Then will you finally be satisfied?

664
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:53,252
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

665
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:57,814
It's a start. l might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

666
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,611
The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

667
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,744
It is time to stop this madness.

668
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:09,822
Why on earth would I do that?

669
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,149
So your parents can rest in peace.

670
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,870
My parents hated me.

671
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:19,981
Do you understand?

672
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:25,216
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

673
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,176
They loved you.

674
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:31,663
They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

675
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:39,944
The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

676
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:49,029
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

677
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,883
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.

678
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:55,864
Happiness must be taken.

679
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,915
And I will take mine.

680
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,522
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!

681
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:28,713
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

682
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,046
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

683
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,106
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

684
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:39,852
I can't feel my face.

685
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:58,102
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

686
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,618
- Hey.
- Hey.

687
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,374
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

688
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:04,873
You! Where are you going?

689
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:10,311
On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

690
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,494
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!

691
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,985
Greetings, panda.

692
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,471
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

693
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,640
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

694
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,810
Yes! We're talking
about the same night, right?

695
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,427
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

696
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:02,095
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

697
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:14,063
Here's your New Year's gift.

698
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,304
Hope you like it,
‘cause you can't return it.

699
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,555
Po? What's he doing here?

700
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:22,855
Return it! Return it!

701
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,338
Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

702
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:40,928
You bet Il am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

703
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:05,641
We got them. Go!

704
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:28,887
You looking for me?

705
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:37,665
I said that too soon, didn't I?

706
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,316
Po!

707
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,575
Po, get away from him.

708
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,667
I'll get up. Here we go.

709
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,015
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

710
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,261
Now... answers.

711
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,109
Oh, you want to know so badly.

712
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,890
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

713
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:13,994
Fill some crater in your soul?

714
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,558
Well, here's your answer.

715
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,714
Your parents didn't love you.

716
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:22,770
But here...

717
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,506
...let me heal you!

718
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,422
No!

719
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,408
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

720
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:58,708
If ! wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

721
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:02,876
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfill your destiny.

722
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:06,343
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

723
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:10,379
What is this place?

724
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,250
I'm surprised you remember so little.

725
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:17,951
But you were so little when it happened.

726
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,903
Perhaps you do remember.

727
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,139
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

728
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,368
Nightmare? Or memory?

729
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:03,868
This was a thriving village.

730
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:07,491
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

731
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:09,708
But he wanted more.

732
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:15,140
I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

733
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:19,486
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

734
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,386
Get them all!

735
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:44,231
Take our son and run away! Go!

736
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:01,371
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

737
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:09,308
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

738
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:12,729
but that doesn't
make you who you are.

739
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:15,502
It is the rest of your story.

740
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:18,553
Who you choose to be.

741
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:53,947
So, who are you, panda?

742
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:03,859
lam Po.

743
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,535
And I'm gonna need a hat.

744
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:19,823
Such sad, sad faces.

745
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,770
But now is a time only for joy.

746
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,759
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

747
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:33,036
Once we reach the harbor,
in front of all the world,

748
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:37,323
you and your precious kung fu will die.

749
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:44,346
Then China will know to bow before me.

750
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:46,568
Set sail!

751
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,284
What is that?

752
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:22,723
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

753
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,909
l always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

754
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:27,969
..then she'd eat my head.

755
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,491
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

756
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:34,934
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

757
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,946
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

758
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,217
Fire!

759
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:00,225
You coward!

760
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,330
Po?

761
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:14,732
Po?

762
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:21,526
How many times do! have to kill
the same stinking panda?

763
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:32,974
Shen!

764
01:07:33,316 --> 01:07:36,856
A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

765
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:38,954
What?

766
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:42,825
Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

767
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:44,893
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

768
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:48,131
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

769
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:50,508
Disc of Destruction!

770
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:04,428
OK. Take aim!

771
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:17,522
Ready?

772
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:40,377
You can't follow me.

773
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:41,743
Just get him!

774
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,706
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

775
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:57,394
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

776
01:08:57,734 --> 01:08:58,634
No, don't shoot!

777
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:01,045
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

778
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,644
- You don't shoot!
- 1 won't shoot if you won't shoot.

779
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,209
Yeah!

780
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:10,060
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

781
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,726
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

782
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:26,319
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

783
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,979
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

784
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:30,694
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

785
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:31,903
Po!

786
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,100
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbor.

787
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:40,812
Nice!

788
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:44,683
Viper, Puppet of Death!

789
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:46,484
Tigress!

790
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,041
- Master Ox!
- Jump!

791
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,650
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

792
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:02,619
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

793
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:11,653
Master Shifu!

794
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:16,193
Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

795
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,160
Crane!

796
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,958
Wings of Justice!

797
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,312
Yeah!

798
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:41,503
What?

799
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:55,250
I love you guys.

800
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,124
Why aren't we firing?

801
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:09,519
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

802
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,344
Fire! Fire at them!

803
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:18,501
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

804
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,008
Fire!

805
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:23,682
No.

806
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:32,594
Po!

807
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,313
Tigress?

808
01:12:59,275 --> 01:13:00,795
As you wish.

809
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:02,607
Let's finish this.

810
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:27,552
Fire!

811
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,352
Inner peace.

812
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:02,941
Again!

813
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:11,282
Yeah!

814
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:15,295
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

815
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,980
What? No. No!

816
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:49,546
Keep firing! Keep firing!

817
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:11,849
Skadoosh.

818
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:43,474
How did you...?

819
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,471
How did you do it?

820
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,835
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

821
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:56,094
Not that. How did you find peace?

822
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,872
I took away your parents. Everything.

823
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:02,568
I scarred you for life.

824
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:06,562
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

825
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:10,669
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

826
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,440
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

827
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:17,803
- 1 don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

828
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:21,934
You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past, ‘cause it just doesn't matter.

829
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:26,528
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

830
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,509
You're right.

831
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:30,931
Then I choose... this!

832
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,936
That was pretty hard-core.

833
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:36,514
- Po!
- You did it!

834
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,539
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

835
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:43,279
It seems you have found inner peace.

836
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:45,976
And at such a young age.

837
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:48,068
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

838
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:12,501
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

839
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:15,202
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

840
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:18,058
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

841
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:21,050
You know, I think we'll
just try again another time.

842
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:22,794
When do you think he'll be back?

843
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:29,411
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

844
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:33,002
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.

845
01:18:33,576 --> 01:18:35,506
At least, l was his dad.

846
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:39,195
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

847
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:43,035
But why? He's just one little panda.

848
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:02,311
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?

849
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:05,001
Yep.

850
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:07,331
Well, knew you would.

851
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,326
That's why I had new signs made.

852
01:19:09,712 --> 01:19:11,672
“My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

853
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,364
Buy one dumpling, get one free.”

854
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:16,017
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

855
01:19:16,352 --> 01:19:18,662
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

856
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,630
There's something I should tell you.

857
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:30,565
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

858
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:35,791
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

859
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:37,768
You did?

860
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:42,267
- 1 know who lam.
- You do?

861
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:46,177
I'm your son.

862
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:53,918
Il love you, Dad.

863
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:56,797
Il love you, too, son.

864
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:02,875
Delicious, fat radishes!

865
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,169
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

866
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,121
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

867
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,763
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

868
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,944
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

869
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,452
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

870
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:14,779
- Po.
- Dad.

871
01:20:15,077 --> 01:20:16,337
- Po!
- OK.

872
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,989
Let's both cook. Together.
