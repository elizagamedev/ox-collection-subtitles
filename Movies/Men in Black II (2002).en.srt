1
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,352
Mysteries in History,
with your host, Peter Graves.

2
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,490
Although no one has ever been able
to prove their existence...

3
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,884
..@ quasi-government agency,
the Men in Black...

4
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,367
. supposedly carries out operations
here on Earth...

5
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:44,541
..in order to keep us safe from aliens
throughout the galaxies.

6
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,282
Here is one of their stories
that "never happened"...

7
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,571
...from one of their files
that doesn't exist.

8
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:57,346
1978, The leaders of Zartha
flee their planet...

9
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:02,625
...in order to escape the clutches
of the evil Kylothian, Serleena.

10
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:07,194
Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring
with them their greatest treasure:

11
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:11,575
The Light of Zartha,
a cosmic force so powerful...

12
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,219
...that in the wrong hands it could
lead to the annihilation of Zartha.

13
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,267
The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna,
beseeched the Men in Black...

14
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,926
...to hide the Light from Serleena.

15
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,447
But they had no choice.

16
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,922
Intervention would have meant
the destruction of the Earth.

17
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:35,204
However, in an act of galactic bravery,
the Men in Black subdued Serleena...

18
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,955
..allowing the Zarthans to escape...

19
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,618
...80 they might hide the Light
on another planet.

20
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:47,303
Serleena, released from her captors,
vowed that the Light would be hers...

21
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,351
..and that she would destroy
any planet that stood in her way.

22
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,577
And so, never knowing what happened...

23
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:01,654
..the people of Earth were saved
by a secret society of protectors...

24
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,146
...Known as the Men in Black.

25
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,331
Harvey!

26
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,881
Harvey, get over here!

27
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,594
Harvey. Heel, heel!

28
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,993
You're barking at the moon, moron.

29
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,985
Harvey. Harvey!

30
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,104
Hey, pretty lady.

31
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,751
You taste good.

32
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,243
Hey, what the--?

33
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,616
Yeah, you too.

34
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,128
Nothing fancy, no heroics.
By the book.

35
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,884
Got it. Hey!

36
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,243
Hey, Jeff. What's happening, buddy?

37
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,179
-We were wondering why you're here.
-The man's talking to you.

38
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,603
You know our arrangements.
Stay in the E, F and R subway lines...

39
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,414
..and you get all the garbage
you want.

40
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,307
What the hell are you doing here,
worm boy?

41
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,683
Tee.

42
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,585
Jeff...

43
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,846
Excuse my partner.
He's new and he's...

44
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,576
You getting big, Jeff.
Boy, what you been eating?

45
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,686
You like jokes, huh?

46
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,874
Jeffrey!

47
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,232
All right.

48
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,465
Sweet dreams, big boy.

49
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,095
Sweet dreams...

50
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,322
.. big boy.

51
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,096
Transit authority.
Move to the forward car.

52
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,882
We got a bug in the electrical system.

53
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:05,691
People! We got a bug
in the electrical system!

54
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,640
Now y'all running?

55
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,508
No, no, no! Sit down!

56
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,617
It's only a 600-foot worm.

57
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,695
-Everybody out.
-Put the hammer down on this thing.

58
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,403
I'm Captain Larry Bridgewater.
I decide what happens.

59
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,310
You decide?
Okay, come here. Come here.

60
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,613
Larry? That's my man, Jeff.

61
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,867
-Larry just made a decision.
-Larry need to take his ass in there.

62
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,055
Don't make me do this, Jeff!

63
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,795
Eighty-first Street.

64
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,077
Just a second.

65
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,046
May I have your attention, please?

66
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,446
We thank you
for participating in our drill.

67
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,653
Had this been an emergency,
you'd have been eaten.

68
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,449
Because you don't listen.
You're ignorant.

69
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,594
How a man gonna bash through--?
That's the problem with New Yorkers.

70
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,463
"We've seen it all. A 600-foot worm!
Save us, Mr. Black Man!"

71
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,767
l ask you nice, "Move to the next car."
You just sit there like--

72
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,676
Thank you for participating.

73
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,481
Hopefully, you enjoyed our smaller,
energy-efficient subway cars.

74
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,142
Watch your step.
You will have a nice evening.

75
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,256
I need a cleanup crew
at 81st and Central Park West.

76
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,056
Revoke Jeff's movement privileges.

77
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,026
Have him escorted
to the Chamber Street station.

78
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,899
And please check the expiration date
on the unipod worm tranquilizers.

79
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,458
Sorry, fellas. Station closed.

80
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,703
-Emergency drill. For your safety.
-Do you believe these putzes?

81
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,132
You're welcome.

82
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,964
I know, by the book.

83
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:51,327
Tee, when was the last time
we just looked at the stars?

84
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,675
This is a test. 1 can do this.

85
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,733
Ever feel like you're alone
in the universe?

86
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,530
Yes.

87
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,152
No.

88
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,286
-Hey, let me buy you a piece of pie.
-Really?

89
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,477
Thanks.

90
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,829
Hey, you're not alone
in the universe.

91
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,266
-Remove the arm.
-Okay.

92
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:24,505
Please, shut up, Charlie.

93
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,071
I'm tired of you constantly talking
behind my back.

94
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:32,582
You meet a girl. She's into it.
The best line you come up with is:

95
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,849
"Wanna come back to my place for some
tonsil hockey and egg salad?"

96
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,764
-Who are you and how'd you get in here?
-You like egg salad?

97
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,694
Serleena!

98
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,872
Why didn't you say it was you?

99
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,319
-Where's the Light?
-Here's the deal.

100
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,885
You're looking for this Light.
We found it.

101
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:59,121
You want it, it'll cost you 50 mill.
Here's how it'll work. First--

102
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,392
Where is the Light?

103
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:11,497
We couldn't find it, but we found
a guy who might know where it is.

104
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,881
He runs a pizza parlor
on Spring Street.

105
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,932
Let's go. And wipe your nose, idiot.

106
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,239
-Good pie.
-Yeah.

107
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,387
Crowded.

108
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,295
Well, they got good pie.

109
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,156
What is wrong with you?

110
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,416
-You're gonna neuralyze me.
-No, I'm not.

111
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,106
You took me here
so I wouldn't make a scene.

112
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,172
You making a scene.

113
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,025
Let me ask you a question.
Why did you join MiB?

114
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,698
Six years in the Marines.
l like the action. Protect the planet.

115
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,202
You like being a hero?
You joined the wrong organization.

116
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,346
-You ever heard of James Edwards?
-No.

117
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,490
Well, he saved the lives of 85 people
on the subway tonight.

118
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,894
No one knows he exists.

119
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,959
And if no one knows he exists,
how can anyone ever love him?

120
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,285
Hey, how long we been partners?

121
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,338
-Feb 1.
-Five months, three days.

122
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,234
-Started at noon.
-Nine hours.

123
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,776
Get married. Have a bunch of kids.

124
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,037
Okay.

125
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:46,841
Excuse me. My buddy's kind of shy,
but he thinks you are hot.

126
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:53,729
Here it is.

127
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,751
I don't know what to say.

128
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,676
Years from now,
you know what people'll say?

129
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,128
-"Employee" is misspelled?
-They charge by the letter.

130
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:07,333
They'll say, "Imagine that. Big shot
like her used to work here."

131
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,237
-Ben--
-You deserve it.

132
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,325
Bring up a case of Mountain Dew
from the basement.

133
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,061
Hey, Bruno.

134
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,264
Two slices of pepperoni and
information about the Light of Zartha.

135
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,949
-Whoever you are, don't hurt me.
-Where's the Light, Ben?

136
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,545
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let me down, ma'am.

137
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,969
l want to report a robbery--

138
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,105
There.

139
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,984
Noise.

140
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:45,934
Kitchen!

141
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,956
You idiots see anything?

142
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,045
Wind blew the door open.

143
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,818
Nothing out of the ordinary.

144
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,174
For 25 years, I've traveled
the universe looking for it.

145
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,307
But it never left Earth, did it?
You kept it here.

146
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,351
What are you talking about?

147
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,952
I'm running out of time.
Where's the Light?

148
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,895
-l don't know what you mean.
-Listen, Zarthan.

149
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,655
You hid the Light on Earth.
I'll find it.

150
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,241
Once we have the Light,
Zartha will be ours.

151
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,095
You're too late.
Tomorrow at midnight...

152
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,681
..the Light will leave
the third planet and be back home.

153
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,154
Sorry you made the trip for nothing.

154
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,080
Now we don't know
if it's on Earth or not.

155
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,676
He said third planet.
It's here, you idiot.

156
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,385
-Third Rock from the Sun.
-l never got that till now.

157
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,740
It's on Earth, and I know
who's gonna tell me where it is.

158
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,375
-Don't you ever go home?
-Nope.

159
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,331
Il see you neuralyzed another partner.

160
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,587
Bee, Dee, when you use
a fission carbonizer...

161
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,363
.. attach a de-atomizer
so it doesn't sound like a cannon.

162
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,767
Hey, get some booties on them things.
You're crapping up the floor.

163
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,925
Check his visa.

164
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,923
The Cephalopods have been making
counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal.

165
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:53,231
And why do I have a dead Tricrainasloph
going through passport control?

166
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,700
That'd be my fault. I'm very sorry.
Please don't neuralyze me, sir.

167
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,476
-What the hell's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing, sir.

168
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,787
Good work in the subway.

169
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,583
-l remember Jeff when he was yea high.
-What you got for me?

170
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,243
Look. See those guys in black suits?

171
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,383
-They work here. We got it covered.
-Zed, what you got?

172
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,649
Dedication's one thing, but this job
will eat you up and spit you out.

173
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,944
You want to look like me
when you hit 50...

174
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,505
ish?

175
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,466
I'll be in the gym if you need me.

176
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,336
All right, there was a killing earlier.
177 Spring.

177
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,053
Alien-on-alien.

178
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,601
Take Tee with you
and make a report.

179
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,486
You have got to stop neuralyzing
MiB personnel.

180
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,989
He was crying
in the middle of the diner.

181
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,771
I hate that.

182
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,497
And plus, you can't count Elle.

183
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,515
She wanted to go back to the morgue.
I helped her.

184
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,589
-You need a partner.
-I'm cool.

185
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,992
I'll be his partner.

186
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,742
Jay, wait up.
l appreciate the shot, man.

187
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,211
-Thought I'd never get out.
-Lose the suit.

188
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,581
Sure thing.
Just going for the look.

189
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,389
But if l say so myself,
I find it slimming.

190
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,198
Not that I've had problems
with the ladies.

191
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,092
When you get down to--

192
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,980
Nice sled, very swank.

193
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,232
Heated seats? Sometimes I get hives.

194
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,122
Frank!

195
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,351
Bring your head in this window
before I roll it up in there.

196
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,158
Got it.

197
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,592
Frank!

198
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,769
My money? It's missionary.

199
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,861
I was in the Bowery,
and I meet this Great Dane.

200
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,397
A little thick in the body,
but pretty.

201
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,563
That's just not appealing to me, man.
Seriously.

202
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,133
Il say we do the good cop,
bad cop thing.

203
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,832
You interrogate the witness
and I growl.

204
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:23,038
How about we do the good cop,
dumb dog thing, and you just shut up?

205
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,803
You got it, partner.
Total silence.

206
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,188
Absolute quiet. Not a word out of me.

207
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,729
What do we got?

208
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,187
-What do we got?
-There's residue on the wall.

209
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:42,013
-We sent samples to Em for analysis.
-Hey, 0% body fat.

210
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,837
-Funny.
-Witness?

211
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,347
Girl. Saw everything.

212
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,116
She's taking it well.

213
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,111
Il won't answer any more questions.
l want to know what happened here.

214
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,825
-I'll handle this one.
-You got it.

215
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,218
Alone. A talking dog might be
a bit much for her now.

216
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,605
What do you want me to do?

217
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,974
Sniff around.

218
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,139
What?

219
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:10,825
Funny.

220
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,307
Take a deep breath.
Everything is all right.

221
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,523
What part is she supposed
to feel all right about?

222
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,485
I'm Agent Jay.

223
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,157
Tell me what you saw.

224
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,736
-A two-headed guy and a woman.
-Caucasian?

225
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,848
Gray, with tentacles
that she used to rip--

226
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,318
His skin off.

227
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:35,283
It's not skin. It's protoplasma polymer
similar to the gum in baseball cards.

228
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,345
-What was the last thing you ate?
-Calzone.

229
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,821
-What time?
-Lunch.

230
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,212
-Spinach?
-Mushroom.

231
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,738
You need pie.

232
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,316
You okay?

233
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,578
An hour ago, a man I've known
my whole life vanished...

234
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,428
.. because of a woman
with weird fingers...

235
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,287
..and a two-headed guy
with a cannoli's IQ.

236
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,127
So yeah, everything's okay.

237
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:09,305
When we're kids,
before we're taught how to think...

238
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,859
..our hearts tell us there is
something else out there.

239
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:17,742
I know what I saw.
Tell me what I'm supposed to believe.

240
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:28,486
I'm a member of a secret organization
that monitors alien activity on Earth.

241
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,211
Ben was an alien.
So were his killers.

242
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,160
I don't know why they did it,
but I promise I'm gonna find out.

243
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,652
Okay.

244
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,511
-Okay?
-Okay.

245
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,489
Okay.

246
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,399
-I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to--
-Kill me.

247
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,245
No!

248
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:58,067
Just a little flash and everything
goes back the way it was.

249
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,908
After you flash me...

250
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,621
. if lsee you again,
will l know it's you?

251
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,864
I'll see you.

252
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,308
But you won't see me.

253
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,500
Must be hard.

254
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,596
Must be very lonely.

255
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,479
Excuse me.

256
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,576
-I gotta go.
-What about the flashy thing?

257
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,427
I'll flash you some other time.

258
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,967
What?

259
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,560
-Did you tell the girl you love her?
-She's a witness to a crime. That's it.

260
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,039
You're attracted. She's not my species,
and I'm attracted.

261
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:18,133
I should take advice on love
from a dude that chases his own ass?

262
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,331
Easy, pal. That's canine profiling,
and I resent it.

263
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,715
Hey, Jay, wait up.

264
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,706
Coming through. MiB brass.
Look sharp.

265
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,709
I'm Agent Eff, Jay's new partner.
Who are you eyeballing?

266
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,344
Frank, just cool out, dog.

267
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,761
-Got kids?
-No.

268
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,416
Want them?

269
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,527
Get him off me!

270
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,481
-Talk to me.
-It's Kylothian, class C.

271
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:12,847
Serleena.

272
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,195
-Serleena. Old girlfriend?
-She wishes.

273
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,016
The perps were looking
for the Light of--

274
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,977
-Zartha.
-Yeah, what is it?

275
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,522
This makes no sense.
It's not on Earth.

276
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,858
-We took care of this a long time ago.
-Obviously not.

277
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,205
That is very bad news.

278
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,877
The Zarthans came to Earth
to hide the Light from Serleena.

279
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,568
-We don't do that.
-Right. I ordered it off the planet.

280
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,598
Well, Zed....

281
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,870
I got a Kylothian class C in my park.
Are you sure this Light isn't here?

282
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,734
Positive. l gave the order.
My best agent carried it out.

283
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,595
-It's as if l gave it to you.
-Ask the agent.

284
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,041
-Can't.
-Dead?

285
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:53,129
Sort of. He works at the post office.

286
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,676
No.

287
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,328
If Serleena gets to Kay before we do,
he's dead,

288
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,484
The Earth's very existence
may rest on what Kay knows.

289
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,197
Too bad you wiped out
his memory of it.

290
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,973
Bring him in.

291
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:07,401
Now.

292
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:11,269
How cool is this? Going to get Kay.
The legend, the go-to guy.

293
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,157
The guy who taught you everything.

294
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,710
-The greatest agent in MiB history!
-Frank! Stop talking.

295
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,222
Stay.

296
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,830
Listen, partner.
I may look like a dog...

297
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,489
.. but l only play one here on Earth.

298
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,325
-Whatever. Wipe your mouth.
-Hey, babe.

299
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,897
People of Truro,
may I kindly have your attention?

300
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,608
To facilitate your shipping needs...

301
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,409
..all packages must be
properly wrapped.

302
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,306
This one is an example of
"go home and do it again."

303
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,404
Il think you know what I mean,
Mrs. Vigushin.

304
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:59,193
Brown paper and triple-twist twine
are the preferred media.

305
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,472
Thank you for your time.

306
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,455
-Kay.
-C. Express mail, two-day air.

307
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,716
Kevin.

308
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,371
Kevin. That's funny.
You don't have a "Kevin"...

309
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,462
You don't remember.
We worked together.

310
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:22,504
I never worked in a funeral home.
Something I can do for you, slick?

311
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,605
Straight to the point.

312
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:29,264
You were an agent of an organization
that monitors aliens on Earth.

313
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,518
We're the Men in Black.
We have a situation. We need your help.

314
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:37,466
There is a free mental health clinic
on the corner of Lilac.

315
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,820
-Next.
-Excuse me.

316
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,372
-Twenty Rugrats stamps.
-Elizabeth.

317
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:46,574
The Postal Service hasn't kept up
with today's youth, but we have...

318
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,606
...Berlin airlift stamps.
Opera legends?

319
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,712
American Samoa?
Amish quilts.

320
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,638
I'm sorry, got a world to save here.

321
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,122
There was no coma.
It was a cover.

322
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,125
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

323
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,293
The postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts,
and I'm ordering you to leave.

324
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,010
-ls that decaf?
-Sorry.

325
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,435
We have a breach.
Cordon off this area.

326
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,521
Full perimeter wipe-down,
right here, right now.

327
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,930
Get a mop and escort all civilian
personnel from this site immediately.

328
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,412
Listen to yourself, Kay.
Who talks like that?

329
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,311
Why do you think you're
so comfortable here?

330
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,599
Just about everybody who works
in a post office is an alien.

331
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,521
No smoking.

332
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:47,675
Kay.

333
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,310
My wife and I saw Siegfried and Roy
fly a tiger around a room.

334
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,233
You're nothing special.

335
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,142
When you look at the stars,
you get a feeling...

336
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,412
. like you don't know who you are.

337
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,020
Like you know more about out there
than you do down here.

338
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,674
That's why she left you, Kay.
That's why your wife left you.

339
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,851
Okay, I'll tell you what.

340
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,673
You want to know who you really are,
take a ride with me.

341
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,714
If not, people are waiting
for their TV Guides.

342
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:23,664
Think he'll bite?

343
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,041
I'm just going for a ride. If things
don't add up, it's hasta luego.

344
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,034
Hey, Kay.

345
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,558
How's it hanging?

346
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,761
Good to see you, Kay.

347
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,843
Good to see you too,
whoever you are.

348
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:03,281
Well, let's see
what you got here, chief.

349
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,259
Welcome back, Agent Kay.

350
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:18,916
Agent Kay.

351
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,548
Greetings, Kay.

352
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,119
Wow, look who's back.

353
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,700
I don't mean to bother you--
You're Agent Kay!

354
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,966
-That's what they tell me.
-This is an honor. Agent Gee.

355
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,693
The most respected agent
in MiB history.

356
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,349
The most feared human in the universe.

357
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,437
Maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee?

358
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:42,304
-Black, two sugars, if you're going.
-An honor.

359
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,761
-Yeah, I'll take a-- My man?
-Good to see you, Kay.

360
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,069
How'd it go?

361
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,578
The Drolacks are gone
and the treaty is signed.

362
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:52,912
Good work.

363
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,141
What about that position you
promised me in Men in Black?

364
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,735
Still working on the alien
affirmative action program.

365
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,308
That's not what you promised me.

366
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,593
-You're breaking up.
-Zed? Hello?

367
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,183
-I'll call you back.
- could be Agent Em. Zed, you--

368
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:13,551
I think Earth might be in a bad way.
You're the only one that could save it.

369
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,019
-Well, neither rain, sleet, snow....
-Good man.

370
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,999
Get him armed and up to speed
and over to deneuralyzation.

371
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,631
-Frank?
-Yeah?

372
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,554
I'm gonna need them together
on this one.

373
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,602
I need an assistant. It's not
field work, but you get dental.

374
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,525
Dental?

375
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,713
The most advanced technologies from
all over the universe are in this room.

376
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,947
Allis lost! Allis lost!

377
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,734
Don't touch that!

378
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,537
I didn't do anything.

379
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,716
Hands in your pockets.

380
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,415
Your favorite weapon.

381
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,443
-That?
-Yep.

382
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:13,062
-Let's go put it on.
-What?

383
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,542
The last suit you'll ever wear.

384
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,363
Again.

385
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,839
The deneuralyzer.

386
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,262
Magneto-energy will surge
through your brain...

387
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:34,849
.. Unlocking information that could
hold the key to Earth's very survival.

388
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,919
Okay. What's that thing?

389
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,398
The deneuralyzer.

390
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:52,634
Welcome to planet Earth.
There are some rules and regulations.

391
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,528
Go out only at night.

392
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,586
If you must go out during the daylight,
only the East Village.

393
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,881
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

394
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,864
Name and planet of origin?

395
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,664
Sylona Gorth. Planet Jorn.
Kaluth system.

396
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,661
-Any fruits or vegetables?
-Yeah, two heads of cabbage.

397
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,196
Reason for visit?

398
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:25,594
Education. I want to learn
how to be an underwear model.

399
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,597
They told me I've got real potential.

400
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,049
Help! Heart attack!

401
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,766
Clear!

402
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,958
Wake up, champ!

403
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,486
-Oh, jeez.
-Lockdown. Code 101.

404
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,553
Lockdown.

405
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,000
This is not good. This is not good.

406
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,629
-Breach! We're being flushed.
-Flushed?

407
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,319
-Ever been to a water park?
-I don't know.

408
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,709
Flushed.

409
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,972
Yeah, man, back when you was an agent,
you loved getting flushed.

410
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:52,687
Yeah, every Saturday night, you'd
be like, "Flush me, Jay. Flush me."

411
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,938
I'd be like, "No."

412
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,098
You can't quit on me.

413
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:01,006
Il save the world, you tell me
why I stare at the stars.

414
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,895
Cool.

415
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,578
Does that come standard?

416
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:18,569
It came with a black dude,
but he kept getting pulled over.

417
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,889
I could rule this place
with the right set of mammary glands.

418
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,221
Trapped like rats...

419
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,084
..in a Chia Pet.

420
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,668
Computer, surveillance MiB.

421
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,372
MiB's locked down.

422
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,859
Computer, magnify. Times 10.

423
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,108
Communicator. Frank.

424
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,656
-Jay, where are you?
-We got flushed.

425
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,009
-MiB's code 101.
-Yeah, who did it?

426
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:56,055
Some hot-looking biker chick.
Want me to tail her?

427
00:36:56,581 --> 00:37:00,861
-Stay where you are. I'll be in touch.
-Stay where I am. Easy for you to say.

428
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,849
-Find Kay?
-Neuralyzed.

429
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:05,498
-Not active. Civilian.
-What?

430
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,890
-He was--
-Here.

431
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:08,362
-To get--
-Deneuralyzed.

432
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:12,673
-Memory's shot. But we'll find him.
-Don't put anything in our ears.

433
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,069
What?

434
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,406
What do you make of that?
Found it in my pocket. Weird, huh?

435
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,403
-Yeah, a smile.
-ls that the only deneuralyzer?

436
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,486
Officially. The plans leaked out
on the Internet.

437
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,759
Computer, Internet.

438
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,788
Deneuralyzer.

439
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,814
Perfect. It's an old friend.

440
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,607
Jay, ain't seen you in a while.

441
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,429
Did you peep that drop-top thing
out front?

442
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,801
My business is banging, dog.

443
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,528
You gotta check out the website.
It's Jeebsie dot--

444
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,952
Okay, whoa. He's retired, right?

445
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,191
We need the deneuralyzer.

446
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,506
-You're kidding.
-The meter's running, Jeebs.

447
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,275
Do you remember me?

448
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:08,925
Can't say I do.
I'm good with faces.

449
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,278
I think I'd remember that.

450
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,500
The great Kay's a neutral.

451
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:18,706
You're between me and my memories.
Do you have this deneuralyzer or not?

452
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,567
No.

453
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,176
Fresh out.

454
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,062
Can't help you.

455
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,679
Don't got it.

456
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,980
Even if I did, if it doesn't work,
he dies, you blow my head off.

457
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,160
If it does, I've brought back Kay,
who, for fun, blows my head off.

458
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,495
So, what's my incentive?

459
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:52,723
Okay, homey, I keep it downstairs
next to the snow blowers.

460
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,574
Alien prisoners released,
armed and ready for your orders.

461
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:03,158
Prisoners of MiB,
the scum of the universe.

462
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,408
Now it's the scum's turn.

463
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,917
I'm in a jam,
so I'll make this simple.

464
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,666
I need the Light of Zartha,
and Kay knows where it is.

465
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,300
Whoever brings Kay to me gets Earth.

466
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,652
Find a deneuralyzer.
They want his memory back.

467
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,833
Check.

468
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,065
Now.

469
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,393
Jarra, good to see you.

470
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,273
Okay, that should do it.

471
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,511
If l could have your attention
while we go over the safety procedures.

472
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,428
Keep your hands inside the vehicle.

473
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,631
If, during the ride,
you become disoriented...

474
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,522
.. there's nothing we can do about it.

475
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,459
Have you removed all your jewelry?

476
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,467
-Are you allergic to shellfish?
-Jeebs!

477
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,386
Right, then!
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

478
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,529
Have you used this?

479
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,214
l used it to make some hot-air popcorn.
That's about it.

480
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,421
Okay! Let's make it happen, cap'n!

481
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,226
Perfect.

482
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,891
-You're back.
-No.

483
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,125
-How'd you know his head grows back?
-It grows back?

484
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:34,452
Real nice. Okay, that's the last time
Il help out a friend.

485
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,585
-Kay, you remember anything?
-Goodbye.

486
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,433
-Kay!
-Kay, wait!

487
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,567
I never got the updated software.
Still working off the 6.0.

488
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,870
Your brain needs to reboot.

489
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,510
Give it a minute.

490
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,072
Kay!

491
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,779
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
l hope it won't affect our friendship.

492
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,530
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
l hope it won't affect our friendship.

493
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:01,929
All those years of loyalty and trust,
respect for one another.

494
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,062
Right over there!

495
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,929
-Where's Kay?
-He's not here! He went--

496
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:13,357
Kay's retired. I'm his
trigger-happy replacement.

497
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,061
Right in the pie hole.
Now nothing's gonna taste right.

498
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,838
-Lower your weapon.
-No.

499
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,863
Jay, how are you, boo-boo?

500
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:30,686
-These guys really need Kay.
-He's a neutral.

501
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:34,401
-Tell me something we don't know.
-Yeah, tell me something--

502
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,419
lam so sorry.

503
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,538
-God bless you.
-Thank you.

504
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,598
If 1 don't bring Kay back to MiB,
Serleena's gonna kick my ass.

505
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,072
-Now, where is he?
-Where is who?

506
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,747
You don't look too good.

507
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,441
Yeah, and you look like crap.

508
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,992
l take that back. He look like crap.

509
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,614
-Bend him!
-Bend him.

510
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,653
Wait, don't bend him.

511
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,232
Damn decent of you.

512
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,161
Don't mention it.

513
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,637
-I'm gonna be sick.
-You don't wanna do that.

514
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:12,687
-Fellas, I think he's telling the truth.
-Then he's no good to us.

515
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,150
-Didn't l teach you anything, kid?
-Pineal eye!

516
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,582
Go for the mosh tendrils!

517
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:35,491
-You were in a tight spot.
-l handled it.

518
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,433
-You need a partner.
-l had one. Job got too tough.

519
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,993
I'm back. You got some dust
on your coat.

520
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,085
So you got your memory back.

521
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:45,651
-What the hell is going on?
-Don't know.

522
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,287
-The Light of Zartha?
-Never heard of it.

523
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:49,653
Cool.

524
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:55,174
You don't remember
the Light of Zartha?

525
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,996
Must've neuralyzed myself
to keep it from myself.

526
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:01,366
-Good plan. What you doing?
-I do the driving.

527
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,683
-Wait, no. Whoa.
-l remember that.

528
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:07,561
What you remember is you used
to drive that old, busted jawn.

529
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,896
I drive the new hotness.

530
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,632
Old and busted, new hotness.

531
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,861
Old busted hotness.

532
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,859
-Serleena, please.
-Been a long time, Zed.

533
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,550
I'm just touched you remembered me.
Makes me fuzzy all over.

534
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:36,094
Never forget a pretty
whatever you are.

535
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,225
Zed?

536
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:42,265
Zed? Look at you.

537
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,270
Twenty-five years,
and you're still such a looker.

538
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,330
Cut out the meat and dairy.

539
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:51,052
And you, still a pile of squirmy
crap in a different wrapper.

540
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,069
So feisty.
Look, we both need the same thing.

541
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,762
Bring him in.

542
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:01,585
Don't think so.

543
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:05,372
What about the Light's secret?
If it's not off Earth by midnight...

544
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,050
.. it self-destructs,
annihilating your little planet.

545
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:13,034
Il lose, you lose.
I win, everything keeps spinning.

546
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,384
You don't want the Light on Earth
any more than I do.

547
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:21,968
All right, Serleena.

548
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,087
You win.

549
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,846
Zed? Is that you?
! could be Agent Em.

550
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,881
Zed. Hello?

551
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,375
So feisty.

552
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:52,326
Fastest way back to MiB,
you take this right on 39th.

553
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,313
Right here. Right.

554
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:58,231
Next right on 37th.

555
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:00,786
Right here. Right!

556
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:02,788
We're not going back.

557
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:07,604
Headquarters has been breached, man.
We need to peel caps and split wigs.

558
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,821
Not ready.

559
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:13,500
Look, you've been out for five years.
That's a long time.

560
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:16,817
l understand you're scared.
I'm a little scared too.

561
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:19,178
-I'm not scared.
-Me neither.

562
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,114
I just thought we was bonding.

563
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,839
You're acting like a rookie.
Splitting wigs and stepping on caps.

564
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,111
-No wonder Zed brought me back.
-He did it because you messed up.

565
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,152
Your attitude makes for
a stressful environment.

566
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:38,222
Tell it to the hand.
Stressful is what we got back at MiB.

567
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:42,929
Exactly. Serleena broke into MiB
in order to lure me back.

568
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:45,471
Into a trap.

569
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,146
Which is why we can't
bust in there.

570
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:51,262
We need a plan. Where we going?
Scene of the crime?

571
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:55,492
-You're the boss.
-Scene of the crime. That's a left.

572
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:00,646
I'll contact the witness.
We'll talk to her.

573
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:03,982
Things have changed.
We used to neuralyze witnesses.

574
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,236
See, originally, I'd--

575
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:12,402
No, I was going to--
l interrogated her.

576
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,156
-Then neuralyzed her?
-What?

577
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:14,708
-Then neuralyzed her?
-What?

578
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:19,709
MiB code 773I-1 clearly states
that all civilian personnel--

579
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,674
-Drop that weapon!
-No!

580
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,433
Jay, I'm-- I'm sorry.

581
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:27,382
No, no, I'm fine. It's my fault.

582
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,242
Kay, my partner.
Laura, the witness.

583
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:31,698
Pleasure.

584
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:37,150
Thanks for sending those agents over
to keep an eye on me last night.

585
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,632
MiB procedural code 594-B...

586
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,830
.. States that MiB personnel
shall never be used--

587
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:48,077
Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here.
l assume the perp was over here.

588
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:50,263
Ben.

589
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:53,118
-Was he 5'7", thinning hair?
-You knew him?

590
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,858
Nope. Never seen him before
in my life.

591
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,850
That is a hell of a fish.

592
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,985
Wait a minute.

593
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,575
You left yourself clues?

594
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:13,484
In case I was deneuralyzed because
my replacement couldn't handle it.

595
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:18,250
If the joker that had got deneuralyzed
hadn't created the situation--

596
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,159
Boys.

597
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,776
All right. You pointing at something.

598
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,500
Excuse me.

599
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:33,603
The astronaut.

600
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,426
Jay?

601
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:39,061
Okay, all right. He's pointing....

602
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,240
He's like...

603
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:45,828
Who would stack boxes like this?

604
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:49,587
A box stacker who's not stacking boxes.
He's leaving clues.

605
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,531
It's an arrow.

606
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,850
-Jay?
-You're slowing me down, slick.

607
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,485
Whatever we're looking for
is in these cabinets, right here.

608
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,024
Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil.

609
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,020
I hope I'm not slowing you down.

610
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,220
Good work, partner. Yeah.

611
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:18,293
-We gotta figure out where it goes.
-l know where.

612
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:22,579
-No. Not yet.
-MiB code 773 clearly says--

613
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:26,064
I know the code,
but she might be important to me.

614
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,247
To us. Well, for help.
To help us later.

615
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,596
Well, she can't stay here.
They'll be back.

616
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:38,883
-You can stay with friends of mine.
-People like you?

617
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:40,507
Kind of.

618
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,174
Jay!

619
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,730
-Low bridge!
-What's going on, man?

620
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,078
Hey, what's happening, fellas?
MiB is code 101.

621
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,279
-Bad.
-Very bad.

622
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:54,184
-l need your help. This is Laura.
-Laura!

623
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,312
Easy, easy!

624
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:57,557
They're worms.

625
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,755
Once you go worm,
that's what you'll yearn.

626
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:04,254
-That's what they say. They just:
-I've dated worse.

627
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,475
They're suspended
for stealing from duty-free.

628
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:10,425
-We were framed.
-Zed's wormophobic.

629
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,075
-Kay!
-You're back!

630
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,803
-They said you were dead.
-We're double-parked.

631
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:16,976
Laura's very important to me.

632
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,067
To us. To the stuff--
Me and you, the stuff we're doing.

633
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:25,276
-Keep an eye on her.
-I'll keep both on her.

634
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:26,685
No problem!

635
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:31,482
-Why don't you sit here?
-Like you got a shot.

636
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,009
Hey, shut up!

637
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:38,697
My communicator, in case you need it.

638
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,096
-Nice move.
-Okay.

639
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,277
-Just watch out for Neeble.
-Which one's Neeble?

640
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,137
-Which one of y'all is Neeble?
-Yo, mama!

641
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:59,269
Him, right there. It's fine.
Everything's straight. It's safe.

642
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,700
Don't fall asleep.

643
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,147
Twister!

644
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:11,458
Run over your plan one more time.
I'm struggling with it.

645
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:15,625
You neuralyzed memory of the Light
but left yourself clues.

646
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,136
Right.

647
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:21,884
Photo pointing to a key in a pizzeria
which opens a locker at Grand Central.

648
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:26,243
-In the locker, we'll find another clue.
-That's the plan.

649
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:32,339
-l like to keep my enemies confused.
-We're all confused.

650
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:38,862
-Are you gonna slow me down?
-Your brain's working on old software.

651
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,516
Why don't you go grab us some coffee?

652
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:45,029
Sure. How do you take it?
Black? Couple cubes of kiss my ass?

653
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,618
I don't know what's in there,
so step back.

654
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,239
Kay, for real, man.
Open the damn locker.

655
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:59,351
Kay!
He's back! The light giver!

656
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,000
All hail Kay! All hail Kay!

657
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,080
Oh, Kay, can you see
By the dawn's early light

658
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:09,237
You are the man who would be king
of the train locker.

659
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,623
Praise Kay!

660
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:15,140
Oh, good and gentle townsfolk
of Locker C-18...

661
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:19,023
-...did l leave anything here?
-Yes. The timekeeper.

662
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,970
Left to illuminate our streets
and hearts.

663
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:26,386
-I've been looking everywhere for this.
-Merciful one! The clock tower!

664
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:29,504
I got y'all, it's cool.
Check this out.

665
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:32,857
Titanium case.
Waterproof to over 300 meters.

666
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:36,261
-That's banging.
-Who are you, stranger?

667
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,414
Jay.

668
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,979
All hail Jay!
All hail Jay!

669
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,465
Oh, Jay, can you see

670
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,577
-Oh, merciful Jay, the keeper of--
-Come on.

671
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,391
-Wait! The commandments!
-The tablet!

672
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:52,487
The tablet! The tablet!
The tablet! The tablet!

673
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,570
We have lived by its word, and peace
has reigned throughout our world.

674
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,223
Pass it on to others! So that they too
may be enlightened!

675
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,264
Be kind! Rewind!

676
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,249
Reconcile your past...

677
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,018
..in order to move into your future!

678
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:09,558
Two for one every Wednesday.

679
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,973
Give twice as much as ye receive
on our most sacred of days.

680
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,580
Every Wednesday.

681
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:18,225
Large adult entertainment section
in the back.

682
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,462
That's just nasty.

683
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,484
-What's with the video card?
-Don't know.

684
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,240
-The watch?
-A reminder.

685
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,829
-Of what?
-Can't remember.

686
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,037
Guess.

687
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,645
I guess we have till midnight.
59 minutes to figure it out.

688
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:41,138
Look. Here's an idea. Let's stop
chasing butt-backwards clues...

689
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:45,471
..get a couple fission carbonizers
and get our headquarters back.

690
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,050
It's all about to make sense, kid.

691
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,035
Is this card valid?

692
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:55,259
-This card hasn't been used in years.
-I've been away on business.

693
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:57,943
-Billions of frequent flier miles.
-Try and use them.

694
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,935
l wanted to go to Cambodia. You can
get a lobster dinner for a dollar.

695
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,490
The airlines black out holidays.
It's a conspiracy, I'm sure, 1 mean--

696
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,674
Can you tell us anything
about the account?

697
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,107
You never checked out a tape.

698
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,440
You reserved one once,
but you never picked it up.

699
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:19,520
-Newton.
-There's a rat in the toilet.

700
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,733
It's all stopped up.
You're gonna have to pee in the sin--

701
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,067
-Still think I'm paranoid?
-Yeah.

702
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:35,995
Gentlemen, my name is Newton.
Il run the place. Seen any aliens lately?

703
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,553
-You need professional help.
-He's getting it. It's not working.

704
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:43,198
Okay, so, new case, huh?

705
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,779
Episode 27, Light of Zartha.

706
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:48,750
Got it.

707
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,856
Jarra, it's a sin they've kept
a genius like you locked away.

708
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,963
Their agent Jay caught me siphoning
ozone to sell on the black market.

709
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:59,321
They're touchy about global warming.

710
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,853
I need a spacecraft that can travel
300 times the speed of light.

711
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,190
I'll give you
whatever you want.

712
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:07,816
-Give me Jay. We'll call it even.
-Groovy.

713
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,069
You've got till midnight.

714
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:18,699
Gatbot, I got a little
something special for you.

715
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:26,074
Newton? Newton, is that you?

716
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,773
Yes, Mom, I'm up here
with some friends.

717
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:30,653
l wanna have your baby.

718
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:32,861
Would you like some mini-pizza?

719
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,776
You guys want some mini-pizzas?
They're good.

720
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,137
They're like mini-bagels,
with pizza stuff on them.

721
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:43,157
She'll put a little fontina cheese on.

722
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:47,147
She has palsy, so she ends
up putting a lot of cheese on.

723
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:54,145
No, thanks, we're cool.

724
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:55,688
All right.

725
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,781
Over here.

726
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,790
This is it.

727
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,275
Finally some hard evidence.

728
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:11,041
Gentlemen, before I play the tape,
one question:

729
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,645
What's up with anal probing?

730
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:17,461
Aliens travel billions of light
years just to check out our--

731
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,091
Boy, move.

732
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,087
Okay. Just a question.

733
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:27,604
Here is one of their stories
that "never happened"...

734
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:31,611
...from one of their files
that doesn't exist.

735
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:37,873
1978, Devastating war of Zartha
had raged on for 50 years.

736
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,205
Looks like Spielberg's work.

737
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:44,020
But the Zarthans had a great treasure,
the Light of Zartha.

738
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,621
A source of power so awesome,
it alone...

739
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,357
...could mean victory and restoration
for the Zarthans...

740
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:55,869
...or complete annihilation, if it
fell into the hands of the Kylothians.

741
00:57:56,573 --> 00:58:00,173
A group of Zarthans made the journey,
led by the Keeper of the Light...

742
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,134
Lauranna.

743
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:04,586
...Princess Lauranna.

744
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:09,158
Lauranna beseeched the Men in Black
to help her hide the Light on Earth.

745
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,966
But they could not intervene.

746
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:13,502
No.

747
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:15,348
It was night.

748
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:18,954
And it was raining.

749
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,026
You've been very wise.

750
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:25,375
Kay, please. If Serleena takes
the Light, it's the end of our world,

751
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:29,500
If we extend protection for the Light
beyond Earth...

752
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:33,002
...we put Earth in jeopardy.
We must remain neutral.

753
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,860
-Where is it?
-We're neutral, remember?

754
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,310
If you want it, go get it.

755
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,129
No!

756
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,470
And so never knowing it happened...

757
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,499
the people of Earth
were once again saved...

758
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,772
..by a secret society of protectors--

759
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,720
I shouldn't have.

760
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,036
You never sent it off the planet.

761
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:30,693
You hid it here.

762
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,099
The worm guys.

763
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,902
Are you one of Newton's
friends from therapy?

764
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,361
-Yes, ma'am, l am. Look here, please.
-Would you like some mini-pizz--?

765
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,346
A neuralyz--

766
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,716
Okay, first, get some contact lenses.

767
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,343
Joints look like they pick up cable.

768
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:59,832
Second, take her to Cambodia. Get
her lobster. Pay more than a dollar.

769
01:00:00,564 --> 01:00:03,464
Third, the second y'all get back
from Cambodia...

770
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:06,694
...move your bum ass
out of your mom's house.

771
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,347
-Let's go.
-Boy, you like 40 years old.

772
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,826
-Agent Jay?
-All right, all right.

773
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,785
And there ain't no such thing
as aliens or Men in Black.

774
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:25,296
-You wanna go to Cambodia?
-Yeah.

775
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:29,054
Hey, Mom?

776
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,666
Communicator, Jay.

777
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:35,256
-Laura, it's me.
-Jay, we're playing Twister.

778
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,345
What's up, Jay?

779
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,604
-Quit touching my butt!
-l thought it was your face.

780
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:43,830
They're good at this.
They don't have spines.

781
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,984
They were telling me about Oprah,
from Chicago.

782
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:50,351
Maybe landed in Chicago.

783
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,600
-Are you wearing a bracelet?
-Yeah.

784
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:55,013
Is it glowing?

785
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,887
-It's never done that before.
-We're on our way.

786
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:04,766
Communicator, Frank.

787
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:10,122
Deactivate the lockdown. We're headed
to the worm guys. We found the Light.

788
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:13,367
Got it, Jay. Scrad?

789
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,859
Bitch.

790
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,842
Why didn't you say I love you?

791
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:21,310
-He's a dog. I don't even like him.
-No, the girl. You're sweet on her.

792
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,825
That's why you didn't neuralyze her.
You got emotionally involved.

793
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:29,332
-Like you did with Lauranna?
-I put the entire planet in danger.

794
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,923
I don't want to see you
making my mistakes.

795
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,859
Whatever, man.

796
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,509
Laura?

797
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:48,537
Damn!

798
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:54,806
Never stood half a chance.

799
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:57,239
Oh, boy.

800
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,291
That's gonna leave a scar.

801
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,528
-Where's Laura?
-MiB headquarters.

802
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,670
-Some dumb two-headed guy.
-They got the bracelet.

803
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,654
We got 39 minutes.
You guys...

804
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,060
.. pull yourselves together.

805
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:13,993
Damn.

806
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:17,342
That's feeling better.

807
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:20,167
-Hey, guys, wait up!
-Let me grab my drink!

808
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,450
Serleena has the bracelet.
Why take Laura?

809
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:23,892
She also wants me.

810
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:27,107
-What's the book say?
-We're off book. I say split some wigs.

811
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,637
-We need wig-splitting weapons.
-Got them.

812
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:38,142
Paw Paw's coming to visit me.
Hello, Paw Paw.

813
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,318
Paw Paw and ZuZu love
to see what's going on in the garden.

814
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:46,858
Don't worry, folks. I used to live
here. Came to pick up a few things.

815
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:51,767
Nice place.

816
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,391
See you.

817
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,818
You did not see a room
full of weapons or four aliens.

818
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,728
You will cherish and love each other
for the rest of your lives.

819
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:24,711
Which could be the next 28 minutes,
so get to loving and cherishing.

820
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,708
And she can stay up
as late as she want...

821
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,514
..and have cookies
and candy and stuff.

822
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:43,647
Four minutes to launch.

823
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:45,787
Four minutes to launch.

824
01:03:46,723 --> 01:03:50,263
-Your ship is ready.
-Good. Send it to Kyloth now.

825
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,210
Ready, guys?

826
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:57,462
Lock and load, baby.

827
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,361
-You ready, kid?
-Kid?

828
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:02,395
l saved the world
from a Kreelon invasion.

829
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:06,598
They're the Backstreet Boys of
the universe. They throw snowballs?

830
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:09,167
Know what you're doing?

831
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,142
I'm about to attack one
of the most feared aliens...

832
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,551
.. with four worms and a mailman.
Let's make it hot.

833
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:17,229
No, no, wait!

834
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,179
A code 101 lockdown!

835
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:29,168
The building gets pressurized.
Nothing in, nothing out. I knew that.

836
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,613
Yeah, you knew.
Front and center, worms!

837
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,174
You got it.

838
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:44,806
It's about time you guys got here.
That lady is causing all kinds of hell.

839
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:08,672
Yummy. Someone I need to eat.

840
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,732
Get to the launch pad. The bracelet
shows the departure point.

841
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,126
-Do not come back for me.
-What?

842
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:17,915
Do not come back for me.

843
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:26,085
-Worm guys, give me some cover fire.
-Too scared, can't move.

844
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,316
Go!

845
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,758
-Limber.
-Go to subcontrol panel 7-R-Delta.

846
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:56,111
-Shut off power so they can't take off.
-Can't. Too scared.

847
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:00,034
-That way.
-Away from the bullets.

848
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:01,953
No problem.

849
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,476
Nice to see you again, Kay.

850
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,759
-Three minutes to launch.
-Jay!

851
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,111
Three minutes to launch.

852
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:29,174
Hello, Jay. Long time.

853
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:31,709
Jarra! What's up, man?
You look great.

854
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,498
-What's it been? Five years?
-And 42 days.

855
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,041
You count every one
when you're locked away.

856
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:45,146
Over our dead titanium bodies!

857
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:46,925
Two minutes.

858
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,353
Let's play this one by ear.

859
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:02,100
-l should have vaporized you before.
-You really did love Lauranna.

860
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,424
Didn't you, Kay?

861
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,734
You silly little man.

862
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,028
Two minutes to launch.

863
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,482
Just go, I'll be fine!

864
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,647
What you talking about?
I'm winning.

865
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:47,667
Jarra, you are under arrest
for being that ugly...

866
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:50,791
..and for making that many copies.
Surrender!

867
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:52,973
l want him in pieces.

868
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:57,922
Jarra Jr. is going, going...

869
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:00,455
..gone!

870
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,603
-Rectum.
-Damn near killed him!

871
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:17,642
Never get tired of that one.

872
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,337
-Where do we shut off the power?
-Don't know.

873
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:30,133
-I'm fine. I'll be there in a minute.
-No, he won't.

874
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,673
Down to one now, Jarra!

875
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,504
Thirty seconds to launch.

876
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,981
Fifteen seconds to launch.

877
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:06,042
Ten seconds to launch.

878
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:07,689
Eight.

879
01:09:08,011 --> 01:09:09,181
Seven.

880
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:10,711
Six.

881
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,216
Five.

882
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:13,537
Four.

883
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:14,840
Three.

884
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,111
Two.

885
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:19,453
Launch terminated.

886
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,196
-What did you mean, leave you?
-Well, he took your gun.

887
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,282
Cracked your head.
Slammed you across the room.

888
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:30,366
-Half the time you were on your back.
-Look, that's how I fight.

889
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,737
You've lost, you insignificant speck.

890
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:36,893
You've wasted 25 years
of my time, and for what?

891
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:41,046
The total annihilation of Zartha.
All because you went mushy.

892
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:45,431
I'll give you one last chance
to surrender, you slimy invertebrate.

893
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:49,245
-What are you gonna do to stop me?
-Not me. Him.

894
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,741
Your flight's been canceled.

895
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:04,629
Shut down power. Shut down power.
Buttons, buttons. I'm guessing...

896
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,324
Yeah.

897
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,527
-Worms!
-Sorry.

898
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,218
-Give me the bracelet.
-I'm going with you.

899
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,085
Everybody in the car.
Everybody.

900
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:37,117
This bracelet is what
everybody's been after?

901
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,153
It's often something small.

902
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:42,755
It's not the Light.
It tells us the departure point.

903
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:45,302
If we don't get there in 11 minutes...

904
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:48,432
.. that bracelet will go nuclear
and destroy Earth.

905
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,268
What?!

906
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:51,950
Hello.

907
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,452
-Wait.
-l know what I'm doing.

908
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:10,969
Damn.

909
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:15,612
-Modified to hyper-speed!
-Seat belts.

910
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:20,308
What's that?

911
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,599
At hyper-speed, you have
to use the navigational stalk.

912
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:32,733
Toggle switches for the ailerons.
Joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder.

913
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,370
I just want you to know--

914
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,632
Hold on to that for one second.

915
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,928
Computer, worms.

916
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:51,693
I said, "Bitch, if you don't want me
to kick your skinny Zone Diet ass...

917
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:55,875
-...turn around and exit the planet."
-Frank, where are you?

918
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,802
Main hall, egg display.

919
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,667
We're taking fire.
Kay pushed the red button.

920
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:04,614
Computer at MiB can destroy
bogey. I'll walk you through it.

921
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:11,423
Jay? Frank. You were the best darn
partner a Remoolian could ever have.

922
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:13,905
Godspeed.

923
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:16,431
Frank? Frank?

924
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:19,907
Okay, here we go, automatic pilot.

925
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:26,165
-It is not automatic piloting.
-He doesn't operate at hyper-speed.

926
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:29,833
-l could use a steering wheel!
-This is what we got.

927
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:34,628
-Didn't you ever have a Game Boy?
-What's that?

928
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:36,491
You know what? Move.

929
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,070
That is not the navigational stalk!

930
01:12:52,335 --> 01:12:54,085
Okay, straight down.

931
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,271
Idiots.

932
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:12,979
Subway may not be the best place
to lose her.

933
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:16,981
-Where is he?
-He?

934
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,700
Jeff. Hang on!

935
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:22,032
Oops.

936
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:24,356
Teeth.

937
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,064
Running out of time, Kay.
Where is the Light?

938
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:03,948
Right here.

939
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:07,101
-What?
-What, I'm the Light?

940
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,557
-No. No way.
-You have a planet to save.

941
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:13,217
You're mistaken. I work at a pizzeria.

942
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:17,163
Two days ago, I was running a post
office. You are who you are.

943
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,540
Laura, you are the Light.

944
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:24,370
The leader of your people.
Their spirit and their hope.

945
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:27,364
The power is within you
to save a planet.

946
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:32,203
I protected you until it was
your time. Your time is now.

947
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,949
You will save a world.
You know things before they happen.

948
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:42,416
-I'm a Libra.
-You're Zarthan.

949
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:46,565
-When you get sad, it rains.
-Lots of people get sad when it rains.

950
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:49,753
It rains because you're sad, baby.

951
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:44,705
It's not fair.

952
01:15:50,813 --> 01:15:52,243
Never is.

953
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,646
We are who we are...

954
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:58,208
..even if we sometimes forget.

955
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:10,180
Jeff, lam so not in the mood for you!

956
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,186
Get back in the subway!
Now!

957
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,050
That's not good.

958
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,418
Wait! No!

959
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:26,217
Jay!

960
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:30,882
I cannot emphasize strongly enough how
much we need you on that transport.

961
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:34,842
Laura! You have to go!

962
01:16:35,558 --> 01:16:36,758
Oh, jeez.

963
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:41,421
Go. He's fine.
He does this all the time.

964
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:43,945
Nope!

965
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:49,019
About to lay the smackdown
on your candy ass.

966
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:51,822
Laura! It's your destiny!

967
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,041
l was talking, Kay!

968
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,678
Hey! No biting.

969
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:01,791
If you don't go, we all die.

970
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,537
You're just as beautiful
as your mother.

971
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:16,553
Kay? A little help?

972
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,201
Kay?

973
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:34,401
Might I suggest a bigger gun?

974
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:02,643
-Kid?
-Yeah.

975
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:06,242
-Thanks for bringing me back.
-No problem.

976
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,589
Why didn't you tell me?

977
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:10,791
Would you have let her go?

978
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:35,907
So, what's it like on the outside?
Not doing this every day?

979
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:37,805
It's nice.

980
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:41,487
Sleep late on the weekends.
Watch the Weather Channel.

981
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,324
I did miss this city.

982
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,924
So Laura is Princess Lauranna's
daughter.

983
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:57,223
-Did y'all--?
-MiB's a mess. Let's go, kid.

984
01:18:58,434 --> 01:18:59,514
Let's go?

985
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:03,585
Thousands of people in New York
and New Jersey saw our little event.

986
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:08,113
Plan needs to be thought out.
Plan needs to be cool. What you--?

987
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:15,044
Kid, I'll get you trained yet.

988
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:16,791
I want one of those.

989
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:18,262
Damn!

990
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,309
-Hey.
-Hey.

991
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:26,767
-How you doing?
-I'm good.

992
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:31,209
We've all been there. The girl is gone
and it hurts. Wanna talk?

993
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:33,304
-No.
-l can help.

994
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:34,539
No.

995
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:35,767
Still sulking?

996
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:36,941
-No.
-Yeah.

997
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:40,959
You miss her. It happens to all of us.
I knew this hot young thing.

998
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:44,804
When our bodies were in the positions
of the Kamasutra--

999
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:46,554
Zed!

1000
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,789
Come on, man! Damn!

1001
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:50,907
I'll tell you about dames.

1002
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:54,417
They say they want to be scratched,
but they really want:

1003
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:56,487
Hey! Frank.

1004
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:59,262
What? Still sitting shiva?
Want my advice?

1005
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:01,432
No. No advice.

1006
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,200
No talking.

1007
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:05,139
Hell, no.

1008
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,807
Fellas, ! swear, I'm fine.

1009
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,564
All hail Jay! All hail Jay!

1010
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:15,601
-l brought them from Grand Central.
-Why put them in my locker?

1011
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:18,261
l thought it would put things
in perspective.

1012
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:21,084
It's kind of sad.
