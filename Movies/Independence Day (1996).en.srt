1
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,819
For those who haven't read the plaque,
we'll read the plaque.

2
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,670
“Here men from the planet Earth
first set foot upon the moon."

3
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,155
"July 1969."

4
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,599
“We came in peace for all mankind."

5
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,254
If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman,
I'm hanging up.

6
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,505
Sir, I think you should listen to this.

7
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,756
- Goddamn it!
- Sir?

8
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,370
Come on, baby. Come on!

9
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,353
This better not be
another damn Russian spy job!

10
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,796
Air traffic say the skies are clear.

11
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,655
It's the real thing.
A radio signal from another world.

12
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,115
Let's not jump the gun here.

13
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,324
Get online with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know...

14
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,898
What's with the golf balls?
You're gonna kill me!

15
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,223
Wait, this can't be right.

16
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:47,339
The calculated distance
from source is only 375,000km.

17
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,551
It's coming from the moon.

18
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,449
- Who else knows about this?
- SETI in New Mexico identified a signal.

19
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,206
But, they're even more confused
than we are, sir.

20
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,090
- Major!
- Yes, sir.

21
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,472
Radar reception has been impaired,
but we were able to get these.

22
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,857
We estimate that it has
a diameter of over 550km

23
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,721
and a mass roughly
one fourth the size of our moon.

24
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,445
What the hell is it? A meteor?

25
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,274
- No, sir.
- No, definitely not.

26
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,204
- How do you know?
- Well, sir, it's slowing down.

27
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:47,674
- It's what?
- It's slowing down, sir.

28
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,552
Get me the Secretary of Defense.

29
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,142
Then wake him!

30
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,568
- Hello.
- Hi.

31
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,919
- It's me.
- Hi.

32
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,265
- What time is it there?
- It's 2:45 in the morning.

33
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,806
- [know I didn't wake you.
- As a matter of fact, you did.

34
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,155
Liar.

35
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,199
I have a confession to make.

36
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,971
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful, young brunette.

37
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,772
You didn't let her stay up watching TV?

38
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,382
- Did you?
- Of course not. You're coming home

39
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,142
- right after the luncheon?
- Yes, yes.

40
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,118
- Mommy?
- Here's your mother.

41
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,806
- Hi, honey!
- miss you.

42
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,853
President Whitmore's approval ratings
have slipped below 40%...

43
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,542
He's good.

44
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:53,033
Are the salad days over
for President Whitmore?

45
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:57,507
Leadership as a Gulf War pilot
is different from leadership in politics...

46
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,708
Daddy let me watch Letterman.

47
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,181
Traitor.

48
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,605
They elected a warrior and got a wimp.

49
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,159
- Morning, George.
- Morning, Mr President.

50
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,815
That game couldn't have been pretty.

51
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,111
Thank you, sir.

52
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,440
Connie, you're up awfully early this morning.

53
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,390
They're not attacking your policies,
they're attacking your age.

54
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:27,688
“Whitmore seems less like the President and
more like the orphaned child Oliver asking:

55
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,988
‘Please, sir, I'd like some more."

56
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,474
- That's clever.
- I'm not laughing.

57
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:38,464
Age was not an issue when you stuck to your
guns. You were seen as young, idealistic...

58
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,659
Now the message has gotten lost.

59
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,765
It's too much politics, too much compromise.

60
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,049
Isn't it amazing how quickly
everyone can turn against you?

61
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,944
Mr President, it's the Secretary of Defense.

62
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,357
Yes.

63
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,154
Could you say that again?

64
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,705
So why are you waiting?

65
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,789
My Social Security will expire,
you'll still be sitting there.

66
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,611
- I'm thinking.
- Yeah, well, think already!

67
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,215
Do you know how long it takes
for those cups to decompose?

68
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,940
If you don't move soon,
I'll start to decompose.

69
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,934
Listen, David,
I've been meaning to talk with you.

70
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,192
- It's nice that you see me so much now...
- Don't start, Dad.

71
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:26,366
It's been... what? Four years?
You're still wearing a wedding band?

72
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,907
- Three years.
- You're divorced, move on.

73
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,903
- This is not healthy.
- No, the smoking is not healthy.

74
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,651
Checkmate.

75
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,924
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

76
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,359
- Wait. This is not checkmate.
- See you tomorrow, Pop.

77
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,143
Hold on! This is not checkmate.

78
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,345
Oh... Checkmate!

79
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,517
We've got everybody we have
working on the problem.

80
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,757
I love X-Files too. l hope you get to see it.

81
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,602
David! What's the point in having a beeper
if you don't turn it on?

82
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,988
I was ignoring you.

83
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,218
What's the big emergency?

84
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,983
It started this morning.
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

85
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,334
We got static, snow, all kinds of distortions.
Nobody knows...

86
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,418
There's a reason
we have bins labelled "Recycle".

87
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,324
What the hell is going on? My God in heaven!

88
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,514
So sue me. David! We got a problem!

89
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,050
Did you switch transponder channels?

90
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,190
Please! You think I'd be this panicked
if it was so simple?

91
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,050
OK, let's point the dish at another satellite.

92
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,409
We tried that. It didn't work.
It's almost as though they weren't there.

93
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,571
All right. What have we got here?

94
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,718
This is impossible.

95
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,840
- The signal's all screwed up.
- Stop it! Just leave it alone. You'll break it!

96
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,586
It's so fuzzy.

97
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:09,785
Oh, no.

98
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,668
Morning, Lucas.

99
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:21,022
You see these?
1 got a whole goddamn crop full of these.

100
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:26,884
If your father's not in the air in 20 minutes,
I'm getting someone else.

101
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,775
- Russell!
- Hey, Miguel!

102
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,461
Russell! What are you doing?

103
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,392
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

104
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,622
It's the wrong field, you idiot!

105
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,971
Lucas's farm's on the other side of town!

106
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,630
Are you sure?

107
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,557
CNS is running a story that we're covering up
a nuclear-testing experiment.

108
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,590
They can run with it
if they want to embarrass themselves.

109
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,843
NASA wants to know our position.

110
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,333
Our official position is
we have no official position.

111
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,057
- What is going on here?
- Guys, would I keep you out of the loop?

112
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,534
- Absolutely.
- What? I can't hear you.

113
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,598
At the moment
our satellites are somewhat unreliable.

114
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,711
Isn't it possible
that this thing may just pass us by?

115
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,904
What if it doesn't. Why don't we target
some ICBMs to blow it up?

116
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,151
And risk turning
one dangerous falling object into many?

117
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,028
We don't yet know enough
to make any kind of intelligent judgments.

118
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,375
Luckily the press is making up
their own story for now.

119
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,862
But that's not gonna keep.

120
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,818
- We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.
- Absolutely.

121
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,964
General, tell NORAD we're on DEFCON 3.

122
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,544
- That's not what the President said.
- Isn't that a bit premature?

123
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,721
Over 50% of the armed forces
are on weekend leave.

124
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,930
Plus the commanders and troops
that are in town for the Fourth of July parade.

125
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,161
The object has settled into a stationary orbit.

126
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,021
- Well, that's good news.
- Not really, sir.

127
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,954
Part of it has broken off
into nearly three dozen pieces.

128
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:19,805
Smaller than the whole,
yet over 15 miles in width themselves.

129
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,141
Where are they heading?

130
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,736
They should be entering our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.

131
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,841
- This had better be good.
- Admiral on deck!

132
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,523
Sir, we're looking at a total radar blackout
over a 13km area.

133
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,451
- Let's do a diagnostic check.
- Excuse me, sir.

134
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,863
The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared is totally off the map.

135
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,376
Jeez!

136
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,545
Get me Atlantic Command.

137
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,671
Hang on, sir.

138
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,922
We have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi air space.

139
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,248
- Second sighting?
- Yes, sir. Just came in from the Persian Gulf.

140
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,727
Correction, sir.

141
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,911
We have two confirmed visual contacts.

142
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,089
Mr President, they're tracking another one
off the California coastline!

143
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,288
All right, put it on.
General, you might wanna watch this.

144
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,721
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are interrupting our regular broadcast

145
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,015
to bring you extraordinary events
taking place in Russia.

146
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,839
This unexplained disturbance
and the resulting hysteria are incredible.

147
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,877
How would you describe
what you are seeing?

148
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:12,376
it is clearing the mountains,
moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor.

149
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,342
Widespread panic
has gripped the countryside as

150
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,133
thousands have taken to the streets.

151
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:23,472
it is confirmed. The unexplained
phenomenon is headed for Moscow.

152
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,233
We have an AWAC off the West Coast.

153
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,499
ETA with contact point, three minutes.

154
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,540
Don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see a thing.

155
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,286
I know! I'm blind, sir.
Nothing is registering.

156
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,242
Negative.
We have zero visibility. Visibility is at zero.

157
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,893
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

158
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,044
Captain, the President is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.

159
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,145
We still have zero visibility.

160
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,789
Instrumentation is malfunctioning.

161
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,043
We can't get any kind of reading
on what's in front of us.

162
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,455
Wait a minute.

163
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,291
it may be clearing.

164
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,084
Pull out!

165
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,454
- Line's gone, sir.
- Two more spotted over the Atlantic.

166
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,144
One's moving toward New York,
the other here.

167
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,456
- How long do we have?
- Less than 10 minutes.

168
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,390
Mr President, I recommend
we move you to a secure location.

169
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,244
- Connie, can we expect the same panic?
- More than likely.

170
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,411
- We can discuss this on the way.
- I'm not leaving.

171
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,068
We have to maintain a working government.

172
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:52,781
Take the Vice President, the whole cabinet,
and the Joint Chiefs to a secured location.

173
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,533
I'm staying.

174
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,260
1 don't want to add to a public hysteria
that's gonna cost lives.

175
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,101
Connie, we'll initiate
the emergency broadcast system.

176
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,464
We'll advise people not to panic.

177
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,574
The best idea right now
is to stay in their homes.

178
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,669
Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?

179
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:14,306
Have the cabinet members rendezvous here.
We'll take them to NORAD.

180
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:19,011
Mr President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.

181
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,082
I had a feeling you would.

182
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,186
What happens if they do become hostile?

183
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,549
Then God help us.

184
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,241
There it is.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.

185
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,464
it is apparently what is causing
all the distortions...

186
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,450
David, are you watching this?

187
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,868
There is no evidence that
these phenomena are endangering anyone.

188
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,338
Thus far, reports of oppression...

189
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,841
Marty, I got a lock on that signal pattern
so we can filter it out.

190
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,432
But if my calculations are right,
it'll be gone in seven hours.

191
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:04,929
It's reducing itself every time it recycles
so eventually it'll disappear.

192
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,888
- Are you listening?
- Can you believe this?

193
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,129
Haven't you been watching? David!

194
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:19,538
Good afternoon. So far the phenomenon
has not caused any damage.

195
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,926
We have to ask you to stay calm,
and it's important for everyone not to panic.

196
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,577
We have a fix on three
of the occurrences about to appear...

197
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,657
- It's just unreal.
- Miguel, come here!

198
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,100
One is headed towards Los Angeles.

199
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:38,549
The other two are headed towards New York
and Washington, DC.

200
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,432
Marty.

201
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,235
Jamie says this building
has an old bomb shelter.

202
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,499
- We're heading down there now.
- Everybody! Head down to the basement.

203
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,167
Take it slow, don't run.
Walk down to the basement!

204
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,643
There's no shame in hiding.

205
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,285
I'd better call my mother.

206
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,342
Well, look who we have here.

207
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,918
Russ, I heard you had a little trouble this
morning. Dusted the wrong field.

208
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:25,704
I know you're probably still a little confused
from your hostage experience.

209
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,675
Hostage experience?
Did something happen to you, Russ?

210
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:35,297
Years back he was kidnapped by aliens.
Did all kind of experiments on him and such.

211
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:39,435
Tell ‘em about it, Russ. Get a few beers in him
and he'll tell you all about it.

212
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,712
Won't you, Russ?

213
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,591
Russ, when they took you up
in their spaceship, did they do any...

214
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,159
sexual things?
Do you recall? Do you recollect?

215
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,763
- What's that?
- Let's get outta here.

216
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,064
Wow!

217
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,524
Mommy, lookit!

218
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,621
It's too early, baby.

219
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:05,081
- Is it an earthquake?
- Not even a four-pointer.

220
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,851
Go back to sleep.

221
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,795
Daddy!

222
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,149
What are you doing here?

223
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,952
- You should be in the shelter.
- What's going on?

224
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,001
- Aren't you coming, David?
- I gotta see this.

225
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,024
The signal!

226
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,327
My God!

227
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,979
Now what do we do?

228
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,014
Address the nation.

229
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,833
There's gonna be
a lot of frightened people out there.

230
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,646
Yeah.

231
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,728
I'm one of ‘em.

232
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,353
Hey! Come on!

233
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,875
He's just trying to impress you.

234
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,537
If you wanna impress me, you need to get
a job and stop slobberin' all over my shoes.

235
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,831
I don't believe this. Jasmine!

236
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:42,223
Neighbours are movin’ out. 1 guess
they finally got tired of all these quakes.

237
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,894
A little shake and they runnin’.

238
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,750
Police and fire departments
want everyone to stay off the phone.

239
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,506
There's something on the news
about the quake!

240
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,009
What's up, man?
What you doin’ goin’ out there?

241
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,699
Shooting aliens.

242
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:06,011
Oh, you shootin’ aliens. You think you're
tough, huh? What you got? Turn around.

243
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,284
Come on, let's get you something to eat.

244
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,149
- Watch out! Watch it now!
- I'm gonna go grab the paper.

245
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,127
Dylan!

246
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,278
Come on, honey. Let's go!

247
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,932
Babe, you want some of this coffee?

248
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:54,712
Babe?

249
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,902
Pentagon officials are warning
more ships have arrived

250
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,883
over the capitals
of india, England and Germany,

251
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:11,722
bringing estimates up to between 10 and 15
of these city-size spacecraft.

252
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,781
I know, Ma. Just try and stay calm.

253
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,710
- Tell her to leave town.
- Why? What happened?

254
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,574
- Just do it!
- Ma, listen!

255
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,674
Get your stuff together
and head for Aunt Esther's.

256
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,580
Don't argue with me! Just go!

257
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,950
David! Why did I just
send my mother to Atlanta?

258
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,330
David, talk to me.

259
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,629
The signal in the satellite feed is recycling
down to extinction. Didn't you hear me?

260
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,907
- Not really.
- Countdown.

261
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:43,072
A countdown? To what, David?

262
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,439
It's like in chess.
First you strategically position your pieces.

263
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,604
Then, when the timing's right,
you strike. See?

264
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:58,116
They're positioning themselves everywhere
using one signal to synchronise their efforts.

265
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:02,917
In about six hours, the signal's gonna
disappear and the countdown will be over.

266
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,369
And then what?

267
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,392
Checkmate.

268
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,698
Oh, my God!

269
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,805
Oh, my God, I gotta call my brother.

270
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,627
I'd better call my housekeeper,
and my lawyer!

271
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,710
Ah, forget my lawyer.

272
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,908
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

273
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,138
Good afternoon.

274
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,257
My fellow Americans,

275
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:30,573
a historic and unprecedented event
has occurred.

276
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,803
The question of whether or not
we're alone in the universe

277
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,986
has been answered.

278
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:40,135
Although it's understandable
that many of us feel hesitation or fear,

279
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,256
we must attempt to reserve judgment.

280
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,885
He says he's your husband.

281
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,076
Oh, God.

282
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,985
- What do you want?
- You gotta leave the White House.

283
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,099
This is hardly the time
to be having that old discussion.

284
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,218
You gotta leave Washington.

285
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:02,768
In case you haven't noticed,
we are having a little crisis here!

286
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,715
They have a hidden signal.
They're gonna attack.

287
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,024
- You are just being paranoid!
- It's not paranoia!

288
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,541
The embedding's very subtle.
It was probably overlooked...

289
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,212
Marty, get out of town
as soon as you can. Please?

290
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,162
The staff and I will remain here
as we attempt to communicate.

291
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,568
if you feel compelled to leave these cities,
please do so in an orderly fashion.

292
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,234
Excuse me! Coming through.

293
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:50,081
The arrival of the aliens has caused over
10,000 fender benders in just a few seconds.

294
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,932
But this is just the beginning...

295
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:57,782
- You can't go! You got to call them back!
- I'm not gonna do this with you, Jasmine.

296
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,983
- I've got to report to El Toro.
- You said you was on leave for the Fourth!

297
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,914
Well, they cancelled it!

298
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,385
Look, why are you acting like this?

299
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,207
Why?

300
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,342
That's why!

301
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,560
Look, I really don't think they flew 90 billion
light years to come and start a fight,

302
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,033
and get all rowdy.

303
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:38,876
Why don't you just relax? I'm gonna report
to El Toro, find out what's goin’ on.

304
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:46,141
- What are you doin’ in there, man?
- Nothing, I'm just drivin’.

305
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,619
Look.

306
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,174
- I got these for you.
- Firecrackers!

307
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,399
- You be careful.
- Steve, wait.

308
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,689
- wanna tell you something.
- What is it, Jasmine?

309
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,412
You take care of yourself, you hear?

310
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:06,873
Look,

311
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:12,927
why don't you pack some things and you
and Dylan come stay with me on the base?

312
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,335
You will see that there is nothing
to be scared of.

313
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,059
Really?

314
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,915
- You don't mind?
- Well, I mean...

315
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,902
I will have to let all my other girlfriends
know they can't come over.

316
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:31,746
- I got to postpone a freaky weekend.
- There you go, thinking you're all that.

317
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:35,361
But you are not as charming
as you think you are, sir.

318
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,678
Yes, lam.

319
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,063
- Them big old Dumbo ears.
- Look at you with them chicken legs.

320
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,689
Come on, Dylan.

321
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,990
Look out!

322
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,156
The television said they started looting.
Vultures.

323
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:16,124
- Do you still have the Plymouth?
- David, you don't have a licence.

324
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,965
- You're driving.
- Yeah, I'm... I'm driving?

325
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,521
Come on.

326
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,798
I really want you out of Los Angeles.

327
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:29,133
You're staying there to keep people calm.
I won't let them criticise you for it.

328
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:34,071
- l appreciate your trying to help me.
- Liar. Stick to the truth. You're good at it.

329
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:37,132
OK. I don't want you
in any one of those cities.

330
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,687
I'll leave as soon as the interviews are done.

331
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,810
All right. A helicopter
will be taking you to Nellis.

332
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,350
- And the munchkin?
- She'll meet you there.

333
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,460
All right. I love you.

334
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,560
I love you.

335
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,504
- Bye.
- Bye.

336
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,042
It 's the White House!

337
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,360
- You can't drive up and ring a bell.
- Can't you go any faster?

338
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:09,231
You think they don't know what you know?
She works for the President.

339
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,138
- They know everything.
- They don't know this.

340
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,754
You're gonna educate them, huh?
So are you so smart?

341
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,400
How come you spent eight years
in MIT to become a cable repairman?

342
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,688
All I'm saying is they got people
who handle these things.

343
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:26,655
If they want HBO, they'll call you.
Look at these people, look.

344
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,089
Vultures. They take and then they go.

345
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:32,291
They're going faster than we are.
We're in the fast lane!

346
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,274
- They're cutting me off.
- No one's cutting you off!

347
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,910
- They're getting in front. I can't go faster.
- [don't wanna argue.

348
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,951
- Let's just get there, quickly.
- What's the rush?

349
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,434
You think we'll get to Washington
and it won't be there?

350
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,479
A crop-duster was arrested
as he dropped leaflets from the air.

351
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,719
- Everybody's leavin’.
- Can you give us some of your time?

352
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:57,866
We've got to stop them! I was kidnapped
by space aliens ten years ago!

353
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,320
They did all kinds of experiments on me!

354
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,402
They've been studying us,
finding out our weaknesses!

355
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,754
We've gotta stop ‘em.
They're gonna kill us all!

356
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,975
Some people attribute his behaviour
to post-traumatic stress

357
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,520
from his service as a pilot in Vietnam.

358
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,095
Others have a more unusual theory.

359
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,108
How would you describe Mr Casse?

360
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,680
- Keeps to himself. Quiet.
- Private.

361
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,275
When they took him up in the spaceship,

362
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:27,362
the aliens abused him sexually.

363
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,353
Mr Casse is in the county lockup...

364
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,522
Pack up. We're leaving.

365
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,683
He may be released fater tonight...

366
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,955
Miguel, what about Dad?

367
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,689
This could be our last night on Earth.

368
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,476
You don't wanna die a virgin, do you?

369
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,309
- Come on! We're going.
- No, I'm not goin' anywhere.

370
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:50,801
Miguel!

371
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:54,698
Stop it!

372
00:33:56,434 --> 00:34:00,944
Thanks a lot, partner! Remember.
Get as far away from these things as you can!

373
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,522
You read my mind!

374
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:09,634
We gotta get as far away
from these things as we can!

375
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,258
- They let you out?
- You damn right!

376
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,281
They got bigger fish to fry now,
believe you me!

377
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:17,047
Come on, boy!

378
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,139
The LAPD is asking Los Angelenos
not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft.

379
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,845
You may inadvertently trigger
an interstellar war.

380
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,014
Do you think we can find something better
to do with our time?

381
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,051
Where you been, Stevie?

382
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,513
Man, this is unbelievable. This is, like, huge.

383
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,915
- They've recalled everybody.
- Looks like the mail's still working.

384
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,011
You'll have to do the honours for me.

385
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:47,632
- You're a wuss!
- Whatever. Shut up and read it.

386
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:52,697
It says: "Captain Steven Hiller"... loser.

387
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,761
- Come on!
- Blah blah blah!

388
00:34:57,062 --> 00:35:01,402
“We regret to inform you that
despite your excellent record of service..."

389
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:08,076
I'm sorry, man.
You know what you need to do?

390
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:12,272
You need to, like, kiss some serious booty
to get ahead in this world.

391
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,247
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
See, I like the one-knee approach,

392
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,388
because it puts the booty, like,
right in front of the lip...

393
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,098
- What's this?
- That's nothin’.

394
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,567
What is this?

395
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:30,386
- Jasmine kinda has a thing for dolphins.
- Stevie, this is a wedding ring.

396
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,129
I thought you said
you were gonna break it off?

397
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,418
Well...

398
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,281
Man, you know I really like Jasmine.

399
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,457
You know that, right?

400
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,730
Man, you're never gonna get to fly
the space shuttle if you marry a stripper.

401
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,905
it could only happen in California.
Here's Wendy Walsh with a special report.

402
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:10,223
Hundreds of UFO fanatics have gathered
on rooftops in Los Angeles

403
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,699
to welcome the new arrivals.

404
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,211
Oh, God! I hope they bring back Elvis!

405
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:19,177
I just came in to get my check tonight
and I got talked into working.

406
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,528
Oh, I must have been trippin’.

407
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,663
It's the party event of the century!

408
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,265
Everyone is invited,
especially you-know-who.

409
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,178
- This is so cool!
- Girl, please!

410
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:31,931
Oh, hey! I made it before I came in.

411
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,522
Check it out!

412
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,448
I know you're not gonna join those idiots.

413
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,181
l am going over there as soon as I get off.

414
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,330
- Do you wanna come?
- Tiffany, listen to me a sec.

415
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,813
I've got a really bad feeling about this.
I don't want you to go.

416
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,854
Now promise me you won't.

417
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,113
Come on, girl! Promise me.

418
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,274
I promise.

419
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,448
OK.

420
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,744
Look, I'm out of town for a while. Later.

421
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,804
Everyone is trying to get out of Washington.
We're the only schmucks trying to get in.

422
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,804
What the hell is that?

423
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,098
Pops, this is every phone book in America.

424
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,462
You think an important person
like Constance will be listed?

425
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,676
She keeps her portable phone
listed for emergencies.

426
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,449
Demonstrators in front of
the White House are protesting

427
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,564
the military involvement with
our first contact with the alien visitors.

428
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,325
So?

429
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,590
Do you wanna ring the bell, or should I?

430
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:53,298
- Perfect, she's using it.
- What? It's busy?

431
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:58,531
Yeah, I can use her signal to triangulate
her exact position in the White House.

432
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,581
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

433
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,963
All cable repairmen can, Pops.

434
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,782
The visitors have arrived,
but the President remains at the White House.

435
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:14,096
Question. Are Mr Whitmore's actions
a) ultra brave or b) foolhardy?

436
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,267
- What?
- Don't hang up, sweetie.

437
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,683
David! How did you get this number?

438
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:24,845
- Do me a favour. Walk to the window.
- And I'm looking for what?

439
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,203
You'll see.

440
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,269
Over here.

441
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,649
See us?

442
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,024
How does he do that?

443
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:47,055
In light of our apparent inability
to communicate with the visitors

444
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,585
Pentagon officials have retrofit
this Skylift helicopter

445
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,205
with a visual communications device.

446
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,231
- Mr President.
- Gentlemen, be seated.

447
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,269
- Where are we now?
- We're commencing liftoff.

448
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,165
wand refitted
with these enormous light panels

449
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,831
that are attached to the hull
and onto the sides.

450
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,267
Echo One, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

451
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,490
I repeat, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

452
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,872
Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One, right beside you.

453
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:18,305
This is something I would never believe
that I would be! In the White House!

454
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,731
If knew I was gonna meet the President,
1 would have worn a tie.

455
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,991
Look at me, I look like a schlemiel.

456
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,497
- Oy, my God!
- David,

457
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:33,156
- [ don't know if he'll want to see you.
- Then we're wasting time, we should go.

458
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,745
- Why wouldn't he listen?
- Last time I saw him, we had a fight.

459
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,525
You walked in and punched him in the head.

460
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,904
- The President!
- He wasn't president then.

461
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,593
I punched him, he fought back.
It was a fight!

462
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:48,386
A fight that you started!
David thought I was having an affair.

463
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,823
- With the President?
- Which I wasn't!

464
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,269
Either go get him,
or we should head back.

465
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,471
All right, I'll get him.
Wait here, and don't touch anything!

466
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,475
You punched the President?

467
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:00,791
God!

468
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,160
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.
We're closing in.

469
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,863
Roger that. Begin sequence when ready.

470
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,406
The three choppers are approaching

471
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:22,092
what has been unanimously agreed
to be the front of these spaceships...

472
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,192
You're leaving now?

473
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,731
Hey, see if they've got
those pens they give away.

474
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,180
Dad, what?

475
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,888
I don't have a choice...

476
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,087
- [don't have time for this.
- Two minutes, Tom, please.

477
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,911
Mr President, Julius Levinson. David is my...

478
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,240
- [told you he wouldn't listen.
- You have to tell him now.

479
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,993
David, you have to tell him!
David, tell him!

480
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,933
I know why we have satellite disruption.

481
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,732
All right. Go ahead.

482
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,850
Let's say that you wanted to coordinate with
spaceships on different sides of the Earth.

483
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,641
They couldn't send a direct signal, right?

484
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:10,635
- You mean line of sight?
- Right. The curve of the Earth prevents it.

485
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:15,105
You'd need satellites to relay that signal
in order to reach each ship.

486
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:21,283
Well, l found a signal hidden
inside our own satellite system.

487
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:27,002
Excuse me, Mr President. They're starting.

488
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,504
They're using our own satellites against us.

489
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,610
The clock is ticking.

490
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,360
- Bringing it in to hover.
- Welcome Wagon,

491
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,875
Echo One. Approaching alien ship.

492
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,743
Initiating communication sequence.

493
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,760
Welcome Wagon has commenced.

494
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,129
General Grey, coordinate with the Atlantic
Command. Tell them to evacuate the cities.

495
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,674
Get those helicopters away from the ship.
Call them back!

496
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:13,381
- What the hell's going on?
- We're leaving. Kim! My daughter.

497
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,634
Something's happening.

498
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,249
They're responding.

499
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,124
Something is happening.

500
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:31,665
It looks like there's activity.
This may be a response, Echo One.

501
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,060
We see it too. Can't identify it.

502
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,667
We are evacuating. I repeat,
we are evacuating the White House.

503
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,243
Load the rest of the staff
in the second helicopter.

504
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,188
- Is my wife in the air?
- She will be shortly.

505
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,314
Nice. Very nice.

506
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,659
Good! Close the door! Hatch secure!

507
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,456
We have our own phone.

508
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,087
Move outta here.

509
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,111
The President's ordered an evacuation.

510
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:19,021
Our prayers go out to the pilots‘ families.

511
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,636
- Indeed, God help us all.
- Mrs Whitmore.

512
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,343
The visitors responded with terrifying...

513
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:28,202
Authorities have called for
the evacuation of Los Angeles County.

514
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,736
People are advised to avoid
the highways wherever possible.

515
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,053
Great! Now he tells me.

516
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,994
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

517
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:47,651
Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.

518
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,585
- Can we move it along?
- Dr Katz's office.

519
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,821
- Hello. Dr Katz, please.
- I'm sorry, he's not available.

520
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:13,388
For $300 an hour, you can put me
through to his house in the Hamptons!

521
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,533
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

522
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,600
Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.

523
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,511
Mrs Whitmore!

524
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,341
You must leave now.

525
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,582
The First Lady's secured. We're on the move.

526
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,152
They're opening up!

527
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:09,699
It's so pretty.

528
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:39,945
Get the hell outta here!

529
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,150
Go ahead, pilot.
We're ready to take off right now.

530
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,836
Can we get a blanket for Patricia?

531
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,754
Here.

532
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,085
Time's up.

533
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,727
Oh, crap.

534
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:04,162
Oh, my God! Come on, Dylan! We gotta go!

535
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,464
Come on, Boomer!

536
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,487
Boomer!

537
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,007
Reports are unclear
as to the extent of the devastation,

538
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,511
but it appears that Los Angeles,
Washington, and New York are in ruins.

539
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,013
Good God!

540
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,703
I've been sayin’ it.

541
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:34,245
I've been sayin’ it for ten damn years!
Ain't I, Miguel?

542
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,578
Huh? I've been sayin’ it!

543
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:41,115
Dad, I don't feel good. Pull it over, man.

544
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:53,578
- We're gonna be all right, Troy.
- Yeah, leave me alone. I got it.

545
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,095
Miguel!

546
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,204
Look at all that.

547
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,505
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.

548
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:33,068
That's the advantage of being a fighter pilot.

549
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,904
In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.

550
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,217
This is just...

551
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,388
«not simple any more.

552
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,416
A lot of people died today.

553
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,590
How many didn't have to?

554
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,478
Any news on my wife yet?

555
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,501
The helicopter never made it to Nellis.

556
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,966
No radio contact.

557
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,775
Come on, Dylan. Stay close.

558
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:28,594
Here it is.

559
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,317
What happened, Mommy?

560
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,458
I don't know, baby.

561
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,250
You men will be the first wave
in our counterattack.

562
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:04,493
Our target is to the north,

563
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:07,752
centred above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles.

564
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,015
Our Black Knight Squadron...

565
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,467
- Are you scared, man?
- Nope.

566
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,254
- You?
- Nope.

567
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:21,516
- Hold me!
- Hey, pay attention.

568
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,806
Something you wanna add, Captain Hiller?

569
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:28,359
No, sir. Just a little anxious
to whup ET's ass, that's all.

570
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,632
You'll get your chance.

571
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,944
You'll all get your chance.

572
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,456
Good hunting. Dismissed!

573
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,040
Let's kick the tyres and light the fires,
Big Daddy!

574
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,700
Ready to go, sir!

575
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:48,339
Let's bring it home.
Bring that bad boy home, Captain!

576
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:50,556
- You loose?
- Yes, sir!

577
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:54,998
- Got your victory dance?
- Oh, I got it right here... yeah!

578
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:59,126
Hey, don't get pre-patrol on me.
We don't light up till the fat lady sings.

579
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,137
I'm all ears, brother!

580
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:12,857
You the man!

581
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:20,061
- All right, gentlemen, we're on.
- General, it's NORAD.

582
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,281
- General Grey here.
- Al?

583
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,531
All communications with the cities are down.

584
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:31,841
- All systems gone.
- For intelligence, we believe it's a total loss.

585
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:34,553
How about our boys? Where are they?

586
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:37,662
ETA to target, four minutes.

587
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,486
- [shouldn't have left her.
- Don't worry about it, big man.

588
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,709
I'm sure she got outta here
before it happened.

589
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:55,062
Or, as the good Reverend would say:

590
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:59,282
“Why we're on this particular mission,
we'll never know."

591
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:02,477
“But I do know, here today,

592
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:06,473
that the Black Knights
will emerge victorious once again."

593
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,180
- Amen, man!
- Amen, Reverend.

594
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,953
Holy God!

595
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,459
Lock and load!

596
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,200
Roger that.

597
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:37,044
LA attack squadron
has Amraam missiles locked on target.

598
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,904
Washington and New York squadrons
report lock-on.

599
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,147
- Fire at will.
- Fire at will.

600
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,195
Knights, we are red and free.
Knight One, fox three!

601
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:51,236
Knight Three, fox three!

602
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:52,788
Knight Seven, fox three.

603
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:57,622
The missiles have been fired.

604
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,457
- Are they not getting through?
- No, not one.

605
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,897
Command, Knight One.
Switchin' to Sidewinders, moving in.

606
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:29,707
Knight Three, low 50 knots reference 120.

607
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:33,279
Knight Seven, 120.

608
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,780
Knight One, sweep lock. Fox two.

609
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:37,043
Knight Seven...

610
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,062
Come on!

611
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:52,306
They must have a protective shield
over the hull! Knights, pull up!

612
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:01,035
- Knight Three, pull up!
- Complete failure in the stators!

613
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,071
Pull up!

614
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,729
Blow through!

615
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:16,144
Too many of 'em!

616
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,956
They got another one, sir.

617
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,870
Oh no, you did not shoot
that green shit at me!

618
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,992
I got ya covered, Big Daddy!

619
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:36,735
Damn, they got shields, too!

620
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,124
Let's go, Knights! Move, Knights! Move!

621
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:55,985
Jesus!

622
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,369
They got another one. And two more.
They're dropping like flies.

623
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,460
- We're losing it.
- Get ‘em outta there.

624
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:07,103
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback position.
Abort mission right away!

625
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:14,278
We'll have to make a run for this one!
Let's get low and fast!

626
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,571
I gotcha, Big Daddy! Let's get ‘em!

627
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,496
Watch the deck!

628
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:32,205
- Squadron leader, abort!
- This isn't happening fast enough!

629
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:33,772
Get 'em out!

630
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,750
- The monitor! Where's the picture?
- We've lost the satellite.

631
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,969
- We got two on our six, Jimmy. Shackle!
- Roger.

632
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,009
Come on, come on! Move!

633
00:58:56,566 --> 00:59:00,576
- You told me, like, quite all right!
- They ain't got nothin’ for us! Let's push it!

634
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:04,991
- can't shake ‘em.
- Yes, you can. Just the way I showed you.

635
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:07,892
- I'm gonna try somethin’.
- Nothin’ stupid!

636
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,681
- You know me!
- That's what I mean.

637
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,954
Jimmy, you can't bank at that speed!

638
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,131
Jimmy, he's closing on you!

639
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,866
- Put your mask back on! That's an order!
- I can't breathe!

640
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,077
Jimmy!

641
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,130
No!

642
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:33,198
Affirmative. We have incoming.

643
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:35,727
- Let me have it, son.
- You got it.

644
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,039
Friendly?

645
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,627
- Sergeant?
- [don't think so.

646
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,006
Come on and get me!

647
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:17,689
What are you shooting at?

648
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,955
Where you at, baby?! Come on!

649
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:28,214
You can't hit nothin’!

650
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,285
Low bridge!

651
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,197
See if you can fly that thing under cover!

652
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,176
Hope you got an airbag!

653
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:38,173
Son of a bitch!

654
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:44,009
This way! This way!

655
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:45,973
Get off! Get off of me!

656
01:01:46,303 --> 01:01:49,343
That's what you'll get! Look at you!

657
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,656
Ship all banged up! Who's the man?!

658
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:55,723
Huh? Who's the man?!
Wait till l get another plane!

659
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,403
I'm linin’ all your friends up, right beside you!

660
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,727
Where you at? Huh? Where you at?

661
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:16,775
Welcome to Earth.

662
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,874
That's what I call a close encounter.

663
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:37,377
Baby, stay right here with Boomer.

664
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:49,116
Keys. Come on, keys.

665
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,679
Yes!

666
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,487
Come, baby. Come on!

667
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:59,375
Reports indicate that this battle
has repeated itself all over the world

668
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,346
with the same results.

669
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:04,625
See, Troy? You're feelin’ better already.

670
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,253
Everyone's packin' up.

671
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:12,535
- They said a spaceship is headed this way.
- We'd better leave, too, then.

672
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:25,948
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick.

673
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:29,029
- I don't feel too good.
- Look at me, huh? Like a rock.

674
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:31,875
Could be bad weather or good weather.

675
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:36,702
We could go up or down,
back or forwards, side to side...

676
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,430
What did I say?

677
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,200
- He still gets airsick, huh?
- Yeah.

678
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:49,614
Julius, with all of this...

679
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,990
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.

680
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,520
All he could think of was getting to you.

681
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:03,119
There's still love there, I think.

682
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:07,933
- Love was never a problem.
- All you need is love.

683
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:12,270
John Lennon. Smart man.
Shot in the back, very sad.

684
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:17,724
We've moved as many of
our forces away from our bases as possible.

685
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:22,365
- But we've already sustained heavy losses.
- I spoke with the Joint Chiefs at NORAD.

686
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:26,156
They agree we must counterattack
with a full nuclear strike.

687
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,036
Over American soil?

688
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:32,205
You're saying we should sacrifice
more innocent American civilians?

689
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:35,736
If we don't strike soon,
there may not be much of an America left!

690
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,989
Sir! They've taken out NORAD.

691
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,335
- What?
- It's gone, sir.

692
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,230
My God!

693
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,569
The Vice President? The Joint Chiefs?

694
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,761
Mr President.

695
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:49,428
We must launch.

696
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:53,196
A delay would be more costly
than when you waited to evacuate the cities.

697
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:57,803
You're not gonna launch nuclear weapons.
You'll kill them and us. If we fire nukes...

698
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:02,060
- Sir, may I remind you you are a guest here?
- You ever hear of nuclear winter?

699
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:05,625
- It's the end of life as we know it.
- Just go.

700
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,952
I don't have to go. It can't be allowed!

701
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:11,784
- Shut up! Captain, get him out!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

702
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:17,629
You'd all be dead if it wasn't for my David!
None of you did anything to prevent this!

703
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,665
There was nothing we could do.
We were totally unprepared for this.

704
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:24,279
- Don't give me that!
- Come on.

705
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:27,281
It was, what?
In the 1950s, you had that spaceship.

706
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:31,558
- Dad. Look...
- Yeah, that thing you found in New Mexico!

707
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,069
- Where was that?
- Not the spaceship.

708
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:37,801
Roswell, New Mexico.
You had the spaceship and the bodies!

709
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:40,008
They were locked up in a bunker.

710
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,205
Where was that?

711
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:43,171
David! Area 51. Right?

712
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:46,466
Area 51. You knew then!
And you did nothing.

713
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,115
Sir.

714
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,970
Regardless of what
you may have read in the tabloids,

715
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:56,819
there have never been any spacecraft
recovered by our government.

716
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,577
Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.

717
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,829
And there's no recovered spaceship.

718
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,948
Excuse me, Mr President...

719
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:08,922
That's not entirely accurate.

720
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,644
What? Which part?

721
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:23,948
Hold on, everybody. Hold on!

722
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:25,054
Sorry.

723
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49,287
- Can you give me a hand?
- Sure.

724
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,363
Oh, God.

725
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,518
OK, let's get this off.

726
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:09,704
Here, let me help you.

727
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,759
She's hurt pretty badly.

728
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,782
You know, this was
supposed to be my weekend off.

729
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,640
But, nooo!

730
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:30,259
You got me out here, draggin’
your heavy ass through the burnin’ desert

731
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,640
with your dreadlocks
stickin' out the back of my parachute.

732
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:38,070
You gotta come down here with an attitude,
actin’ all big and bad.

733
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:43,537
And what the hell is that smell?

734
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:50,627
I coulda been at a barbecue!

735
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:55,007
But I ain't mad.
It's all right, it's all right.

736
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,321
Do you need a lift, soldier?

737
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:40,524
When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.

738
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:44,959
It ain't on the map.

739
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,194
Trust me, it's there.

740
01:09:02,971 --> 01:09:04,581
Attention!

741
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,040
Mr President. General.

742
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,076
Welcome to Area 51. Please follow me.

743
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,218
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface

744
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:20,107
and here's our main research facility.

745
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:24,756
- Let's see it.
- Sorry, sir, it's a clean room. It's static free...

746
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,191
Open the door.

747
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:31,108
Yes, sir.

748
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:53,144
My God.

749
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:55,322
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?

750
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:59,355
Two words, Mr President.
Plausible deniability.

751
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,996
I don't get it. Where does all this come from?

752
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:11,622
How do you get funding
for something like this?

753
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,591
You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer,

754
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,594
$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?

755
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:21,409
Mr President, this is Dr Okun.

756
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:26,674
He has headed up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.

757
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:28,893
How do you do?

758
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:31,936
Mr President!

759
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,961
Wow!

760
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,290
This...

761
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,644
What a pleasure!

762
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:40,054
As you can imagine, they...

763
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,080
They don't let us out much.

764
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,563
I can understand that.

765
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:48,796
Well!

766
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:52,045
I guess you'd like to see the big tamale, huh?

767
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,362
Follow me.

768
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,547
She's a beauty, ain't she?

769
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:53,415
As you can see from the repairs, we've been
trying to put her back together since the '60s.

770
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:57,150
You've had this for 40 years
and you know nothing about 'em?

771
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,780
Oh, hell, no.
We know tons about ‘em.

772
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,821
But the neatest stuff...

773
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,843
The neatest stuff has
only happened in the last few days.

774
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:11,363
We can't duplicate their type of power
so we've never been able to experiment.

775
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:17,361
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

776
01:12:18,234 --> 01:12:20,484
The last 24 hours have been really exciting!

777
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:23,483
Exciting? People are dying out there.

778
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,370
Exciting isn't the word
I'd choose to describe it!

779
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,154
You're hoping to fly this thing, huh?

780
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:34,933
You said you can repair their technology.
Can you tell us anything useful about them?

781
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:39,725
Yeah. Well, I mean...
They're not all that dissimilar from us.

782
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:43,429
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

783
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,950
Probably why they're interested in our planet.

784
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:49,187
Hey...

785
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,045
You guys wanna see 'em?

786
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,520
This is...

787
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:07,625
This is the vault.

788
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,130
Or, as some of us have come to call it...

789
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:13,416
the freak show.

790
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:37,685
When we found ‘em,

791
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:41,494
they were wearing
some sort of biomechanical suits.

792
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:45,368
Once we got ‘em off,
we learned a great deal about their anatomy.

793
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:48,535
Eyes, ears. No vocal chords.

794
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:52,361
We assume they communicate
with each other by some other means.

795
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:56,622
You're obviously not thinking
about hand signals and body language.

796
01:13:57,233 --> 01:14:00,633
It's some kind of extrasensory perception.
Telepathy.

797
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:03,558
So...

798
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:06,920
It's an organic life form.

799
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:13,873
- Can they be killed?
- Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

800
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,620
These two died in the crash.

801
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:18,689
This one a few weeks later.

802
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:22,531
You just have to get through
their technology, which is,

803
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:25,768
I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

804
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:28,337
David,

805
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,644
you unlocked part of their technology.

806
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:35,103
- You cracked the code.
- No, no. All l did was stumble on their...

807
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,555
«Signal. I don't know
how helpful I can be.

808
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:42,872
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?

809
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:45,726
Figure out what they haven't thought of yet.

810
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:50,846
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

811
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,560
What code?

812
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,331
Captain Steven Hiller, US Marine Corps.

813
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:28,431
I'm sorry, Captain. You don't have clearance.

814
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:31,639
OK. Come here.

815
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:34,751
You wanna see my clearance?

816
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,731
- Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
- Let 'em pass.

817
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,000
Get the hell out of the way!

818
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,290
Did you see that?

819
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,595
Oh, boy!

820
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,161
- How long has he been unconscious?
- About three hours.

821
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,843
Let's get him in containment.

822
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,201
As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.

823
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:06,267
- When were you planning to inform us?
- It had been deemed classified.

824
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,792
You should have told us about this
when they first arrived!

825
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:14,842
We wouldn't have launched a counterattack
that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots!

826
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:20,260
We could not have known that our fighters
would've been that ineffective! Mr President.

827
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:24,410
The little bit of information we have
comes directly into this room.

828
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,849
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

829
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,900
Destroyed.

830
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:33,969
NATO and Western Allied installations
were the first to be taken out.

831
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,880
Then we were hit.

832
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,908
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.

833
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:41,975
- And our forces?
- We're down to 15%.

834
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:46,210
If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on,

835
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:51,382
we're looking at the worldwide destruction
of every major city

836
01:16:52,141 --> 01:16:54,800
in the next 36 hours.

837
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,615
We're being exterminated.

838
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,681
Mr President!

839
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,100
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

840
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:07,712
- Captain.
- Mr President.

841
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,540
Well done.

842
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:13,615
- Where is it now?
- It's isolated in the containment lab, sir.

843
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:16,450
I'd like to go see it.

844
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:24,230
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

845
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:29,653
Hasn't anyone told you?

846
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:35,068
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

847
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,823
We were lucky.

848
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,409
Today was the first time I used the subway.

849
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:35,181
Thank God for the Metro Rail.

850
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:37,424
These should last us a while.

851
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:40,713
Don't move. I'll get it for you. Stay still.

852
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,011
- He's your son?
- He's my angel.

853
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:48,671
Was his father stationed here?

854
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,934
Nah, he...

855
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,343
He wasn't his father.

856
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:57,336
But I was kinda hopin’
he wanted the job, though.

857
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:04,424
- So what do you do for a living?
- I'm a dancer.

858
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:10,022
- Ballet.
- No. Exotic.

859
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,272
- Sorry.
- Don't be. I'm not.

860
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:21,786
It's good money.
Besides my baby’s worth it.

861
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:24,258
Dylan! Come here.

862
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,349
I want you to meet the First Lady.

863
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:33,056
- Hello.
- Hi.

864
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,615
I didn't know that you'd recognised me.

865
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:39,641
Well, I didn't want to say nothin’.
I voted for the other guy.

866
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:46,947
- Life-support monitors recording.
- So if we screw up, it's all on tape.

867
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,336
Come on.
Let's get this biomechanical suit off.

868
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:53,129
Put the spreader right here, along the ridge.

869
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:57,395
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here.
Pick there. Good.

870
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:00,523
All right, now spread it very, very gently.

871
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,663
Let me get in.

872
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:11,681
Gentle, gentle, that's it.

873
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,920
Run this right in...

874
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:21,566
All right.

875
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:23,954
Let's proceed.

876
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:26,803
Now comes the really icky part.

877
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,054
Oh, boy.

878
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:34,463
This is one smelly, disgusting...

879
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:45,014
Look at it.

880
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,654
It doesn't look alive, does it?

881
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:54,027
The arm is moving.

882
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,712
Doctor? Doctor?

883
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:08,816
Doctor?

884
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,327
Don't move!

885
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,117
Dr Okun?

886
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:25,628
Release me.

887
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:28,165
- Open the door. Get him out!
- No, wait.

888
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,285
Release me.

889
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:00,587
I know there is much
we can learn from each other

890
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,199
if we can negotiate a truce.

891
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:06,399
We can find a way to coexist.

892
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:10,394
Can there be a peace between us?

893
01:23:11,887 --> 01:23:13,786
Peace.

894
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,287
No peace.

895
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:26,039
What is it you want us to do?

896
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,643
Die.

897
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:40,603
Die!

898
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:47,384
Mr President.

899
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:50,704
- Is that glass bulletproof?
- No, sir.

900
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,300
- Are you all right?
- I saw his thoughts.

901
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:18,461
I saw what they're planning to do.

902
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:22,165
They're like locusts.

903
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:24,371
They're moving from planet to planet.

904
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,600
Their whole civilisation.

905
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:30,215
After they've consumed
every natural resource, they move on.

906
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:35,211
And we're next.

907
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:47,794
Nuke 'em.

908
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,227
Let's nuke the bastards.

909
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:04,754
Just my luck. No ice.

910
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,290
I take it you've heard?

911
01:25:08,337 --> 01:25:09,707
Hey, toast.

912
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:14,875
- To the end of the world.
- He didn't come to this decision lightly.

913
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,790
He didn't have any other choice.

914
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:21,612
- Well, you still believe in him.
- Well, he's a good man.

915
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,102
He'd better be. You left me for him.

916
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:29,165
Or, you know... for your career.

917
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,845
You know, it wasn't just my career.

918
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,467
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.

919
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:38,523
I wanted my life to make a difference.
I wanted my life to mean something.

920
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:43,917
And... I wasn't...
ambitious enough for you?

921
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:48,303
David, you could have done anything
you wanted. Research, development...

922
01:25:48,944 --> 01:25:50,374
I was happy where I was.

923
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:54,249
Haven't you ever wanted to be
part of something special?

924
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:59,062
I was part of something special.

925
01:26:14,703 --> 01:26:18,423
Well, if it makes any difference,
I never stopped loving you.

926
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:22,115
But that wasn't enough, was it?

927
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,416
Let's pick it up, man. Let's go!

928
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:54,009
Let's pick it up, man!
We're on a tight schedule! Pick it up, man!

929
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:56,573
Pick it up!

930
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,478
What the hell are you doin'? Get outta there!

931
01:27:02,918 --> 01:27:05,258
I got something I gotta handle.
I'm borrowin'’ it.

932
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:09,027
- No, you're not, sir.
- Do you really wanna shoot me?

933
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,263
Just tell 'em I hit you.

934
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,071
Command, this is Retal Op.

935
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:24,915
Squadron is in the air.
We are on station and awaiting instructions.

936
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:27,727
Break formation. Head to targets.

937
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,570
Sir.

938
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:35,491
They're breaking formation.

939
01:27:35,851 --> 01:27:39,571
- We're initiating sequence code.
- Verification: Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

940
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,738
Which city will be reached first?

941
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,110
Houston, Texas.
ETA, six minutes and counting down.

942
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,180
- Houston.
- The major cities have been deserted.

943
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:52,702
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

944
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:59,304
Command, this is Neighbourhood Watch.
We are in position.

945
01:28:00,342 --> 01:28:02,182
Tracking monitors are locked on.

946
01:28:02,544 --> 01:28:04,943
We are going to visual recon.

947
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:06,840
Roger.

948
01:28:11,153 --> 01:28:13,523
- We have confirmation.
- Launch code confirmed.

949
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,855
Alpha Zulu six eight niner, standing by.

950
01:28:19,928 --> 01:28:22,008
Laser targeting.

951
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:23,687
Locked on.

952
01:28:24,533 --> 01:28:26,963
We're locked on, sir.
Do you wish to deploy?

953
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:33,986
Mr President,
if you wish to deploy, the time is now.

954
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:43,049
- Mr President?
- Deploy.

955
01:28:43,385 --> 01:28:45,845
That's a go. Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

956
01:28:46,755 --> 01:28:48,535
Here we go.

957
01:28:56,031 --> 01:28:57,401
Bird's away.

958
01:28:57,732 --> 01:29:00,512
We have visual confirmation of the missile.
It's on target.

959
01:29:01,636 --> 01:29:02,976
Approaching.

960
01:29:03,872 --> 01:29:05,602
May our children forgive us.

961
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:08,784
Five seconds to impact. Three, two,

962
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,237
one.

963
01:29:12,581 --> 01:29:14,131
It's a hit!

964
01:29:19,154 --> 01:29:21,054
Get down! Get down!

965
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:23,880
Can we confirm
that the target was destroyed?

966
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:27,509
Get the tank commander.
Confirm the target was destroyed.

967
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:31,223
Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?

968
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,460
- Repeat. You're breaking up.
- We have lost visual.

969
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:37,110
Roger that. We're looking for confirmation.

970
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:45,889
We got the bastards.

971
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,824
Good job, everyone! Congratulations.

972
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:54,195
Commander, do you have visual?
We need visual confirmation.

973
01:29:54,823 --> 01:29:56,223
Has the target been destroyed?

974
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:11,742
Negative.

975
01:30:14,943 --> 01:30:16,813
Target remains.

976
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:22,377
repeat, target remains.

977
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:28,855
Call the other planes back.

978
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:31,946
The others might have more luck.
We shouldn't give up!

979
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,420
I said call them back!

980
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:39,344
- Abort.
- Abort mission.

981
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:44,458
Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort, full abort. Do you read?

982
01:31:22,911 --> 01:31:24,691
Jasmine!

983
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,478
You're late!

984
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:41,133
You know I like to make an entrance.

985
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,678
- Where are we going?
- Through there, sir.

986
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:56,101
Mr President. Your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.

987
01:31:56,611 --> 01:32:00,651
- Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier...
- Hey, there she is! Go on!

988
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:06,931
- She doesn't look too good.
- Your wife is bleeding internally.

989
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:10,715
- Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...
- What are you saying?

990
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:13,505
We can't stop the bleeding.

991
01:32:14,396 --> 01:32:16,236
If we'd...

992
01:32:16,598 --> 01:32:19,148
There's nothing we can do for her.

993
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:22,790
We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.

994
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:31,743
- You've gotten bigger, I think.
- l did?

995
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:37,156
You just keep growing and growing.

996
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:40,844
I can't...

997
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:44,051
Hey.

998
01:32:44,359 --> 01:32:48,259
Can you wait outside for a little bit
so Mom can get a rest?

999
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,207
Come on, Munchkin.

1000
01:33:00,108 --> 01:33:03,328
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.

1001
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:07,731
It's OK.

1002
01:33:10,452 --> 01:33:11,822
The doctors...

1003
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:16,884
think that you're... gonna be just fine.

1004
01:33:20,028 --> 01:33:21,668
Liar.

1005
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:19,862
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1006
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:23,387
Yeah.

1007
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:26,839
Mommy's sleeping.

1008
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:03,867
David!

1009
01:35:04,566 --> 01:35:07,226
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm makin’ a mess!

1010
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:09,165
Yeah. This I can see.

1011
01:35:09,504 --> 01:35:13,894
We gotta burn this toxic waste,
pollute the air and rip up the ozone!

1012
01:35:14,609 --> 01:35:16,859
Cos maybe if we screw
this planet up enough...

1013
01:35:18,246 --> 01:35:20,026
«they won't want it any more.

1014
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,811
Wait. David.

1015
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:25,780
- Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

1016
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:30,456
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life. Even myself.

1017
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,763
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

1018
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:44,639
You see, sometimes
we have to remember what we still have.

1019
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:47,844
Like what?

1020
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:53,375
Well, you still have your health.

1021
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,520
David, you need your rest.

1022
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:01,251
Come on! Get off this freezing floor
before you catch cold. Come on!

1023
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,839
- What did you just say?
- About faith?

1024
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:09,598
- Well, you see, a man...
- No.

1025
01:36:10,031 --> 01:36:14,101
- The other part.
- What? I don't want you to catch cold.

1026
01:36:19,841 --> 01:36:21,981
What is that? What is the matter with you?

1027
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:25,340
- Genius.
- Genius?

1028
01:36:25,847 --> 01:36:28,036
My dad. A total genius.

1029
01:36:30,218 --> 01:36:31,858
Jerry, wake up.

1030
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:34,830
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.

1031
01:36:40,061 --> 01:36:41,840
- Look at that!
- Wow!

1032
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:46,070
- Does that thing really fly in outer space?
- It most certainly does.

1033
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:49,251
- Sure doesn't look like it.
- They're here.

1034
01:36:49,704 --> 01:36:52,424
- All right, what's this all about?
- [have no idea.

1035
01:36:52,907 --> 01:36:57,037
Get everybody off.
Right, clear the platform. Let's go.

1036
01:36:58,212 --> 01:37:00,762
- Major Mitchell. Do you have a pistol?
- What?

1037
01:37:01,249 --> 01:37:03,879
- Have you got a gun?
- Sergeant, your sidearm.

1038
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:10,389
See that Coke can on top of the alien craft?
Think you can shoot that thing off?

1039
01:37:11,526 --> 01:37:13,776
- Shoot it.
- Sir?

1040
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:17,340
Go ahead.

1041
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:25,826
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry. My fault.

1042
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:29,237
That Coke can was protected
by the craft's shield.

1043
01:37:29,744 --> 01:37:31,994
- We can't penetrate it.
- What's your point?

1044
01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:36,457
My point is, if we can't beat their defences,
then we gotta get around them.

1045
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:40,248
Major. One more time... Any time.

1046
01:37:51,766 --> 01:37:54,516
- How did you do that?
- I gave it a cold.

1047
01:37:56,137 --> 01:37:59,126
I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

1048
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:04,128
Are you telling us you can send out a signal
that will disable all their shields?

1049
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:09,639
Just like they used our satellites against us,
we can use their own signal against them.

1050
01:38:10,418 --> 01:38:13,258
If we plant a virus into that mother ship,

1051
01:38:13,755 --> 01:38:17,125
it's gonna filter down
into all the corresponding ships below.

1052
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:23,525
I'm sorry. I don't understand. How exactly
do we infect the mother ship with this virus?

1053
01:38:24,432 --> 01:38:26,862
We're... We're gonna

1054
01:38:27,335 --> 01:38:31,255
have to... fly their alien craft
out of our atmosphere and dock with it.

1055
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:34,719
We can enter here,
as shown in these satellite photos.

1056
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:40,009
We then upload the virus, set off
some kind of explosion which'll disable it.

1057
01:38:40,782 --> 01:38:45,972
That'll disorient the smaller ships below
and that could buy you some time to...

1058
01:38:47,455 --> 01:38:49,975
to take ‘em... take 'em out. Take ‘em down.

1059
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:52,795
Do your... Do your stuff.

1060
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:56,687
- This is ridiculous!
- How long would their shields be down?

1061
01:38:58,032 --> 01:39:00,722
Eh... l dunno. A matter of minutes.

1062
01:39:01,202 --> 01:39:05,952
You want us to coordinate a counterstrike
with a window of a few minutes?

1063
01:39:06,741 --> 01:39:09,781
- With shields down, it might be possible.
- Oh, please!

1064
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:13,684
We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!

1065
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:16,357
Not to mention
that this whole cockamamie plan

1066
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:21,233
depends on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.

1067
01:39:21,989 --> 01:39:23,539
1 wouldn't say that, sir.

1068
01:39:23,858 --> 01:39:28,138
I've seen them in action.
I'm aware of their manoeuvring capabilities.

1069
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:32,019
With your permission, General,
I'd like the opportunity to try.

1070
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,180
That thing is a wreck.

1071
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:38,916
It crash-landed in the ‘50s.
We don't even know if it's capable of flying!

1072
01:39:39,474 --> 01:39:41,584
Jim, remove the clamps.

1073
01:40:04,432 --> 01:40:05,692
Any questions?

1074
01:40:10,805 --> 01:40:12,585
Let's do it.

1075
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:17,560
All right, you heard the President...

1076
01:40:17,879 --> 01:40:20,949
- Good luck, pilot.
- Thank you, Mr President.

1077
01:40:21,482 --> 01:40:23,262
A virus.

1078
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:25,658
Your idea.

1079
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,800
That's right.

1080
01:40:33,828 --> 01:40:36,438
Do you really think you can fly that thing?

1081
01:40:36,898 --> 01:40:40,438
Do you really think
you can do all that bullshit you just said?

1082
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:51,353
I understand you are upset
over your wife's death.

1083
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:54,329
But that's no excuse
for making another fatal mistake.

1084
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:58,852
No, my mistake was to appoint a snivelling
weasel like you as Secretary of Defense.

1085
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,950
- You don't understand!
- However,

1086
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:05,580
that is one mistake I am thankful to say
that I don't have to live with.

1087
01:41:06,127 --> 01:41:08,527
- Mr President...
- Mr Nimsiki,

1088
01:41:08,963 --> 01:41:11,242
you're fired.

1089
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:16,967
Let's organise every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly ‘em.

1090
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:20,202
- Yes, sir.
- He can't do that.

1091
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:23,168
Well, he just did.

1092
01:41:27,381 --> 01:41:31,221
Command has attempted to list casualties
and losses, but information is sketchy.

1093
01:41:31,886 --> 01:41:34,346
We know they've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.

1094
01:41:34,789 --> 01:41:39,099
There's a strong possibility reinforcements
are hiding in the Golan Straits.

1095
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:45,566
- What is he saying?
- They're getting a signal. Old Morse code.

1096
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,759
It's from the Americans.

1097
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,440
They want to organise a counteroffensive!

1098
01:42:04,819 --> 01:42:07,449
It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?

1099
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,984
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions

1100
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:38,021
- in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
- Impressive. Considering it's all done with...

1101
01:42:38,786 --> 01:42:39,896
Morse code.

1102
01:42:40,588 --> 01:42:43,777
- The armed forces here?
- We have sufficient aircraft, but...

1103
01:42:44,392 --> 01:42:47,232
- But what?
- Pilots are comin’ up short.

1104
01:42:47,762 --> 01:42:49,491
Well, then, find ‘em.

1105
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:53,840
Ham radio operators from New York to Japan
trade rumours of military forces in hiding,

1106
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:58,222
unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...

1107
01:42:59,774 --> 01:43:01,884
We're planning to launch a counteroffensive.

1108
01:43:02,276 --> 01:43:03,736
With our depleted manpower,

1109
01:43:04,045 --> 01:43:07,005
we're asking that anyone with
flight experience come forward.

1110
01:43:07,515 --> 01:43:11,935
Military training is preferable,
but anyone who can fly would be useful.

1111
01:43:13,454 --> 01:43:15,563
I can fly. I'm a pilot.

1112
01:43:18,592 --> 01:43:20,172
All right, guys! Listen up!

1113
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:23,804
Pay attention. These F-18s are
very different than the jets you piloted.

1114
01:43:24,432 --> 01:43:26,362
- It's strong.
- Forgive the expression,

1115
01:43:26,734 --> 01:43:29,284
but this is a crash course in modern avionics.

1116
01:43:29,737 --> 01:43:32,047
- Keep it comin’.
- OK, you got it!

1117
01:43:32,473 --> 01:43:37,393
All right, listen up. First we need some
background information on your experience.

1118
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,492
Let's start with you.

1119
01:43:40,915 --> 01:43:42,935
Who, me?

1120
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:45,597
Well, I'm Russell Casse, sir.

1121
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:50,731
And after 'Nam I got into crop-dusting.

1122
01:43:51,959 --> 01:43:54,648
And been doing that ever since.

1123
01:43:55,129 --> 01:43:59,959
On a personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that

1124
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:03,545
ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago,

1125
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:05,821
I have been dyin’ for some payback.

1126
01:44:06,173 --> 01:44:09,633
I just want you to know
that I won't let you down.

1127
01:44:11,979 --> 01:44:13,789
You have one tactical nuclear missile

1128
01:44:14,148 --> 01:44:17,078
we're loading into this launcher
under the right wing.

1129
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:19,365
This is the firing mechanism.

1130
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,940
It'll be attached to the ship's main console.

1131
01:44:22,356 --> 01:44:24,346
Just like the Amraam launch pad
on a Stealth.

1132
01:44:24,725 --> 01:44:26,945
Except the nuke will not detonate at impact.

1133
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:30,912
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.

1134
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:33,699
Good luck, gentlemen.

1135
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:36,169
30 seconds.

1136
01:44:36,504 --> 01:44:40,193
It's the strongest radio transmitter we had.
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.

1137
01:44:40,808 --> 01:44:43,388
30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it too close?

1138
01:44:43,878 --> 01:44:48,008
We're gonna be well on our way back home
before we shoot that thing off.

1139
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:51,393
Why you? David!

1140
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:57,386
I don't understand why you can't show
someone else how to plant the virus.

1141
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,842
No. Something may go wrong.

1142
01:45:00,161 --> 01:45:02,711
I may have to think quickly,
adjust the signal.

1143
01:45:03,164 --> 01:45:06,414
Who knows? Hey, you know how
I'm always trying to save the planet?

1144
01:45:11,705 --> 01:45:13,485
Here's my chance.

1145
01:45:16,177 --> 01:45:17,956
Now he gets ambitious.

1146
01:45:18,846 --> 01:45:21,335
- It's too tight.
- Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.

1147
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:24,212
OK. All right, l guess that's good enough.

1148
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:26,492
So. How do I look?

1149
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:30,238
Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.

1150
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,450
- You're late!
- Well, you know me.

1151
01:45:35,863 --> 01:45:38,413
I know. You like to make a big entrance.

1152
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:42,713
Listen. Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1153
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:45,080
Sorry for what, babe?

1154
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:48,820
I should have done this a long time ago.

1155
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:52,032
- Do you have the ring?
- Yes, sir.

1156
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:54,510
Here, make yourself useful.

1157
01:45:58,752 --> 01:46:00,532
Witnesses?

1158
01:46:02,156 --> 01:46:05,876
- We got hung up.
- Well, let's get this show on the road.

1159
01:46:06,493 --> 01:46:09,863
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here in the sight of God

1160
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:12,391
and in the presence of these witnesses

1161
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,930
to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1162
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:19,950
Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed,

1163
01:46:21,642 --> 01:46:24,572
please speak now
or for ever hold your peace.

1164
01:46:27,114 --> 01:46:29,864
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife,

1165
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:33,044
to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?

1166
01:46:34,321 --> 01:46:38,510
Will you love her, comfort her, honour
and keep her in sickness and in health,

1167
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:41,215
and, forsaking all others,

1168
01:46:41,662 --> 01:46:45,142
keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?

1169
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,910
1 will.

1170
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:01,386
Good morning.

1171
01:47:05,152 --> 01:47:06,962
They're a little young.

1172
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:09,732
That they are.

1173
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:12,958
They look a little nervous.

1174
01:47:13,294 --> 01:47:16,604
I need all flight crews
to report to their designated areas.

1175
01:47:18,465 --> 01:47:20,865
- Major. Can I borrow that?
- Sir.

1176
01:47:22,703 --> 01:47:24,103
Good morning.

1177
01:47:27,041 --> 01:47:29,211
Good morning.

1178
01:47:30,344 --> 01:47:32,394
In less than an hour,

1179
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:36,880
aircraft from here
will join others from around the world.

1180
01:47:37,551 --> 01:47:42,441
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.

1181
01:47:44,992 --> 01:47:49,412
Mankind. That word should have
new meaning for all of us today.

1182
01:47:51,565 --> 01:47:54,375
We can't be consumed
by our petty differences any more.

1183
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:59,110
We will be united in our common interest.

1184
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:03,817
Perhaps it's fate
that today is the Fourth of July.

1185
01:48:05,546 --> 01:48:08,446
And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.

1186
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:12,929
Not from tyranny, oppression or persecution.

1187
01:48:15,956 --> 01:48:18,206
But from annihilation.

1188
01:48:18,993 --> 01:48:21,013
We're fighting for our right to live.

1189
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:24,192
To exist.

1190
01:48:25,566 --> 01:48:27,755
And should we win the day,

1191
01:48:28,535 --> 01:48:32,345
the Fourth of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday,

1192
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:36,701
but as the day
when the world declared in one voice,

1193
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:39,317
“We will not go quietly into the night!"

1194
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:43,064
“We will not vanish without a fight!"

1195
01:48:44,418 --> 01:48:46,228
“We're going to live on!"

1196
01:48:47,121 --> 01:48:49,111
“We're going to survive!"

1197
01:48:49,823 --> 01:48:53,513
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!

1198
01:49:19,019 --> 01:49:21,299
- Let's go!
- Mr President. Right this way, sir.

1199
01:49:22,189 --> 01:49:24,089
- I've got your gear over here.
- Good luck!

1200
01:49:24,458 --> 01:49:28,268
I've got you a jumpsuit and your gear is here.
You've got your choice of helmets.

1201
01:49:31,298 --> 01:49:34,258
Mr President,
I'd sure like to know what you're doing.

1202
01:49:34,835 --> 01:49:36,565
I'm acombat pilot, Will.

1203
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:40,943
I belong in the air.

1204
01:49:47,815 --> 01:49:50,065
OK, sir. Let's get you airborne.

1205
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:57,684
As soon as I get back,
we're gonna light those fireworks, right?

1206
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:06,931
Here. Take these.

1207
01:50:10,537 --> 01:50:11,967
Just in case.

1208
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:13,746
Where's...

1209
01:50:25,018 --> 01:50:26,508
Just in case.

1210
01:50:29,256 --> 01:50:30,836
I'm very proud of you.

1211
01:50:42,936 --> 01:50:44,806
Be careful, OK?

1212
01:50:51,912 --> 01:50:53,692
It's time.

1213
01:50:58,952 --> 01:51:01,532
- Il love you.
- Il love you.

1214
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:09,180
Oh, damn! Wait a minute.

1215
01:51:09,596 --> 01:51:12,026
- We gotta find some cigars. I can't...
- Here!

1216
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:14,749
Take these. My last two.

1217
01:51:15,536 --> 01:51:17,466
You are a lifesaver.

1218
01:51:18,305 --> 01:51:20,415
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing!

1219
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:50,434
- Missile launch.
- Oh, crap!

1220
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:52,755
What do I hit? Which one?

1221
01:51:55,242 --> 01:51:57,612
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinkin’.

1222
01:52:13,327 --> 01:52:15,317
This is our victory dance.

1223
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:17,509
Not until the fat lady sings.

1224
01:52:17,864 --> 01:52:20,114
Oh. Yes, OK.

1225
01:52:20,567 --> 01:52:24,047
- This is important.
- Fat lady. I gotcha.

1226
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:28,353
Open launch tunnel.

1227
01:52:47,995 --> 01:52:50,215
Shaky, huh?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

1228
01:52:50,631 --> 01:52:53,561
Make sure your seat backs
are in their upright position.

1229
01:52:54,067 --> 01:52:55,297
Yeah. Is it?

1230
01:52:59,206 --> 01:53:00,286
Let's rock'n'roll.

1231
01:53:07,214 --> 01:53:08,264
Oops.

1232
01:53:08,515 --> 01:53:10,475
Oops? What does that mean?

1233
01:53:10,851 --> 01:53:13,431
No, I got it.
Some jerk didn't put the thing...

1234
01:53:13,887 --> 01:53:16,437
What do you mean, saying "oops" there?

1235
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:19,080
What do you say we try that one again, huh?

1236
01:53:19,893 --> 01:53:22,083
Yes, without the "oops".

1237
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:25,429
Thataway!

1238
01:53:31,104 --> 01:53:33,094
I have got to get me one of these!

1239
01:53:42,883 --> 01:53:46,393
- What was that? Don't do that!
- Just tryin’ to get a feel for the old girl.

1240
01:53:47,054 --> 01:53:49,164
No, don't. Leave her alone.

1241
01:53:49,556 --> 01:53:51,165
- Look, no hands!
- Steve!

1242
01:53:55,896 --> 01:53:58,146
- You're all secure, sir.
- Grey, do you read me?

1243
01:53:58,565 --> 01:54:01,525
Roger, Eagle One.
Your primary target has shifted course.

1244
01:54:02,102 --> 01:54:04,501
- Which way they headed?
- [ think our secret's out.

1245
01:54:04,938 --> 01:54:06,578
They're headed straight for us.

1246
01:54:06,907 --> 01:54:09,097
ETA, 26 minutes.

1247
01:54:13,313 --> 01:54:16,333
- You still with me over there?
- What the hell was I thinking?

1248
01:54:27,794 --> 01:54:30,224
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

1249
01:54:42,142 --> 01:54:43,922
Head straight for it.

1250
01:54:50,016 --> 01:54:52,186
- What the hell?
- Don't touch ‘em. Don't!

1251
01:54:52,586 --> 01:54:55,926
I was counting on this.
They are bringing us in.

1252
01:54:57,391 --> 01:55:00,821
- When the hell was you gonna tell me?
- Oops.

1253
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:05,470
We've got to work on our communication.

1254
01:55:21,314 --> 01:55:24,744
- We have visual.
- Do not engage until we've confirmed

1255
01:55:25,352 --> 01:55:27,222
- the package has been delivered.
- Roger.

1256
01:55:32,959 --> 01:55:35,269
Major, what happens if that thing gets here

1257
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:38,069
before the virus is planted?

1258
01:55:38,432 --> 01:55:40,712
This facility's buried deep within a mountain.

1259
01:55:41,201 --> 01:55:43,691
- It should provide us some protection.
- Great.

1260
01:55:44,204 --> 01:55:46,483
What about the people outside?

1261
01:55:54,014 --> 01:55:55,944
Lieutenant Sell? We got incoming.

1262
01:56:55,609 --> 01:56:56,809
Oh, my God.

1263
01:57:30,911 --> 01:57:32,691
Look at that.

1264
01:57:41,988 --> 01:57:45,588
There must be thousands of ‘em. Millions.
What the hell are they doing?

1265
01:57:46,927 --> 01:57:49,007
Looks like they're preparing an invasion.

1266
01:58:16,823 --> 01:58:19,403
Hey, I don't like this!
This is stupid. They can see us.

1267
01:58:19,893 --> 01:58:21,643
No. This thing comes fully loaded.

1268
01:58:21,995 --> 01:58:24,575
AMIFM radio, reclining bucket seats and

1269
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:26,811
power windows.

1270
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:44,286
Come on, baby.

1271
01:58:46,953 --> 01:58:48,733
We're in.

1272
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:55,810
Do it.

1273
01:58:56,396 --> 01:58:57,416
Do it.

1274
01:58:57,664 --> 01:58:59,654
Sir, he’s uploading the virus.

1275
01:59:00,033 --> 01:59:01,933
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.

1276
01:59:02,369 --> 01:59:04,148
Stand by to engage.

1277
01:59:05,805 --> 01:59:07,735
Roger. Eagle One, check left.

1278
01:59:12,178 --> 01:59:14,168
Listen up! We have an emergency situation.

1279
01:59:14,581 --> 01:59:16,541
We need you to grab everything you can.

1280
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:20,320
Only what you can carry.
We need to get you inside immediately.

1281
01:59:24,557 --> 01:59:26,337
The virus is in.

1282
01:59:31,431 --> 01:59:33,830
All we can do now is pray.

1283
01:59:35,201 --> 01:59:38,511
- Delivery complete. Engage.
- Delivery complete. It's a go!

1284
01:59:39,072 --> 01:59:41,122
Eagle One. Fox three.

1285
01:59:45,512 --> 01:59:47,001
Gentlemen, this is it.

1286
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:52,150
Come on, come on.

1287
02:00:05,432 --> 02:00:07,012
Virus ineffective. Disengage.

1288
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:09,032
- Get your people out.
- Disengage.

1289
02:00:09,436 --> 02:00:11,215
Rear flank, follow suit.

1290
02:00:12,806 --> 02:00:15,085
Hold on, Command.

1291
02:00:15,508 --> 02:00:19,108
- [ want another shot at it.
- Sir, strongly recommend you disengage.

1292
02:00:19,713 --> 02:00:22,322
Eagle One. Fox three.

1293
02:00:36,763 --> 02:00:40,193
- Direct hit!
- It's a hit! Squadron leaders, fire at will!

1294
02:00:41,301 --> 02:00:43,701
We're going in. Squadron leaders, take flight.

1295
02:00:45,705 --> 02:00:47,315
- Eagle Six at seven.
- Eagle Five at three.

1296
02:00:47,674 --> 02:00:49,424
Eagle One. Fox two.

1297
02:00:49,776 --> 02:00:51,066
Eagle Twenty! Fox two!

1298
02:01:00,253 --> 02:01:03,152
Evasive manoeuvres!
Squadron leaders, evasive manoeuvres!

1299
02:01:04,791 --> 02:01:06,811
Prepare to engage!

1300
02:01:10,697 --> 02:01:13,627
All right, Mr President! Here we go!

1301
02:01:14,134 --> 02:01:15,884
All right, baby. I've gotcha!

1302
02:01:18,204 --> 02:01:20,224
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

1303
02:01:22,408 --> 02:01:24,428
OK. Job's done. Let's go home.

1304
02:01:25,211 --> 02:01:26,731
Gladly.

1305
02:01:31,084 --> 02:01:33,044
- What's up?
- It's stuck.

1306
02:01:33,419 --> 02:01:35,318
- What?
- It's not responding. It's stuck.

1307
02:01:35,722 --> 02:01:36,831
Try it again.

1308
02:01:51,905 --> 02:01:53,865
Come on!

1309
02:02:10,423 --> 02:02:12,063
Come on! Inside!

1310
02:02:12,392 --> 02:02:15,001
- Go to the elevator!
- Hurry!

1311
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:27,949
Steve!

1312
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:37,030
- What are you doin’?
- They're overriding the system.

1313
02:02:37,584 --> 02:02:38,874
Oh, shit!

1314
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:41,730
Hide.

1315
02:02:47,227 --> 02:02:50,157
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands.

1316
02:02:50,663 --> 02:02:51,652
Come on in.

1317
02:02:55,068 --> 02:02:57,558
- I'm not Jewish.
- Nobody's perfect.

1318
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,040
Are you scared?

1319
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:04,015
Me, too.

1320
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:09,340
Eagle Seven, fox two.

1321
02:03:09,716 --> 02:03:11,736
Eagle Three, fox two.

1322
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:20,580
We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're not causing enough damage.

1323
02:03:21,127 --> 02:03:22,557
It's directly over us.

1324
02:03:31,938 --> 02:03:33,988
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon!

1325
02:03:34,407 --> 02:03:36,577
Then let's take it out before it takes us out.

1326
02:03:42,348 --> 02:03:44,018
Target at 12 o'clock!

1327
02:03:46,352 --> 02:03:47,722
My God! They're everywhere!

1328
02:03:49,489 --> 02:03:51,568
- Bandits on our tail! Locked on!
- l see 'em.

1329
02:03:55,261 --> 02:03:57,221
Squadron leaders, I want a weapons check!

1330
02:03:59,232 --> 02:04:01,482
You're outta time! Disable it now!

1331
02:04:05,538 --> 02:04:07,817
I'm in range. Locking on.

1332
02:04:08,274 --> 02:04:10,554
I've got tone. Eagle One, fox two!

1333
02:04:20,586 --> 02:04:22,106
That is a negative impact.

1334
02:04:22,455 --> 02:04:24,265
That is an NI. Negative impact.

1335
02:04:25,258 --> 02:04:27,278
I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!

1336
02:04:27,727 --> 02:04:29,037
I'm on it.

1337
02:04:32,298 --> 02:04:33,197
Jesus!

1338
02:04:35,735 --> 02:04:38,804
- All missiles have been fired.
- Outta time! Get your ass outta there!

1339
02:04:39,339 --> 02:04:41,529
- We're not done yet!
- Get as far away as you can!

1340
02:04:41,941 --> 02:04:43,670
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?

1341
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:45,880
Sorry I'm late, Mr President!

1342
02:04:49,983 --> 02:04:51,183
I got hung up back there!

1343
02:04:51,484 --> 02:04:54,444
- Pilot, you armed?
- Armed and ready, sir!

1344
02:04:54,954 --> 02:04:56,264

1345
02:04:57,924 --> 02:04:59,794
- Who is that guy?
- Put him on speaker.

1346
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,179
- Pilot, identify yourself.
- It's me!

1347
02:05:02,562 --> 02:05:03,992
Russell Casse, sir.

1348
02:05:05,031 --> 02:05:06,811
I told you I wouldn't let you down!

1349
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:09,916
Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds, will ya?

1350
02:05:10,403 --> 02:05:14,883
OK. Echo Niner, Echo Seven, take
flanking positions. Look after this guy, OK?

1351
02:05:16,009 --> 02:05:18,999
All right, boys.
Let's give Mr Casse some cover!

1352
02:05:19,545 --> 02:05:22,035
Gentlemen! Let's plough the road!

1353
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:32,090
We'll draw them off and it's all yours!

1354
02:05:33,593 --> 02:05:35,523
Look out! Comin’ through!

1355
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:39,674
I've got tone.

1356
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,990
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1357
02:05:50,476 --> 02:05:52,085
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1358
02:05:55,615 --> 02:05:56,815
It's jammed.

1359
02:05:58,017 --> 02:05:59,597
it won't fire.

1360
02:06:03,256 --> 02:06:04,246
Dammit!

1361
02:06:15,168 --> 02:06:16,947
Do me a favour.

1362
02:06:19,205 --> 02:06:22,545
Tell my children I love them very much.

1363
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:27,978
All right, you alien assholes!

1364
02:06:29,315 --> 02:06:31,625
In the words of my generation,

1365
02:06:32,051 --> 02:06:35,531
up yours!

1366
02:06:36,522 --> 02:06:37,782
Dad! What's he doing?

1367
02:06:38,057 --> 02:06:39,227
Come on, baby!

1368
02:06:39,492 --> 02:06:41,302
Come on, baby, come on!

1369
02:06:44,597 --> 02:06:45,857
Good luck, buddy.

1370
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:58,180
Hello, boys! I'm back!

1371
02:07:20,166 --> 02:07:23,266
He did it! The son of a bitch did it!

1372
02:07:26,706 --> 02:07:27,756
All right!

1373
02:07:50,763 --> 02:07:53,803
What your father did was very brave.

1374
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:56,702
You should be proud of him.

1375
02:07:57,136 --> 02:07:58,746
lam.

1376
02:08:16,189 --> 02:08:19,879
We know how to take 'em out, General.
Spread the word.

1377
02:08:23,429 --> 02:08:26,499
Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.

1378
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:29,873
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

1379
02:08:44,116 --> 02:08:45,316
What do you think?

1380
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:48,780
Checkmate.

1381
02:09:15,014 --> 02:09:19,374
Well, it's funny. I always thought
things like these would kill me.

1382
02:09:32,031 --> 02:09:34,221
It's been a pleasure.

1383
02:09:34,634 --> 02:09:35,684
Steve, you too.

1384
02:09:39,972 --> 02:09:41,552
Only one thing left to do.

1385
02:09:48,381 --> 02:09:50,751
- Ready?
- Yes, sir.

1386
02:09:57,523 --> 02:10:00,273
Hey, all right! Look at us.

1387
02:10:00,793 --> 02:10:03,753
Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

1388
02:10:04,263 --> 02:10:06,923
- Y'all take care. Nothing but love for ya!
- Goodbye!

1389
02:10:09,201 --> 02:10:11,221
Do you think they know
what's about to happen?

1390
02:10:11,637 --> 02:10:13,746
Not a chance in hell. Good night!

1391
02:10:21,414 --> 02:10:22,143
Peace!

1392
02:10:36,495 --> 02:10:38,455
We're loose.
Can you get us outta here in 30 seconds?

1393
02:10:38,864 --> 02:10:42,374
- l ain't heard no fat lady!
- Forget the fat lady. Drive us outta here!

1394
02:10:51,544 --> 02:10:53,064
- They're chasing us.
- You think?

1395
02:11:01,754 --> 02:11:05,034
- Oh, that was a hit.
- We're not hit! Stop side-seat driving!

1396
02:11:09,362 --> 02:11:11,412
Left! Tunnel! Exit left!

1397
02:11:11,797 --> 02:11:14,317
- Where the hell do you think I'm goin’?
- OK. We're...

1398
02:11:33,486 --> 02:11:35,476
- They're closing up on us.
- Shut up!

1399
02:11:35,888 --> 02:11:38,878
Go faster, must go faster. Go, go, go!

1400
02:11:52,371 --> 02:11:54,271
Elvis has left the building!

1401
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:56,450
Thank you very much.

1402
02:11:56,809 --> 02:11:58,619
I love you, man.

1403
02:13:29,869 --> 02:13:32,709
They're goin’ down all over the world, Tom.
We got ‘em beat.

1404
02:13:33,272 --> 02:13:36,022
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?

1405
02:13:39,845 --> 02:13:44,645
We lost contact with Captain Hiller
and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.

1406
02:13:48,521 --> 02:13:49,661
Hold it!

1407
02:13:49,922 --> 02:13:52,201
Hold on, sir. I've got something on radar.

1408
02:14:40,172 --> 02:14:42,102
Sorry, sir.

1409
02:14:42,508 --> 02:14:43,558
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1410
02:14:43,809 --> 02:14:46,209
- Well done, Captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1411
02:14:54,119 --> 02:14:55,018
David...

1412
02:14:57,723 --> 02:14:59,243
Not bad.

1413
02:15:02,595 --> 02:15:04,875
Thank you, Mr President.

1414
02:15:06,131 --> 02:15:07,711
Not too bad at all.

1415
02:15:09,134 --> 02:15:11,304
Oh, so this is healthy?

1416
02:15:11,737 --> 02:15:14,047
Oh, I could get used to it.

1417
02:15:32,024 --> 02:15:33,924
Happy Fourth of July, Daddy.

1418
02:15:34,326 --> 02:15:36,136
Same to you, Munchkin.

1419
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:40,309
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

1420
02:15:40,733 --> 02:15:41,933
Yeah.
