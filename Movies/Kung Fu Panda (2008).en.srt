1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,722
Legend tells of a legendary warrior...

2
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,986
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,519
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

4
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:02,934
Il see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

5
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,797
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

6
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:10,081
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

7
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,557
Enough talk. Let's fight!

8
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,166
Shashabooey!

9
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,921
He was so deadly in fact,

10
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,462
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

11
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,913
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

12
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,682
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

13
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,965
There is no charge for awesomeness.

14
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,635
Or attractiveness.

15
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,137
Kablooey!

16
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,762
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

17
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,685
They were no match for his bodacity!

18
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:57,646
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

19
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,456
Even the most heroic heroes in China,

20
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,815
the Furious Five,

21
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,737
bowed in respect
to this great master.

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,770
We should hang out.

23
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,052
Agreed.

24
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,933
But hanging out would have to wait.

25
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:19,168
Because when you're facing
the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain,

26
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,233
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

27
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,209
Po! Get up!

28
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,028
You'll be late for work!

29
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,423
What?

30
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,077
Po! Get up!

31
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,745
Po. What are you doing up there?

32
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,352
Nothing.

33
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:03,327
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

34
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,127
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

35
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,792
Coming!

36
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,362
Sorry, Dad.

37
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,063
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

38
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,556
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

39
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,102
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

40
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,561
About what?

41
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,182
What were you dreaming about?

42
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,791
What was I...?

43
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,570
l was dreaming about...

44
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:44,727
.. noodles.

45
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,545
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

46
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,312
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

47
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,868
Careful! That soup is sharp.

48
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,524
Oh, happy day!

49
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,199
My son, finally having the noodle dream!

50
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,584
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

51
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,785
This is a sign, Po.

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,660
A sign of what?

53
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,019
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

54
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,643
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

55
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,499
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

56
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,264
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father...

57
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,104
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.

58
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,871
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,289
No, it was the dream.

60
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,769
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

61
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,706
But, Dad, didn't you ever want
to do something else?

62
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,887
Something besides noodles?

63
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,762
Actually, when I was young and crazy,

64
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,755
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

65
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,312
Why didn't you?

66
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,074
Because it was a stupid dream.

67
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,079
Can you imagine me making tofu?

68
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,787
Tofu.

69
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,055
No! We all have our place in this world.

70
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,786
Mine is here, and yours is...

71
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,252
I know, is here.

72
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,223
No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12

73
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,486
Service with a smile.

74
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,820
Well done, students...
if you were trying to disappoint me.

75
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,191
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

76
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,198
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis...

77
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,228
- Master Shifu.
- What?!

78
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,659
It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.

79
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,887
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

80
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:20,542
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

81
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,017
So, nothing's wrong?

82
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,660
Well, didn't say that.

83
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,547
You were saying?

84
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,495
I have had a vision.

85
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,342
Tai Lung will return.

86
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,866
That is impossible! He is in prison.

87
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,682
Nothing is impossible.

88
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:03,759
Zeng!

89
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,007
Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them

90
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,289
to double the guards, double
their weapons, double everything!

91
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,433
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

92
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,021
Yes, Master Shifu!

93
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:19,575
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

94
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,783
We must do something! We can't let him
march on the valley, take his revenge!

95
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,214
He'll...

96
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,431
Your mind is like this water,
my friend.

97
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,801
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

98
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,108
But if you allow it to settle...

99
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,128
..the answer becomes clear.

100
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,344
The Dragon Scroll.

101
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,800
It is time.

102
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:49,225
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

103
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:54,029
To become the Dragon Warrior?

104
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,964
I don't know.

105
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,650
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

106
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,714
Watch it!

107
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,225
Sorry. Suck it up!

108
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,251
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

109
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,524
What?

110
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,627
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

111
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:18,134
Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of
the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

112
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,455
We've waited 1,000 years for this!
Take the bowl!

113
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,531
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history! Just go!

114
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,856
Po! Where are you going?

115
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,059
To the Jade Palace.

116
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,431
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

117
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,789
The whole valley will be there,
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

118
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,648
Selling noodles?

119
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,632
But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...

120
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,861
- Yeah?
- l was thinking maybe I...

121
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:54,974
..could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

122
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,092
That's my boy!

123
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,364
I told you that dream was a sign.

124
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,282
Yeah. Glad I had it.

125
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,956
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

126
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,535
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

127
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,781
Come on. Come on!

128
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,829
Almost there.

129
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,144
What?

130
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,698
No! Oh, no!

131
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,493
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

132
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,441
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

133
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,310
It is an historic day.

134
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,098
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

135
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,663
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

136
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,072
Are your students ready?

137
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,939
Yes, Master Oogway.

138
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,847
Know this, old friend.

139
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,939
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley...

140
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,843
...but also to you.

141
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:39,972
Let the tournament begin!

142
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,193
Let the tournament begin!

143
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,288
Yeah.

144
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,038
No, no, wait!

145
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,310
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

146
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,742
Yes!

147
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,980
Hey! Open the door!

148
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,891
Let me in!

149
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,590
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

150
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,226
it is my great honor
to present to you... Tigress!

151
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:24,406
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

152
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,154
The Furious Five!

153
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,387
Yeah, the Furious Five!

154
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,039
Warriors, prepare!

155
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,520
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

156
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,075
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

157
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,060
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

158
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:55,604
Look at that.

159
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,565
Hey! Get out of the way!

160
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,940
And finally Master Tigress!

161
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,658
And believe me, citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

162
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,370
know!

163
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:46,074
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

164
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,012
l sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.

165
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,348
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

166
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,771
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

167
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,197
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

168
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,042
Yeah.

169
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,651
Po!

170
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,552
What are you doing?!

171
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,104
What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!

172
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,190
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

173
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:53,359
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

174
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,394
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, Dad.

175
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,673
I love kung fu!

176
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:20,535
Come on, son. Let's get back to work.

177
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,960
OK.

178
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,753
Come back!

179
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,776
What's going on?

180
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,226
Where...?

181
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,306
What are you pointing...?

182
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,991
OK. Sorry.

183
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,478
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

184
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,545
How interesting.

185
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,747
Master, are you pointing at me?

186
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,997
- Him.
- Who?

187
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,188
- You.
- Me?

188
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:29,354
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

189
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,523
- What?
- What?!

190
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,254
- What?!
- What?!

191
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,622
Stop, wait! Who told you to...?

192
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,680
Master Oogway, wait.

193
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,776
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

194
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,607
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

195
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,391
That was just an accident!

196
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,061
There are no accidents.

197
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,947
Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

198
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,282
No. If the panda
has not quit by morning

199
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,805
then I will have failed you.

200
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,776
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message...

201
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,170
...from Master Shifu.

202
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,147
What?!

203
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,525
"Double the guard?!"

204
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,336
"Extra precautions?!"

205
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,675
"Your prison may not be adequate?!"

206
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,103
You doubt my prison security?!

207
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,240
Absolutely not.

208
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,286
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

209
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,929
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

210
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,760
Escape from Chorh-Gom prison
is impossible!

211
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,085
Impressive, isn't it?

212
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,868
It's very impressive.

213
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,466
It's very impressive.

214
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,063
One way in, one way out.

215
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,060
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

216
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,851
Yes, except that prisoner...

217
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,724
.. is Tai Lung.

218
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,526
Take us down.

219
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,447
What are you doing?

220
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,250
Oh, my.

221
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,389
Behold Tai Lung.

222
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,127
I'm just gonna wait right here.

223
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:31,353
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

224
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,934
Crossbows! At the ready!

225
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,860
Crossbows?

226
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,398
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

227
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,734
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.

228
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,816
Don't get him mad.

229
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:49,311
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

230
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,613
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

231
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,783
I'm good. I've seen enough.

232
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,179
I'll tell Shifu he
has nothing to worry about.

233
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,620
No, he doesn't.

234
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,803
I'll tell him that.

235
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,785
Can we please go now?

236
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,498
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

237
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:26,959
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

238
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:33,998
Wait a second!

239
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,278
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

240
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,716
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

241
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,350
Look at this place.

242
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,594
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage!

243
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,860
The Sword of Heroes!

244
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,004
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking.

245
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,811
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

246
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,588
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

247
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,623
No!

248
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,587
The legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

249
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,773
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

250
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,523
Hello.

251
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,784
Have you finished sight-seeing?

252
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,976
Sorry, l should have come to you first.

253
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,036
My patience is wearing thin.

254
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,831
Well, ! mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

255
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,323
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

256
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,580
How's it going?

257
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,921
How do you get 5,000...
Master Shifu!

258
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,369
Someone... broke that.

259
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,734
But I'll fix it. Do you have some...

260
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,041
.. glue?

261
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,064
A splinter.

262
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,893
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

263
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,083
- l guess so.
- Wrong!

264
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,816
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will
never be the Dragon Warrior until...

265
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,919
.. you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

266
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,618
So, how does this work?

267
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,531
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or...?

268
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,758
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

269
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,992
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

270
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,951
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

271
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,964
And that is impossible
if that one is someone like you.

272
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,432
Someone like me?

273
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,733
Yes, look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

274
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,541
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

275
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,397
And this ridiculous belly.

276
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,679
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

277
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,046
Now, wait a minute.
That's uncalled for.

278
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,602
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

279
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,658
Listen, Oogway said I was...

280
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,290
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

281
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,089
Oh, you know this hold?

282
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,831
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

283
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,658
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

284
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,205
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

285
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:19,001
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

286
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,408
OK, OK, take it easy.

287
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,880
Now listen closely, panda.

288
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,993
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

289
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,755
I promise you, you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

290
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,268
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

291
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,241
Good.

292
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,223
I can't wait to get started.

293
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,054
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

294
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:22,774
What?

295
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,673
- Now?
- Yes, now.

296
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,819
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

297
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,780
Oh, OK, well...

298
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,555
I don't know
if l can do all of those moves.

299
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,546
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

300
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:43,322
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

301
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:44,786
What level is that?

302
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,030
Well, I'm not a master, but...

303
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,957
.. let's just start at zero. Level zero.

304
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,963
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

305
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,964
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

306
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:02,854
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

307
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,709
But if you insist...

308
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,374
The Furious Five!

309
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,530
You're bigger than your action figures.
Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.

310
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,571
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

311
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,718
Are they gonna watch, or should I wait
till they get back to work?

312
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,064
Hit it.

313
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,366
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

314
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,311
So my kung fu might not be
as good as... later on.

315
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:33,828
Just hit it.

316
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,797
All right.

317
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,899
What you got? You got nothing,
‘cause I got it right here.

318
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,039
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

319
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,412
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

320
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:48,381
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

321
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,400
You've only seen praying mantis.

322
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,389
Or monkey style.

323
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,341
Orl could come at you snickety-snake.

324
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,774
Would you hit it!

325
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,033
All right. All right.

326
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,725
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

327
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:11,953
How's that?

328
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,197
That hurts.

329
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,297
This will be easier than I thought.

330
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,822
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

331
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,109
Those are hard!

332
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,901
My tenders.

333
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,661
How did I do?

334
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,279
There is now a level zero.

335
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:17,909
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

336
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,930
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

337
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,329
What was Master Oogway thinking?

338
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,701
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

339
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,240
He is so mighty!

340
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,869
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

341
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,014
When he walks, the very ground shakes!

342
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,111
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

343
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,479
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

344
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,910
Or even see his toes.

345
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,581
OK.

346
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:20,968
Great.

347
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,421
Hi. You're up.

348
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,919
lam now.

349
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,488
I was just...

350
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,396
Some day, huh?

351
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:46,563
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

352
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,353
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day, so...

353
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,602
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

354
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,249
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

355
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:02,098
It's just...
Man, I'm such a big fan!

356
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,883
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

357
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:08,354
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

358
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,607
Sorry about that.

359
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,149
Look, you don't belong here.

360
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,713
I know. I know. You're right.

361
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,323
I don't have... I just...

362
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,042
My whole life 1 dreamed of...

363
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:29,584
No, I meant you don't belong here.
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

364
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,352
Property of Crane.

365
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,319
OK. Right, right.

366
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,834
So, you want to get to sleep.

367
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,797
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

368
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,955
We got big things tomorrow.

369
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,977
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

370
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,349
What was that?

371
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,823
I didn't say anything.

372
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,965
OK. All right. Good night.

373
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,350
Sleep well.

374
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,944
That seemed a little awkward.

375
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,331
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

376
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,081
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

377
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,620
This is your room.

378
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,748
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

379
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,298
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have

380
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:18,844
any respect for who we are
and what we do,

381
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,525
you will be gone by morning.

382
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,662
Big fan!

383
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,645
l see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

384
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:46,577
Is that what this is? Sorry. ] thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

385
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:51,559
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

386
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:55,734
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

387
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,606
So why are you so upset?

388
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,137
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

389
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,830
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

390
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,304
Probably.

391
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,762
And the Five! Man, you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

392
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,151
Totally.

393
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,919
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

394
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,226
l mean, I'm not like the Five.

395
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,655
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

396
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,742
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

397
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,690
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

398
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,173
Quit, don't quit.

399
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,048
Noodles, don't noodles.

400
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:51,712
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

401
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,991
There's a saying:

402
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,426
Yesterday is history,

403
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,962
tomorrow is a mystery,

404
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,041
but today is a gift.

405
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,954
That is why it is called the present.

406
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,372
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?!

407
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,919
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Gol

408
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,404
Fire crossbows!

409
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,845
Fire!

410
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,546
Fire!

411
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,690
Tai Lung is free! 1 must warn Shifu.

412
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,581
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!

413
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:09,984
Bring it up!

414
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,174
Wait! Bring it back!

415
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,661
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

416
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,730
We're dead. So very, very dead.

417
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,637
Not yet we're not. Now!

418
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,947
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

419
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,363
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

420
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:08,294
l was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

421
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,487
Fly back there and tell them...

422
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:14,089
. the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

423
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,864
Good morning, Master!

424
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,957
Panda!

425
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,098
Panda!

426
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,647
Wake up!

427
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,415
He's quit.

428
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:45,022
What do we do now, with the panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

429
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,430
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

430
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,190
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

431
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,358
What are you doing here?!

432
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,237
Hi! Good morning, Master!

433
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,229
I thought I'd warm up a little.

434
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,462
You're stuck.

435
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,741
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

436
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,491
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

437
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,600
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

438
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,140
Maybe on three. One, two...

439
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,557
.. three.

440
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,936
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

441
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,790
- No, really, l appreciate...
- Ever.

442
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,994
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

443
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,545
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility!

444
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,332
And years longer to apply it in combat!

445
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,542
Put that down!

446
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:49,754
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

447
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,955
Yeah! Excellent.

448
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,162
Let's get started.

449
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,254
- Are you ready?
- was born re...

450
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:04,083
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

451
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,422
That was awesome! Let's go again!

452
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,765
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

453
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,238
Your next opponent will be me.

454
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,141
All right! Yeah, let's go!

455
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,672
Step forth.

456
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,037
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness...

457
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,174
..and make him suffer for it.

458
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,639
Oh, yeah!

459
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,831
To take his strength
and use it against him...

460
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,497
...until he finally falls...

461
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,779
..OF quits.

462
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,694
A real warrior never quits.

463
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,823
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

464
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,403
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

465
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,033
But he will.

466
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:22,285
He's not going to quit, is he?

467
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,064
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

468
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:39,972
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

469
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,318
Trust me, it will.

470
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,709
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

471
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:47,563
- Fat?
- Fur. was going to say fur.

472
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:48,828
Sure you were.

473
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:52,597
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

474
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,134
I'm over here.

475
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,507
Maybe you should look at this again.

476
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,013
Oh, OK.

477
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,858
Stop it. Stop!

478
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,857
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

479
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,767
...but if I didn't know better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

480
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,267
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

481
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,923
...but he wasn't always like that.

482
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,399
According to legend,

483
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,610
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

484
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,935
- No!
- Yes.

485
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,347
But that was before.

486
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,321
Before what?

487
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,810
Before Tai Lung.

488
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,325
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

489
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,341
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

490
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,480
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

491
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:49,582
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

492
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,981
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

493
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,429
He wasn't just a student.

494
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:03,522
Shifu found him as a cub...

495
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,083
..and he raised him as his son.

496
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,498
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

497
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,968
...Shifu trained him.

498
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:20,945
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

499
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,674
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

500
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,025
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

501
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:33,074
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

502
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,182
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

503
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,884
He tried to take the scroll by force.

504
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:46,246
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

505
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,150
But how could he?

506
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:08,154
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

507
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,018
Or since.

508
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,171
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

509
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,547
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

510
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,549
And he's stuck with you.

511
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,393
A big fat panda
who treats it like a joke.

512
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:40,634
That is it!

513
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,582
Wait! My fault!
l accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

514
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:48,574
And may have also stopped his heart.

515
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,913
Inner peace.

516
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,130
Inner peace.

517
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,841
Inner...

518
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,324
Inner peace.

519
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,506
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?!

520
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,410
Inner...

521
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,982
Oh, Zeng.

522
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,708
Excellent.

523
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,676
l could use some good news right now.

524
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,886
Master! Master!

525
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,472
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

526
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,140
Shifu.

527
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,484
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

528
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,185
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

529
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,692
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

530
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,974
That is bad news...

531
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:03,187
.. if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

532
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:07,531
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

533
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,019
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

534
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,509
There are no accidents.

535
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:17,776
Yes, I know. You've said that already.

536
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:21,919
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

537
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,460
Thrice.

538
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,098
My old friend,

539
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,409
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

540
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:33,171
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

541
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:34,877
Illusion?

542
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,743
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

543
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,841
cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

544
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,154
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

545
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,841
But there are things we can control.

546
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:50,946
l can control when the fruit will fall.

547
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,886
And I can control...

548
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,916
..where to plant the seed.

549
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,508
That is no illusion, Master.

550
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,155
Yes.

551
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,584
But no matter what you do

552
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,523
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

553
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:13,226
You may wish for an apple or an orange,
but you will get a peach.

554
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:17,075
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

555
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,928
Maybe it can.

556
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,784
If you are willing to guide it.

557
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:24,834
To nurture it.

558
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,359
To believe in it.

559
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,767
But how? How?

560
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,863
I need your help, Master.

561
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,419
No, you just need to believe.

562
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,593
Promise me, Shifu.

563
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:40,846
Promise me you will believe.

564
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:44,375
I will try.

565
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,960
Good.

566
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,130
My time has come.

567
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:57,431
You must continue
your journey without me.

568
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,551
What are you...? Wait!

569
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,006
Master!

570
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,371
You can't leave me!

571
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,650
You must believe.

572
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,310
Master!

573
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,282
Yeah, so I'm like,
"Fine, you may be a wolf,

574
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,258
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

575
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,558
...but you're a lousy tipper.”

576
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,430
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

577
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,674
I mean, I didn't actually say that...

578
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,580
...but ] thought it...

579
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,375
..in my mind.

580
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,350
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

581
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,197
Order up! Hope you like it.

582
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:13,208
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

583
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:17,451
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

584
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:20,152
What do you mean? This is amazing!

585
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,091
- You're a really good cook.
- l wish my mouth was bigger.

586
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,184
Tigress, you've got to try this.

587
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:28,673
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months

588
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:33,406
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf
and the energy of the universe.

589
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,788
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

590
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:43,720
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

591
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,459
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

592
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:58,152
Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you
lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

593
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:02,904
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

594
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,877
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday...

595
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,960
.. you will have ears like mine.

596
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:11,024
That's good.

597
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:14,785
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

598
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:16,522
It's Shifu!

599
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:19,223
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

600
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:22,772
Master Shifu!

601
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,500
You think this is funny?

602
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,388
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

603
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,835
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

604
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,264
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

605
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,533
And I was saying
you got no sense of humor.

606
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:43,946
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

607
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,785
What? You're serious? And I have to...?

608
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,609
Master Oogway will stop him,
like he did before.

609
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,376
Oogway cannot!

610
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,301
Not anymore.

611
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,344
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

612
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:01,174
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

613
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,605
Master, let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

614
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:08,246
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

615
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,153
It is his!

616
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,410
Where'd he go?

617
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,796
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

618
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,636
Watch me.

619
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:27,397
Come on.

620
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:30,975
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

621
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:34,139
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

622
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,182
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

623
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,279
From the beginning,
you've tried to get rid of me.

624
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,769
Yes! was.

625
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:48,631
But now I ask you to trust in your
master as I have come to trust in mine.

626
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,607
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

627
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,941
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew
l wanted you gone, yet you stayed.

628
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,349
Yeah, I stayed.

629
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,948
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

630
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:08,345
or said ! smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

631
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,786
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

632
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,960
I stayed because ! thought,
if anyone could change me...

633
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:20,512
..could make me... not me...

634
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,158
. it was you.

635
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,170
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

636
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:26,996
But I can change you!

637
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,364
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

638
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:34,378
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

639
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:37,928
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here, how are you...

640
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:42,159
...gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

641
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:45,852
How?

642
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:48,488
How?

643
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,585
- How?!
- l don't know!

644
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:03,269
I don't know.

645
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,000
That's what I thought.

646
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:52,815
This is what you trained me for.

647
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,094
Tigress!

648
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,042
Don't try and stop me.

649
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,340
We're not trying to stop you.

650
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:12,471
What?

651
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,310
We're coming with you!

652
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,810
What? I eat when I'm upset, OK?

653
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:33,683
No need to explain.

654
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:37,577
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides
his almond cookies on the top shelf.

655
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,499
Don't tell Monkey.

656
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:03,558
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

657
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,644
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

658
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:09,513
I don't know. I guess that...

659
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,207
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

660
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,226
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

661
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,542
And you have done a perfect spilt.

662
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,505
No, this? This is just...

663
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:22,768
.an accident.

664
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:29,861
There are no accidents.

665
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,236
Come with me.

666
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,403
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

667
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,286
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

668
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,702
You dragged me...

669
00:53:58,102 --> 00:53:59,591
.all the way out here...

670
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:01,007
..for a bath?

671
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:05,978
Panda...

672
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:09,400
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

673
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:11,981
The Pool of...

674
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:14,462
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

675
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,781
...of harmony and focus.

676
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:19,341
This is the birthplace...

677
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:20,833
...of kung fu.

678
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,962
Do you want to learn kung fu?

679
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,176
Yeah!

680
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,245
Then l am your master!

681
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:43,262
OK!

682
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:45,775
Don't cry.

683
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:47,153
OK.

684
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:54,806
When you focus on kung fu,

685
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,995
when you concentrate...

686
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:58,651
. you stink.

687
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,532
Perhaps that is my fault.

688
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:03,871
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

689
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:07,087
l now see that the way
to get through to you...

690
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:08,678
.. 1S with this.

691
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:11,336
Oh, great, ‘cause l am hungry.

692
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:13,506
Good.

693
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,080
When you have been trained, you may eat.

694
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:18,868
Let us begin.

695
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,680
After you, panda.

696
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,618
Just like that?

697
00:56:32,923 --> 00:56:36,142
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

698
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,609
Il vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

699
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,970
Enjoy.

700
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,000
Hey!

701
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,991
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

702
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,002
Hey!

703
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,183
You are free to eat.

704
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:07,159
- Am I?!
- Are you?!

705
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:35,117
I'm not hungry.

706
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:39,965
Master.

707
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:11,386
Cut it!

708
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,345
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

709
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:33,264
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

710
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,633
You think I'm a fool?

711
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:39,162
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

712
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,546
heard how he fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

713
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:46,913
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

714
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:52,437
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

715
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,910
Finally, a worthy opponent.

716
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,549
Our battle will be legendary!

717
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,339
We've got this. Help her.

718
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:46,045
Monkey!

719
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:47,853
Gol

720
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,195
What was I thinking?!

721
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:00,656
Mantis!

722
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,289
Now!

723
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,396
Shifu taught you well.

724
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,348
But he didn't teach you everything.

725
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:05,998
You have done well, panda.

726
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,506
Done well? Done well?

727
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,165
I've done awesome!

728
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,839
The mark of a true hero is humility.

729
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,669
But, yes, you have done...

730
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:20,773
. awesome.

731
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:31,107
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

732
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,601
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
But their eyes are open.

733
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,835
We were no match for his nerve attach.

734
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,113
He's gotten stronger.

735
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:41,476
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

736
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:43,828
He's too fast!

737
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,397
Sorry, Po.

738
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:49,034
I thought we could stop him.

739
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:50,909
He could have killed you.

740
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:52,131
Why didn't he?

741
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:56,205
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

742
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,620
It might. 1 mean, a little.

743
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,257
I'm pretty scared.

744
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:03,788
You can defeat him, panda!

745
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:06,627
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

746
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:09,680
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

747
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,080
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

748
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:21,018
You really believe I'm ready?

749
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:22,858
You are...

750
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:24,272
.-Po.

751
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,513
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

752
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,720
It is yours.

753
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,602
Wait. What happens when I read it?

754
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:25,565
Legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

755
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:28,089
Really? That's cool.

756
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,921
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

757
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,884
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

758
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,164
Can I punch through walls?

759
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:38,486
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

760
01:04:38,842 --> 01:04:39,892
- Will L...?
- Focus.

761
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,673
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

762
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,461
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

763
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,810
Read it and become...

764
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,670
..the Dragon Warrior.

765
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,052
It's impossible to open.

766
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:01,034
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.

767
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,096
Thank you.

768
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,478
I probably loosened it up
for you though.

769
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,412
OK, here goes.

770
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,079
- It's blank.
- What?!

771
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:27,513
- Here, look.
- No, lam forbidden to look upon...

772
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:36,183
Blank. I don't...

773
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:38,533
I don't understand.

774
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,473
OK. So, like...

775
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,712
.. Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

776
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,456
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

777
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:52,415
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

778
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:56,612
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

779
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,644
But who will stop Tai Lung?

780
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:02,113
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

781
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:03,952
No.

782
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:09,321
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

783
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,176
- What about you, Master?
- l will fight him.

784
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,904
- What?
- lcan hold him off long enough

785
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,595
for everyone to escape.

786
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,980
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

787
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,832
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

788
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,986
Listen to me, all of you.

789
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,415
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

790
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,548
lam very proud
to have been your master.

791
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,788
We've got to get them out safely.

792
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,194
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

793
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,650
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

794
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,667
Crane, light the way.

795
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:24,598
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

796
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:34,913
Hey, Dad.

797
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:36,825
Po!

798
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,732
Good to have you back, son.

799
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:48,773
Good to be back.

800
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:50,462
Let's go, Po.

801
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:55,658
So for our next shop,
it's time to face it...

802
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,342
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

803
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:01,949
...no longer slices.

804
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:05,298
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

805
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:08,562
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

806
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,303
You like that?

807
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:21,634
Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

808
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,925
It just wasn't meant to be.

809
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:30,960
Po, forget everything else.

810
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,271
Your destiny still awaits.

811
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:37,799
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

812
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,470
I don't know, Dad.

813
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:44,327
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

814
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:49,151
Po...

815
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,259
...[ think it's time I told you
something ! should have told you...

816
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,673
...a long time ago.

817
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:57,519
OK.

818
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:02,732
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

819
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:10,045
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

820
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,550
.. nothing.

821
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,289
You heard me. Nothing!

822
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,822
There is no secret ingredient!

823
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,876
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

824
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,844
You don't add some kind of special
sauce or something?

825
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:28,130
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just believe it's special.

826
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,531
There is no secret ingredient.

827
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:06,894
l have come home, Master.

828
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:10,173
This is no longer your home.
And 1am no longer your master.

829
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,100
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

830
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:17,364
So where is this Po?

831
01:10:19,182 --> 01:10:20,262
Did I scare him off?

832
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:22,533
This battle is between you and me.

833
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,240
So, that is how it's going to be.

834
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,504
That is how it must be.

835
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:47,916
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

836
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,624
Obeying your master is not weakness!

837
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,440
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

838
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,750
You always knew.

839
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:00,425
But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?

840
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:04,378
What did you do?!

841
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,219
Nothing!

842
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,920
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

843
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:13,063
Not your fault?!

844
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:15,179
Who filled my head with dreams?!

845
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,465
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

846
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:20,206
Who denied me my destiny?!

847
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,066
It was never my decision to make!

848
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,000
It is now.

849
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,543
Give me the scroll!

850
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,150
I would rather die.

851
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,175
All l ever did, I did to make you proud!

852
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,915
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

853
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,505
Tell me!

854
01:12:48,231 --> 01:12:49,751
Tell me!

855
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:03,236
I have...
l have always been proud of you.

856
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,710
From the first moment, I've been...

857
01:13:08,184 --> 01:13:10,204
...proud of you.

858
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,633
And it was my pride...

859
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:14,768
..that blinded me.

860
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:18,221
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming...

861
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:21,652
.. What I...

862
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,748
...was turning you into.

863
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,530
I'm...

864
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:27,706
I'm sorry.

865
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,745
I don't want your apology.

866
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,488
l want my scroll!

867
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,835
What?!

868
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,267
Where is it?!

869
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:51,463
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

870
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:55,912
You will never see
that scroll, Tai Lung.

871
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:57,535
Never.

872
01:13:58,634 --> 01:13:59,504
Never.

873
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:07,715
Stairs.

874
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:11,893
Who are you?

875
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:16,601
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

876
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,392
You?

877
01:14:22,525 --> 01:14:24,254
Him? He's a panda.

878
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,960
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

879
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,197
Don't tempt me.

880
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:34,039
No. I'm gonna use this.

881
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,033
You want it? Come and get it.

882
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,114
Finally!

883
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,524
That scroll is mine!

884
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:01,356
Lightning!

885
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:38,442
The scroll has given him power!

886
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,698
No!

887
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,826
Finally! Oh, yes.

888
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:25,650
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

889
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:32,326
It's nothing!

890
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,830
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

891
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,820
What?

892
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:41,769
There is no secret ingredient.

893
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:46,608
It's just you.

894
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:57,469
Stop it!

895
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,223
I'm gonna pee.

896
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,440
Don't.

897
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,171
Don't! Don't!

898
01:19:11,647 --> 01:19:13,227
You...

899
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,475
..can't defeat me.

900
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:21,269
You...

901
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,338
.. you're just a big...

902
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:26,027
. fat...

903
01:19:26,295 --> 01:19:27,165
...pandal

904
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:31,014
I'm not a big fat panda.

905
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:33,487
I'm the big fat panda.

906
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:37,298
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

907
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:38,799
Oh, you know this hold?

908
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:42,521
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

909
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,568
Nope.

910
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:46,777
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

911
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:08,649
Look!

912
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:11,678
The Dragon Warrior.

913
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:43,681
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

914
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,302
Yes!

915
01:20:48,711 --> 01:20:50,081
Thanks, Dad.

916
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:00,785
Hey, guys.

917
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:06,864
Master.

918
01:21:07,096 --> 01:21:08,356
Master.

919
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:12,983
Master?

920
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,558
Master Shifu!

921
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:28,983
Master!

922
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,058
Shifu, are you OK?!

923
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:34,919
Po.

924
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:36,857
You're alive.

925
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:38,239
Or we're both dead.

926
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,920
No, Master, I didn't die.
defeated Tai Lung.

927
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:43,454
You did?

928
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:52,910
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

929
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:56,745
You are the Dragon Warrior.

930
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,083
You have brought peace...

931
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,879
...to this valley...

932
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,215
and...

933
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:06,984
.and to me.

934
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:08,366
Thank you.

935
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:13,199
Thank you, Po.

936
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,942
Thank you. Thank you.

937
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:26,160
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

938
01:22:26,842 --> 01:22:29,241
I'm not dying, you idiot!

939
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,375
Dragon Warrior...

940
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:37,131
.. Lam simply at peace. Finally.

941
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:43,036
So, I should stop talking?

942
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:45,522
If you can.

943
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,212
Want to get something to eat?

944
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,043
Yeah.

945
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:18,179
Everybody is kung fu fighting

946
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:22,358
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

947
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:26,695
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

948
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:31,340
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

949
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:37,567
Everybody is kung fu fighting

950
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:42,054
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

951
01:23:43,452 --> 01:23:46,382
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

952
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,753
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

953
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:54,891
You are a natural

954
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,190
Why is that so hard to see?

955
01:23:57,566 --> 01:24:01,196
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me

956
01:24:01,737 --> 01:24:05,337
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know

957
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:09,338
But sometimes you've got to go
And be your own hero

958
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,458
Everybody is kung fu fighting

959
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:16,992
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

960
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,410
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

961
01:24:22,925 --> 01:24:25,765
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

962
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:31,608
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

963
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,800
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

964
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:39,711
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

965
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:44,082
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

966
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,430
‘Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

967
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:51,777
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

968
01:24:53,355 --> 01:24:56,105
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

969
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,609
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

970
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:05,958
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

971
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:11,055
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

972
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:15,213
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

973
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:19,087
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:22,335

977
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:36,065
It's the book of your life
that you're writing
