1
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:48,009
Spain, 1944

2
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,350
The Civil War is over.

3
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,486
Hidden in the mountains,

4
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,688
armed men are still fighting
the new Fascist regime.

5
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,649
Military posts are established
to exterminate the Resistance.

6
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,358
Along time ago,

7
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,277
in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,

8
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,440
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

9
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:43,506
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

10
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,295
One day,

11
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,371
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,350
Once outside...

13
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,383
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.

14
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,576
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

15
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:18,947
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.

16
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,971
However, her father, the king,

17
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,207
always knew that the Princess’ soul
would return,

18
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,374
perhaps in another body,

19
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,439
in another place, at another time.

20
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,255
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

21
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,926
until the world stopped turning.

22
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,405
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

23
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,154
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

24
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,442
Fairy tales?

25
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:04,650
You're a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

26
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,894
Ask him to stop the car.

27
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,764
Ofelia, wait.

28
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,150
Your brother's not well.

29
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,982
Madam, are you okay?

30
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:41,867
Ofelia?

31
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,936
Ofelia, Come here.

32
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,334
-I saw a fairy.
-Just look at your shoes!

33
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:55,845
Let's go.

34
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,650
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

35
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,847
l want you to call him Father.

36
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,646
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

37
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:09,243
It's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

38
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,092
They're coming, Captain.

39
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,628
15 minutes late.

40
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,781
Carmen.

41
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,543
Welcome.

42
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,652
That's not necessary.
l can walk perfectly well.

43
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,582
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

44
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,344
No.

45
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,158
Come.
Do it for me.

46
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,626
Thank you.

47
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,652
Ofelia, come out.

48
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,748
Say hello to the Captain.

49
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:41,871
Ofelia.

50
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,075
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

51
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,186
Mercedes!

52
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,078
-Bring the luggage.
-Sir.

53
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,493
It's a labyrinth.

54
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,448
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

55
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,868
Even before the mill.

56
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,717
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

57
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:22,755
Thank you.

58
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,610
Have you read them all?

59
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,095
Mercedes!

60
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,191
The Captain is calling.

61
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:32,837
Your father needs me.

62
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:36,909
He's not my father.

63
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,287
The Captain is not my father.

64
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,586
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

65
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,295
He's not my father.

66
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,999
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

67
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,592
Have you seen my mother?

68
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,667
-Isn't she beautiful!
-Yes.

69
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,382
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

70
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,103
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods

71
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,204
because it's hard
to track them up there.

72
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,618
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

73
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,524
We'll block all access
to the woods

74
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,790
Food, medicine-
we'll store it all. Right here.

75
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,890
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

76
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,093
We'll set up three
new command posts.

77
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,635
Here, here and here.

78
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,146
Mercedes.

79
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,768
-Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,625
This will help you sleep
through the night.

81
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,391
Just two drops just before bed.

82
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,891
Two drops only.

83
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,298
Very good.

84
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,296
All of it.
Good.

85
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,126
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

86
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,907
You or your nurse.

87
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:15,864
Good night.

88
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,237
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

89
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,458
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

90
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,742
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

91
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,851
This is all l could get.

92
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,193
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,962
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

94
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,537
Come here, Ofelia.

95
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,763
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

96
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,037
Are you afraid?

97
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,274
A little.

98
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,470
What's that noise?

99
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,434
Nothing, just the wind.

100
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,096
Nights here are different
from city nights.

101
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,083
There, you hear cars-tramway.

102
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,633
Here the houses are old.

103
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,510
They creak.

104
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,401
As if they were speaking.

105
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,746
Tomorrow, I'm going
to give you a surprise.

106
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,209
-A surprise?
-Yes.

107
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:26,876
-A book?
-No, something much better.

108
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,086
Why did you have to get married?

109
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,612
Il was alone too long.

110
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,248
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

111
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,988
You were never alone.

112
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,920
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.

113
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,714
Your brother's at it again-

114
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,687
Tell him one of your stories.

115
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,976
I'm sure that'll calm down.

116
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,227
My brother, my brother...

117
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,968
Many, many years ago,

118
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,716
in a sad, faraway land,

119
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,385
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

120
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,968
At sunset,

121
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,835
on top of that mountain,

122
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:35,276
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

123
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,169
But no one dared go near it

124
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,803
because its thorns were full of poison.

125
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:56,452
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

126
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:01,142
and pain, but never about the promise
of eternal life.

127
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:12,698
And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

128
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,531
forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

129
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,450
forever alone, until the end of time.

130
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:37,565
Come in.

131
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,764
-How is she?
-Very weak.

132
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,786
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

133
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,113
I'll sleep down here.

134
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,747
-And my son?
-Pardon?

135
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,839
Excuse us, Captain.

136
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,910
My son, how is he?

137
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,606
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

138
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,830
Very good.

139
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,246
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

140
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,327
-Is that your opinion?
-My professional opinion, yes, sir.

141
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,098
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

142
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,794
That's all.

143
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,691
One more thing, Captain.

144
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,647
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

145
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,164
Don't fuck with me.

146
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,314
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

147
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,047
Gunfire.

148
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,068
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

149
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,928
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

150
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,330
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

151
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,396
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

152
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,099
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

153
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,120
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

154
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,768
Again, keep quiet.

155
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,223
“No God, no country, no Master"?

156
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,409
-Just like that-how do you like that?
-Red prpaganda, Captain.

157
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,630
It's not propaganda, sir.

158
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,573
It's an old almanac, Captain.

159
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,348
We're just farmers.

160
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:30,889
Go on.

161
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:35,538
l went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

162
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,502
For my daughters. They're sick.

163
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,659
Rabbits, uh?

164
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,578
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

165
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,910
Leave him alone.

166
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,927
You killed him,
You killed him!

167
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,467
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

168
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,494
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

169
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,399
before you come bothering me.

170
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,885
Yes, Captain.

171
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:07,307
Mother, wake up!

172
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,093
Mother, there's something in the room.

173
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:53,722
Hello.

174
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,043
Did you follow me here?

175
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,026
Are you a fairy?

176
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,403
Look!

177
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,168
This is a fairy.

178
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,605
You want me to go with you?

179
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,554
Outside? Where?

180
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,322
Hello?

181
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,238
Hello?

182
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,325
Echo.

183
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,374
Echo.

184
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,339
Hello?

185
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,777
Hello?

186
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,714
It's you.

187
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,944
It's you.
You've returned.

188
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,231
Don't be frightened,
I beg you.

189
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,521
Look, look.

190
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,341
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

191
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,821
Me?

192
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,708
I've had so many names...

193
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:25,237
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

194
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:32,422
lam the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

195
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,163
lam...

196
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,254
lam a faun.

197
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,904
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

198
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,725
-No, I'm...
-You're Princess Moanna,

199
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:55,252
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

200
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,531
My father was a tailor.

201
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,716
You are not born of man.

202
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,156
It was the moon that bore you.

203
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,639
Look on your left shoulder

204
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,697
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

205
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:18,251
your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

206
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,395
This is...

207
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,518
This is the last of them.

208
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:33,033
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,

209
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,213
that you have not become a mortal.

210
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:47,441
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

211
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:56,166
This is The Book of Crossroads.

212
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,356
Open it, when you are alone

213
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,426
and it will show you your future,

214
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,689
show you what must be done.

215
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,962
But there's nothing in here.

216
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,246
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

217
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,468
They are too young.

218
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,914
-Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
-Yes, sir.

219
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,402
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

220
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,698
You should keep an eye on it.

221
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,106
As you wish, sir.

222
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,699
Cook these.

223
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,760
-He didn't like the coffee.
-He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

224
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,122
A fussy dandy!

225
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,425
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

226
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,765
-Where are we supposed to find that?
-The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

227
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,938
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

228
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,533
-And they don't shut up.
-Not even underwater.

229
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,702
I'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

230
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,173
Ofelia.

231
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,300
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

232
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,526
Look what I've made for you.

233
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,357
Do you like it?

234
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,949
What I wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

235
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:54,817
as fine as this when I was your age!
And look at the shoes!

236
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,922
-Do you like them?
-Yes, very pretty.

237
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,349
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

238
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:07,802
Ofelia?

239
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:10,451
Ofelia?

240
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:15,043
Hurry up.
l want to see the dress on you.

241
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,981
l want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

242
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,686
You'll look like a princess.

243
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,539
A princess?

244
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,570
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

245
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,055
And don't forget the beans.

246
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:46,431
-You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
-What a gorgeous dress!

247
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,598
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

248
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,993
Do you want some milk with honey?

249
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,200
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

250
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,510
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

251
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:13,911
No.

252
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,023
But when I was a little girl,
I did.

253
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,538
I believed in a lot of things
I don't believe any more.

254
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,783
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

255
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:24,929
Really?

256
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,467
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,

257
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:30,928
-And a faun, too.
-A faun?

258
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,896
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

259
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,071
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

260
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,611
Mercedes!

261
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,533
Come with me.

262
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,908
Captain,
everything is here.

263
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,735
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

264
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,984
olives, bacon.

265
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,111
This-this is real tobacco.

266
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:07,538
And the ration cards.

267
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,126
-l need you to check the inventory.
-Very well.

268
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:14,782
Mercedes.

269
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,608
-The key.
-Yes, sir.

270
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,860
-Is this the only copy?
-The only one.

271
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,774
From now on, I'll carry it.

272
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:30,751
Captain.

273
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,187
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

274
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,528
It's them.

275
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,898
“Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,

276
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:08,915
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."

277
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,461
“They protected one another,

278
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,827
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

279
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,791
that grew on a hill, near the mill."

280
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,172
“But now, the tree is dying.

281
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:32,945
Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

282
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,036
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

283
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,989
and won't let the tree thrive.

284
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:43,279
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth

285
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,389
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

286
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,190
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."

287
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,678
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

288
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,312
They left in a hurry.

289
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,348
A dozen men, at most.

290
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,699
Antibiotics.

291
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,614
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

292
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,389
They're here.

293
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,591
Those sons of bitches are here.

294
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,617
and they're watching us.

295
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,316
Hey!

296
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:23,062
You left this behind!

297
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,859
And your lottery ticket!

298
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,475
Why don't you come back
and get it?

299
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,641
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

300
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:46,208
Hello.
I'm Princess Moanna,

301
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,305
and I'm not afraid of you.

302
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,793
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

303
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,170
eating all these bugs...

304
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,773
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

305
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,805
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

306
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:47,304
Yes, ma‘am.

307
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,464
Have you checked the garden?

308
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,581
-And the barn?
-Yes, ma'am.

309
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,037
Where is that girl?

310
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,445
This way, please.

311
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,281
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

312
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,152
-Charmed.
-A pleasure to meet you.

313
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,881
From now on,
one ration card per family.

314
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:11,902
Take a look.

315
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,083
-One?
-Only one.

316
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,703
Captain, I'm not sure
it'll be enough.

317
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,161
If people are careful,
it should be plenty.

318
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:21,203
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

319
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,129
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

320
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,232
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

321
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,604
We almost got them.
We found this.

322
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,820
Antibiotics.

323
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,290
God has already
saved their souls.

324
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,156
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

325
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,848
We'll help however we can, Captain.

326
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,270
We know you're not here by choice.

327
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:50,721
You're wrong about that.

328
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,456
I choose to be here because I want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

329
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,618
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

330
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:01,638
that we're all equal.

331
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,727
But there's a big difference:

332
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,725
the war is over and we won.

333
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,222
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

334
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,569
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

335
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:16,502
We're all here by choice.

336
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,448
By choice!

337
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:25,084
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

338
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,320
We'll take care of it.

339
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,545
Ofelia?

340
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,221
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

341
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,466
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

342
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:16,794
Oh, I see...

343
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,134
And after he died,
l went to work at the shop.

344
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,713
A little more than a year ago,

345
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:28,226
the Captain and I met again.

346
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,176
Curious, isn't it!

347
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,235
I mean, finding each other again?

348
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,469
Oh, yes,
-
very, very curious.

349
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:41,316
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

350
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,230
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

351
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,013
We understand.

352
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,509
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

353
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,743
Excuse me.

354
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,789
Have I told you that 1 was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

355
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,519
No.
I had no idea.

356
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,753
In Morocco.

357
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,944
I knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

358
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:18,422
An excellent soldier.

359
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,820
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,

360
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:25,605
he smashed his watch on a rock

361
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,214
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

362
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,667
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

363
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,243
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

364
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,970
What you've done hurts me.

365
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,178
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

366
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:49,462
Are you listening?

367
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,504
Sometimes I think
you'll never learn to behave.

368
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,471
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

369
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,011
And your father, too.

370
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,761
You mean the Captain?

371
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,194
Him more than me.

372
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,064
I've got the key.

373
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,405
Take me to the Labyrinth.

374
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:23,743
Hello.

375
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,246
I got the key out.

376
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:32,816
That's me,
and the girl is you.

377
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:34,791
And the baby?

378
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,270
So... you retrieved the key.

379
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,424
I'm glad.

380
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:55,005
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

381
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:58,267
She's so glad you succeeded.

382
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:05,868
Keep the key.

383
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:09,254
You'll be needing it very soon.

384
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,120
And this too?
a piece of chalk.

385
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,448
Two tasks remain

386
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,669
and the moon is almost full.

387
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,938
Be patient.

388
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:34,077
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

389
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:37,456
How do I know
that what you say is true?

390
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:43,321
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

391
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,183
Proceed.

392
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,509
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

393
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,288
Let's go.
Your name?

394
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,665
Your names, first and last.

395
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:22,973
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

396
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,948
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,

397
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:33,057
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

398
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,388
because in a united Spain,

399
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,013
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

400
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:56,810
Come on, show me
what happens now?

401
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:58,652
Show me.

402
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,223
Ofelia, help me...

403
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,905
Captain! Captain!

404
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,073
Come quickly.

405
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:51,945
... because in a united Spain,

406
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:55,606
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

407
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,594
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

408
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,392
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

409
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,170
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

410
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:13,809
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

411
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,673
I'll stay here until the birth.

412
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:19,249
Make her well.

413
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,481
I don't care what it costs
or what you need.

414
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:28,051
Make her well.

415
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:50,753
Don't worry.

416
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,299
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

417
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:59,402
Having a baby is complicated.

418
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:03,188
Then I'll never have one.

419
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,613
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

420
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,774
Have you told anyone?

421
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:34,497
No, I haven't.

422
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:38,683
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

423
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:50,967
Nor I to you.

424
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,530
Do you know a lullaby?

425
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:57,844
Only one...

426
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,913
but I don't remember the words.

427
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,629
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

428
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,855
Don't be afraid.
It's only me.

429
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,866
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

430
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:14,264
Then let's go.

431
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,703
This is sheer madness.

432
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,388
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

433
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,933
-Have you thought about that?
-Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

434
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,451
It's not fear...

435
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,491
at least not for myself.

436
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,667
Pedro!

437
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:47,279
Pedro, My brother!

438
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,124
You didn't carry out the task.

439
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:09,426
No, my mother is sick.

440
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:13,645
That's no excuse
for negligence.

441
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:18,514
Look...
this is a mandrake root.

442
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:22,606
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

443
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:28,111
Put it under your mother's bed

444
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,889
in a bowl of fresh milk.

445
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:37,256
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

446
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:41,862
Now, we have no time
to waste.

447
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:45,093
The full moon will be upon us.

448
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,971
Take my pets
to guide you through.

449
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:55,790
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

450
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:59,107
The thing that slumbers there,

451
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,567
it is not human.

452
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,470
You will see
a sumptuous feast,

453
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,551
but don't eat
or drink anything.

454
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:18,254
Absolutely nothing.

455
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,601
Your life depends on it.

456
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:49,062
I've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

457
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,444
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

458
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:56,531
Let's see how that leg's doing,
Frenchie.

459
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,357
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

460
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,641
Let's see.

461
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,783
... N-North American,

462
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,891
British and Canadian troops

463
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,420
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

464
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,061
-"France", idiot.
-F-f-f-rance.

465
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,994
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

466
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,750
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

467
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:31,145
Is it really bad, doctor?

468
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:33,969
Look, Frenchie.

469
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:36,812
There's no way to save it.

470
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:51,788
I'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

471
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:02,957
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

472
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:43,892
“Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."

473
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,307
“Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."

474
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,959
“Let the fairies guide you."

475
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:06,527
“Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay,

476
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:11,177
and come back
before the last grain of sand falls."

477
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:21,601
No...

478
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,621
This other one.

479
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,091
No! No!

480
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,775
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

481
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:24,871
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

482
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,579
And then what?

483
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:32,832
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

484
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,692
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

485
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,910
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

486
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,180
If you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

487
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,603
-This is a lost cause.
-I'm staying here, doctor.

488
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,083
There's no choice.

489
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:00,633
You have to leave.

490
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,129
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

491
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,712
It's exactly what he expects.

492
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,007
Leave it to me.

493
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:17,186
I'm a coward.

494
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,651
No, you're not.

495
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,215
Yes, lam.

496
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:27,904
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch,

497
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:32,203
doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

498
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:38,449
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

499
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:45,015
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

500
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:41,023
Captain Vidal...

501
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,463
Her temperature's down.
I don't know how, but it is.

502
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:47,509
But she still has a fever?

503
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,698
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

504
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:53,702
Listen to me.

505
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,147
If you have to choose,
save the baby.

506
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,910
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

507
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,240
Save him.

508
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:38,213
Brother...

509
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,153
Little brother...

510
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:44,843
If you can hear me,

511
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,038
things out here aren't too good.

512
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,936
But soon you'll have to come out.

513
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:54,876
You've made Mama very sick.

514
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,473
l want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

515
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,045
just one:

516
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:05,984
don't hurt her.

517
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:10,232
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty,

518
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,454
even though sometimes she's sad
for days at a time.

519
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,474
You'll see, when she smiles,

520
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:19,624
you'll love her.

521
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:25,075
Listen, if you do what I say,

522
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,148
I'll make you a promise,

523
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:31,471
I'll take you to my kingdom,
and I'll make you a prince.

524
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:35,699
I promise you, a prince.

525
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,969
l sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

526
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:07,595
I tried to stop, but it was too late.

527
01:08:07,984 --> 01:08:10,094
The fireman and I
jumped out just in time,

528
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:11,852
but look at the mess they made.

529
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:16,714
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

530
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,010
They didn't open a single one.

531
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:20,759
What the hell are you talking about?

532
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:23,086
This whole mess...
They didn't open any of the cars.

533
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,350
-They didn't take anything.
-Nothing? Are you sure?

534
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,640
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

535
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:50,512
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

536
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:56,846
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

537
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:04,401
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

538
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:06,377
They took cover up on the hill.

539
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:45,598
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

540
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:30,912
Serrano!

541
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:50,941
Let me see.

542
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,015
Can you talk?

543
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:02,411
Damn it!

544
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:23,394
These are useless! They can't talk.

545
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,365
Captain,
this one's still alive.

546
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:40,966
Shot in the leg.

547
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:48,303
-What's happened?
-They caught one.

548
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:50,621
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

549
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,105
Mercedes!

550
01:11:58,114 --> 01:12:00,044
Pedro... Pedro...

551
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,620
Mercedes?

552
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:22,312
-l need to get into the storeroom.
-Not now.

553
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:24,346
Move away!

554
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:53,564
That's plenty, dear.

555
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,730
Should I take this up?

556
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,934
Here, half the dose.

557
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,314
I don't think I need it.

558
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:26,476
l feel better, much better.

559
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:29,216
I don't understand.
But I'm glad.

560
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:33,365
Mother...

561
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,624
Damn, this cigarette is good!

562
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,721
Real tobacco hard to find.

563
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,879
G-G-Go to hell.

564
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:05,351
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

565
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:07,982
We'll be here all night.

566
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:10,177
As long as he talks.

567
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:17,899
Garces is right.

568
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:20,978
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

569
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:24,921
But to make sure it happens,
l brought along a few tools.

570
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:29,597
Just things you pick up
along the way.

571
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:32,209
At first, l won't be able to trust you,

572
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:36,122
but after I use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

573
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:39,867
When we get to these,

574
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:44,299
we'll have developed...
how can I put this-?

575
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:47,431
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

576
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:50,528
You'll see.

577
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:54,185
And when we get to this one,

578
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,901
I'll believe anything you tell me.

579
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:11,648
I'll make you a deal.

580
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:14,977
If you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,

581
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:16,798
you can go.

582
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:21,698
Don't look at him, look at me.

583
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,871
Above me, there's no one.

584
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,293
-Garces!
-Yes, Captain?

585
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:29,892
If l say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

586
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:32,006
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

587
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:36,395
There you have it.
Count to three.

588
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,594
-One.
-Good.

589
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:01,009
Two.

590
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:05,445
One more and you will be free.

591
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:23,565
Shame.

592
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:39,134
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

593
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:46,397
Surely, you must be relieved.

594
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,480
Yes, thank you.

595
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:53,192
But things haven't turned out so well.

596
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:55,473
No?

597
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:00,606
-l had an accident.
-An accident?

598
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,070
Yes.

599
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:14,014
-You broke the rules!
-It was only two grapes!

600
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:15,867
I thought no one would notice.

601
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,190
-We've made a mistake!
-A mistake?

602
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:24,587
You failed.
You can never return.

603
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:28,364
-It was an accident!
-You cannot return.

604
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:32,404
The moon will be full in three days.

605
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:38,462
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

606
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:42,657
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them

607
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:46,795
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

608
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:51,376
And we'll vanish along with it.

609
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:55,845
You will never see us again.

610
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:10,299
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,

611
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,010
but I think we need your help.

612
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:37,919
My God, what have you done to him?

613
01:18:38,314 --> 01:18:39,274
Not much.

614
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,933
But things are getting better.

615
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:55,223
l like having you handy, Doctor.
It has its advantages.

616
01:18:57,366 --> 01:18:58,626
Serrano, stay here.

617
01:18:59,001 --> 01:18:59,901
I talked.

618
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,520
Not much.

619
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:08,063
-B-b-but I talked.
-I'm sorry.

620
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:10,615
I'm so sorry.

621
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:22,467
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

622
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:40,678
Son of a bitch.

623
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:03,667
It'll take away the pain.

624
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,566
It's almost over.

625
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:21,656
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,

626
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,244
-I'll be right there.
-Yes, Captain.

627
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,379
You're not moving anymore.

628
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:51,342
Are you sick?

629
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,940
What are you doing down there?

630
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,296
-Call him!
-Who?

631
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,714
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

632
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:40,938
What the hell is this?

633
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:45,669
No! No, no!

634
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:49,265
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

635
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,660
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

636
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:55,430
What do you think of this?

637
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:04,135
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

638
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,350
It's a magic root
the faun gave me.

639
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,274
This is all because of that junk
you let her read.

640
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,780
Look what you've done!

641
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:16,601
Please, leave us alone.
I'll talk to her, darling.

642
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,316
Fine.
As you wish.

643
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:24,844
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

644
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:27,994
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

645
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:30,641
You have to stop all this.

646
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,759
No. I want to leave this place!

647
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,200
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

648
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:39,742
Things are not that simple.

649
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,871
You're getting older,

650
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,090
soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

651
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,031
The world is a cruel place.

652
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:55,951
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

653
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,230
-No! No!
-Ofelia!

654
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:06,250
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

655
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:20,654
Mom! Help!

656
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,660
Help!

657
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:24,812
Help!

658
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:31,858
Why did you do it?

659
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:35,773
It was the only thing I could do.

660
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,276
No. You could have obeyed me.

661
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,310
I could have, but I didn't.

662
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:47,744
It would have been better for you.
You know it.

663
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:52,071
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

664
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:58,121
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

665
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:03,246
that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

666
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,216
Captain!

667
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,767
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

668
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,456
-Get up immediately!
-Yes, Captain.

669
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,032
Your wife is dead.

670
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,008
Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.

671
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:45,549
Because the essence
of His forgiveness

672
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,773
lies in His word
and in His mystery.

673
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,688
Because although God
sends us the message,

674
01:25:53,215 --> 01:25:55,495
it is our task to decipher it.

675
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:58,298
Because when we open our arms

676
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,970
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.

677
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,510
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.

678
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,687
Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.

679
01:26:12,968 --> 01:26:15,518
And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.

680
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:21,839
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.

681
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:28,751
And because it is only
in His physical absence,

682
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:32,971
that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.

683
01:26:55,477 --> 01:26:58,517
You knew
Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,
didn't you, Mercedes?

684
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,598
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

685
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:08,113
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

686
01:27:09,758 --> 01:27:13,128
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

687
01:27:15,464 --> 01:27:18,454
Mercedes, please.

688
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:29,873
What must you think of me?

689
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:32,835
You must think that
I'm a monster.

690
01:27:33,482 --> 01:27:36,002
It doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

691
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:49,081
l want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

692
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:52,510
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

693
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:56,962
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

694
01:27:58,507 --> 01:27:59,357
Sir?

695
01:28:04,546 --> 01:28:05,306
The key.

696
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:08,501
I do have the only copy, don't I?

697
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:10,868
Yes, sir.

698
01:28:12,554 --> 01:28:16,034
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

699
01:28:16,892 --> 01:28:18,562
Maybe it's not important, but...

700
01:28:19,094 --> 01:28:20,464
the day they broke into
the storehouse,

701
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:23,209
with all those grenades
and explosives,

702
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,626
the lock itself wasn't forced.

703
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:31,099
As I said, it's probably
not important.

704
01:28:35,177 --> 01:28:36,286
Be very careful.

705
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:39,630
Good night, sir.

706
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:25,057
Ofelia, Ofelia!

707
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,444
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.

708
01:29:28,263 --> 01:29:31,303
-Where to?
-I can't tell you. I can't tell you...

709
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,497
-Take me with you.
-No, no. I can't.

710
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:37,633
Il can't, my child. But I'll come
back for you, I promise.

711
01:29:38,173 --> 01:29:39,133
Take me with you.

712
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:05,308
l heard something.

713
01:30:10,472 --> 01:30:13,222
It's nothing, don't worry.

714
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:23,834
Mercedes.

715
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:26,974
Ofelia.

716
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:37,531
How long have
you known about her?

717
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:44,511
How long have you been
laughing at me?

718
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:45,993
Little bitch!

719
01:30:47,509 --> 01:30:48,589
Watch her!

720
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:53,737
And if anyone tries to get in,

721
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,320
kill her first.

722
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:11,684
Dry meat.

723
01:31:15,437 --> 01:31:16,287
Tobacco.

724
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:20,138
If you had asked for it, 1 would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

725
01:31:27,716 --> 01:31:29,646
l want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

726
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:33,556
And I want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

727
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:35,092
Yes, Captain.

728
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:39,386
You can go, Garces.

729
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:42,362
You're sure, Captain?

730
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,400
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

731
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,610
That's what you've always thought.

732
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:57,506
That's why I was able to get away with it.

733
01:31:58,113 --> 01:32:02,183
-I was invisible to you.
-Damn.

734
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:06,928
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

735
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:11,723
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

736
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,079
It's very simple: you will talk...

737
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:20,037
And I have to know

738
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:23,280
that everything you say is the truth.

739
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:28,426
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

740
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:31,992
Nothing complicated.

741
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:36,326
Things we learn on the job.

742
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:40,353
At first...

743
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:00,549
I'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

744
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:04,582
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

745
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:06,866
Won't be the first pig ! gutted.

746
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:31,535
Look! He let her go.

747
01:33:34,209 --> 01:33:35,318
The fuck did you say?

748
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:45,858
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

749
01:33:46,654 --> 01:33:48,234
Bring her to me, damn it!

750
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:49,913
Mount up!

751
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:55,224
It'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

752
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:58,121
The Captain said that if you behave...

753
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:04,384
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

754
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:06,339
If anyone's going to kill you...

755
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:09,690
I'd rather it be me.

756
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:24,551
I've decided to give you
one last chance.

757
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:31,911
Do you promise to do what I say?

758
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:37,844
Will you do everything I tell you,
without question?

759
01:36:40,194 --> 01:36:42,774
This is your last chance.

760
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:47,019
Then listen to me.

761
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:49,949
Fetch your brother

762
01:36:50,672 --> 01:36:52,982
and bring him to the labyrinth,

763
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:57,314
as quickly as you can,
Your Highness.

764
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,252
My brother?

765
01:36:59,681 --> 01:37:00,821
We need him.

766
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,809
-But...
-No more questions.

767
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:08,561
The door's locked.

768
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:14,951
In that case,
create your own door.

769
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:05,562
Captain, with your permission.

770
01:40:09,136 --> 01:40:10,006
Come quickly.

771
01:40:10,938 --> 01:40:13,778
-Now what?
-Serrano is back. He's wounded.

772
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,346
Wounded?

773
01:41:02,757 --> 01:41:03,956
Where's Garces?

774
01:41:11,632 --> 01:41:12,562
How many were there?

775
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:15,097
I don't know exactly, Captain.

776
01:41:15,836 --> 01:41:17,126
Fifty men, at least.

777
01:41:17,438 --> 01:41:20,568
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

778
01:41:21,175 --> 01:41:24,305
-How many men we have left?
-Twenty, maybe less, sir.

779
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:38,520
We're leaving.
Together.

780
01:41:39,994 --> 01:41:41,074
Don't be afraid.

781
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:43,559
Nothing is going to happen to you.

782
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:51,571
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

783
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,779
If the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

784
01:41:54,308 --> 01:41:57,348
Radio for reinforcements, now.

785
01:41:57,979 --> 01:41:59,089
Yes, Captain.

786
01:42:26,107 --> 01:42:27,157
Leave him!

787
01:43:13,421 --> 01:43:14,501
Ofelia!

788
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:44,182
Quickly, Your Majesty,

789
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:47,001
give him to me.

790
01:44:47,882 --> 01:44:50,571
The full moon is high in the sky,

791
01:44:51,085 --> 01:44:53,545
we can open the portal.

792
01:44:54,822 --> 01:44:56,222
Why is that in your hand?

793
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:02,237
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

794
01:45:03,164 --> 01:45:07,034
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

795
01:45:07,701 --> 01:45:09,951
It's the final task.

796
01:45:10,604 --> 01:45:11,744
Hurry.

797
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:17,331
You promised to obey me!

798
01:45:18,179 --> 01:45:20,109
-Give me the boy!
-No!

799
01:45:21,015 --> 01:45:22,855
My brother stays with me.

800
01:45:23,384 --> 01:45:28,544
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

801
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:31,786
Yes, I would.

802
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:35,600
You would give up
your throne for him?

803
01:45:36,063 --> 01:45:40,073
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

804
01:45:41,202 --> 01:45:43,692
Yes, I would.

805
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:53,155
As you wish, Your Highness.

806
01:46:09,597 --> 01:46:10,467
No!

807
01:47:09,323 --> 01:47:10,173
My son.

808
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:39,348
Tell my son...

809
01:47:45,426 --> 01:47:47,596
Tell him what time his father died.

810
01:47:48,329 --> 01:47:49,619
-Tell him that I...
-No.

811
01:47:50,831 --> 01:47:52,501
He won't even know your name.

812
01:49:35,436 --> 01:49:37,186
Arise, my daughter.

813
01:49:40,774 --> 01:49:41,854
Come.

814
01:50:08,268 --> 01:50:09,318
Father.

815
01:50:10,003 --> 01:50:13,163
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

816
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:17,748
That was the final task,
and the most important.

817
01:50:28,755 --> 01:50:33,355
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

818
01:50:34,261 --> 01:50:35,691
Come here with me,

819
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:38,637
and sit by your father's side.

820
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:41,299
He's been waiting for you so long.

821
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:37,800
And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

822
01:51:39,226 --> 01:51:43,885
That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.

823
01:51:45,465 --> 01:51:47,425
That she was loved by her people.

824
01:51:48,001 --> 01:51:52,101
And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth,

825
01:51:53,807 --> 01:51:58,027
visible only to those
who know where to look.
