1
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:44,873
Once there was a way
To get back homeward

2
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,321
Are the stars out tonight?

3
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:54,613
Once there was a way to get back home

4
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,412
f only have eyes

5
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:02,278
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry

6
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,113
For you

7
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,846
And I will sing a lullaby

8
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,914
With a song in my heart

9
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,582
So tell me

10
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,907
Tell me something good

11
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,136
Tell me that you love me

12
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,959
Tell me, baby

13
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,562
Tell me something good

14
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,541
Only you

15
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,593
But how can you know for sure?

16
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,572
Can make this world seem right

17
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,465
fs there really just one?

18
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,140

19
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,706
So many songs, but I'm feeling so lonely.

20
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,748
Where is the love?

21
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,179
You don’t have to be beautiful

22
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,463
To turn me on

23
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,646
i just need your body, baby

24
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,304
Hello

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,496
-From dusk till dawn
-Is it me you're looking for?

26
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,782
You don't need experience

27
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,292

-These broken wings

29
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,990
You just leave it all up to me

30
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,880
Let's talk about eggs, baby
Let's talk about you and me

31
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,076
You don’t have to be rich

32
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,437
-Give me all your loving
-To be my pearl

33
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,343
You don’t have to be cool
To rule my world

34
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,587
Ain't no particular song

00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,261
Boys. Boys.

Give a chick a chance.

38
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,666
Well, since my baby left me

39
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,360

40
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,890
it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

41
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,632
And I! said, "I'm feelin’ so lonely, baby

42
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,465
I'm feelin’ so lonely

43
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,971
Oh, I'm feelin’ so lonely”...

44
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,051
! could die

45
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:16,645
Don't have to be rich to be my girl

46
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:21,853
Don't have to be cool to rule my world

47
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,946
You rule my world

48
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:28,434
You're the particular song
i'm compatible with

49
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,786
{just want your

50
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:34,278

-And your kiss
-And your kiss

52
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,084
His mom and dad met in the usual way.

53
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,058
The song became love...

54
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,581
...and love became the egg.

55
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,132
Memphis?

56
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,554
-You got it, sugar?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

57
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,406
Safe and warm.

58
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,085
Hold it tight, now.

59
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,583
Whoa, I think I felt a move in there.

60
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,886
And in the usual way...

61
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,655
...the moms left for the fishing season...

62
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,871
...while the dads stayed home
to do egg time.

63
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,665
You gonna be okay, Daddy?

64
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,090
Oh, sure, honey. We'll be waiting for you,
tight here on Lonely Street.

65
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:24,974
f love you more and more, tell me why

66
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:26,872
Bye-bye, now.

67
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,099
Goodbye, Norma Jean.
Don’t you worry about a thing.

68
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,160
Don't wanna let you go

69
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,601
i never can say goodbye, boy

70
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,784
When all others leave...

71
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,241
...we remain!

72
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,956
When the sun vanishes...

73
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,140
...we remain!

74
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,629
I'm feelin’ so lonely
I'm feelin’ so lonely--

75
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,619
Heed the wisdoms, brothers!
Make a huddle!

76
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,891
Warm thy egg!

77
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,774
Make a huddle!

78
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,073
-Share the cold!
-Share the cold.

79
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,819
Each must take his turn
against the icy blast...

80
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,106
...if we are to survive the endless night.

81
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,928
Raise your voices, brothers!

82
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,760
Give praise to the Great 'Guin...

83
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:29,207
...who puts songs in our hearts
and fish in our bellies!

84
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,360
Ain't no particular song
i'm more compatible with

85
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,900
Oh, baby, I think 1 wanna dance now.

86
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,484
No, no, no.

87
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,542
There is a wisdom,
brothers and sisters...

88
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,012
...that stands above all others.

89
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,426
-Never, ever...
-It's okay.

90
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,565
-...n0 matter what...
-No harm done. See?

91
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,631
...drop your egg.

92
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,689
No, we're cool. We're cool.

93
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:19,354
Of the many thousands who sang
through that long night of winter...

94
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,870
..it was Memphis
who cried out most fervently...

95
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:29,061
...to turn the Earth
and bring back the sun.

96
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,768
-It’s a boy!
-Hey, it’s a girl!

97
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,943
-What a peach!
-What a bruiser!

98
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,265
-Come here, son.
-Come to Daddy, there you go.

99
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,371
Son, you have made
your daddy so proud.

100
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,380
It’s all genetics, you know.

101
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,294
Memphis?

102
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,047
Is everything okay?

103
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,714
I don’t know. I can’t hear anything.

104
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,059
-ls it empty?
-Honey.

105
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,390
-Can I have it?
-Gloria.

106
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,599
It’s okay, Maurice.

107
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,947
It happens sometimes, Memphis.

108
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:58,837
Yeah.

109
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,491
Wait, you hear that?

110
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,388
-Yeah.
-Hey, I can hear you, buddy.

111
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,436
Oh, your papa’s here, it's okay.

112
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,464
Oh, he’s okay, Maurice.
Whoa, there it is!

113
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,991
That's his little foot there.

114
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,514
There's his other one.

115
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,335
That's different.

116
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,343
Hey! Come back here, Mr. Mumble.

117
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:29,612
Gloria....

118
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,719
She can call him
whatever the heck she likes.

119
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,755
Whoa, little Mumble.

120
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,979
-Mumble? Mumble?
-You okay?

121
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,859
Freezing. Freezing.

122
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,497
Oh, you'll get used to it.

123
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,858
Come on. Come to your daddy.

124
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,652
-What do you make of that?
-Little wobbly in the knees.

125
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,185
-ls he okay?
-I don’t know.

126
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,643
What you doing there, boy?

127
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,111
I'm happy, Pa.

128
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,306
What you doing with your feet?

129
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,419
They're happy too.

130
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,998
-l wouldn’t do that around folks, son.
-Why not?

131
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,000
-Well, it just ain’t penguin, okay?
-Okay.

132
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,477
Yeah. Hey, come on over here.
Get under here. Get warm.

133
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,044
Watch the beak. Watch the beak-- Beak!

134
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,749
The beak.

135
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,491
Okay, good boy.

136
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,723
So late. What's keeping them?

137
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,509
Pray, brothers, the Great ‘Guin
does not test us with a lean season.

138
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,299
Why, Noah? Have we not all been dutiful?

139
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,981
So when you see your mama....

140
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,182
-l stand perfectly still.
-You got it.

141
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,014
But how will I know
which one’s my mama?

142
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,477
Oh, you'll know.

143
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,245
She's got a wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk.

144
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,975
And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

145
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,627
Hey, wait. 1 see them. I see them!

146
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,147
You're right! You're right!

147
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,429
Wives, ho!

148
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,575
Wives, ho!

149
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,637
Wives, ho!

150
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,305
Wait, no. Wait, no, Mumble, get back here.
No, Mumble! Get back-- Mumble!

151
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,782
Mumble! Mumble!

152
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,806
Mumble!

153
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,521

154
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,029
-Roxanne?
-Michelle?

155
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,980
Alfie?

156
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,274
-Maurice!
-Michelle! Michelle!

157
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,786
Mommy!

158
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,501
Oh, she's so darling.

159
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,970
Excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me.
Mumble? Mumble?

160
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,608
Oh, Mumble.

161
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,959
-Mama?
-Mumble!

162
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,310
-Mama?
-Mumble!

163
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,947
Mumble!

164
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,392
Mama? Mama?

165
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,407
-Mumble, boy, where are you?
-Mama!

166
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,269
Memphis?

167
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,232
Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama.

168
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,172
-Oh, my.
-Daddy.

169
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,351
So where's the baby?

170
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,757
Well, honey, I'll find him.

171
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,046
-You lost the baby? Memphis!
-It's okay.

172
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,115
-Mama? Mama?
-Stay!

173
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,248
-Come to Mommy.
-No, Mumble.

174
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,421
Mama, Mama.

175
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,827
Hey, what's wrong with his feet?

176
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,499
Oh, that’s just a little thing he’s got going.
He'll grow out of it.

177
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,793
Mama!

178
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,502
Oh, Memphis, he’s gorgeous.

179
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,365
-Isn’t he, though?
-Look at you.

180
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,615
I got something for you.

181
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,554
Open up.

182
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,642
Oh, I love the way she does that.

183
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,178
W, X, YandZ

184
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,631
Good morning, class.

185
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,029
Good morning, Miss Viola.

186
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,354
Right.

187
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,642
Well, today we begin with the most
important lesson you will ever learn...

188
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,363
..at Penguin Elementary.

189
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,151
Does anyone know what that is?

190
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,636
Anyone? Anyone?

191
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:08,831
Someone? Seymour?

192
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,798
-Fishing?
-No.

193
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,397
Mumble?

194
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,132
Don't eat yellow snow?

195
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,730
No, that’s not it, no.

196
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,848
-It’s our Heartsong, Miss.
-Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes.

197
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,925
Without our Heartsong,
we can't be truly penguin, can we?

198
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,022
No.

199
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,370
But, my dears, it’s not something
that I can actually teach you.

200
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,057
Does anybody know why?
Anyone? Anyone?

201
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,976
You can't teach it to us, ma’am...

202
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,542
...because we have to find
our Heartsongs all by ourselves.

203
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,025
Well done, you.

204
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,783
It's the voice you hear inside...

205
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,558
..-who you truly are.

206
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,147
Yes. Thank you, Gloria.
Excellent, lovely, thank you.

207
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,710
So let's all be very still now.

208
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,035
Take a moment and let it come to you.

209
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,562
-l got one!
-Pick me!

210
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,450
-Pick me! Pick me!
-One at a time. Yes, Seymour.

211
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,603
Don't push me
‘Cause I am close to the edge

212
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,858
I'm trying not to lose my head

213
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,991
Yes, I like that one. I could
really get jiggy with that. Lovely.

214
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,917
I'm ready. I got one.

215
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,536
Oh, I thought you might, Gloria.

216
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,324
Midnight creeps so slowly

217
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,034
Into hearts of those

218
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,776
Who need more than they get

219
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,815
Daylight deals a bad hand

220
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,116
To a penguin

221
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:31,188
Who has laid too many bets

222
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,742
That's as far as I got so far.

223
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,393
-Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely.
-That’s beautiful.

224
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,753
Well, Mumble, since
you seem so keen to share.

225
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,413
Mine’s sort of a boom and a:

226
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,733
And another boom.

227
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,052
You heard that in there?

228
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,353
-Do you like it?
-I’m afraid that’s not a tune.

229
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,579
-It’s not?
-No, dear. A tune is like:

230
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,276
Oh, okay.

231
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,423
Who is that?

232
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,238
That is the offspring of Memphis
and Norma Jean.

233
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,121
The wee hippity-hopper.

234
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,476
It’s not funny!

235
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,674
No. No, not in the least.

236
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,137
A penguin without a Heartsong
is hardly a penguin at all.

237
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,874
I think he broke my ear.

238
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,824
In all my years, I've never, I mean--

239
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,366
And you having such fine voices.
Well, it’s bizarre.

240
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,076
Did anything happen, you know,
during early development?

241
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,819
No, all fine. Normal incubation.

242
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,452
-Right.
-Wasn't it, honey?

243
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,944
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter,
I guess.

244
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,424
Right, right.

245
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,891
-He did hatch a little late--
-Yes, l understand. Yes.

246
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,048
-To think he might spend his life alone...
-Quite, quite.

247
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,495
...never to meet his one true love.

248
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,739
Oh, please, Miss Viola,
isn't there something we can do?

249
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,458
Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan.

250
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:05,807
Mrs. Astrakhan?

251
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,535
If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can.

252
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,326
Can't sing?

253
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,637
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.

254
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,392
Every little penguin has a song.

255
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,315
When I have finished...

256
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,907
... your singing will be giving everyone
the goose pimple.

257
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,954
Now, to begin.
First, we must find a feeling.

258
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,345
Happy feeling, sad feeling.

259
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,829
Maybe lonely feeling.

260
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,376
You feel it?

261
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,430
Good. Now, let it out.

262
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,344
Be spontaneous.

263
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,754
That, what is that?

264
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,012
I'm being spontan-you-us.

265
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,209
Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl?

266
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,922
You want to make the egg?

267
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,217
Oh, yes.

268
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:04,275
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog.
Do not move muscle.

269
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,967
No moving!

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,020
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

271
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,068
Enough!

272
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,181
Okay. We go back to the top.

273
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,243
Forget body. Look inside soul.

274
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:24,097
Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling.

275
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,677
So enormous it fills whole body.

276
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,124
It must escape or you explode.

277
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,181
-Now, open your little beak.
-Come on.

278
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,444
Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that’s it.

279
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,016
Now.... Now....

280
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,596
Now

281
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,146
Disaster! Catastrophe!

282
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,592
I never fail before.

283
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,788
Never! Never!

284
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,820
-Well, 1 thought it was kind of cute.
-But it just ain't penguin, okay?

285
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,256
So what if he’s a little different?
l always kind of liked different.

286
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,163
He’s not different.
He’s a regular emperor penguin.

287
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,440
Hey, you know what? I can leave school.

288
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,792
Il can go to work. The three of us.

289
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,601
Whoa, little fella. You ain’t going nowhere
till you got yourself an education.

290
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,814
You get them singing muscles
big and strong, you got that?

291
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,328
Vil try, Pa.

292
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,708
You bet you will. The word "triumph"
starts with "try," and it ends with...?

293
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,530
-"Umph."
-That’s right. A great big "umph.”

294
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,117
I'm going fishing.

295
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,185
Oh, Mumble.

296
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,334
That first hard summer...

297
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,457
..-While his mom and dad
were working overtime...

298
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,550
...on the great commute to the sea...

299
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,879
...Mumble found a place
away from disapproving eyes...

300
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:33,374
..-where a funky little fella
could be himself.

301
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,838
Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird?

302
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,263
Nothing. What are you doing?

303
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,196
Nothing. Just dropped in
for a little lunch.

304
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,109
There's food? Here?

305
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,349
Leg or wing?

306
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,854
Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I'm a penguin.

307
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,566
Exactly. The flipper birds,
that’s you, eat the fish.

308
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,286
The flying birds, that’s me,
eat the flipper bird and the fish.

309
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,851
And lately, there ain't a lot of fish.

310
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,132
-So....
-This time I’m getting the juicy bits.

311
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,671
-Me first!
-Hey, you want a piece of me?

312
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,471
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm trying to think about lunch.

313
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,777
Wait! Watch this!

314
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:14,923
Yeah, that’s weird, all right. Listen.
For once, we're gonna do this civilized.

315
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,995
-Now, get in line--
-Hey! What's that on your leg?

316
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,234
-What? This little thing?
-Oh, no. Don’t start him on that.

317
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,537
Shut up! The little flipper bird
asked me a perceptive question.

318
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,460
-A question like that deserves an answer.
-Here we go.

319
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,420
I got two words for you:

320
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,546
“Alien abduction.”

321
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,522
-Oh, you had to ask.
-Have mercy.

322
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,540
Quiet!

323
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,926
Now, little buddy,
there is something out there.

324
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,346
Creatures. Not like us.

325
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,735
Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too.

326
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,486
-Ask me how I know.
-How?

327
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,746
Because I've been captured by them,
that’s how.

328
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,081
Unbelievable.

329
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,112
What do you mean “unbelievable?”
It’s true.

330
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,478
I'm sitting on a rock,
minding my own business...

331
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,320
...when suddenly, they're onto me.

332
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,559
These beings, like big ugly penguins.

333
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,860
Fat, flabby faces with front-ways eyes...

334
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,283
..no feathers, no beaks,
and these-- These appendages.

335
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,250
They probe me. They tie me up.
They strap me down.

336
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,253
They take this pointy thing
and they stick it into me.

337
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,020
And then, blackout.

338
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,736
Gosh.

339
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,654
l woke up and there’s this--
This thing on me.

340
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:21,897
Every flying bird is dissing me,
“Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?”

341
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,331
It was humiliating.

342
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,770
And then what?

343
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,745
It was humiliating.
What more do you want?

344
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,992
They could have eated you.

345
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,125
Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,400
I guess my pitiful cries for mercy
appealed to their better nature.

347
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,781
Can I appeal to your better nature?

348
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,712
Nice try, kid, but no.

349
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,970
No. No. No!

350
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,985
What you doing down there, flipper bird?

351
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,247
Get up here.

352
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,976
Get back up here this minute.

353
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,247
Oh, great. You let him get away.
Didn't you?

354
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,823
All your screwy alien talk.

355
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,141
-Hey, I’m an abductee.
-Abduct this.

356
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,897
-Don’t make me call Uncle Angie.
-Oh, fine.

357
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,235
Where youse going? I'm an abductee!

358
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,789
-I don’t care what you are, I'm hungry!
-Would you like to hear our specials?

359
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:13,265
How about fish? There’s no fish.
How about penguin? There’s no penguin.

360
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,583
What are we gonna eat?!

361
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,630
There's a world where I can go

362
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:35,206
And tell my secrets to

363
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,921
in my room

364
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,377
Paying no mind to his dancing heart...

365
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,771
...the kid saw out his school days
at the back of the class...

366
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,125
...lost in his imaginings.

367
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,989
Now it's dark and I'm--

368
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:57,962
What fabulous worlds lay out there,
far beyond the ice?

369
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,398
-- won't be afraid

370
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,508
Was there any place...

371
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,918
.-.-where one small penguin
without a Heartsong...

372
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,889
...could ever truly belong?

373
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,698
in my room

374
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,845
And so, a thousand generations ago...

375
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,408
...our forefathers
forsook our wings for flippers.

376
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,672
You graduates going to sea
for the first time...

377
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,584
...are to reap the benefits
of their wise choice.

378
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,825
These are lean and uncertain times.

379
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,718
But by the power
of the ancient penguin wisdoms...

380
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,944
...we, my brethren, will endure.

381
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,954
-"Blah, blah, blah.”
-Norma Jean.

382
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,893
Who is he to say my boy can’t graduate?
He’s not hurting anyone.

383
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:59,514
--true to our ways
and you will always be worthy of this...

384
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:04,749
...our brave penguin nation. Excelsior!

385
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,113
Ocean, here I come!

386
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,317
You know what? We're gonna have
a little graduation ceremony of our own.

387
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,131
-You mean it, Ma?
-You betcha.

388
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,805
-Excelsior!£
-Excelsior!£

00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:35,145
-Pa.
-Memphis.

391
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,687
-Go get them, tiger.
-Thanks, Ma.

392
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,709
-Make every moment count!
-Got you, Ma!

393
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,991
-Remember, "Stranger Danger.”
-Yeah, sure, Pa.

394
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,110
And watch out for those leopard seals
and them killer whales.

395
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,991
Mark this, Noah.

396
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:59,156
That boy was always a bad egg.
I'm telling you, no good will come of this.

397
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,024
Guys!

398
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,947
Wait up!

399
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,720
What do you think?

400
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,469
-You first.
-No, you first.

401
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,112
No. No, no, no.

402
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,036
Stop pushing!

403
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,648
-What was that?
-l think it was the fuzzball.

404
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,066
See any blood?

405
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,351
What you waiting for?

406
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,263

Fish!

416
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,663

You just let him get away!

427

-He’s certainly not eating.

428

Mumble? Are you okay?

429
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,485

00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,917
Mambo!

528
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,245
Everybody's so...spontan-you-us.

529
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,196
Spontan-you-us!

530
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,716
And these are the bad times!

531
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,973
-Yeah, our food chain go loco.
-Everyone a bit down.

532
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,947
But it ain’t gonna stop no party!

533
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,152
-Viva la party!
-Watch me work.

534
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,130
Gosh, he’s eating rocks.

535
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,037
-You hear what he said?
-"Eating rocks."

536
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,054
But he had a rock in his mouth.

537
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,389
That's no rock, hombre. It’s love stones.

538
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:50,596
-For building the nest.
-The one with the most pebbles wins.

539
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,216
You know:

540
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,455
You're not interested in chicas?

541
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,013
-Hey, hey, hey.
-You kidding?

542
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:59,972
Without us, the chicas got no boom.

543
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,736
-Why aren't you collecting pebbles?
-Pebbles, schmebbles, man.

544
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:07,408
We got personality, with a capital Y.
Why? Because we're hot.

545
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,448
Watch and learn, tall boy.

546
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,352
-Hey. Hey, baby.
-Over here, mama. Chicky baby.

547
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,052
-Baby.
-What are you looking at?

548
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,823
-You looking at me?
-Come over here.

549
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:19,505
-Come on, mami.
-You see something you like, yes?

550
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,218
I don’t think so. Not tonight, baby.

551
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,009
Oh, don't be so snooty, booty.

552
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,993
That's the way...you like it, you like it

553
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:31,056
You want it, got it
Could've had it, you missed it

554
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,276
Look at the feet, huh?

555
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,600
-Where'd you learn that?
-The big guy.

556
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,322
-He from out of town.
-He with us.

557
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,754
-Do it again.
-Do it, baby. Show me those flipping feet.

558
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,573
-No, no, no. Sorry, girls.
-Some other time maybe.

559
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,622
You guys are soft in the head, okay?

560
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,365
Let's go.

561
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,383
-Leave them wanting more, you know?
-Hold back till the season.

562
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,386
-You show them what you got.
-Either you got it or not.

563
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,179
-And the Amigos?
-We got it!

564
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,743
You think I could get some of it?

565
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:08,328
Hombre, you’ve got so much already,
you dangerous, baby.

566
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,450
You really think so?

567
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,335
You kidding? With moves like yours...

568
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,887
..-you must have all the ladies
drooling at your feet.

569
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,013
-l wouldn't say that.
-Oh, listen to him. He’s so cute.

570
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,000
Let me tell something to you.

571
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:24,993
Except for me, tall boy,
you got the most charisma of anybody.

572
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,730
Put that ego away, Ramon,
you're gonna hurt someone.

573
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:32,763
You so jealous. Just a moment.
I hear people wanting something.

574
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,244
Me!

575
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,798
-Mambo
-Okay, you girlies, Mambo

576
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:42,377
One more time now, mambo
Mambo, mambo, mambo

577
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,731
Mambo!

578
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,856
Your turn, your turn.

579
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,926
Oh, get down.

580
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,062
Man, this guy is so accidentally cool.

581
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,153
Okay, okay.

582
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,511
Mama!

583
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,612
Mommy!

584
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,893
Come on, Fluffy.

585
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,599
Oh, I love gravity.

586
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,830
-Oh, I feel like reminiscing.
-Remin-icing?

587
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,424
-It was too close.
-Come on, come on.

588
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,031
Hey, guys! Where are we going?

589
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,366
-We relocating.
-Placing ourselves elsewhere.

590
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,410
-But that thing, what was it?
-How should we know?

591
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,046
-We're penguins.
-Very little penguins.

592
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,985
But where did it come from?
It’s so weird, so alien.

593
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,753
-What'’s he talking about?
-Some hombre called Elian.

594
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,382
I don’t know a guy Elian.
I knew a guy named Estevan--

595
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,898
-Not Estevan, Elian.
-Guys, we have a mystery here.

596
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,339
A mind-boggling mystery.

597
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,352
So? What are we
supposed to do about it?

598
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,714
Amigos, we gotta get
to the bottom of this thing.

599
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:17,484
Big guy, let me tell something to you.
Come close. Don't be afraid.

600
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:19,785
-You want answers?
-Yeah.

601
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,364
-That’s all you need?
-Yeah.

602
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,569
-Nothing else?
-No.

603
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,067
Then this is very easy.

604
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,422
You go see Lovelace.

605
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,134
-Lovelace.
-Go see Lovelace.

606
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:30,256
-Genius, Ramon. You are the man.
-Thank you.

607
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:32,225
-l take a moment for myself.
-Let’s go.

608
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,720
-Bow down.
-You the man.

609
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,095
-That’s enough, I feel your love.
-Who’s Lovelace?

610
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,597
-Lovelace is the guru.
-Go see Lovelace.

611
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,890
-He got the answer to everything.
-Everything.

612
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:43,159
-Really?
-Ask him, he never wrong.

613
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:46,458
But first, you gonna need a pebble.

614
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:54,512
Hold it, y'all. 1 have a warning
for the audience.

615
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,700
Ladies, please, avert your eyes...

616
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:02,200
...-because I've been known to hypnotize.

617
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,494
You heard the voice,
now you're about to meet...

618
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:10,618
...the one and only Lovelace,
in the flesh...

619
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:15,732
tight here, right on, right now.

620
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:19,451
The devotion, please.

621
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:21,608
Oh, yeah.

622
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:24,145
And now, your question.

623
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:25,889
Sefior Lovelace...

624
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,377
...my wife has disappeared. Is she alive?

625
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:36,214
is she alive now?
Separate the truth from the jive

626
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:40,004
Speak to me, oh, mystic beings

627
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,443
Yes! She's happy
and you're in her thoughts.

628
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,503
Is she with another male?

629
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,465
One pebble, one question. Next!

630
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,647
Oh, Serene One.
Please ask the mystic beings...

631
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,592
..-Will 1 ever be as rich as you?

632
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,890
In your dreams, Jean. Next!

633
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,180
-Go ahead. Go ahead.
-Get up there, big guy.

634
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,999
-That’s it. Don’t be scared.
-Gentleman, please! One at a time.

635
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,393
-We with him.
-Yeah, we together.

636
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,877
-He got a beautiful question. Go.
-Do it.

637
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:11,681
Just don't look him in the eye.

638
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,793
Have you ever been abducted by aliens?

639
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,735
Excuse me?
What kind of question is that? Next!

640
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,085
No, wait, sefior.

641
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,162
I met a skua once, with something like that
on his foot, said he was abducted by aliens.

642
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:27,043
This, friend, is my sacred talisman...

643
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:30,116
Talisman, talisman

644
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,714
... bestowed on me by the mystic beings...

645
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:36,551
Mystic beings

646
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:40,464
...during my epic journey
of enlightenment...

647
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,049
...to the forbidden shore.

648
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,427
Forbidden shore

649
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,656
Oh, say it one more.

650
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,209
-Forbidden shore
-Oh, yeah

651
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:53,486
Wait, you saw mystic beings?

652
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,784
I hear them! They speak through me!

653
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:59,165
Oh, yeah.

654
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,220
There’s a power that makes me
stand upon this tower!

655
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,420
Did they have front-ways eyes?
Did they probe you? Strap you down?

656
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:08,953
Enough! "Did they probe me?”

657
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,993
Too many questions!
You don’t have enough pebbles, fool.

658
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:14,477
You haven't answered
any of my questions.

659
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:18,031
-How many questions he got?
-We've all got stuff to ask!

660
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,213
Enough!

661
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,136
You bring this stranger before me.

662
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,629
He doubts my powers.
He compares me to a skua.

663
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,307
The voices are shrieking in my head.

664
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,276
They say, "Lovelace, who is this fool?

665
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:43,663
Tell him! Tell him to go forth
and multiply!"

666
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:45,875
Come to think of it...

667
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:49,547
...why don't we all go forth and multiply?

668
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,074
-Lovelace.
-What he saying?

669
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,090
-It’s mating season.
-Already?

670
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:58,018
I will retire now
to my couch of perpetual indulgence.

671
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,823
-Okay, ladies, who's first?
-Me!

672
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,714
One at a time. Don’t touch the talisman,
baby, please.

673
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,091
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about us?

674
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,087
Lovelace, Lovelace, Lovelace!

675
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,144
Hear me!

676
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,310
There's not enough love in the world.

677
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,542
Turn to the penguin next to you.

678
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,077
Put your flippers up.
Fluff him up a little bit.

679
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,707
And give him a great big hug.

680
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,073
Okay, ladies.

681
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,587
Oh, make that little noise again, girl.

682
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,413
Hey, what he got we don’t got, man?

683
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,421
-What you hugging me for?
-He told me to.

684
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:33,897
-Get away.
-No, you like it.

685
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:35,118
Get off him, Ramon.

686
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,169
Stretch, got any stones
where you come from?

687
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,458
-We don't collect stones.
-You don't? Why not?

688
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:40,759
We live on the ice.

689
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,638
So how you win the heart of the ladies?

690
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,217
Well, we sing.

691
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:49,761
-Stop! That's crazy!
-You're kidding, right?

692
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:51,911
No. We sing to each other.

693
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,933
If someone special likes your song,
you know....

694
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,083
Oh, and you have someone special?

695
00:47:57,475 --> 00:48:00,404
-A tall beauty in your dark romantic past?
-Of which you never speak?

696
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:01,938
Well, sort of.

697
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,706
Hey, let's go check it out.
Maybe she got some friends.

698
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,086
I like them tall.

699
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,614
It's never gonna work.

700
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:09,502
-Hey, big guy.
-It’s the loving season.

701
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,197
All you gotta do is sing.

702
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,845
That's the problem. I can’t.

703
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,360
-You a bird, ain't you?
-All birds can sing.

704
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,816
! don't sing like the birdie do

705
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,640
All right.

706
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,368
Find me, find me

707
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,430
What's he doing?

708
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,336
-l think he’s singing.
-I know singing, that’s not singing.

709
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:33,808
l heard an animal once do that,
but then they rolled him over, he was dead.

710
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,815
Yeah. And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

711
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,966
You in tragic shape, man.

712
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,251
-Don't worry. We can fix it.
-We can?

713
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,586
-Absolutely. We can. We can.
-We can?

714
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,162
-Really?
-Yes! Let me tell something to you.

715
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,585
-Come close. Closer. You wanna sing?
-Yeah.

716
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:52,471
-You sure?
-Absolutely.

717
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,940
You making fun of me?
Then this is very easy.

718
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:58,118
Really? Gosh, if 1 could sing,
that would change everything.

719
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:02,359
You will sing. You just got to do
exactly what I say.

720
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,910
-Okay.
-Did I say "okay"?

721
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,652
-No.
-No. What did I say?

722
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:10,111
-Do exactly what you say.
-Exactly what I say.

723
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:18,189
Don't push me
‘Cause I'm close to the edge

724
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:24,741
I'm trying not to lose my...

725
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,600
Gloria

726
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,895
It's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder

727
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,413
How I keep from going under

728
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,985
Midnight creeps so slowly

729
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:41,286
Into hearts of those
Who need more than they get

730
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:45,966
Daylight deals a bad hand

731
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,630
To a penguin who has laid too many bets

732
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,863
it make love to you
Like you want me to

733
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,040
And I'll hold you tight, baby, all...

734
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:00,673
Gloria

735
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:05,798
The mirror stares you in the face

736
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:08,247
And says, "Baby--"

737
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,719
Shake a bon-bon, Shake a--

738
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,330
ft don't work

739
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:16,185
You say your prayers
Though you don't care

740
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:22,311
You say your prayers
Though you don't care

741
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,410
Boys! Boys!

742
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,560
Boys!

743
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,015
Mumble?

744
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:55,688
Mumble.

745
00:50:57,655 --> 00:50:59,905
Oh, hi, Gloria.

746
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,127
And this is you?

747
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,263
Sure, it’s me. You like?

748
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:17,551
Well, ! would, if it were really you, yeah.

749
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,756
Well, it is me, sort of.

750
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:22,634
Yeah.

751
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,623
Turn around.

752
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,384
-Turn around.
-Why?

753
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,560
-Well, why not?
-Well....

754
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:32,982
-What do you know?
-Yeah.

755
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:35,254
My way

756
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:37,833
-Gloria.
-Mumble, how could you?

757
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,692
Hello.

758
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:44,478
I know size can be daunting,
but don't be afraid. I love you.

759
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,005
-Gloria, please.
-l love you.

760
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,398
-Gloria!
-Gloria!

761
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:49,666
-Gloria!
-Gloria!

762
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:52,084
-Please, Gloria, wait!
-Please, Gloria, wait for me!

763
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:55,458
-Stop it!
-Okay.

764
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,559
Mumble, what could
you possibly be thinking?

765
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,896
I don’t know what else to do.

766
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,717
Oh, Gloria, no.

767
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:11,962
Gloria

768
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,959
Gloria

769
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:17,864
Go up there, right now.

770
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,978
Daylight deals a bad hand...

771
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:24,542
Gloria. Gloria.

772
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,495
Sing to this.

773
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,426
Mumble, you're embarrassing me.

774
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:41,113
Baby...it don’t work.

775
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,222
Baby

776
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:58,123
So slowly

777
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:02,619
So slowly into hearts of those

778
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:08,537
Who need more than they get

779
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,960
Daylight deals a bad hand

780
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:18,453
To a penguin that has laid too many bets

781
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,806
The mirror stares you in the face

782
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:26,837
And says, "Baby...it don't work”

783
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:30,981
You say your prayers
Though you don't care

784
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:37,761
You sing and you shake the hurt

785
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:40,543
Dance!

786
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,474
Boogie wonderland

787
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:53,298
Dance

788
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:57,684
Boogie wonderland

789
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,332
Midnight creeps so slowly

790
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:04,751
Into hearts of men
Who need more than they get

791
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,496
Daylight deals a bad hand

792
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:12,075
To a penguin who has laid too many bets

793
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,805
The mirror stares you in the face

794
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,196
And says, "Baby...it don't work”

795
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,857
You say your prayers
Though you don't care

796
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,070
You dance and shake the hurt

797
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,797
Dance!

798
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:29,092
Mumble!

799
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:33,089
Boogie wonderland

800
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,441
Dance, dance, dance

801
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:36,859
Mumble

802
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:39,044
Boogie wonderland

803
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,696
Check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out

804
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,384
My brothers

805
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:55,473
You look so beautiful to me, baby

806
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:06,859
-Mumble.
-Hey, Miss Viola.

807
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:12,187
-All the love in the world can't be gone
-Mumble!

808
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:17,403
-All the need to be loved can't be wrong
-Mumble!

809
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:19,551
Disgraceful!

810
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,938
Who do they think they are?

811
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,480
Where is Noah?
This is getting out of hand.

812
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:28,691
Go!

813
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,273
Hey, Memphis. It’s your boy, Mumble.

814
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,622
-Mumble?
-Mumble?

815
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:42,206
No, no. No, it’s "Mambo." O!

816
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,846
Baby. They're saying, "Mumble.”

817
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,564
Boogie!

818
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,016
Behold, Noah, look!

819
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:15,604
This was an omen from the start
and now we have this uprising.

820
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:19,606
Stop! Stop!

821
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,550
Stop this unruly nonsense!

822
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,353
Stop it right now!

823
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:32,027
A little self-control, if you please!

824
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:36,619
You bring this disorder, this aberration,
to the very heart of our community.

825
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:38,471
Have you lost your minds?

826
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,345
-We're just having fun.
-Harmless fun.

827
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:44,451
"Harmless"? It is this kind of backsliding
that has brought the scarcity upon us.

828
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:47,355
Excuse me, smiley. Can you speak
plain penguin, please?

829
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,178
He thinks the food shortage
has something to do with me.

830
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:53,894
Do you not understand that we can
only survive here when we're in harmony?

831
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,351
When you and your foreign friends
lead us into your easy ways...

832
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,345
...you offend the Great 'Guin.

833
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,415
You invite him to withhold his bounty.

834
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,978
-He rules the seasons.
-He giveth and he can taketh away.

835
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,779
Wait a minute.
Happy feet can’t cause a famine.

836
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,417
If thy kind of pagan display
did not cause it, then what did?

837
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:14,049
I think it comes from outside.
Way beyond the ice.

838
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:16,548
There are things out there,
things we don’t understand.

839
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,460
-Mysteries.
-Mind-boggling mysteries.

840
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,065
-Mystic beings.
-Yeah, aliens.

841
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:21,834
-He’s mad.
-No, aliens.

842
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,665
-l hear they're smart.
-He’s insane.

843
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,351
No, they might be smarter than all of us.
Who knows?

844
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,953
He drove the fish away,
now he’s ranting this rubbish!

845
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:32,283
-Hey, let me tell something to you.
-Don't touch me, you filthy vermin.

846
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,459
-Hey, watch it.
-And so it follows.

847
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:37,921
Dissent leads to division
and division leads us to doom.

848
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:41,212
-You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go.
-Hear, hear.

849
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,897
Don't you take one step, sweetheart.

850
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:47,431
You have as much right to be here
as any of these daffy old fools.

851
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,979
Norma Jean, I'll deal with this.

852
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,758
Pa?

853
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,935
Mumble, you must renounce
your so-called friends...

854
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,255
...your peculiar thoughts,
your strange ways.

855
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:01,877
-Memphis.
-If we are devout...

856
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:04,082
...Ssincere In Our praise,
the fish will return.

857
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:07,384
-But, Pa--
-Listen, boy, 1 was a backslider myself.

858
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,941
l was careless
and now we're paying the price.

859
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:11,787
What's this got to do with Mumble?

860
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,735
-It's why he is the way he is.
-There’s nothing wrong with him!

861
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,948
-Face it, our son's all messed up.
-He’s not messed up, hear me?

862
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,225
-Believe me, I know.
-How can you say that?

863
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,350
Because when he was just an egg,
I dropped him!

864
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,450
Memphis.

865
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,874
Mumble.

866
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,625
Oh, my poor little Mumble.

867
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,571
But, Mom, I’m perfectly fine.

868
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:37,696
-No. No, you're not, boy.
-That’s right.

869
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:41,245
For all our sakes, you must stop
this freakiness with the feet.

870
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:45,482
Your father speaks wisely.
Heed his suffering heart and repent.

871
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:48,086
But it just doesn’t make any sense.

872
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,335
Then your arrogance leaves us no choice!

873
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:51,631
No, wait.

874
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:56,513
Please, son, you can do this.
It ain’t so hard.

875
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:02,189
Don’t ask me to change, Pa,
because I can’t.

876
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:10,406
And that, my brethren, is the end of it.

877
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,718
You, begone!

878
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,786
-Mumble.
-No, Ma, it’s okay. It's okay.

879
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:22,764
Let me tell something to you.

880
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,130
When I find out
what’s happening to the fish...

881
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,843
[Il be back.

882
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,328
Let me through? Let me through.

883
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,540
-Mumble, you don’t have to go.
-Let it be.

884
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,139
-Gloria.
-No. No, Dad, this isn’t fair.

885
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,565
Gloria, listen to your father.

886
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:43,231
My folks were always putting him down

887
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,601
Down, down, down

888
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:50,867
They said he came
From the wrong side of town

889
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:54,625
He came from the wrong side of town

890
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:57,944
They told me he was bad

891
00:59:58,495 --> 00:59:59,455
So bad

892
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:03,223
-But 1 know he was sad
-So sad

893
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:08,407
Vit never forget him
The leader of the pack

894
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:12,576
We sing the heart
of our true friend, Mumble.

895
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:18,480
You are a nation of peeny-weeny,
piffling, piccolini, piddly-diddly pouft!

896
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,120
Together, we prevail.

897
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:24,158
In the wisdoms, we trust.

898
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,254
We trust.

899
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,115
Look out

900
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,608
Look out

901
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,577
Look out

902
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:44,173
Look

903
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:48,508
Look out

904
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:56,372
Don’t worry, tall guy.
My father also called me a pitiful loser.

905
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,042
Look how I turn out.

906
01:00:58,355 --> 01:00:59,405
You're not helping, Ramon.

907
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:02,973
He gonna be okay. All he gotta do
is find out what happened to the fish.

908
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,323
-How he gonna do that?
-He think of something.

909
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,479
-The aliens.
-What?

910
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:10,388
-I’m gonna talk to the aliens.
-How you gonna find aliens?

911
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:13,151
-Lovelace.
-He don't like you. He don’t like you at all.

912
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:15,477
That's okay. I'll appeal
to his better nature.

913
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:18,076
-How you gonna do that?
-Cruel and unusual punishment?

914
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:20,732
-Unimaginable torture?
-Imaginable torture?

915
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:23,140
-Your singing?
-No!

916
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,630
"Can anybody find me"...

917
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,656
-You're cracking the ice!
-Avalanche!

918
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,612
Yes, okay. Thank you.

919
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:43,781
Lovelace. You there?

920
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,171
Lovelace!

921
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:50,886
Lovelace.

922
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:57,576
Lovelace?

923
01:01:57,948 --> 01:01:59,118
Is this a bad time?

924
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,149
I know we don’t have
an appointment, but--

925
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,421
Just one question and
I want a straight answer.

926
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,253
Where do I find the mystic beings?

927
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,041
Why don't he speak?

928
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,605
Lovelace, you okay?

929
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,209
-Boy, he’s possessed.
-It’s a seizure! It’s a seizure!

930
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,058
-Open the beak.
-Grab his tongue.

931
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,684
He’s choking. That thing
around his neck, it’s too tight.

932
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,484
-Well, why didn’t you say so?
-On three.

933
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:30,727
Stop! Listen! No! Amigos! Amigos! Stop!

934
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,164
-What?
-You're hurting him.

935
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:36,775
Any better?

936
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,339
Lovelace, how did you get
that thing around your neck?

937
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:42,752
-It was bestowed on him.
-By the mystic beings.

938
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,226
-They didn't bestow it?
-No.

939
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:48,292
Oh, come on, he don't know
what he’s saying.

940
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:51,462
You were swimming
and it just got caught around your neck.

941
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,552
Oh, no way. He the guru.

942
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,715
Lovelace, did you ever actually meet
a mystic being?

943
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:01,272
Officially?

944
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:03,816
No.

945
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,814
I knew it! It’s all a lie.

946
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:07,856
But this belongs to someone.

947
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:10,621
If we could find them,
I bet you they could take it off.

948
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:15,073
Show me where you found it. I'm sure
they could help us. You and me both.

949
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,098
Two words, three syllables.

950
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:22,077
-What is it?
-You're dying?

951
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,715
No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life.

952
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:27,736
You're passing gas.

953
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:31,089
Now he thinks he’s an elephant seal.

954
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,207
No, no, no. Go over the mountains.

955
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,190
-Go over the mountains!
-Through the land of the elephant seals.

956
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:40,753
-Beyond the land of the elephant seals.
-Beyond the land of the elephant seals!

957
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:54,162
-Wait.
-What?

958
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,082
l hear voices.

959
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,960
-There is a voice.
-Where?

960
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,466
-There’s a little voice on the wind.
-Mumble!

961
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:04,212
-"Mambo"?
-"Mambo"?

962
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,801
-Listen.
-Mumble Happy Feet.

963
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,589
-Gloria?
-Gloria!

964
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:08,781
Gloria?

965
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:11,299
Hey, you got a stalker.
She's obsessed with you, man.

966
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,388
Il can’t believe it's you.

967
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,663
Of course it’s me.

968
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:22,714
What are you doing here?

969
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,903
All the love in the world can't be gone

970
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:29,863
All the need to be loved can't be wrong

971
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,900
-Oh, my.
-So which way, twinkletoes?

972
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:36,363
No, no, no. If you come,
you may never get back home.

973
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,140
Fine by me.

974
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:43,275
Gloria, you have a life back there.
I don’t. 1 mean, we don’t. Not out here.

975
01:04:44,114 --> 01:04:46,834
How can we keep an egg safe?
That's if we ever had an egg.

976
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,664
Well, [ don’t need an egg to be happy.

977
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:53,692
You say that now, but what about later
when all your friends have eggs?

978
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,638
Then I'll have you.

979
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:01,218
Now he’s going to pledge
his soul forever.

980
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:02,787
-Gloria.
-Here it comes.

981
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:09,189
I'm a particular kind of guy,
the kind of guy who needs his own space.

982
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,946
It’s not you, it’s me.

983
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:14,482
I'm just not up for a serious relationship
right now.

984
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:17,874
What he’s trying to do now
is he’s pushing her away. Let's watch.

985
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:21,518
No matter what you say or do,
you're stuck with me.

986
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:24,837
Oh, come on. As if you're not
totally thrilled that I'm here.

987
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:28,428
-Now she got him on the ropes.
-See, right there is your problem.

988
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,695
You think you're irresistible, don’t you?

989
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,144
I don't care where you're from,
that’s got to hurt.

990
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,996
-Excuse me?
-Gloria’s so gorgeous, Gloria’s so talented.

991
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:37,368
What?

992
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,777
Just because
you can hit a few high notes.

993
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,106
You got a problem with my singing?

994
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,499
No, it’s perfectly fine.

995
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,580
-"Fine"?
-If you like that sort of thing.

996
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,256
-It’s a little Nana Tootsie for my taste.
-What?

997
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:51,616
You know, showy, flashy, froufrou.

998
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,357
-"Froufrou”?
-That’s right.

999
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:57,346
Coming from someone who thinks it’s cool
to jig up and down really fast on the spot...

1000
01:05:58,021 --> 01:06:00,011
...like some twitchy idiot.

1001
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,370
You stubborn, hippity-hoppity fool!

1002
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:08,502
Right back at you.

1003
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,265
Amigo, that was a good thing you do.

1004
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,734
She is going to be so much better off
without you.

1005
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,930
She is going to find a good, steady guy
to comfort her...

1006
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:30,294
..and love her up real good
and raise a big family.

1007
01:06:30,854 --> 01:06:32,814
-Ramon.
-And then she’s going to let herself go--

1008
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:36,006
Ramon. He’s hurting. He’s hurting bad.

1009
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,659
Oh, listen, listen, don't hold it in
or you explode. You got to let it out.

1010
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,767
You just let it out. You let it out.

1011
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:46,787
Everybody, turn away for a moment.

1012
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,323
If she leave him now

1013
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:54,342
She take away the biggest part of him

1014
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,047
Don't, baby, please, don't go

1015
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:01,089
Please, guys.

1016
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,234
No more singing.

1017
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,403
Then she say to me, "Enough,
you are making me nauseous.”

1018
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:20,180
So I become silent, almost moody,
and you know what she says?

1019
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,613
“You never share. You got to let it out.”

1020
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,469
-Ramon, come on.
-Let it out. Let it out.

1021
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,235
Stop it! Let it go.

1022
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:30,797
-I never had a good relationship in my life.
-Give him a hug. Give him a hug.

1023
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,494
-l let it out!
-There we go.

1024
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,065
-[ let it out.
-l know. Get over it.

1025
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,012
-Can you keep going?
-Yeah.

1026
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:41,331
-What’s that smell?
-It wasn't me.

1027
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:46,169
Hey, Fluffy, we're following you.
Get up here.

1028
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:58,341
So these elephant seals,
they're not penguin eaters, are they?

1029
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:01,118
I don’t know.
I believe they are herbivores.

1030
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,218
-What?
-You know, kelp-suckers.

1031
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,663
Here we go, Lovelace. Come on.

1032
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,257
Jump in time. Jump in time.

1033
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,082
-Okay, let’s do it.
-Okay, okay, okay. Ready?

1034
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:17,734
I can do this. I can do this.
I got to trick myself.

1035
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,864
Boy, look at that. What?

1036
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:40,055
You blokes better be lost,
because trespassing’s a crime.

1037
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,293
-We're just passing through.
-Yeah. We're with him.

1038
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:47,558
You wouldn't be heading
over them distant hills...

1039
01:08:48,024 --> 01:08:49,724
..and through the blizzard country?

1040
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,586
If it’s the only way
to the forbidden shore, yeah.

1041
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:54,145
Crikey.

1042
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:57,533
You might come face to face
with an annihilator.

1043
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,033
An alien annihilator?

1044
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,915
Too right. Cut you up
as soon as look at you.

1045
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:05,098
Waste every living thing in their path.

1046
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,102
Could they be annihilating the fish?

1047
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:08,876
Every living thing.

1048
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,415
Merciless, mate. Merciless.

1049
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,901
Even if you're a whopping great whale...

1050
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,690
...they drag your sorry carcass ashore...

1051
01:09:17,185 --> 01:09:22,196
...dice you up, melt you down,
and turn you into fun food.

1052
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:25,049
One day you're a big old whale...

1053
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:27,515
..next minute...

1054
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:29,193
..-fun food.

1055
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:30,792
Someone's gotta stop them.

1056
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:33,323
Oh, yeah? What's gonna be
your approach?

1057
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:35,582
If I could just talk to them.

1058
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,315
Appeal to their better nature.

1059
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:38,544
Beauty.

1060
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:43,761
When that crafty little trick pays off,
you be sure to let us know, won't you?

1061
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:47,134
All right, Lovelace, let's go.

1062
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,559
See you, Lovelace.

1063
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,397
Your funeral, mate.

1064
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:46,757
Oh, man!

1065
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:50,510
-Push tight.
-Okay.

1066
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:07,394
Come on, guys. Let’s do it.

1067
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:11,260
You can do it. Come on, push!

1068
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,758
What's that noise?

1069
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:00,599
There's no noise.

1070
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,167
-No gasping. No wheezing.
-Where's Lovelace?

1071
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:09,745
Sometimes a brave penguin
will just slip away to die.

1072
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,193
Do you think he went to a happy place?

1073
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:15,755
-Probably.
-No, no. I think he went this way.

1074
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:30,433
Come on. Let’s go.

1075
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:49,000
Lovelace!

1076
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:52,589
Lovelace!

1077
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,550
Hello?

1078
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:03,407
Is there anyone there?

1079
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,906
-No-- No need to shout.
-Somebody might hear you.

1080
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:14,539
His feet don't look too good.

1081
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:17,204
-He rested here.
-Now he's on his belly!

1082
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,943
-No, this way.
-You don’t want to know what he did here.

1083
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,389
-You're right.
-There he is. Lovelace!

1084
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:25,732
-All right! Lovelace!
-Lovelace!

1085
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,455
-Oh, look at Lovelace.
-We're here.

1086
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,970
-Are you okay?
-Come on, man. Hang in there, buddy.

1087
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:36,708
What is it?

1088
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,949
Oh, look. There’s one for everyone.

1089
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,736
Hang in there, Lovelace.
I know they're here somewhere.

1090
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:45,439
-Why would they leave all this behind?
-I don’t know.

1091
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:47,626
Hey.

1092
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,914
-Tell them we come in peace.
-We come in peace!

1093
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:51,699
-Lovelace.
-Lovelace.

1094
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:53,351
-Lovelace.
-Oh, buddy, come on.

1095
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:55,506
-Are you okay?
-Hang in there, buddy.

1096
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:00,537
-Oh, that’s not good.
-Stay calm.

1097
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,143
-Stay calm.
-That’s not good.

1098
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:04,750
-Okay, don't stay calm!
-Panic!

1099
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,510
Oh, no, no!

1100
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:18,505
-Oh, they’re making us appe-teasers.
-They’re appe-teasing us!

1101
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:20,925
We're all gonna die.

1102
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,098
Whatever you do, stay out of the water!

1103
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,363
-Stay out of the water.
-Don't go in the water!

1104
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,166
Lovelace, don’t go in the water!

1105
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:36,678
Lovelace, hang in there!

1106
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:38,709
Hang in there!

1107
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,939
Get your dirty tongue off him!

1108
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:47,385
No, no, no!

1109
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,073
Stay out of the water!

1110
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,907
-Mumble!
-Mumble!

1111
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:25,424
-They playing birdminton?
-No, it’s a show. Dinner and a show.

1112
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,875
Lovelace!

1113
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,450
Rejoice!

1114
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,160
Lovelace!

1115
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:51,288
-Help!
-Reach out!

1116
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,324
Thank you, my brother, thank you!

1117
01:16:04,527 --> 01:16:06,167
l wasn’t scared! 1 wasn’t scared!

1118
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:10,656
Oh, my beautiful brother, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!

1119
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,914
-Go, Lovelace! You the man!
-Go, go, go, go, go!

1120
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:20,611
Enough!

1121
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,917
It's a bad day for you!

1122
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,155
You dealing with Lovelace now!

1123
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,921
-And my man, Mumble, here.
-You tell them, Lovelace.

1124
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,847
Begone, demon fish. Adios.

1125
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,018
That's right.

1126
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,940
You hightail it back to your mamas.

1127
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:38,269
-How did he do that?
-Don’t make me come in the water.

1128
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,394
I'll come after your sons and daughters.

1129
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,546
I’m gonna give you the bad eye.

1130
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:38,256
A whole bunch of them.

1131
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,897
They gonna rule the world.

1132
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:42,260
It’s gotta be them.

1133
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:45,428
-If it is, 1 don’t wanna know about it.
-They don’t even know we exist.

1134
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,165
Let me tell something to you.

1135
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,126
This is the end of the road. It’s over.

1136
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,216
You did everything penguinly possible.

1137
01:17:53,736 --> 01:17:55,906
-You found the aliens.
-We gonna testify to that.

1138
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:59,332
We'll tell your whole laughing-boy nation
they were dead wrong about you.

1139
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:01,489
Now, let’s all go back home. Right now.

1140
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,077
Right on.

1141
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:04,812
-Could I ask a favor of you?
-Sure.

1142
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,431
-What kind of favor?
-Could you make sure Gloria’s okay?

1143
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:09,117
-And my ma.
-What?

1144
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:10,851
And if you see Pa...

1145
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:13,740
..-tell him I tried.

1146
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:15,566
Okay, what you talking about?

1147
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:17,475
I'm gonna stop them taking our fish.

1148
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,230
How you gonna do that, Mumble?

1149
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,486
Adios, amigos!

1150
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,511
Amigo! He did it.

1151
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:51,159
You believe that?

1152
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,590
How we gonna tell his mama
he bring us all this way just to kill himself?

1153
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:57,627
No. He didn’t. Look.

1154
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:00,351
He loco maniac.

1155
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,316
First ever flying flipper bird.

1156
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:05,739
How tall you think that tall boy was?

1157
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:08,955
Who could say? Taller than anyone.

1158
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:12,971
Hey, it's me, Lovelace...

1159
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:15,726
...formerly known as "guru."

1160
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:18,815
I'm gonna be telling your story,
Happy Feet...

1161
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:22,754
...long after you dead and gone!

1162
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:42,232
Hey! Hey!

1163
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,031
Enraged by their indifference...

1164
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:40,221
..-he followed them long after
they were gone from his sight.

1165
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:46,758
He ventured further
than any of us had gone before...

1166
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:50,813
..--beyond all hope of return.

1167
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,354
Swept up by the great currents...

1168
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:58,917
...he was carried endlessly
across vast oceans...

1169
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:02,905
...to worlds unknown.

1170
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:02,078
Excuse me. What is this place?

1171
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,214
You're in heaven, Dave. Penguin heaven.

1172
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,504
Is it anywhere near Emperor Land?

1173
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:10,383
It's wherever you want it to be.

1174
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,100
Try the water, Dave. It’s really real.

1175
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:35,520
{ heard tell,
when he finally saw aliens up close...

1176
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:39,907
...they were just as the skua
had described.

1177
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:42,899
Excuse me. Why are you taking our fish?

1178
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:48,052
Big, ugly penguins without feathers
on their fat, flabby faces.

1179
01:22:48,864 --> 01:22:53,904
Why are you taking our fish?
You're kind of killing us out there.

1180
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,812
No! No, wait!

1181
01:23:08,684 --> 01:23:10,414
Oh, my.

1182
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,380
Hello. Hello from Emperor Land.
Good afternoon.

1183
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:17,608
Why are you taking our fish?

1184
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,893
I'm sure you don't mean to,
but you're causing an awful lot of grief.

1185
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:26,942
Am I not making myself clear?
I'm speaking plain penguin.

1186
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:31,467
Penguin! Don’t you understand?
You're stealing our fish.

1187
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:38,577
Oh, please, anyone, talk to me!

1188
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:41,041
For pity’s sake, you're stealing our F-I-S--

1189
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:50,277
After three days, he would lose his voice.

1190
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,166
After three months...

1191
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:59,060
.--he would all but lose his mind.

1192
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,589
So you found the fish, baby.

1193
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,511
Ma?

1194
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,026
-Hi, sweetie.
-Ma.

1195
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:23,224
Fluffy, no matter what they say or do,
we never stopped believing in you.

1196
01:24:23,926 --> 01:24:25,766
So you'll be back soon, right?

1197
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:27,624
Hey, come on. Let him eat.

1198
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,746
Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us.

1199
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:31,789
But there's plenty for everyone.

1200
01:24:32,134 --> 01:24:34,154
It’s okay, sugar. We can wait.

1201
01:24:34,603 --> 01:24:36,213
No, no, Ma! Ma!

1202
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:39,594
There's lots here. Ma!

1203
01:24:43,946 --> 01:24:45,346
Ma!

1204
01:27:05,754 --> 01:27:08,124
-Kids, you gotta see this.
-He’s on now.

1205
01:27:30,212 --> 01:27:32,292
Hey! Hello!

1206
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:37,266
-Isn't that the fellow with the wacky feet?
-Looks like.

1207
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:39,773
-What was his name?
-l thought he was dead.

1208
01:27:40,222 --> 01:27:41,451
-Everybody--
-Apparently not.

1209
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:44,370
Everybody, listen up! I’ve got big news.

1210
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,810
I know who's taking the fish!

1211
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:49,399
-Yeah, and they took his brain.
-It’s the aliens.

1212
01:27:49,865 --> 01:27:51,855
-l made contact with them.
-The lunatic is back.

1213
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,050
The aliens are taking our fish.

1214
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:56,279
Someone ought to fetch
Noah and the elders.

1215
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:57,845
Hey, you.

1216
01:27:58,573 --> 01:27:59,943
Gloria.

1217
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:02,148
Kind of weird, seeing you again.

1218
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:03,781
Yeah.

1219
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:06,159
-Everything cool here, baby?
-You remember Seymour.

1220
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:07,755
Yeah. Hi, Seymour.

1221
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:09,393
Yeah.

1222
01:28:10,886 --> 01:28:12,406
So which one is yours?

1223
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:14,964
All of them.

1224
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:21,122
This is our singing class.
He teaches rhythm. I teach the blues.

1225
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:24,076
-So you're not--?
-l guess I never heard the right song.

1226
01:28:24,566 --> 01:28:27,316
That's great! I didn’t mean....

1227
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:29,436
I found out who's taking the fish.

1228
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,675
They're big and kind of ugly,
but, Gloria...

1229
01:28:32,107 --> 01:28:34,127
...the things they can do.
They're coming here.

1230
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:35,566
Oh, is that so?

1231
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:37,987
They'll be here soon.
I think they wanna help us.

1232
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:39,966
So now you speak with them?

1233
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:43,158
Well, they don’t speak penguin,
but they seem to respond to this.

1234
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:45,528
-What’s he doing?
-You gotta be kidding me.

1235
01:28:45,954 --> 01:28:48,614
I suggest we all do it.
It really gets their attention.

1236
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,327
And why would it do that?

1237
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:53,209
Beats me, but it works.

1238
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:56,248
-Hey, it’s the hippity-hopper.
-Freaky feet!

1239
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:57,635
Boys, boys--

1240
01:28:57,933 --> 01:28:58,803
-Fluffy.
-Tall guy.

1241
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,850
-Stretch!
-Amigo!

1242
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:07,226
So you dare come back?

1243
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:10,156
He says he’s found aliens
and they're taking our fish.

1244
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:12,865
He says that they’re coming
and we all have to do this.

1245
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:17,749
There be no such thing as aliens!

1246
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,687
Mumble, turn around.

1247
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:27,471
It’s a disease.

1248
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:29,553
Is that from them?

1249
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:34,125
Yeah. But don’t be afraid.
l think it’s a way to find me, that’s all.

1250
01:29:34,803 --> 01:29:38,053
You led them here?
You turned them on your own kind?

1251
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:42,737
Wait a second, you just said
there’s no such thing as aliens.

1252
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:47,517
Well, there’s not.

1253
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:51,138
But if there were, only a traitorous fool
would bring them here.

1254
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:52,713
But they have to come.

1255
01:29:53,021 --> 01:29:55,630
They're the ones taking our fish.
They can do something about it.

1256
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:59,227
None but the Great ’Guin
has the power to give and take away.

1257
01:29:59,828 --> 01:30:03,748
The Great ’Guin didn’t put things
out of whack, the aliens did.

1258
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:08,326
A fool returns this day
to mock our suffering.

1259
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:12,600
We are starving
and he wants us to hippity-hop.

1260
01:30:13,275 --> 01:30:15,855
So do we hold fast to our ways...

1261
01:30:16,378 --> 01:30:20,508
...or do we bend to the fetid fantasies
of a dancing fool?

1262
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:32,260
Say, how does that feet thing go again?

1263
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,131
Yeah, show us, Mumble.

1264
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:37,507
Oh, it’s really quite easy.

1265
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:39,363
No, no!

1266
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:40,904
No, you must resist!

1267
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:43,393
That's right.

1268
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:46,932
-Pointless nonsense.
-Resist! Stand your ground!

1269
01:30:47,509 --> 01:30:50,439
Stand your ground against this folly!

1270
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:59,308
Raise your voices, brothers.

1271
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:02,754
Cry out in defiance of this jiggity-joggity!

1272
01:31:03,325 --> 01:31:05,195
Show me what you got.

1273
01:31:08,263 --> 01:31:09,783
You got it.

1274
01:31:14,536 --> 01:31:15,796
Come on.

1275
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:17,307
Work, work it.

1276
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:20,359
Yes, yes! Call on the wisdoms!

1277
01:31:20,909 --> 01:31:22,429
Let the world tremble!

1278
01:31:23,078 --> 01:31:24,718
For when all others leave...

1279
01:31:25,113 --> 01:31:26,753
...we remain!

1280
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:30,147
Mumble! Mumble!

1281
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:32,978
Mama? Amigos.

1282
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:37,179
-Oh, Mama.
-Oh, my boy.

1283
01:31:37,692 --> 01:31:39,972
-My gorgeous boy.
-Oh, Mama.

1284
01:31:40,462 --> 01:31:42,332
-Look at him.
-You're so dazzling.

1285
01:31:42,764 --> 01:31:45,284
-Oh, Fluffy.
-We waited and waited for you.

1286
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,290
-Oh, yeah.
-Where’s Pa?

1287
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:50,793
Believe me. You don't wanna see
your deadbeat dad.

1288
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:53,049
-Your pa is sort of....
-What?

1289
01:31:53,475 --> 01:31:55,495
Come on, I'll show you.

1290
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:06,733
Memphis?

1291
01:32:07,989 --> 01:32:09,249
Memphis?

1292
01:32:09,591 --> 01:32:10,901
Pa?

1293
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:16,426
Mumble?

1294
01:32:16,798 --> 01:32:18,548
Is it truly you?

1295
01:32:18,967 --> 01:32:21,017
Every last bit of me, Pa.

1296
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:27,083
I thought....

1297
01:32:31,446 --> 01:32:32,756
Pa?

1298
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,661
There ain't been one day...

1299
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:44,991
... not one day, that I done right by you.

1300
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:51,678
Oh, Pa.

1301
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,740
Dance for him, Daddy.

1302
01:32:54,135 --> 01:32:55,885
Dance with your boy.

1303
01:32:59,474 --> 01:33:01,584
You'll have to forgive me.

1304
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:05,366
The music's gone clean out of me.

1305
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:09,014
No, it hasn't.

1306
01:33:09,384 --> 01:33:12,724
It’s just like singing with your body.

1307
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:15,134
Come on, baby. We can do it.

1308
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:16,927
Oh, Mama.

1309
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:21,132
It’s just one big old foot after the other.

1310
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:27,938
That's it.

1311
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:31,681
Yeah.

1312
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,764
-Yeah, see?
-Well, that feels good.

1313
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:44,369
You don’t have to be beautiful

1314
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,090
Yeah, Memphis.

1315
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:47,884
To turn me on

1316
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:49,425
Daddy.

1317
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:53,264
i just need your body, baby

1318
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:56,117
From dusk till dawn

1319
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,911
You don't have to be rich to be my girl

1320
01:34:01,536 --> 01:34:05,046
You don’t have to be cool
To rule my world

1321
01:34:05,707 --> 01:34:09,137
Ain't no particular song
i'm more compatible with

1322
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:13,877
{just want your extra time and your...

1323
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:37,429
Holy flock!

1324
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:05,338
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

1325
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:44,383
l think you better dance now.

1326
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:40,396
First, there was just one.
Now there's thousands.

1327
01:36:40,862 --> 01:36:43,232
-Are they trying to tell us something?
-What’s the problem?

1328
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:46,191
-We're messing with their food chain.
-We've gotta do something.

1329
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:49,951
-We suggest a ban on all marine harvesting.
-Too much money. Too many jobs.

1330
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:54,206
Why should we do anything at all?

1331
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:03,141
They're just a bunch of flightless birds
at the bottom of the world.

1332
01:37:08,056 --> 01:37:10,106
I don’t wanna live in a world
without penguins.

1333
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:11,758
What are we gonna do about it?

1334
01:37:12,093 --> 01:37:13,553
Bang up the sign "No Fishing.”

1335
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:18,519
Is equal to the love...

1336
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:20,330
..-you make.

1337
01:37:24,572 --> 01:37:28,232
Oh, baby. Right on.

1338
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:45,765
Looking back on when {
Was a little nappy-headed boy

1339
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,519
It's like a jungle sometimes

1340
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,795
it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

1341
01:37:55,002 --> 01:37:56,292
Bring it on! Go ahead!

1342
01:37:57,338 --> 01:38:00,848
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing

1343
01:38:01,509 --> 01:38:04,909
We were happy with
The joy the day would bring

1344
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:08,326
! wish those days
Would come back once more

1345
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:12,572
Come back those days, those days
Come back, don't go

1346
01:38:13,488 --> 01:38:15,828
Come here, babe. Come on back.

1347
01:38:16,324 --> 01:38:17,193
Come on back

1348
01:38:17,492 --> 01:38:18,922
-Come on back
-Come on back

1349
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:21,482
-Come on back
-Come on back

1350
01:38:21,963 --> 01:38:23,893
1 love them, I love them

1351
01:38:24,332 --> 01:38:25,352
1 love them, I love them

1352
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:33,054
Those days, those days
Those days, those days

1353
01:38:33,608 --> 01:38:38,438
Those days
