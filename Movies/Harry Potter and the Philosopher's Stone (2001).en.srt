1
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:26,202
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,845
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,363
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,570
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,252
-And the boy?
-Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,309
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:04,627
Professor, 1 would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:27,674
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,812
-No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
-No, sir.

10
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:36,386
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,948
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,804
There you go.

13
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,542
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,906
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,285
-They really are--
-The only family he has.

16
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:07,343
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,675
Exactly.

18
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,840
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,233
Until he’s ready.

20
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:36,445
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,292
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,351
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,828
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,162
Now!

25
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,998
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:51,216
-Here he comes, the birthday boy.
-Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,477
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:01,423
-Yes, Aunt Petunia.
-l want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,845
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:09,765
-Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
-Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,325
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,950
-How many are there?
-36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,397
36?! But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,420
-But some are bigger than last year's.
-I don't care!

35
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,314
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,641
We're going to buy you two
hew presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,060
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,719
I'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,381
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,738
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,179
Get in.

42
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,708
Make it move.

43
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,193
Move!

44
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,795
-Move!
-He's asleep!

45
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,527
He's boring.

46
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,569
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,227
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

48
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,588
... watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,161
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,500
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,728
Do you...?

52
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,703
Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,238
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,895
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:01,173
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

56
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:06,315
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,796
Thanks.

58
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,542
Anytime.

59
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,723
Snake!

60
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,366
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,728
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:06,128
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

63
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:16,218
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,245
-What happened?
-l swear, I don't know!

65
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,200
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

66
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,626
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,992
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

68
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,389
-Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
-It's mine!

69
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,389
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

70
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:54,003
No more mail through this letterbox.

71
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,169
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

72
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,785
Shoo! Go on.

73
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,463
Fine day, Sunday.

74
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,576
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

75
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:52,247
-Because there's no post on Sundays?
-Right you are, Harry!

76
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,386
No post on Sunday.

77
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,587
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

78
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:06,018
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

79
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,434
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--

80
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,383
Make it stop, please!

81
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,127
Stop it!

82
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,063
Mummy, what's happening?

83
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,683
Give me that! Give me that letter!

84
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,360
Get off!

85
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:03,009
They're my letters! Let go of me!

86
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,954
That's it! We're going away!

87
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,247
Far away, where they can't find us!

88
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,768
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

89
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,053
Make a wish, Harry.

90
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,233
Who's there?

91
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,805
Sorry about that.

92
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,014
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

93
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,935
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

94
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,563
Il haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

95
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:55,177
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

96
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,425
I'm not Harry.

97
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,890
-lam.
-Well, of course you are.

98
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,538
Got something for you.

99
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:11,806
Afraid I sat on it, but Il imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

100
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,011
Baked it myself, words and all.

101
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,863
Thank you.

102
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,868
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

103
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,214
Excuse me, but who are you?

104
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:53,261
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

105
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,339
-Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
-Sorry, no.

106
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:02,738
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

107
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,766
Learned what?

108
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,328
You're a wizard, Harry.

109
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,715
-I'm a what?
-A wizard.

110
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,837
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

111
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,024
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

112
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,127
...[ can't be a wizard.

113
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,340
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

114
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:30,533
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

115
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,270
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

116
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,035
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

117
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,461
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”

118
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:03,418
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

119
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,950
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

120
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,388
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

121
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,251
My perfect sister being who she was.

122
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:21,128
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

123
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,708
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?”

124
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,639
l was the only one to see her
for what she was.

125
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,809
A freak!

126
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,415
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

127
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:40,542
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

128
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,786
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

129
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:50,116
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

130
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,619
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

131
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,747
-We had to say something.
-It's an outrage! A scandal!

132
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,638
He'll not be going.

133
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,054
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

134
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:06,527
Muggle?

135
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,532
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

136
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,660
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

137
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:20,494
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

138
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:25,656
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

139
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:30,455
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

140
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,997
..in front of me.

141
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:55,767
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

142
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,208
-'m not allowed to do magic.
-Okay.

143
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,628
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

144
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,030
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

145
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,581
"All students must be equipped with...

146
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,788
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

147
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:40,447
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad.”

148
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,664
Can we find all this in London?

149
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,270
If you know where to go.

150
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,957
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

151
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,948
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

152
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,312
Just helping Harry
buy his school supplies.

153
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,052
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

154
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,803
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

155
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:35,216
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

156
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,875
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

157
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,904
Hello, professor. I didn’t see you.

158
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:48,867
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

159
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,829
Oh, nice to meet you.

160
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,044
Fearfully fascinating subject.

161
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,697
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

162
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,860
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

163
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,120
Goodbye.

164
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,199
-See, Harry? You're famous.
-But why am I famous?

165
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,866
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

166
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,852
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

167
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,610
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

168
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,610
Here, you get your quills and ink.

169
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,607
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

170
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,915
It's a world-class racing broom.

171
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,821
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

172
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,395
It's the fastest model yet.

173
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:47,534
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

174
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,347
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

175
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:56,724
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

176
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,575
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

177
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,926
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

178
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,442
Best stay close.

179
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,961
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

180
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,432
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

181
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,596
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

182
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,319
Ha! There's the little devil.

183
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,356
And there’s something else as well.

184
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,933
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

185
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,827
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

186
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,480
Very well.

187
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,411
Vault 687.

188
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,682
Lamp, please.

189
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:28,673
Key, please.

190
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,774
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

191
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,579
-Vault 713.
-What's in there, Hagrid?

192
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,900
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

193
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,981
Stand back.

194
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,934
Best not to mention this to anyone.

195
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:50,132
I still need a wand.

196
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:54,483
A wand? You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

197
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,410
Run along there and wait. 1 got one more
thing to do. Won't be long.

198
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,627
Hello?

199
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,461
Hello?

200
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,973
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

201
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,232
It seems only yesterday...

202
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:47,868
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

203
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,240
Here we are.

204
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,351
Give it a wave.

205
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,387
Apparently not.

206
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,077
Perhaps...

207
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,921
... this.

208
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:42,263
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

209
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,475
I wonder....

210
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,993
Curious.

211
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,054
Very curious.

212
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:29,362
Sorry, but what's curious?

213
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,343
l remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

214
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,353
It so happens that the phoenix...

215
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,990
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

216
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,748
Just one other.

217
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,140
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

218
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:55,908
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

219
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,220
And who owned that wand?

220
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,561
We do not speak his name.

221
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,419
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

222
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,664
It's not always clear why.

223
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,464
But I think it is clear...

224
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,554
...that we can expect
great things from you.

225
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:24,012
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

226
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,046
...did great things.

227
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,323
Terrible...

228
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,945
... yes, but great.

229
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,697
Harry! Harry!

230
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,466
Happy birthday.

231
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,966
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

232
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:59,683
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

233
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,702
You know, Hagrid. 1 know you do.

234
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:12,086
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

235
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,041
Not all wizards are good.

236
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,774
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

237
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:22,680
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--

238
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,715
-His name was V--
-Maybe if you wrote it down?

239
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,006
No, I can't spell it.

240
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,154
-All right, Voldemort.
-Voldemort?

241
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,629
It was dark times, Harry.

242
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,934
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

243
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,477
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

244
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,039
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

245
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,216
Your parents fought against him.

246
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,076
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

247
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,191
Nobody, not one.

248
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,817
Except you.

249
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,775
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

250
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:21,406
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

251
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:27,254
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

252
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,290
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

253
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,888
Well, some say he died.

254
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,581
Codswallop, in my opinion.

255
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,971
Nope, I reckon he’s out there still...

256
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,184
...too tired to carry on.

257
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:50,524
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

258
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:55,133
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

259
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,344
You're the boy who lived.

260
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,531
What are you looking at?

261
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,338
Blimey, is that the time?

262
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:19,343
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

263
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:24,295
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

264
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,803
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

265
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,348
"Platform 9 3’4"?

266
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:40,047
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3(4.

267
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,762
There's no such thing, is there?

268
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,024
Sorry.

269
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,154
Excuse me. Excuse me.

270
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,062
On your left.

271
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:13,831
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 34?

272
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,749
Think you're being funny, do you?

273
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,199
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

274
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,996
-Muggles?
-Platform 9 3’4, this way.

275
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,895
All right, Percy, you first.

276
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,338
Fred, you next.

277
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,883
-He's not Fred, I am.
-You call yourself our mother?

278
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,263
I'm sorry, George.

279
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,813
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

280
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:05,161
Excuse me.

281
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,041
Could you tell me how to...?

282
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,687
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

283
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,495
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

284
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:21,184
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

285
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:25,107
-Best to run if you're nervous.
-Good luck.

286
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:26,938
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

287
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,592
Not at all.

288
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,078
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

289
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,914
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

290
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,388
So it's true!

291
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,306
I mean, do you really have the...?

292
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,766
-The what?
-The scar?

293
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,216
Wicked!

294
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,500
-Anything off the trolley, dears?
-No, thanks. I'm all set.

295
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,190
We'll take the lot.

296
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:22,399
-Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
-They mean every flavor.

297
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:26,375
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

298
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:30,392
... spinach, liver and tripe.

299
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,662
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

300
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:44,632
-Are they real frogs?
-It's a spell. You want the cards.

301
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:50,210
Each pack’'s got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

302
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,377
Watch it!

303
00:35:56,688 --> 00:36:00,028
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

304
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,758
-'ve got Dumbledore!
-1 got about six of him.

305
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,374
Hey, he's gone!

306
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,808
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

307
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,623
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

308
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,226
A little.

309
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,537
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

310
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:24,898
Yeah.

311
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,352
Has anyone seen a toad?

312
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,238
-A boy named Neville’s lost one.
-No.

313
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:41,005
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

314
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,377
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

315
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,862
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow

316
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:57,901
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

317
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,683
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

318
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,596
...but they've all worked for me.

319
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,340
For example:

320
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,424
Oculus Reparo.

321
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,147
That's better, isn't it?

322
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:23,100
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

323
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,935
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

324
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,889
-I'm Ron Weasley.
-Pleasure.

325
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:35,963
You two better change into robes.
l expect we'll be arriving soon.

326
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,745
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

327
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,112
Just there.

328
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:02,016
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

329
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,279
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

330
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,519
-Hello, Harry.
-Hi, Hagrid.

331
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,773
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

332
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,560
Wicked.

333
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,930
Welcome to Hogwarts.

334
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,892
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

335
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:50,063
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

336
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,639
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

337
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,125
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

338
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:03,487
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

339
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,839
Your triumphs will earn you points.

340
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:12,103
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

341
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,470
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

342
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,493
Trevor!

343
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,993
Sorry.

344
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:33,855
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

345
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,656
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

346
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,777
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

347
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,506
Harry Potter?

348
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,712
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

349
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,265
And I'm Malfoy.

350
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,867
Draco Malfoy.

351
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,337
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

352
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:02,996
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

353
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:08,202
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

354
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,210
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

355
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,799
I can help you there.

356
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,648
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

357
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,714
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

358
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:51,522
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

359
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,957
l read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.

360
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,049
Will you wait along here, please?

361
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,259
Now, before we begin...

362
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,667
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

363
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:23,493
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

364
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:26,312
The first years, please note...

365
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:32,144
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

366
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:37,973
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

367
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,866
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

368
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:47,478
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

369
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,067
Thank you.

370
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:56,667
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

371
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,535
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

372
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,019
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

373
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,924
Hermione Granger.

374
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,794
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

375
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,450
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

376
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:24,705
Right, then. Right.

377
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,596
Okay. Gryffindor!

378
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,272
Draco Malfoy.

379
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,113
Slytherin!

380
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,902
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

381
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,682
Susan Bones.

382
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,413
Harry, what is it?

383
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:07,306
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

384
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,134
Let's see....

385
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:13,357
I know! Hufflepuff!

386
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,792
Ronald Weasley.

387
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:36,319
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

388
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,662
Gryffindor!

389
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,320
Harry Potter.

390
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:09,330
Difficult, very difficult.

391
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:13,384
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

392
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,098
There's talent, oh, yes.

393
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:19,951
And a thirst to prove yourself.

394
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:22,518
But where to put you?

395
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,577
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

396
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,310
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

397
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:34,270
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

398
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:39,756
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

399
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:44,805
No? Well, if you're sure.

400
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,126
Better be...

401
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:49,275
...Gryffindor!

402
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,469
Your attention, please.

403
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:22,214
Let the feast begin.

404
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:40,866
I'm half and half.

405
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:44,072
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

406
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:47,769
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

407
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,549
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

408
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:56,094
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

409
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:58,381
-What's he teach?
-Potions.

410
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,736
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell’s job for years.

411
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,976
Hello! How are you?

412
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:14,452
Welcome to Gryffindor.

413
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:27,099
It's the Bloody Baron!

414
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:34,546
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

415
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:39,866
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

416
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:46,171
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

417
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,097
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

418
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:52,703
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

419
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,167
Like this.

420
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,849
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

421
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,330
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

422
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,018
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

423
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:21,314
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

424
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:36,040
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

425
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,287
That picture's moving.

426
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:42,857
-Look at that one.
-I think she fancies you.

427
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,139
-Look!
-Who's that girl?

428
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,815
Welcome to Hogwarts.

429
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,573
Password?

430
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,699
Caput Draconis.

431
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:22,068
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

432
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,502
Gather around here.

433
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:32,397
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

434
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:36,873
Boys’ dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

435
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:40,328
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

436
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,379
Made it!

437
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:54,851
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

438
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:02,815
-That was bloody brilliant!
-Thank you for that assessment.

439
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:07,407
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

440
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,938
-Then one of you might be on time.
-We got lost.

441
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:16,634
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

442
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:30,492
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

443
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:34,578
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

444
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:38,535
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

445
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:41,883
However, for those select few...

446
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:46,127
...who possess the predisposition...

447
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,100
...[. can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

448
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,290
..and ensnare the senses.

449
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,064
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

450
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:04,740
... brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

451
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:15,123
Then again, maybe some of you have come
to Hogwarts in possession of abilities...

452
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:19,133
...80 formidable that
you feel confident enough...

453
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:22,757
...to not pay attention.

454
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,990
Mr. Potter.

455
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,886
Our new celebrity.

456
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:44,623
What would I get if 1 added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

457
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,705
You don't know? Let’s try again.

458
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:55,241
Where would you look
if l asked you to find a bezoar?

459
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:58,334
I don't know, sir.

460
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:02,172
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

461
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:07,138
I don't know, sir.

462
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,945
Pity.

463
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:15,182
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

464
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,920
. is it, Mr. Potter?

465
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:26,355
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

466
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:29,642
Eye of rabbit....

467
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,509
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

468
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:37,233
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before--

469
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:46,187
Mail's here.

470
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,302
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

471
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,556
Look, Neville’s got a Remembrall.

472
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:32,811
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

473
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,797
The problem is, 1 can’t remember
what I've forgotten.

474
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:40,497
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

475
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,361
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

476
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:50,085
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

477
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:56,028
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day.”

478
00:54:56,927 --> 00:55:00,647
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

479
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:13,383
-Good afternoon, class.
-Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

480
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,504
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

481
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,318
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

482
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,278
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

483
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:29,875
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

484
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,461
Up!

485
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:33,766
Up.

486
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:36,979
Up.

487
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,336
Up. Up!

488
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,487
With feeling.

489
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,285
Shut up, Harry.

490
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:57,880
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

491
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:02,135
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

492
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:07,386
When I blow my whistle, 1 want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

493
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:11,567
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

494
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:16,016
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

495
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,490
On my whistle. Three, two....

496
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:23,546
Mr. Longbottom.

497
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,868
-Mr. Longbottom!
-Down, down!

498
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,500
Neville!

499
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,733
Come back down this instant!

500
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:10,135
Everyone out of the way!

501
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,866
Is he all right?

502
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:23,508
Oh, dear, it’s a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

503
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:29,575
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

504
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:33,567
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

505
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:38,847
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

506
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,390
Did you see his face?

507
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:45,225
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

508
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:48,086
Give it here, Malfoy.

509
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,482
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

510
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:59,244
How about on the roof?

511
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:04,114
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

512
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:10,453
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

513
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,641
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

514
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,024
What an idiot.

515
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:22,666
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

516
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,140
Is that so?

517
00:58:28,572 --> 00:58:30,592
Have it your way, then.

518
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,792
-Nice going, Harry.
-That was wicked, Harry!

519
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:09,254
Harry Potter!

520
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:12,227
Follow me.

521
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:26,116
You wait here.

522
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:32,825
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

523
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,280
Yes, of course.

524
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:46,181
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

525
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:52,089
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

526
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,682
l always knew he'd do well.

527
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,995
Seeker? But first years
hever make the house teams.

528
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:03,643
-You must be the youngest player in--
-A century, McGonagall says.

529
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,681
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

530
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:09,424
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

531
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,190
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

532
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:16,214
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

533
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:20,193
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

534
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:23,314
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

535
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:28,864
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

536
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,569
I've never played.
What if 1 make a fool of myself?

537
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:37,580
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

538
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:50,083
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

539
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,281
I didn't know.

540
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:02,101
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

541
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,909
Who doesn't?

542
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:07,969
What's happening?

543
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:12,155
The staircases change, remember?

544
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:22,028
-Let’s go this way.
-Before the staircase moves again.

545
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,240
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

546
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,727
We're not supposed to be here.

547
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,653
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

548
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:42,701
Let's go.

549
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,651
-It's Filch's cat!
-Run!

550
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:54,795
Quick, let's hide through that door!

551
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,057
-It's locked!
-We're done for!

552
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,415
Move over!

553
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:07,491
Alohomora.

554
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:10,328
Get in.

555
01:02:11,795 --> 01:02:12,785
Alohomora?

556
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,316
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

557
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,821
Anyone here, my sweet?

558
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:26,345
Come on.

559
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,547
-Filch is gone.
-He thinks this door's locked.

560
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:33,236
-It was locked.
-And for good reason.

561
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:04,202
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

562
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:08,271
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

563
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:12,608
I wasn't looking at its feet!
l was preoccupied with its heads.

564
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:15,843
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

565
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:19,613
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

566
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:23,393
-It's guarding something.
-Guarding something?

567
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,569
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

568
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:31,397
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

569
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:34,792
Or worse, expelled.

570
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:42,167
She needs to sort out her priorities.

571
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,980
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

572
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:56,765
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

573
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:06,169
There are three kinds of balls.
This one’s called the Quaffle.

574
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:12,116
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

575
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:16,889
The Keeper, that’s me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

576
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:21,569
I think so. What are those?

577
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:26,294
You better take this.

578
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:39,036
Careful now, it’s coming back.

579
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:49,174
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

580
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,288
What was that?

581
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,619
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

582
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:16,346
But you are a Seeker.

583
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:24,390
The only thing 1 want you
to worry about is this.

584
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:27,405
The Golden Snitch.

585
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,554
-l like this ball.
-You like it now.

586
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:34,667
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

587
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:37,064
What do I do with it?

588
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,370
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

589
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,160
You catch this, the game's over.

590
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:47,153
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

591
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:01,409
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

592
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:05,738
...or the ability to make objects fly.

593
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,539
Do you have your feathers? Good.

594
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:13,542
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

595
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,650
The swish and flick. Everyone.

596
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:23,228
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

597
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:28,364
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

598
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,176
Wingardium Leviosa.

599
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,742
Wingardium Leviosa.

600
01:06:38,895 --> 01:06:42,645
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

601
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:48,636
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

602
01:06:49,906 --> 01:06:53,656
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

603
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:58,135
Wingardium Leviosa.

604
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:10,942
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

605
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:13,317
Splendid!

606
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:16,998
Well done, dear.

607
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:25,108
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

608
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:35,865
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

609
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:41,276
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

610
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,829
I think she heard you.

611
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,663
Where's Hermione?

612
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,875
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

613
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:23,032
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

614
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,187
Troll in the dungeon!

615
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,771
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,034
Thought you ought to know.

617
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:49,716
Silence!

618
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:55,197
Everyone will please not panic!

619
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,769
Now...

620
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:02,177
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

621
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:07,652
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

622
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:22,067
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

623
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,209
How could a troll get in?

624
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:29,167
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

625
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,509
-What?
-Hermione! She doesn't know.

626
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:48,919
I think the troll’s left the dungeon.

627
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,089
It’s going into the girls’ bathroom.

628
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,472
Hermione, move!

629
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:35,817
Help! Help!

630
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:40,141
Hey, pea brain!

631
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:54,452
Help!

632
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,888
Do something!

633
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:23,121
-What?
-Anything!

634
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,383
-Hurry up!
-Swish and flick.

635
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:28,873
Wingardium Leviosa.

636
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,879
Cool.

637
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:09,012
Is it dead?

638
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:13,019
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

639
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:21,819
Troll boogers.

640
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,700
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

641
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:32,384
-Well, what it is--
-It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

642
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:36,201
Miss Granger?

643
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:41,700
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

644
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,195
But 1 was wrong.

645
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:49,017
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

646
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,550
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

647
01:12:55,304 --> 01:13:00,254
l expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

648
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,803
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

649
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,510
...for your serious lack of judgment.

650
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,167
As for you two gentlemen...

651
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,640
...[ just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

652
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:17,277
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

653
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,204
...and live to tell the tale.

654
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,900
Five points...

655
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:27,317
... Will be awarded to each of you...

656
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:31,932
...for sheer dumb luck.

657
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:41,197
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

658
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,924
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

659
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,301
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

660
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,828
I'm not hungry.

661
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:03,588
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

662
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:07,313
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

663
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,599
Even if it is against Slytherin.

664
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:21,710
-That explains the blood.
-Blood?

665
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:26,188
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

666
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:29,175
...so he could get past that dog.

667
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:32,159
But he got bit,
that’s why he’s limping.

668
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:35,102
But why would anyone go near that dog?

669
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,478
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

670
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:41,945
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

671
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:43,565
You're saying--

672
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:47,812
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

673
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:05,009
-Bit early for mail, isn't it?
-But I never get mail.

674
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,372
Let's open it.

675
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:18,853
It's a broomstick.

676
01:15:19,782 --> 01:15:23,442
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

677
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:27,198
But who--?

678
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,295
-Scared, Harry?
-A little.

679
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:55,034
It's all right. 1 felt the same way
before my first game.

680
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:58,704
-What happened?
-I don't really remember.

681
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,798
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

682
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,844
Woke up in hospital a week later.

683
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:30,339
Welcome to Hogwarts’ first
Quidditch game of the season.

684
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:35,053
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

685
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:08,095
The players take their positions...

686
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:11,931
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

687
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:15,555
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

688
01:17:16,532 --> 01:17:18,702
..-from all of you!

689
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,690
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

690
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:29,643
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

691
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:33,519
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

692
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:44,072
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

693
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:07,105
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

694
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,028
Well done!

695
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:23,540
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

696
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,788
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

697
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,555
Give me that!

698
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:48,527
Take that side!

699
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:41,174
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

700
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,472
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

701
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:56,788
-Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
-Leave it to me.

702
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,384
Come on, Hermione!

703
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,003
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

704
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:48,193
Fire! You're on fire!

705
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:08,325
Go, go, go, go!

706
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:02,689
Looks like he’s gonna be sick.

707
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:05,356
He's got the Snitch!

708
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:09,287
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

709
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,474
Gryffindor wins!

710
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:59,017
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

711
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:03,195
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

712
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,982
-Who told you about Fluffy?
-Aluffy?

713
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:09,725
-That thing has a name?
-Of course he has a name. He's mine.

714
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:15,039
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

715
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:19,894
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

716
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,566
But whatever Fluffy’s guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

717
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,300
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

718
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:33,710
Teacher or not, 1 know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

719
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:37,696
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

720
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,270
Exactly.

721
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:43,673
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

722
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:48,282
You're meddling in things that ought
hot to be meddled in. It’s dangerous.

723
01:24:49,051 --> 01:24:53,531
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

724
01:24:54,356 --> 01:24:55,616
Nicholas Flamel?

725
01:24:56,792 --> 01:25:00,892
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

726
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:05,322
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

727
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:07,763
I don't know.

728
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:29,344
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

729
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:32,380
Ring the Hogwart bell

730
01:25:32,928 --> 01:25:35,358
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

731
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:38,507
Cast a Christmas spell

732
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:55,411
Knight to E-5.

733
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,392
Queen to E-5.

734
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:12,875
That's totally barbaric!

735
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:16,431
That's wizard’s chess.
l see you've packed.

736
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:18,332
l see you haven't.

737
01:26:18,874 --> 01:26:23,414
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

738
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:27,586
-He's studying dragons there.
-Good. You can help Harry.

739
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:31,270
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

740
01:26:31,887 --> 01:26:34,927
We've looked a hundred times!

741
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:40,624
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

742
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:46,048
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

743
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:52,744
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

744
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:06,050
-Happy Christmas, Harry.
-Happy Christmas, Ron.

745
01:27:06,655 --> 01:27:08,585
What are you wearing?

746
01:27:09,491 --> 01:27:12,711
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

747
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:16,436
-'ve got presents?
-Yeah.

748
01:27:24,139 --> 01:27:25,979
There they are.

749
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:40,322
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

750
01:27:40,956 --> 01:27:44,586
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well.”

751
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,193
-What is it?
-Some kind of cloak.

752
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,527
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

753
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:15,396
My body's gone!

754
01:28:15,757 --> 01:28:18,916
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

755
01:28:19,895 --> 01:28:21,565
I'm invisible?

756
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:26,196
They're really rare.
l wonder who gave it to you.

757
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:31,385
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well.”

758
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:05,195
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

759
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:11,207
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

760
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:32,439
Who's there?

761
01:29:38,807 --> 01:29:43,757
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

762
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:55,103
Who is it? Show yourself.

763
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:43,967
Severus, I....

764
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:48,205
You don’t want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

765
01:30:48,877 --> 01:30:53,037
-l don't know what you mean.
-You know perfectly well what I mean.

766
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:13,672
We'll have another little chat soon.

767
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:19,069
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

768
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:23,861
Professors. 1 found this
in the restricted section.

769
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:29,366
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

770
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:03,683
Mum?

771
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:08,928
Dad?

772
01:33:43,852 --> 01:33:48,242
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

773
01:33:50,692 --> 01:33:53,242
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

774
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:56,895
-Why?
-There's something you've got to see!

775
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:07,855
Come on! Come!
Come look, it’s my parents!

776
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:11,561
I only see us.

777
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:14,973
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

778
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:20,772
-There. You see them, don't you?
-That's me! Only I'm head boy.

779
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:24,073
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

780
01:34:24,559 --> 01:34:28,249
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

781
01:34:29,931 --> 01:34:32,071
Il look good.

782
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:36,371
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

783
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:41,397
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

784
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:06,999
Back again, Harry?

785
01:35:10,405 --> 01:35:12,594
Il see that you,
like many before you...

786
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:16,763
.. have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

787
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:21,239
Il trust by now
you realize what it does.

788
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:25,304
Let me give you a clue.

789
01:35:26,154 --> 01:35:28,054
The happiest man on earth...

790
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:31,478
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

791
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:34,143
...exactly as he is.

792
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:39,108
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

793
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:42,271
Yes. And no.

794
01:35:43,638 --> 01:35:45,858
It shows us nothing more or less...

795
01:35:46,341 --> 01:35:51,581
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

796
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:56,643
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

797
01:35:57,418 --> 01:36:00,848
...you see them standing beside you.

798
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:03,692
But remember this, Harry.

799
01:36:04,192 --> 01:36:09,352
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

800
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:12,075
or truth.

801
01:36:13,368 --> 01:36:18,608
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

802
01:36:20,408 --> 01:36:24,068
That is why tomorrow,
it will be moved to a new home.

803
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,479
And I must ask you...

804
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:31,075
... Not to go looking for it again.

805
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:35,037
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

806
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:38,507
..and forget to live.

807
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:38,561
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

808
01:37:39,487 --> 01:37:42,207
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

809
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,540
This is light?

810
01:37:49,497 --> 01:37:51,307
Of course! Here it is!

811
01:37:52,133 --> 01:37:55,563
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Sorcerer's Stone.

812
01:37:56,237 --> 01:37:57,287
The what?

813
01:37:58,106 --> 01:38:00,736
Honestly, don't you two read?

814
01:38:01,309 --> 01:38:05,319
"The Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

815
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:08,326
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

816
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:12,360
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal.”

817
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:15,014
-Immortal?
-It means you'll never die.

818
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:17,296
I know what it means!

819
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:22,583
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

820
01:38:23,364 --> 01:38:27,843
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday.”

821
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:32,138
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

822
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:36,733
That's what's under the trap door.
The Sorcerer's Stone.

823
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:57,465
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

824
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:00,499
We know about the Sorcerer's Stone.

825
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:10,050
-We think Snape's trying to steal it.
-Are you still on about him?

826
01:39:10,845 --> 01:39:13,305
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

827
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:17,968
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

828
01:39:18,653 --> 01:39:19,523
What?

829
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:22,687
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

830
01:39:23,491 --> 01:39:25,741
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

831
01:39:26,227 --> 01:39:29,657
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

832
01:39:30,298 --> 01:39:32,608
-Spells, enchantments.
-Right.

833
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:35,824
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

834
01:39:36,404 --> 01:39:38,214
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

835
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:41,959
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

836
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:45,769
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

837
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:04,540
-Hagrid, what exactly is that?
-That? It's...

838
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:07,176
I know what that is!

839
01:40:07,602 --> 01:40:09,942
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

840
01:40:10,571 --> 01:40:13,471
l won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

841
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:17,671
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

842
01:40:40,401 --> 01:40:42,361
Is that...

843
01:40:43,404 --> 01:40:44,454
..a dragon?

844
01:40:44,805 --> 01:40:48,675
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

845
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:51,930
My brother works
with these in Romania.

846
01:40:52,446 --> 01:40:56,786
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

847
01:40:58,019 --> 01:40:59,539
Hello, Norbert.

848
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:03,904
-Norbert?
-He's gotta have a name, don't he?

849
01:41:05,126 --> 01:41:07,316
Don't you, Norbert?

850
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,349
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

851
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,386
Who's that?

852
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:27,253
Malfoy.

853
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:29,478
Oh, dear.

854
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:35,569
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time 1 met him.

855
01:41:36,357 --> 01:41:39,927
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

856
01:41:40,595 --> 01:41:44,195
-l don't understand. Is that bad?
-It's bad.

857
01:41:45,032 --> 01:41:46,902
Good evening.

858
01:41:50,805 --> 01:41:53,385
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

859
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:57,101
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

860
01:41:57,712 --> 01:42:01,962
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

861
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:04,830
-50?!
-Each.

862
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:08,263
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

863
01:42:08,723 --> 01:42:11,623
..-all four of you
will receive detention.

864
01:42:12,994 --> 01:42:15,603
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

865
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,270
I thought you said the four of us.

866
01:42:18,733 --> 01:42:20,873
No, you heard me correctly.

867
01:42:21,369 --> 01:42:25,789
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

868
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:29,487
You will join your classmates
in detention.

869
01:42:41,055 --> 01:42:44,565
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

870
01:42:45,259 --> 01:42:49,419
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

871
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:52,687
God, I miss the screaming.

872
01:42:55,603 --> 01:42:58,503
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

873
01:42:59,073 --> 01:43:03,793
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

874
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:09,094
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

875
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:15,308
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

876
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,032
Norbert’s gone.

877
01:43:20,761 --> 01:43:23,921
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

878
01:43:24,598 --> 01:43:27,498
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

879
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:30,144
What if he don't like Romania?

880
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:34,354
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

881
01:43:35,476 --> 01:43:40,135
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

882
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:43,061
Got to have your wits about you.

883
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:48,531
The Forest? 1 thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

884
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:53,053
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

885
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,142
... werewolves.

886
01:43:56,731 --> 01:43:59,601
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

887
01:44:00,201 --> 01:44:02,571
You can be sure of that.

888
01:44:04,872 --> 01:44:06,072
Nighty-night.

889
01:44:08,809 --> 01:44:11,679
Right. Let's go.

890
01:44:49,917 --> 01:44:52,027
Hagrid, what is that?

891
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,510
What we're here for.
See that?

892
01:44:56,357 --> 01:45:01,137
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

893
01:45:02,329 --> 01:45:06,339
Now, this one’s been hurt bad
by something.

894
01:45:14,441 --> 01:45:19,481
So, it’s our job to go
and find the poor beast.

895
01:45:20,381 --> 01:45:23,101
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

896
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:26,884
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

897
01:45:28,756 --> 01:45:30,596
Okay. Then I get Fang.

898
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:36,031
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

899
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:44,794
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

900
01:45:45,573 --> 01:45:49,053
If 1 didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

901
01:45:49,743 --> 01:45:52,293
I'm not scared, Potter.

902
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,209
Do you hear that?

903
01:45:57,918 --> 01:45:59,208
Come on, Fang.

904
01:45:59,587 --> 01:46:00,847
Scared!

905
01:46:26,113 --> 01:46:28,043
What is it, Fang?

906
01:47:38,686 --> 01:47:43,516
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

907
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:47,931
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

908
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:51,029
What was that thing you saved me from?

909
01:47:51,532 --> 01:47:56,252
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

910
01:47:57,104 --> 01:48:01,994
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

911
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:07,356
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

912
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:12,458
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

913
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:14,860
A cursed life.

914
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:18,715
-Who would choose such a life?
-Can you think of no one?

915
01:48:19,393 --> 01:48:23,753
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

916
01:48:24,698 --> 01:48:28,178
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

917
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:33,376
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

918
01:48:34,842 --> 01:48:36,152
The Sorcerer's Stone.

919
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,428
Harry!

920
01:48:40,247 --> 01:48:44,197
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

921
01:48:44,952 --> 01:48:46,822
You all right there, Harry?

922
01:48:48,288 --> 01:48:52,038
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

923
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:56,830
You're safe now. Good luck.

924
01:49:04,772 --> 01:49:08,522
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

925
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:11,729
But he’s weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

926
01:49:12,246 --> 01:49:14,826
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

927
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:19,222
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

928
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:23,963
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

929
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:26,095
He'll come back.

930
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:28,040
But if he comes back...

931
01:49:28,462 --> 01:49:31,972
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

932
01:49:33,467 --> 01:49:36,597
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

933
01:49:37,237 --> 01:49:40,397
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

934
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:44,168
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

935
01:49:44,978 --> 01:49:49,228
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

936
01:49:50,617 --> 01:49:55,127
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

937
01:49:55,956 --> 01:49:59,496
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

938
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:10,516
I'd heard Hogwarts’ final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

939
01:50:11,371 --> 01:50:14,621
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

940
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:19,815
-My scar. It keeps burning.
-It's happened before.

941
01:50:20,647 --> 01:50:23,017
-Not like this.
-You should see the nurse.

942
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:26,570
I think it’s a warning.
It means danger's coming.

943
01:50:34,661 --> 01:50:36,831
-Of course!
-What is it?

944
01:50:37,331 --> 01:50:40,671
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

945
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:43,991
..and a stranger just happens
to have one?

946
01:50:44,538 --> 01:50:46,968
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

947
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:49,464
Why didn't I see it before?

948
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:58,384
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

949
01:50:59,019 --> 01:51:01,479
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

950
01:51:01,989 --> 01:51:04,209
You and this stranger
must have talked.

951
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:08,318
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

952
01:51:08,929 --> 01:51:12,439
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem.”

953
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:17,020
-Was he interested in Fluffy?
-Of course he was interested.

954
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:21,665
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

955
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:27,321
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him.”

956
01:51:28,215 --> 01:51:32,995
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

957
01:51:35,322 --> 01:51:37,722
I shouldn't have told you that.

958
01:51:38,225 --> 01:51:40,185
Where are you going?

959
01:51:47,434 --> 01:51:49,864
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

960
01:51:50,604 --> 01:51:52,944
I'm afraid he's not here.

961
01:51:53,473 --> 01:51:57,223
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

962
01:51:58,212 --> 01:52:00,822
He's gone?
But this is important!

963
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:04,451
This is about the Sorcerer's Stone!

964
01:52:05,085 --> 01:52:08,395
-How do you know--?
-Someone's going to try and steal it.

965
01:52:09,456 --> 01:52:14,056
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

966
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:18,675
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

967
01:52:27,474 --> 01:52:29,964
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

968
01:52:30,477 --> 01:52:32,787
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

969
01:52:33,313 --> 01:52:36,743
-And with Dumbledore gone--
-Good afternoon.

970
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:42,213
What would three young Gryffindors...

971
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:46,946
...be doing inside on a day like this?

972
01:52:51,698 --> 01:52:54,768
-We were just--
-You ought to be careful.

973
01:52:55,769 --> 01:52:57,519
People will think you're...

974
01:53:02,042 --> 01:53:04,382
...up to something.

975
01:53:15,055 --> 01:53:16,785
Now what do we do?

976
01:53:17,224 --> 01:53:20,564
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

977
01:53:34,741 --> 01:53:36,051
Trevor.

978
01:53:36,543 --> 01:53:39,532
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

979
01:53:40,213 --> 01:53:45,013
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

980
01:53:45,852 --> 01:53:49,331
-Neville, listen. We were--
-No, I won't let you!

981
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:54,100
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
Il fight you.

982
01:53:54,861 --> 01:53:59,721
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

983
01:54:07,107 --> 01:54:10,477
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

984
01:54:11,144 --> 01:54:14,364
Brilliant, but scary.

985
01:54:15,415 --> 01:54:17,285
Let's go.

986
01:54:17,718 --> 01:54:21,468
-Sorry.
-It's for your own good, you know.

987
01:54:27,394 --> 01:54:30,874
-You stood on my foot!
-Sorry.

988
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:36,982
Alohomora.

989
01:54:49,282 --> 01:54:51,502
Wait a minute. He's...

990
01:54:53,086 --> 01:54:54,636
.
... Snoring.

991
01:54:57,758 --> 01:55:02,588
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

992
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:07,528
It's got horrible breath.

993
01:55:10,437 --> 01:55:12,277
-We have to move its paw.
-What?

994
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:14,029
Come on!

995
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:20,055
Okay. Push.

996
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:46,660
I'll go first. Don't follow
until l give you a sign.

997
01:55:47,274 --> 01:55:51,694
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

998
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:56,133
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

999
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:58,893
The harp.

1000
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:02,156
It's stopped playing.

1001
01:56:12,799 --> 01:56:14,319
Jump!

1002
01:56:27,848 --> 01:56:31,038
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1003
01:56:45,899 --> 01:56:48,649
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1004
01:56:49,202 --> 01:56:52,482
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1005
01:56:53,106 --> 01:56:57,465
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1006
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:01,550
Hermione!

1007
01:57:02,249 --> 01:57:05,619
-Now what are we gonna do?
-Just relax!

1008
01:57:06,286 --> 01:57:10,206
-Hermione, where are you?
-Do what I say! Trust me.

1009
01:57:17,898 --> 01:57:20,828
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1010
01:57:21,434 --> 01:57:24,124
-He's not relaxing, is he?
-Apparently not.

1011
01:57:24,704 --> 01:57:26,893
-We've gotta do something.
-What?

1012
01:57:27,407 --> 01:57:30,017
l remember reading something
in Herbology.

1013
01:57:31,211 --> 01:57:34,611
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1014
01:57:35,282 --> 01:57:39,122
..-but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1015
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,730
Lumus Solem.

1016
01:57:50,030 --> 01:57:52,309
-Ron, you okay?
-Yeah.

1017
01:57:55,302 --> 01:57:57,491
Lucky we didn't panic.

1018
01:57:58,572 --> 01:58:01,642
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1019
01:58:03,677 --> 01:58:05,017
What is that?

1020
01:58:05,412 --> 01:58:08,752
I don’t know. Sounds like wings.

1021
01:58:22,262 --> 01:58:25,302
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1022
01:58:25,932 --> 01:58:29,121
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1023
01:58:29,769 --> 01:58:32,809
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1024
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:40,750
-What's this all about?
-l don’t know.

1025
01:58:47,187 --> 01:58:48,997
Strange.

1026
01:58:49,623 --> 01:58:51,673
Alohomora!

1027
01:58:54,861 --> 01:58:56,911
Well, it was worth a try.

1028
01:58:57,397 --> 01:59:00,237
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1029
01:59:00,834 --> 01:59:04,294
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1030
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:07,931
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1031
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:14,028
What's wrong?

1032
01:59:15,181 --> 01:59:16,471
It's too simple.

1033
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:21,100
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1034
01:59:21,855 --> 01:59:24,985
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1035
01:59:42,242 --> 01:59:44,902
This complicates things a bit.

1036
02:00:06,533 --> 02:00:08,463
Catch the key!

1037
02:00:12,839 --> 02:00:14,539
Hurry up!

1038
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:51,400
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1039
02:00:52,178 --> 02:00:54,928
Where are we? A graveyard.

1040
02:00:55,682 --> 02:00:57,992
This is no graveyard.

1041
02:01:05,825 --> 02:01:08,405
It's a chessboard.

1042
02:01:20,707 --> 02:01:22,407
There's the door.

1043
02:01:34,721 --> 02:01:36,031
Now what do we do?

1044
02:01:36,523 --> 02:01:40,213
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1045
02:01:41,294 --> 02:01:44,574
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1046
02:01:45,398 --> 02:01:49,088
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1047
02:01:49,803 --> 02:01:53,403
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1048
02:02:01,047 --> 02:02:02,567
What happens now?

1049
02:02:03,516 --> 02:02:06,175
Well, white moves first.

1050
02:02:06,753 --> 02:02:08,393
And then...

1051
02:02:10,390 --> 02:02:11,500
... we play.

1052
02:02:22,202 --> 02:02:26,682
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1053
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:30,637
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1054
02:02:31,477 --> 02:02:34,057
You there, D-5.

1055
02:02:49,028 --> 02:02:50,398
Yes, Hermione.

1056
02:02:50,797 --> 02:02:55,246
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard'’s chess.

1057
02:03:01,774 --> 02:03:04,024
Castle to E-4!

1058
02:03:07,947 --> 02:03:09,727
Pawn to C-3!

1059
02:03:54,894 --> 02:03:58,404
-Wait a minute.
-You understand right, Harry.

1060
02:03:59,098 --> 02:04:03,288
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1061
02:04:04,437 --> 02:04:06,547
Then you're free to check the king.

1062
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,350
-No. Ron, no!
-What is it?

1063
02:04:10,376 --> 02:04:14,476
-He's going to sacrifice himself.
-No, there must be another way!

1064
02:04:15,248 --> 02:04:18,498
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1065
02:04:19,152 --> 02:04:22,342
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1066
02:04:23,256 --> 02:04:25,716
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1067
02:04:36,302 --> 02:04:38,882
Knight to H-3.

1068
02:05:00,126 --> 02:05:01,876
Check.

1069
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:32,870
Ron!

1070
02:05:33,292 --> 02:05:38,422
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1071
02:05:54,113 --> 02:05:55,283
Checkmate.

1072
02:06:15,401 --> 02:06:17,571
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1073
02:06:18,071 --> 02:06:21,471
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1074
02:06:22,141 --> 02:06:23,811
I have to go on.

1075
02:06:24,577 --> 02:06:29,767
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1076
02:06:30,683 --> 02:06:32,903
Not as good as you.

1077
02:06:34,053 --> 02:06:38,273
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1078
02:06:40,059 --> 02:06:45,039
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1079
02:07:23,803 --> 02:07:25,263
You?

1080
02:07:26,272 --> 02:07:29,612
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the--

1081
02:07:30,276 --> 02:07:32,996
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1082
02:07:33,579 --> 02:07:36,299
Next to him, who would suspect...

1083
02:07:36,883 --> 02:07:40,343
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1084
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:45,740
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1085
02:07:46,592 --> 02:07:49,081
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1086
02:07:49,929 --> 02:07:53,559
If Snape’s cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1087
02:07:54,267 --> 02:07:56,227
...l would have succeeded.

1088
02:07:56,702 --> 02:07:59,362
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1089
02:07:59,939 --> 02:08:01,839
Snape was trying to save me?

1090
02:08:02,308 --> 02:08:07,028
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1091
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:11,630
-Then you let the troll in!
-Very good, Potter, yes.

1092
02:08:12,351 --> 02:08:14,981
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1093
02:08:15,922 --> 02:08:20,262
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1094
02:08:21,827 --> 02:08:24,897
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1095
02:08:26,299 --> 02:08:30,929
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn’t understand.

1096
02:08:31,771 --> 02:08:35,340
I'm never alone. Never.

1097
02:08:36,042 --> 02:08:39,642
Now, what does this mirror do?

1098
02:08:41,681 --> 02:08:43,550
l see what I desire.

1099
02:08:44,383 --> 02:08:48,253
Il see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1100
02:08:48,988 --> 02:08:50,858
Use the boy.

1101
02:08:51,958 --> 02:08:55,418
Come here, Potter! Now!

1102
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:11,450
Tell me, what do you see?

1103
02:09:37,136 --> 02:09:39,276
What is it? What do you see?

1104
02:09:39,772 --> 02:09:44,312
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1105
02:09:45,144 --> 02:09:46,514
He lies.

1106
02:09:47,179 --> 02:09:50,429
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1107
02:09:51,083 --> 02:09:54,952
-Let me speak to him.
-Master, you are not strong enough.

1108
02:09:55,688 --> 02:09:59,258
I have strength enough for this.

1109
02:10:17,943 --> 02:10:20,433
Harry Potter...

1110
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:23,089
...we meet again.

1111
02:10:23,582 --> 02:10:24,812
Voldemort.

1112
02:10:25,184 --> 02:10:28,644
Yes. You see what I've become?

1113
02:10:29,422 --> 02:10:32,552
See what I must do to survive?

1114
02:10:33,192 --> 02:10:36,822
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1115
02:10:37,997 --> 02:10:40,927
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1116
02:10:41,534 --> 02:10:44,754
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1117
02:10:45,404 --> 02:10:48,534
But there is something that can.

1118
02:10:49,175 --> 02:10:54,155
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1119
02:10:55,114 --> 02:10:56,574
Stop him!

1120
02:11:01,754 --> 02:11:04,184
Don't be a fool.

1121
02:11:05,024 --> 02:11:07,804
Why suffer an horrific death...

1122
02:11:08,394 --> 02:11:11,584
...when you can join me and live?

1123
02:11:12,231 --> 02:11:13,191
Never!

1124
02:11:15,334 --> 02:11:19,523
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1125
02:11:20,873 --> 02:11:23,772
Tell me, Harry...

1126
02:11:24,377 --> 02:11:27,837
...-would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1127
02:11:28,514 --> 02:11:30,324
Together...

1128
02:11:30,783 --> 02:11:33,063
...we can bring them back.

1129
02:11:33,753 --> 02:11:37,883
All 1 ask is for something in return.

1130
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:47,920
That's it, Harry.

1131
02:11:49,235 --> 02:11:52,665
There is no good and evil.

1132
02:11:53,339 --> 02:11:55,969
There is only power...

1133
02:11:56,542 --> 02:12:00,142
..and those too weak to seek it.

1134
02:12:01,347 --> 02:12:05,737
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1135
02:12:06,786 --> 02:12:08,776
Just give me the Stone!

1136
02:12:11,624 --> 02:12:12,704
You liar!

1137
02:12:13,058 --> 02:12:14,928
Kill him!

1138
02:12:38,717 --> 02:12:43,406
-What is this magic?
-Fool, get the Stone!

1139
02:14:29,261 --> 02:14:31,511
Good afternoon, Harry.

1140
02:14:33,933 --> 02:14:37,853
-Tokens from your admirers?
-Admirers?

1141
02:14:38,604 --> 02:14:43,904
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1142
02:14:44,843 --> 02:14:49,063
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1143
02:14:51,951 --> 02:14:55,201
l see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1144
02:14:55,854 --> 02:14:58,344
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1145
02:14:58,891 --> 02:15:01,521
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1146
02:15:02,094 --> 02:15:06,374
Fine. They're both just fine.

1147
02:15:07,533 --> 02:15:10,023
-What happened to the Stone?
-Relax, dear boy.

1148
02:15:10,636 --> 02:15:13,386
The Stone has been destroyed.

1149
02:15:13,973 --> 02:15:17,483
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1150
02:15:18,177 --> 02:15:21,687
..and agreed it was best all around.

1151
02:15:22,381 --> 02:15:25,721
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1152
02:15:28,253 --> 02:15:33,053
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1153
02:15:33,926 --> 02:15:36,796
But yes, he will die.

1154
02:15:37,396 --> 02:15:39,505
How is it 1 got the Stone, sir?

1155
02:15:39,999 --> 02:15:42,279
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

1156
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:46,401
You see, only a person...

1157
02:15:47,139 --> 02:15:50,619
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1158
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:55,350
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1159
02:15:56,849 --> 02:15:59,949
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1160
02:16:00,586 --> 02:16:05,006
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1161
02:16:07,026 --> 02:16:11,656
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1162
02:16:12,498 --> 02:16:14,548
I'm afraid...

1163
02:16:16,235 --> 02:16:19,804
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1164
02:16:21,006 --> 02:16:23,256
Harry, do you know why...

1165
02:16:23,776 --> 02:16:27,286
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1166
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:32,080
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1167
02:16:33,152 --> 02:16:36,022
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1168
02:16:36,621 --> 02:16:39,902
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1169
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:44,919
-It lives in your very skin.
-What is it?

1170
02:16:46,365 --> 02:16:49,615
Love, Harry. Love.

1171
02:16:58,110 --> 02:17:01,800
Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.

1172
02:17:02,513 --> 02:17:06,614
l was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1173
02:17:07,386 --> 02:17:10,316
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1174
02:17:10,923 --> 02:17:13,913
But I think I could be safe...

1175
02:17:14,526 --> 02:17:16,575
...with a nice toffee.

1176
02:17:20,933 --> 02:17:22,333
Alas!

1177
02:17:23,201 --> 02:17:25,041
Earwax.

1178
02:17:40,585 --> 02:17:43,366
-All right there, Ron?
-All right. You?

1179
02:17:44,889 --> 02:17:47,230
All right. Hermione?

1180
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:49,870
Never better.

1181
02:18:05,878 --> 02:18:08,068
Another year gone.

1182
02:18:09,114 --> 02:18:13,124
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1183
02:18:13,886 --> 02:18:16,196
And the points stand thus:

1184
02:18:16,722 --> 02:18:21,762
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1185
02:18:24,463 --> 02:18:29,413
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1186
02:18:35,374 --> 02:18:36,984
In second place...

1187
02:18:37,409 --> 02:18:41,628
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1188
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:49,379
And in first place...

1189
02:18:49,955 --> 02:18:54,705
.. with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1190
02:19:00,966 --> 02:19:02,866
Nice one, mate.

1191
02:19:07,004 --> 02:19:10,574
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1192
02:19:11,343 --> 02:19:15,123
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1193
02:19:15,848 --> 02:19:20,208
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1194
02:19:21,452 --> 02:19:26,252
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1195
02:19:27,125 --> 02:19:29,615
... while others were in grave peril...

1196
02:19:30,662 --> 02:19:32,621
...50 points.

1197
02:19:33,832 --> 02:19:34,972
Good job.

1198
02:19:42,808 --> 02:19:48,138
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1199
02:19:49,381 --> 02:19:54,010
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1200
02:19:59,258 --> 02:20:01,038
And third...

1201
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:04,350
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1202
02:20:04,897 --> 02:20:08,707
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1203
02:20:09,801 --> 02:20:14,110
...l award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1204
02:20:23,015 --> 02:20:24,685
We're tied with Slytherin!

1205
02:20:25,117 --> 02:20:30,417
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1206
02:20:31,356 --> 02:20:34,756
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1207
02:20:35,427 --> 02:20:38,037
l award 10 points...

1208
02:20:38,597 --> 02:20:41,407
...to Neville Longbottom.

1209
02:20:55,147 --> 02:20:58,167
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1210
02:20:58,784 --> 02:21:02,764
... 1 believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1211
02:21:08,327 --> 02:21:11,286
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1212
02:21:49,801 --> 02:21:52,731
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1213
02:21:53,338 --> 02:21:57,058
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1214
02:22:03,048 --> 02:22:05,948
-Come on, Harry.
-One minute.

1215
02:22:12,624 --> 02:22:15,874
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1216
02:22:19,698 --> 02:22:21,188
This is for you.

1217
02:22:38,150 --> 02:22:39,990
Thanks, Hagrid.

1218
02:22:46,158 --> 02:22:50,028
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1219
02:22:50,962 --> 02:22:54,882
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1220
02:22:55,634 --> 02:22:58,034
..-you could always threaten him...

1221
02:22:58,570 --> 02:23:01,119
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1222
02:23:01,673 --> 02:23:06,123
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1223
02:23:07,145 --> 02:23:10,985
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1224
02:23:17,055 --> 02:23:19,805
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1225
02:23:20,392 --> 02:23:22,232
I'm not going home.

1226
02:23:22,694 --> 02:23:24,364
Not really.
