— I'm fine.

2
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,550

— Fine.

3

] suppose you
wanna see it again?.

4

If you don't mind.

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,890
-— You know where it is.
- Oh, yeah.

6
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,870
If l charged youa
dollar every time...

7
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,570
you came to examine
the machine...

8
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,549
.. you'd probably own it.
It's the one all the pros use.

9
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,290
Mariah Carey. Beyonce.
Gwen Stefani.

10
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,829
Really?. Who's Beyonce?.

11
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,560
Just kidding. I'll take it.

12
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,470
Excuse me, sir.

13
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,050
The adult party's
in the front.

14
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,100
— I'm Kim's father.

15
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,770

l just wanted to give
Kim her present.

19
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,170
We're letting the kids
have their space.

20
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,680
— Put it with the others.

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,330
l wanna give it to her myself.

22
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,540
- Still having trouble
following the rules.

23
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,810
Oh, come on, Lennie.

24
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,760
- I've asked you not
to call me that.

25
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,930
Excuse me. Lenore.

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,570

- ...how we arranged
the presents.

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:26,890
Here.

31
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,660
It's bad manners
to open the one...

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,410
— ...and not the others.
- Go on. Open it.

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,290
- Cool.
— A karaoke machine?.

34
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,500
- Well, I figured she
wants to be a singer.

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,859
When she was 1 2, Bryan.

36
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,269
— We've moved on.
- Thank you, Daddy.

37
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,200
My pleasure.

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,700
— l still wanna be a
singer. Don't tell Mom.

39
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,579
You got it.

40
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,390
Here. One for the book.

41
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,579
— We have a professional
photographer.

42
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,910
Big smile, sweetie.

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,880
That's my girl.

44
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,740
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

45
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,900
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,720
Oh, my-- Stuart.

47
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,490
Stuart, I love
you. I love you.

49
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,510
Happy birthday, sweetie.

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,830
— Oh, Stuart,
you're impossible.

51

l know.

52
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,760
- Hey, Bryan.
— Stuart.

53
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,390
— She's not a little
girl anymore, huh?.

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,400
l guess not.

55
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,520
— Will you join us for lunch?.
— No, thanks.

56
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,030
] just wanted to be here
to wish her a happy birthday.

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
- Good to see you, Bryan.
-— You too.

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,320
Thanks.

59
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,520
- Hey.
- Hey.

60
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,920
You forgot.

61
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,550
Come onin.

62
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,700
It's not like I didn't
call to remind you.

63
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,060
Third Saturday in May?.

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,900
— Red meat, red wine?.
Sound familiar?.

65
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,650
He probably had a
lot on his mind.

66
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,440
Yeah, the busy
life of a retiree.

67
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
Every day a new adventure.

68
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,930
What does a retiree
do, anyway?.

69
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,520
Take naps?. Play golf?.

70
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,690
— Hit on rich widows?.

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,190
That takes care
of the morning.

72
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,770
Yeah, well, come on, guys.
You know why I'm here.

73
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,640
Yeah, how's that going?.

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,610
Okay. We had her
birthday today.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,140
Can you believe
my Kimmy's 1 7?.

76
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,280
Seventeen?.

77
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,729
-— To Kim.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,460
Lennie still got a
hard-on for you?.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,030
She's not Lennie anymore.
She's Lenore.

80
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,850
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,270
— And the husband?.
— The same. Perfect.

82
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,370
- Dig deep enough,
there's always shit.

83
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,210
We can dig if you
want us to dig.

84
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
What, you think he hasn't
done it already?.

85
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,090
Thank you, Bernie.

86
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,929
- How's Kimmy?.
- Good. She's good.

87
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,340
Yeah?. She sleep over yet?.

88
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,250
Well, let's say
we're working on it.

89
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,920
She appreciate the fact...

90
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,820
that you've given
up your life...

91
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,580
..in order to be
closer to her?.

92
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,720
What a life, huh?.

93
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,570
Hey, remember Beirut
after the chief disappeared’.

94
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,290
Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from Hezbollah?.

95
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,070
The guy said he'd
get us inside...

96
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,030
then disappeared.

97
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,929
We're scrambling to
get the hell out...

98
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,290
.. before we get taken down
and where are you?.

99
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,330
l promised never to
miss her birthday.

100
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,580
Yeah, that went down well
at Langley...

101
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,860
..when they found out
you flew the coop...

102
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,969
..to attend your
child's birthday...

103
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,020
9000 miles away.

104
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,969
Where did you say
your next posting was?.

105
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,940
The Arctic Circle
. .
spying on penguins.

106
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,980
l believe it was.

107
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,719
No, penguins live
in Antarctica.

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,220
Actually, it was Alaska.
What's your point, Sam?.

109
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,600
My point is we have
an open space.

110
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,260
Say the word, it's yours.

111
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,050
Who likes theirs rare?.

112
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,610
- Guys.
- See you, Bryan.

113
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,850
- Good night, guys.
- See you, Bry.

114
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,099
Hey, look, look, look.
All kidding aside...

115
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,210
. it's a great thing
trying to make up...

116
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,540
for lost time with Kimmy.

117
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,450
But tomorrow's
job?. Right here.

118
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,320
Four hours’ work,
2500 bucks...

119
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,180
.. just for taking
some pop diva...

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,500
to and from her concert.

121
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,180
— We're one short.
- A singer?.

122
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,169
] don't know if you'd
call her a singer.

123
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
More like a cash cow.

124
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,220
Twenty million records
sold already...

125
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,479
and she's not even 25.

126
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,920
Job's a piece of cake.

127
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,250
We get her there and back.

128
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,140
Inside, they've got
their own people.

129
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,340
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay?.

130
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,790
- Yeah.
— Like that's it?.

131
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,130
Yeah.

132
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,690
- It'll be perfect.
Just like old times.

133
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,630
Better. No one gets killed.

134
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,530
- Tomorrow. Good night, guys.
- See you.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,210
- Get in the back, Wendy.
- l always get in the back.

136
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,930
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
l suggest you keep moving.

137
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,590
My mother is ma'am,
if you don't mind.

138
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,030
— Come on, it's time
now. Let's go.

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,020
Okay.

140
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,570
Bernie, Casey,
you're out here.

141
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,930
Bry, you're in the room.

142
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,920
Okay.

143
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,210
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

144
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,630
Thank you for coming.

145
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,370
Wow, it was beautiful.

146
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,600
Thanks. What did you say

147
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,410

148
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,110
— Nice to meet
you, Bryan Mills.

149
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,160
You too.

150
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,470
-— You're on. Come
on, let's go now.

151
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,439
Okay, guys.

152
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,630
Excuse me, miss.

153
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,410
I've a daughter who
wants to be a singer...

154
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,130
and was wondering if
you had any tips.

155
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, I do.

156
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,100
Tell her to pick
another career.

157
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,780
l got one.

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
We're waiting on
an air strike...

159
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,790
..and we're waiting...

160
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,490
and then my satellite
phone rings.

161
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,790
— Who is it?.
— Hello?.

162
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,660
-— The guy we're to terminate.
- Honey.

163
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,680
— He'd like to know
if we want some tea.

164
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,640
Sorry, guys, it's Kim.

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
The noise?.

166
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,580
I'm at a concert.

167
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,800
You know this song?. Yeah?.

168
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,010
Yep, that's her.
No, no, no, I'm not attending.

169
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,860
I'm-- I'm not attending.

170
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,520
I'm helping some friends out
with security.

171
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,790
Well, of course I met her.

172
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
Who do you think's
guarding her?.

173
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,930
I'm glad you're impressed.

174
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,290
Hey, I'm happy you called.

Lunch?. Tomorrow?.

177
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,890
Sure, sure. l know the place.

178
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,370
Twelve-thirty it is.

179
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll see you then.

180
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,010
— Here he is. And...?.
- What happened?.

181
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,010
— She wants to have lunch.
- Okay.

182
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,329
— Just the two of us.
- All right. Fantastic.

183
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,950
See?. There's
progress. That's great.

184
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,250
Who left that gate open?.

185
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,209
Bry, get her out of
here. Take the lead.

186
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,280
- Move.
- Go, go.

187
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,240
More security here now.

188
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,280
That's it. Move.

189
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,599
Casey.

190
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,290
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

191
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,180
- Go, go, go.
- Watch your head.

192
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,540
Here, take this.
The sugar will...

193
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,150
take the edge off the shock.

194
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,430
Come on, come on,
drink some more.

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,910
It's okay. It's
okay. You're safe.

196
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,359
You're safe now.

197
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
Bernie.

198
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,800
Casey. Rambo.

199
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,560
Seriously, Bry,

200
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,350
you should think
about coming with us.

201
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,530
You've got the edge.

202
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,140
There's more of
this to be had.

203
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,960
- She's going to
college next year?.

204
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,390
Yep.

205
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,830
- You're gonna lose her.

206
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,980
That gives mea
year to find her.

207
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,240
Mr. Mills, she'd
like to see you.

208
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,119
— How are you feeling?.
- Better.

209
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,990
So your daughter
wants to be a singer?.

210
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,030
Yep, since she was 5.

211
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,980
It's not what everyone
thinks it is.

212
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,680
Once the glam wears
off, it's just...

213
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,579
a lot of hotel rooms,
lots of airports.

214
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,800
It's what she wants.

215
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,130
The first number is Gio,
my vocal coach.

216
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,310
If he says she can
sing, she can sing.

217
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,200
He'll give her
coaching she needs,

218
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,219
the fee is on me.

219
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,199
The second number
.
is my manager.

220
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,900
If Gio clears her,

221
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,670
he'll make sure
she gets a shot.

222
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,920
- Thank you.
- No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

223
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,700
— There she is.
- Dad.

224
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,800
— Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

225
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,199
- Hi.
- Hi.

226
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,750
Don't look so excited.

227
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,130
l was just surprised.

228
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,620
thought it was just
gonna be Kim and I.

229
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,760
l asked Mom to come.

230
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,699
One raspberry-banana
milkshake,

231
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,870
extra cherries, just
the way you like it.

232
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,510
— Thanks.
— Lennie-- Lenore.

233
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,550
- Would you like something?.
— I'm fine, thanks.

234
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,760
So?.

235
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,430
So, Dad, guess what.

236
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,790
- You know my friend Amanda?.
- Yep.

237
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,030
Her cousins asked us
to spend vacation...

238
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,170
with them in Paris.

239
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,350
How cool is that?.

240
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,219
- Why do you want
to go to Paris?.

241
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,130
Dad. Hello?.

242
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,220
The Louvre, the
Impressionist museum,

243
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,550
the Picasso Museum.

244
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,460
I didn't know you
were so into art.

245
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,569
Are you kidding?. I've
been to the MOMA,

246
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,830
like, a hundred times.

247
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,850
Amanda went last
summer, she came...

248
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,630
back, she could
practically speak French.

249
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,570
And because you're
under 1 8...

250
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,720
.. you need my permission
to leave the country?.

251
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,260
Dad, please. ! really,
really wanna go.

252
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,650
They've got this...

253
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,459
sick apartment
overlooking the river.

254
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,090
— Just you and Amanda?.
— And her cousins.

255
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,990
Don't make a big deal
out of this, Bryan.

256
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,319
Just sign the paper.

257
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,330
— What?.

258
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,990
I'm not comfortable with this.

259
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,250
- Dad.
— 1 know the world, sweetie.

260
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,210
- Dad, please.

261
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,200
A 17-year-old should
not travel alone.

262
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
— I'm not gonna be alone.
- Two 1 7-year-olds.

263
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,689
Amanda's 1 9.

264
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,810
How about this?.
How about if l go along?.

265
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,260
You won't know I'm there.

266
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,930
I'm very good at
being invisible.

267
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,160
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

268
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,070
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

269
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,610
I'll think about it.

270
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,550
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

271
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,820
Hey, Kimmy, there's
something else.

272
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,160
- I don't want anything else.
— Kim.

273
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,090
- 1 don't get you.
— What?.

274
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,900
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

275
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,819
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

276
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,820
Can't you sacrifice a little
this time for your daughter?.

277
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,870
-— 1 would sacrifice
anything for her.

278
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,079
What's your problem?.

279
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,449
I'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

280
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,560
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?.

281
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,950
You're pathetic.

282
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,069
- She's coming.
— Thanks.

283
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,770
Three conditions.

284
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,430
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

285
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,110
You move, I wanna know where...

286
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,710
and with whom
you'll be staying.

287
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,439
Call me when you land. Call me...

288
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,350
every night before
you go to sleep.

289
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,300
It's international.
My number is in.

290
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,569
- Okay, awesome.
- Kimmy, you're not focused.

291
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,160
— lam.
- What did I say?.

292
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,780
You said call you when I land,

293
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,630
every night before
l go to sleep...

294
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,490
.. your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,980
Okay, one last thing.

296
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,900
l get to take you
to the airport.

297
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,959
Okay.

298
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,719
- There you go.
- Yes.

299
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,660
Thank you, Daddy.

300
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,790
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

301
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,880
Mom.

302
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,470
l love you, Dad.

303
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,550
Mom, he signed
it, he signed it.

304
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,220
I'm gonna go call Amanda.

305
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,360
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?.

306
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,340
Wouldn't it have been easier...

307
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,360
if you and I had talked
about it first?.

308
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,210
Certain areas in Paris
you should avoid.

309
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,510
I've written them down.

310
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,930
- Dad.
— Come on, take it.

311
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,889
We're gonna be
spending 90 percent...

312
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,859
of our time in
museums. Don't worry.

313
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,839
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

314
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,869
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.

315
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,599
Well, my job made me aware.

316
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,300
l used to ask Mom
what your job was...

317
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,020
that you were away
all the time.

318
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,470
And she would tell
me to ask you.

319
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,080
Whenever I did see you,
l was afraid to ask.

320
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,360
Yeah?. Why?.

321
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,840
] don't know. Maybe because...

322
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,060
...l was afraid to find out.

323
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,040
Like, maybe it was something
] wouldn't like.

324
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,360
1 worked for the government.
You knew that.

325
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,610
So you were like
a spy, right?.

326
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,389
- What happens if I
push this button?.

327
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,140
Don't touch that button.

328
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,160
Well, no, l was a—--
l was a preventer, actually.

329
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,720
— A preventer?.
- Yeah.

330
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,950
What did you prevent?.

331
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,320
Bad things from happening.

332
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,350
So it was a good job?.

333
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,470
Yes. Yep, it was.

334
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,800
Do you miss it?.

335
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
] missed you more.

336
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,860
— Kim.
— Dad, there's Amanda.

337
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,620
Go ahead. l'll get the bags.

338
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,460
- Jimmy'll give you
a hand with those.

339
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,340
] can manage.

340
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,899
Lenore.

341
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,220
Do you know about this?.
She's not just going to Paris.

342
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,180
-— 1 know.
— She lied to me.

343
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,340
Yes, because she
can't be honest...

344
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,140
with you.

345
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,760
Why?. What are you
talking about?.

346
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,630
Your rules and conditions.

347
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,080
What is this?.

348
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,820
It's U2's European tour dates.

349
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,080
She's following a rock band
around Europe?.

350
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,960
All kids do. Stuart
got her tickets,

351
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,969
arranged her to stay
in the best hotels.

352
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,310
Best hotels. You know,

353
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,320
you live in your
little bubble here...

354
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,370
...behind your wall,
with your maids...

355
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,910
and chauffeurs and servants.

356
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,580
No idea what the
world is like.

357
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,990
Yes, and neither will she...

358
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,430
unless she goes out
and experiences it.

359
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,610
Don't tell me I
don't know the world.

360
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,830
For five years I waited
for a phone call...

361
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,750
that didn't come
for weeks at a time.

362
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
For a knock on the door...

363
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,970
telling me there'd
be no calls anymore.

364
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,149
Listen, 1 know you
moved here to build...

365
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,139
some sort of
relationship with Kimmy.

366
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,020
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.

367
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,159
Let her live, orl promise,
] promise you'll lose her.

368
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,760
Girls.

369

set of skills.

505
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,610
Skills I've acquired
over a very long career.

506
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,439
Skills that make
me a nightmare...

507

for people like you.

508
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,470

everything about them.

526
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,610
— l have a few resources—-—

527
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,530
Now is not the time
for dick measuring.

528
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,820
-— Anyone looking to hurt you?.
— Not that I know.

529
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,960
— Which room's Kim's?.
- What happened?.

530
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,050
] got a call from her.
There were people...

531
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,740
in the apartment.
She was taken.

532
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,230
- Oh, God.
— Which one?.

533
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,280
That one.

534
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,980
Is there something
] should be doing?.

535
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,480
You have a lease agreement...

536
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,139
with NetJet through
your company.

537
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,160
I do.

538
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,170
- Get me a plane to Paris.
— For when?.

539
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,500
An hour ago.

540
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,430
- I'm gonna make the
call. You all right?.

541
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,870
Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

542
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,440
Would you please
get her back to me, Bryan?.

543
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,189
First l have to find her.

544
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,810
Sam, what have you got?.

545
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,409
They're speaking Albanian.

546
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,440
Based on their
accents and dialects,

547
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,000
they must be from Tropoja.

548
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,969
The place is ground zero
for scummers.

549
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,709
Even the Russians
give these guys a wide berth.

550
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,270
The one you spoke to,
his name is Marko.

551
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,430
We have information
that a mobster boss...

552
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,150
... by the name of Marko Hoxha...

553
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,889
moved to Paris about
six months ago.

554
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,530
If he's the one,
he's a big fish.

555
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,670
The tattoo, by the
way, is a group ID.

556
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,160
- Am lon speaker or
are you by yourself?

557
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,300
Lenore is here.

558
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,090
- Hey, Lennie.
- Hello, Sam.

559
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,610
She needs to hear it, Sam.

560
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,409
The specialty of the
groups coming out...

561
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,090
of this area is
trafficking in women.

562
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,540
- Keep going.
- Okay.

563
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,070
Their previous m.o.
was to offer women...

564
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,520
from emerging East
European countries...

565
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,680
. like Yugoslavia,
Romania, Bulgaria,

566
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,800
jobs in the West as
maids and nannies.

567
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,590
Once smuggled in,
they'd addict them...

568
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,580
to drugs and turn them
into prostitutes.

569
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,419
Lately, however,
they've decided...

570
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,889
that it's more economical...

571
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,590
.. just to kidnap
traveling young women.

572
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,830
Saves on transportation costs.

573
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Oh, my little baby.

574
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,160
What else?.

575
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,280
Based on the way
these groups operate,

576
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,480
our analyst says...

577
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,260
.. you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.

578
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,939
-— To what?.
- To never finding her.

579
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,070
No, no, no.

580
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,360
Daddy.

581
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,090
Mustache. Six feet.

582
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,510
Tattoo on right
hand, moon and star.

583
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,680
Da--

584
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,120
Good luck.

585
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,000
Good luck.

586
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,400
Good luck.

587
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,560
Good luck.

588
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,600
Oh, my God.

589
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,710
Dad, they got Amanda.

590
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,120
Oh, God.

591
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,290
Dad, they got her.

592
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,610
They took her.

593
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,920
Go to the next bedroom.
Get under the bed.

594
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,560
- Tell me when you're there.
— I'm here.

595
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,290
Stay focused, baby.
Leave the phone on the floor.

596
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,090
Concentrate. Shout out
everything you see about them.

597
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,310
Hair color, eye color,
tall, short, scars.

598
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,200
Anything you see.
You understand?

599
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,150
They're there.
l can hear them.

600
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,569
Remember, concentrate.

601
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,180
They're leaving. Daddy.

602
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
Dad.

603
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,700
Beard. Six feet.

604
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,920
Tattoo right hand,
moon and star.

605
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,080
Dad.

606
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,690
- Hi.
- Hi.

607
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,370
—1'm Peter.
-1' m Ingrid.

608
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,920
- On holidays?.
- Yes.

609
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,740
— Me too.
- Cool.

610
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,560
Cabs here are so
damned expensive.

611
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,480
Want to share?.

612
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,680
- Sure. Why not?.
- Great.

613
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,919
— Excuse me.
- Hey.

614
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,600
- Hey.
- Drive.

615
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,790
— The two American
girls from yesterday?.

616
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,830
l don't know.

617
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,100
The next rib drives
into your lungs.

618
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,160
The two American girls,
where are they?.

619
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,900
— Just like the old days.

620
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,680
Would you have it
any other way?.

621
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,270
Between you and me?. No.

622
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,180
But now that I
sit behind a desk,

623
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,790
the world looks different.

624
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,509
- You mean, looks boring.
— 1 mean different.

625
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,290
Okay, a little boring.
But is being retired...

626
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,810
any more interesting?.

627
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,560
It wasn't. Until my daughter...

628
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,330
disappeared in
Paris yesterday.

629
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,220
She and her friend
were marked by a...

630
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,350
spotter at the airport.
Albanians took her.

631
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,120
- How do you know this?.
— I'm retired, not dead.

632
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,710
And l assume you don't want
to go to the police.

633
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,620
l was told I have 96 hours.
That was 1 6 hours ago.

634
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,240
- Okay, first, we should
find the spotter.

635
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,600
l found him, he's dead.

636
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,460
You found him that way?.

637
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,300
Bryan, you cannot
just run around...

638
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,770
tearing down Paris--

639
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,340
I'll tear down the
Eiffel Tower...

640
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,140
if ] have to.

641
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,750
- Don't forget who you talk to.
- I'm talking to a friend.

642
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,700
You are. But please remember,
your friend has a desk now.

643
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,580
‘Deputy director,
Internal Security.’

644
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,840
Very impressive.

645
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,799
The Albanians?.

646
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,850
They showed up from the East,
.
SIX, seven years ago.

647
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,390
Fifteen, 20 of them.
Now there are hundreds.

648
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,270
We don't even know how many.
And dangerous.

649
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,180
So l heard. Where
do I find them?.

650
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,370
The best place to start
is Porte de Clichy.

651
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,600
Bryan, try not to make a mess.

652
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,510
- Gregor Milocivic?.
- Yes. Yes, ! am Gregor.

653
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,930
I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.

654
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,240
Here is my resume.

655
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,680
The employment agency said...

656
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,190
we would be doing
translations.

657
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,080
Yes. Albanian to English.
You do speak Albanian?.

658
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,759
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian.

659
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,549
l was a teacher in
primary school...

660
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,540
— ...before the war
began in Pristina--

661
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,580
What's your rate?.

662
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,960
My rate?.

663
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,100
It is 25 per hour for
the first three hours...

664
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,330
and then it goes up--

665
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,299
Okay. Now, here's
for 1 0 hours.

666
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,180
Wait here.

667
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,170
Mr. Smith, I do
not understand.

668
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,860
What is the job exactly?.

669
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,149
Right now the job
is to wait here.

670
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,860
Good evening.

671
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,740
— Hi. Looking for a date?.

672
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,150
l love your dress.
Is that silk?.

673
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,350
l don't know.
You want to know the prices?.

674
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,410
Just the way it falls,
it must be silk.

675
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,930
How it compliments...

676
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,960
the natural curves
of your body.

677
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,150
The rate is 40 euros
for the standard.

678
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,140
Standard?. Could you
be more specific?.

679
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,880
Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibilities.

680
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,890
Like kissing,

681
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,560
you know, closed
lips, open lips.

682
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,220
- If you're not
buying, piss off.

683
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,790
I didn't say 1 wasn't buying.

684
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,940
l like to get comfortable
before I purchase.

685
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,010
Like this karaoke
machine I bought.

686
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,880
l must have read that manual...

687
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,850
from cover to cover
so many times.

688
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,720
l don't give a shit.
You're gonna...

689
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,490
get me in trouble
if you don't buy.

690
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,810
- Trouble?. Really?. With who?.
- Piss off.

691
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,600
Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.

692
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,279
lf l want a package deal,
do I get a discount?.

693
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,150
- You cost me two now.
- My name's Bryan.

694
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,760
-— Oh, God. You better leave.

695
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,730
] thought we were negotiating.

696
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,670
Anton, I swear,
it's not my fault.

697
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,670
— I told him--

698
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,640
Why are you
bothering the girl?.

699
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
-— None of your business.
-— She is my business.

700
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,850
And if you're not
spending money,

701
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,000
you're costing money.

702
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,050
- l was negotiating.

703
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,870
No negotiating.
Price is the price.

704
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,919
Now you owe me
for two that got away.

705
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,390
] don't owe you nothing.

706
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,830
- Fifty euros or
l kick your ass.

707
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,109
Sure, sure, okay.

708
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,120
Chill.

709
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,569
Okay. Here's your 50.

710
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,740
And another 50 for
being an asshole.

711
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,669
Now get the hell out of here.

712
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,960
If l see you again,
MI kill you.

713
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,299
Mr. Smith, l do not
know what kind of...

714
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,290
job I'm supposed to
do for you, but--...

715
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,240
— You are to translate.
-— Yes. But translate what?.

716
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,520
This.

717
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,600
Translate.

718
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,680
- They're talking about you.
— What about me?.

719
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,850
- They're not saying
nice things.

720
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,759
Be specific.

721
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,570
They're saying--
Excuse me, Mr. Smith.

722
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,690
- what an asshole you are.

723
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,420
Please, if you can
explain to me...

724
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,560
why we're doing this--

725
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,360
Just translate.

726
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,530
One of them says,

727
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,310
the sausage gave
him heartburn.

728
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,770
Keep going.

729
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,150
The other one is
suggesting something...

730
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,279
his grandmother
used to give him.

731
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,700
- Do you really want
to hear all this?.

732
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,050
Every word.

733
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,010
Now they're talking
about football.

734
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,120
The game between
Lazio and Marseille.

735
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,210
And they lost money
on the betting.

736
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,600
- Perhaps if 1 knew
the purpose--

737
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,940
You're better off not knowing.

738
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,290
Is it still football?.

739
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,440
One is on the phone.

740
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,950
He has to do a job
at the construction site.

741
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,190
Something about
fresh merchandise...

742
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,290
giving problems.

743
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:40,980
Mr. Smith,

744
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,750
] do not understand
any of this.

745
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,899
You're not supposed
to. Goodbye.

746
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,980
l asked for an En
glish-Albanian...

747
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,009
dictionary, did
you bring one?.

748
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,200
Thank you.

749
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,319
love you.

750
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,250
Where did you get this?.

751
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,569
Where did you get this?.

752
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,810
- I'm good.
- Who gave this to you?.

753
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,870
- Who--?. Who gave
this to you?.

754
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,080
I'm good.

755
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,520
Hey.

756
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,970
Hey.

757
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,120
Come on.

758
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,029
Monsieur Allen, how are you?.

759
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,080
Hello, Gilles.
How's the wife?.

760
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,850
Well, still in charge.

761
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,200
- Been a long time
since I've seen you.

762
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,270
Way too long.

763
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,610
— The usual accommodation?.
— Plus one.

764
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,150
Yes?.

765
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,040
— We need to talk.
- I'm listening.

766
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,919
Well, can't you come
and meet me first?.

767
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,870
] can't see you.
Where are you?.

768
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,149
] can see you and
hear you very well.

769
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,920
You can tell them
to stop jogging now.

770
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:49,780
Didn't think

771
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,370
] was gonna come
down, did you?.

772
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,750
I didn't think you were gonna
make such a mess.

773
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,990
I didn't have time to worry
about neatness.

774
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,980
— 1 know. You have 70 hours.
— Now I have 56.

775
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,709
No, now you have none.

776
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,620
My chief wanted to arrest you,

777
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,680
] convinced him
to send you home.

778
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,069
Air France 001
leaves today at 2.

779
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,839
First class.

780
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,000
Courtesy of the
French government...

781
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,880
for past services rendered.

782
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,700
- And what about my daughter?.

783
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,650
I told you, I sit
behind a desk now.

784
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,990
l take my orders from someone
who sits behind a bigger desk.

785
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,790
Come on, seven dead bodies,

786
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,980
three in hospital, a
building destroyed.

787
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,520
Total chaos at the airport.

788
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,110
He wanted your ass in chains.

789
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,020
It's the best ]
could do, I'm sorry.

790
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,240
Sorry doesn't cut
it, Jean-Claude.

791
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,520
Not this time.

792
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,120
You can't beat
the state, Bryan.

793
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,040
You know that.

794
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,020
I'm not trying to.

795
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,580
I'm trying to
save my daughter.

796
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,770
It was a trailer,
not a building.

797
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,710
No, no, no. Leave it.

798
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,850
It's all right, it's fluids.

799
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,549
And medication
to counteract the drugs.

800
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,720
It's all right.

801
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,840
Where'd you get this?.

802
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,870
Where did you
get this jacket?.

803
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,000
Did you get it from her?.

804
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,330
Was it from this girl?.

805
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,149
] didn't steal it.

806
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,480
-— l was cold, she
gave it to me.

807
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,310
Where?. Where did
she give it to you?.

808
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,130
— In the house.
— What house?.

809
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,940
The house with the red door.

810
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,879
Sorry.

811
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,299
He said it was a party.

812
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,090
The girl who gave you this,
was she in the house?.

813
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,840
She was nice.

814
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,919
l know.

815
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,399
She's my daughter.

816
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,820
l need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?.

817
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,560
Paradise.

818
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,480
- Good morning.
- May I help you?.

819
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,930
— I'm here to see your boss.
-— No boss.

820
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,190
We're doing
nothing wrong here.

821
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,720
One button,
and 30 agents will be here...

822
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,150
.. before you have time
to scratch your balls.

823
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,770
Stop jerking around before

824
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,430
l close you down
for wasting my time.

825
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,240
Wait here.

826
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,070
You have weapon?.

827
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,120
You're holding it.

828
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,140
Black, one sugar, please.

829
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,540
What is it you want?.

830
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,800
I'm here to
negotiate the rates.

831
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,009
We already negotiated the rate
with Mr. Macon.

832
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,370
Mr. Macon has moved
to another division.

833
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,590
I'm here for the
renegotiation.

834
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,840
Unless you think I'm
being unreasonable,

835
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,690
let me explain ourselves.

836
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,650
Nice coffee. We have you under...

837
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,970
satellite surveillance,
24 hours a day.

838
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,630
We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.

839
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,850
Do you have any idea
what it costs...

840
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,359
just to change the angle...

841
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,160
...of the lens on a satellite...

842
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,130
orbiting 200 miles
above the Earth?.

843
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,790
And those costs have gone up.

844
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,330
Our costs go up,
your costs go up.

845
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,920
It's only logical.

846
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,310
By the way,
which one of you is Marko?.

847
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,380
Why do you want to know?.

848
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,120
l was told Marko is in charge.

849
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,160
We are all Marko.

850
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,640
Marko from Tropoja.

851
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,070
We are all from Tropoja.

852
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,450
lf that's the game
you want to play,

853
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,180
the rate just went
up 1 0 percent.

854
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,590
If you are trying to
extort us because...

855
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,799
we are immigrants,
we know the law.

856
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,410
I'm extorting you because
you are breaking the law.

857
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,020
Which charge would you
like to be arrested for?.

858
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,270
Drugs, kidnapping,
prostitution?.

859
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,410
Take your pick.

860
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,000
You come to this country,
take advantage of it...

861
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,130
..and think because
we are tolerant,

862
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,640
we are weak and helpless.

863
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,360
Your arrogance offends me.

864
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,390
For that,
the rate went up 1 0 percent.

865
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,950
Now, do you want to get down...

866
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,510
to business or to
keep playing?.

867
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,610
— How much?.
- Twenty percent.

868
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,050
And you have my word
it'll not go up...

869
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,399
for a year.

870
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,160
How do you say ‘sugar’
in your language?.

871
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,669
You've made a very
good investment,

872
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:25,390
gentlemen.

873
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,319
See you in a month.

874
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,779
A friend gave this to me.

875
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,680
It's Albanian. You
mind translating it?.

876
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,879
Good luck.

877
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,820
— Good luck.
— Good luck.

878
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,009
— Good luck. Good luck.
— Good luck.

879
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,700
You don't remember me.

880
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,270
We spoke on the phone
two days ago.

881
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,270
l told you ! would find you.

882
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,960
Kim.

883
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,359
Amanda.

884
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,430
Wake up.

885
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,900
l need you to be focused.

886
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,430
Are you focused yet?.

887
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,830
Where is this girl?.

888
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,879
Where is she?.

889
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,810
You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.

890
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,910
But what we found
was the countries...

891
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:06,980
we outsourced to...

892
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,189
.. had unreliable power grids.
Very Third World.

893
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,830
You'd turn on a switch,
power wouldn't come on...

894
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,820
..and then tempers
would get short.

895
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,060
People would resort to
pulling fingernails.

896
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,550
Acid drips on bare skin.

897
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,770
The whole exercise...

898
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,200
would become co
unterproductive.

899
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,000
But here, the power's stable.

900
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,470
Here, there's a
nice even flow.

901
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,270
Here, you can flip a switch...

902
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,430
and the power
stays on all day.

903
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,000
Where is she?.

904
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,480
Now, I don't have
any more time...

905
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,570
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

906
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,920
Give me what I need
or this switch'll stay on...

907
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,050
...till they turn power off...

908
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,190
for lack of payment
on the bill.

909
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,040
Where is my daughter?.

910
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,490
We don't keep virgins,
we sell them.

911
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,980
She was virgin, lot of money.

912
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,600
You sold my daughter?.
You sold her?.

913
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,240
To who?.

914
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,640
l don't know.

915
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,720
— What?.
— Saint-Clair.

916
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,520
Saint-Clair.

917
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,390
Saint-Clair?. Saint-Clair.
Is that a person, a place?.

918
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,640
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

919
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,879
Patrice Saint-Clair.

920
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,300
Where can I find him?.

921
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,859
1 don't know, I don't know.

922
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,750
1 don't know. I don't know.
l don't know.

923
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,170
Please. I don't know.

924
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,089
] don't know. No.
Please. Please.

925
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,879
Please.

926
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,630
Not that. Please.

927
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,839
I believe you.

928
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,750
But it's not gonna save you.

929
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,440
Look who dropped by.

930
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,720
Bryan, what a
pleasant surprise.

931
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,109
Jean-Claude.

932
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,580
The children
waited up for you.

933
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,730
If you tuck them in,
maybe we can eat...

934
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,240
before everything gets cold.

935
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,920
Bryan, will you
do the honors?.

936
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,780
- Sure.
- I'll be just a minute.

937
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,609
l was just telling Bryan
how nice it's been...

938
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,930
since you left the old job
for the new one.

939
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,849
Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.

940
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:25,059
Yeah, must be nice coming home
every night, seeing your kids.

941
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,670
Bryan has been thinking
about relocating.

942
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,389
- Really?.
- Yes.

943
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,300
To Paris, he's been
visiting houses.

944
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,040
— White or dark meat?.
- Dark, please.

945
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,750
Find anything interesting?.

946
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,330
As a matter of fact,
did, in the 1 Oth...

947
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,350
arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

948
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,010
People there know someone
that works in your office.

949
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:45,200
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?.

950
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,600
Oh, Henry. I call
him Mr. Nervous.

951
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,870
Always seems like
he's about to...

952
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:51,580
have a problem. Carrots?.

953
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,670
] got to the bottom of it,
Jean-Claude.

954
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,630
I know everything.

955
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,020
] hope you're not
involved in this shit.

956
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,120
— What shit?.

957
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,179
This is not the time
or place, Bryan.

958
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,880
- Are you involved?.
— Involved in what?.

959
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,689
What are you two
talking about?.

960
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:07,670
- Are you?.

961
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,270
My salary is X, my
expenses are Y.

962
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,630
As long as my family
is provided for...

963
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:13,810
...1 do not care...

964
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,420
where the difference
comes from.

965
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,450
That is my entire involvement.

966
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,630
- What about my family?.
- I told you...

967
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:20,700
1 would help...

968
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,260
as long as it didn't
cause trouble.

969
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,800
Who is Patrice Saint-Clair?.

970
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,490
] don't know, I don't care.

971
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,450
lam driving you
to the airport.

972
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,560
Jean-Claude.

973
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,030
Let's get going.
Dinner is over.

974
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,009
- I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are.

975
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:36,899
- No.
— No, I'm not.

976
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,370
That's what happens
when you sit...

977
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,090
behind a desk.
You forget things.

978
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:49,299
Like the weight in the hand
of a gun that's loaded.

979
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,680
Isabelle.

980
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,610
It's a flesh wound.

981
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,670
But if you don't
get me what I need,

982
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,380
the last thing you'll see...

983
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,550
is the bullet
] put between her eyes.

984
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,560
Now, Patrice Saint-Clair.

985
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,180
You could've made this
less painful...

986
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,380
if you had been more
concerned about...

987
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,420
my daughter and less
about your desk.

988
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,000
Please apologize to
your wife for me.

989
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,099
- Can l help you?.

990
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,009
