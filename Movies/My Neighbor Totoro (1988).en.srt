1
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,038
Dad, do you want some candy?

2
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,880
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

3
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:36,869
All right

4
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,230
We're almost there

5
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,930
Mei, hide

6
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,317
It wasn't a policeman

7
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,255
Hello

8
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,698
Are your parents around?

9
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,350
Thanks

10
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,090
I'm Kusakabe

11
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,060
We've just arrived

12
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,444
A pleasure to meet you

13
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,590
Welcome

14
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,593
Thank you

15
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:17,953
Here we are

16
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,659
Wait

17
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,164
Mei, there's a bridge

18
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,424
A bridge?

19
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,705
See that flash?
Fish too

20
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,471
So, you like it here?

21
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,369
Dad, it's terrific

22
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,152
Look, a tunnel of trees

23
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,963
Is that our house?

24
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,044
Come on

25
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,497
It's a wreck

26
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,914
Wreck

27
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,669
Looks like a haunted house

28
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,002
Haunted?

29
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,794
And it's all rotten

30
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,810
It's gonna fall down

31
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,474
Fall down

32
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,140
Look, Mei

33
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,104
See?

34
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,658
It's huge

35
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,905
Dad, there's a huge tree

36
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,669
It's a camphor tree

37
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,688
Camphor tree

38
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,087
Oops

39
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,007
An acorn

40
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,634
Show me

41
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,344
Another one

42
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,791
It's mine

43
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,288
Out of the way

44
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,472
1 can't open the screens

45
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:55,871
Acorns

46
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,199
There's acorns in the house

47
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,138
They dropped from up there

48
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,676
Maybe there are
squirrels in here

49
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,868
Squirrels, really?

50
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,433
Or rats; they like acorns too

51
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,217
I'd rather have squirrels

52
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,347
Where shall I put this?

53
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,198
Here
I'll get the door for you

54
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,090
Satsuki, open up the kitchen

55
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,172
Okay

56
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,640
It's just round the back

57
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,524
Mei, come on

58
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,220
Wait for me

59
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,219
Hurry

60
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,806
Ready?

61
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,325
Bathtubs

62
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,843
There's nothing here

63
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,189
That's the bathroom

64
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,005
Dad, there's something in here

65
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,082
A squirrel?

66
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,191
I don't know

67
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,675
A bunch of black things
but not roaches or mice

68
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,429
Really?

69
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,646
Can you see ‘em?

70
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,681
! think they were dustbunnies

71
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,277
Dustbunnies?

72
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,538
Like in my picture book?

73
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:07,303
That's right

74
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,794
Ghosts don't come out
on days like this

75
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,125
When you walk into
a dark room from outside

76
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,021
your eyes dim and so
the dustbunnies come out

77
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,864
Oh, I see

78
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,596
Come here, dustbunnies

79
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,411
Come out, come out
wherever you are

80
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,402
Let's get to work

81
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,716
See if you can find
how fo get upstairs

82
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,244
Get up there and
open all the windows

83
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,601
Sure

84
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,222
I'm coming, too

85
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,196
Toilet

86
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:00,836
Not here

87
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,603
Nothing here

88
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:05,858
Nothing

89
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,195
Nothing here

90
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,433
Nothing

91
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,328
Nothing

92
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,891
Nothing Nothing

93
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,154
Mei, it's here

94
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,713
It's pitch black

95
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,501
Dustbunnies

96
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,105
Another acorn

97
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,939
Come out, dustbunnies

98
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,742
Are you there, Mr. Dustbunny?

99
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,428
Nothing

100
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,194
Dad

101
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,546
There's definitely
something here

102
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,769
That's exciting

103
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,674
I've always wanted fo live
in a haunted house

104
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,178
I'm coming

105
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,771
! got it, Satsuki

106
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,790
Mei

107
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,302
You're full of energy

108
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,348
This is Nanny

109
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,587
She's come to
look after the house

110
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,659
I'm Satsuki and
this is my sister, Mei

111
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,108
Nice to meet you

112
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,675
Nice to meet you both

113
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,352
I'd have cleaned up

114
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:59,022
If I'd known
you'd be this quick

115
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,989
No, you've done plenty

116
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,835
Lately I've been so busy
in the rice paddies

117
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,301
! only did a bit of dusting

118
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,464
Mei, what have you done
to your hands?

119
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,701
The dustbunny got away

120
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,894
Your feet, foo

121
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,296
Mine are black, too

122
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,260
That must be
the soot spreaders

123
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:34,843
Those little

124
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:39,300
black, fuzzy things that fly?

125
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,181
That's right

126
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,171
They breed in
empty old houses

127
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:48,054
and cover them
with soot and dust

128
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,145
! could see them
when I was little

129
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,289
Now you can too, huh?

130
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,593
Are they like goblins
or something?

131
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:02,535
Naah, nothing so scare

132
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:08,359
If you keep smiling
they'll soon leave the house

133
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,776
They're probably deciding
where to go next, right now

134
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,836
Mei, they're going away

135
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,011
That's no fun

136
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,685
What happens if a huge one
comes out, like this?

137
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,468
! wouldn't be scared

138
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,284
Okay then

139
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,244
! won't walk you to
the bathroom at night

140
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,935
Okay, cleaning time

141
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,479
Could you get some water
from the stream?

142
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:39,725
From the stream?

143
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,141
I'm coming, too

144
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,993
Mei, wait there

145
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,525
Did you get a fish?

146
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,685
Nanny, it's coming out

147
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,914
Good

148
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,497
keep pumping
‘til the water gets cold

149
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,023
Okay

150
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,199
May I help you?

151
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,280
Huh, my Mom for Granny

152
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,437
Yes?

153
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,138
Wait, what is it?

154
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,055
Is that you, Kanta?

155
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:27,752
You live in a haunted house

156
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,081
Kanta, stop it

157
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,468
! did the same kind of thing
when I was his age

158
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,162
! hate boys

159
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,243
But, I really love
Nanny's rice cakes

160
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,201
Eat as much as you want

161
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,283
Thank you

162
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,251
Thank you very much
for your help

163
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,420
Good bye

164
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,238
Dad, the house
is going to fall down

165
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,453
! hope not
we've only just moved in

166
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,744
Come on, let's laugh to
keep the bogeymen away

167
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,793
I'm not scared

168
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,970
1 mean it. I'm not scared

169
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,065
One-two, one-two...

170
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,579
Come on
keep up the good work

171
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,554
Okay, Washing finished

172
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,273
Here we go

173
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,629
Nanny

174
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,499
Hello

175
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,327
Hard at work?

176
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,189
Where're you all heading?

177
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,162
To visit Mommy
in the hospital

178
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,072
That's nice

179
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,535
Give her my regards

180
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:55,996
Okay

181
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,014
This way...

182

Daddy took the wrong road

187

Really?

188
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,299
Hello, Satsuki

189
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,473
It's a school holiday, today

190
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:57,666
How nice

191
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,190
Daddy is talking
to the doctor

192
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,726
It's so good to see you alf

193
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,668
Have you settled into
the new house?

194
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,184
A haunted house?

195
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,106
Mom, do you like ghosts?

196
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,378
Of course, [do

197
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,500
1 can't wait to see them

198
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,008
See, ! told you, Mei

199
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,558
Mei was worried that
you wouldn't like ghosts

200
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,128
What about you two?

201
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,046
Iflove them

202
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:29,793
I'm not scared of them

203
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,791
Are you fixing
Mei's hair, Satsuki?

204
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,842
It's really
good Lucky girl, Mei

205
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,132
But she always
gets mad at me

206
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,101
That's ‘cuz
you wont stay still

207
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,206
Come here, Satsuki

208
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,576
Isn't yours too short?

209
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,268
No, I like it like this

210
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,906
Do mine, Mommy Mine, too

211
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,491
Wait your turn

212
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,759
Wavy hair, just like mine

213
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,277
when I was your age

214
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:02,424
Will it be like yours
when I grow up?

215
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:06,585
Probably
You take after your Mom

216
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,206
Mom looked really well

217
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,435
You're right

218
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,510
The doctor says
she'll be home soon

219
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,646
Soon?
Like tomorrow?

220
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,785
You always say this

221
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,254
Tomorrow is a little too soon

222
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,366
Mom said she'll sleep
with me in my bed

223
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,779
Weren't you saying

224
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,932
you're big enough
to sleep alone?

225
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,987
Mom is special

226
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:09,871
Dad

227
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,346
Time to get up

228
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,065

229
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,262
Sorry, l oversiept again

! totally forgot about it

232
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,129
It's all right

233
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,763
I've made something
for all of us

234
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:33,707
It's burning

235
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,042
Let me do it

236
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,576
Here, this is yours, Mei

237
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,718
It's forme

00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,317
Satsuki

00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:57,827
I'm coming

243
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,035
You made a friend already?

244
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,234
She's calling you

245
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,120
Yup, that's Michiko

246
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:09,791
Gotta go

00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,697

Morning

250
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,753
Hi, let's go

251
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,764
Daddy

252
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,780
Do I look all grown up?

253
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:37,799
Yes, dear

254
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,139
And where might you be going?

255
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,921
I'm just going out

256
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,099
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

257
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,728
Already?

258
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,205
You be the flower shop, Daddy

259
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,014
Pole tads

260
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,889
Got no bottom

261
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,066
Gotcha

262
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:55,481
Who are you?
A big Dustbunny?

263
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,565
To-to-ro?
You're Totoro

264
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,719
! bet you're Totoro

265
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:37,825
Totoro

266
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:46,734
See you

267
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,205
Okay, catch you later

268
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,314
I'm home

269
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,689
Hey there

270
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,034
Is it that late already?

271
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,099
Where's Mei?
I'm off to Michiko's

272
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,748
We haven't eaten yet

273
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,456
Is Mei in the garden?

274
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,841
Mei

275
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,299
Mei

276
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,980
Mei

277
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,361
Mei

278
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:20,015
Dad, I found her hat

279
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,731
Mei...

280
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,240
Wake up, Mei

281
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,887
You shouldnt sleep here

282
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,231
Where's Totoro?

283
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,652
Totoro?

284
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,877
Where?

285
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,209
Were you dreaming?

286
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,104
Totoro was here

287
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,176
You mean that troll
in your picture book?

288
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,422
Yeah

289
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,930
He was all hairy with
a big mouth like this

290
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,869
There's a tiny one
and a little one

291
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,336
and a huge one like this

292
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,007
There you are

293
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,595
This is a great hiding place

294
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,082
Dad, Mei said
she saw a Totoro here

295
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,409
A Totoro?

296
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,307
It's this way

297
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,447
Hey, wait for me

298
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,124
Is it here?

299
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,635
No

300
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,930
It went to a big tree

301
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,073
But there wasn't
any other path

302
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,122
Come back, Mei

303
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,912
Mei, back

304
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,770
But it's true Totoro was here

305
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,454
I'm not lying

306
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,945
1 know, Mei

307
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,650
I didnt lie

308
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:42,093
Neither of us think
you're lying

309
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,680
You probably met
the king of this forest

310
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:48,064
You were very lucky

311
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:51,427
He doesnt come out very often

312
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,521
We should go to the shrine
to pay our respects

313
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:56,577
Pay our respects?

314
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,171
To this forest

315
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,831
Mei, you're getting heavy

316
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,826
Daddy, look
That camphor tree

317
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,315
What a big tree

318
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:31,685
It's here

319
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,060
Is that the tree?

320
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,773
Dad, hurry up

321
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:49,803
The hole has gone

322
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,354
Are you sure it was here?

323
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:54,928
The hole disappeared

324
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,620
! told you he doesnt
come fo see us often

325
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,012
But, will he come again?

326
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,907
1 want to meet him, too

327
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,846
If you're lucky, sure

328
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,086
What a beautiful tree

329
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:12,473
This tree must have stood
here for years and years

330
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,739
Trees and people
used to be good friends

331
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:23,341
! saw that tree and
decided to buy the house

332
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,238
Hope Mom likes it too

333
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,151
Okay, let's pay our respects

334
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:29,663
then get home for lunch

335
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:30,691
Oh yeah

336
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,359
! promised
to go see Michiko

337
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,067
! want to go, too

338
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,709
Attention

339
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:39,984
Thank you for
looking after Mei

340
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,402
Thank you very much

341
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:44,951
Last one home's
a rotten egg

342
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,705
That's not fair, Dad

343
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,634
Wait

344
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,985
Hurry up

345
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,294
Wait for me

346
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:57,694
Dear Mother

347
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,882
Something amazing
happened today

348
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,921
Mei met a giant Totoro

349
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:12,306
And I'm hoping to see
him myself soon, too

350
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,854
Kanta, hurry up
You'll be late

351
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,271
Coming

352
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:30,847
Mei?

353
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:32,618
Excuse me

354
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,054
Yes, Satsuki?

355
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:36,536
It's my sister

356
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,538
What happened, Nanny?

357
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,096
I'm sorry

358
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,298
She insisted that
she be with you

359
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:54,705
It's Dad's day
at the university

360
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:58,213
You promised to be
a good girl at Nanny's

361
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,185
! still have two more classes

362
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,571
and Nanny'’s too busy for this

363
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:09,733
She was good up ‘til now
weren't you?

364
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,499
I'll go talk to my teacher

365
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,614
Since Satsuki's mother
is in the hospital

366
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,269
! want you alf
to be nice to her

367
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:34,877
Yes

368
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,228
What's that?

369
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,633
It's Totoro

370
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,143
Mei, you should keep quiet

371
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:48,342
Okay

372
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,636
Bye bye, Mei

373
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,673
! can't stay after class today

374
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,301
We'll let teacher know

375
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,360
See you

376
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,273
Hurry up, it's going to rain

377
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:11,544
Okay

378
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:20,824
Here it comes

379
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:33,877

380
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,122
! won't cry. Aren't l good?

381
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,950
It's getting worse

382
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:48,602
Dear Guardian Spirit

383
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,693
let us stay
until the rain stops

384
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:35,819
But...

385
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,970
That was lucky

386
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:01,287
It's got holes in it

387
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,461
Daddy forgot his umbrella

388
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,183
I'm going, too

389
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,521
! said I forgot it

390
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,130
What idiot forgets his
umbrella on a rainy day?

391
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,057
Ouch

392
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,286
You broke it playing, I bet

393
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:31,648
1 did not

394
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,396
Excuse me

395
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,883
Hello, Satsuki, Mei

396
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,445
Grandma

397
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,455
I'm sorry about Mei today

398
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,650
Not at all
Sorry we couldn't do more

399
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,799
Kanta lent us this umbrella

400
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,249
He did?

401
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,014
A broken old thing like that

402
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:07,346
Mei was with me, so I was glad

403
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,567
But I'm so sorry
that Kanta got wet

404
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,300
Thank you very much

405
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:12,449
Not at all

406
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:16,267
It probably
cleaned him up a little

407
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,131
Are you off to
meet your father?

408
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:20,626
Yes
What good girls you are

409
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:22,332
Bye bye, Mei

410
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,720
Bye bye

411
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,645
Who was that?

412
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,006
I don't know

413
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:42,876
Just in time

414
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,520
Getting on?

415
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:00,543
All right, drive on

416
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,063
Daddy wasnt on it

417
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,185
He'll be on the next one

418
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,136
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

419
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,962
Are you okay?

420
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:27,389
Mei, sleepy?

421
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:32,023
I told you
Wanna go to Nanny's?

422
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:35,725
It won't be much longer

423
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:36,993
Hang in there

424
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,930
It's late

425
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,220
Come on

426
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:19,042
Are you Totoro?

427
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,690
Wait a minute

428
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:37,714
You can use this

429
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,403
Take it, Mei's slipping off

430
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,308
Hold it like this

431
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:07,503
Here's the bus

432
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,152
He took Daddy's umbrella

433
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,309
I'm sorry

434
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:34,927
All right, drive on

435
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:36,796
The train was late

436
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,567
and I missed the bus

437
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:40,679
Were you worried?

438
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,465
We met him, Dad
He was here

439
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:45,661
And the cat bus

440
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,129
What?

441
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,817
It was huge

442
00:54:49,153 --> 00:54:50,792
With big eyes like these

443
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,525
We met him

444
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:58,067
We met Totoro

445
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,222
How wonderful

446
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,025
Come on, Daddy

447
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:22,111
Dear Mother

448
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,721
I cant tell you
how excited I was today

449
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:26,919
It was the scariest
funniest day

450
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:28,901
I've ever had

451
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:32,159
Totoro gave us
a lovely present

452
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,236
wrapped in bamboo leaves and
tied with dragon whiskers

453
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:39,284
When we opened it

454
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,073
it was full of magic nuts
and seeds

455
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:49,284
We decided to plant them
in the garden

456
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,856
to make a lovely forest

457
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,592
But they haven't sprouted yet

458
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:58,892
Mei sits there all day
waiting for them

459
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:04,058
She looks like a little crab

460
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:11,183
It's nearly summer vacation

461
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,524
Dearest, dear Mom
get well soon

462
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,242
Love, Satsuki

463
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:20,475
Come on. Bed time

464
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:25,919
Lights off

465
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,288
Wait, Dad

466
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,748
Daddy, do you think
they will come out tomorrow?

467
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:34,535
Well, I'm sure
Totoro would know

468
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,355
Good night

469
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,437
Wake up, Mei

470
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:45,750
That's where
we planted the seeds

471
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,198
Wow, we did it

472
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,536
We're the wind

473
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,340
There are no trees

474
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,056
Yes

475
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:55,698
It was a dream...
But it wasn‘ a dream...

476
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:59,313
We did it

477
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,479
Mr. Kusakabe. Telegram

478
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,263
Mr. Kusakabe

479
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,042
Telegram

480
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,579
Anyone home?

481
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,254
Nanny

482
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:42,361
I'm here

483
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:45,933
This one is ripe

484
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:56,862
What about this one?

485
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,283
That's good, too

486
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,464
Your garden's a treasure house

487
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:10,922
Let's take a little break

488
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,773
These should be cold now

489
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,633
Looks delicious

490
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,584
So good

491
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:36,416
The sun blessed these

492
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:38,717
So they're
really good for you

493
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:40,692
Would they help my Mom, too?

494
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:42,221
Of course

495
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:45,769
If she eats my vegetables
she'll get better right away

496
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,696
She's supposed to
be back next Saturday

497
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,439
She'll sleep in my bed

498
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:52,825
At last

499
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:55,346
That's wonderful

500
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:57,379
But it's only
for a couple of days

501
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:59,464
To get used to the new house

502
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,705
I see

503
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,459
We'll feed her
lots of vegetables, then

504
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:09,009
I'll give her this corn
I picked

505
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,509
I'm sure
she'll be very pleased

506
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:13,115
iknow

507
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,919
There was a telegram for you

508
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:24,346
For us?

509
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,741
Dad won't be back till late
what shall 1 do?

510
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,541
Open it
it might be important

511
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:41,201
PLEASE CONTACT, HOSPITAL

512
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:42,861
It's from Mom's hospital

513
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:44,696
Something's happened to her

514
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:50,468
Nanny, What shall ! do?

515
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,904
Calm down

516
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,125
Do you know
where your Dad is?

517
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:57,135
1 know his office number

518
01:04:57,494 --> 01:04:58,574
But we don't have a telephone

519
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:00,882
Kanta
take her to use the phone

520
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,757
in the main house

521
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:10,418
Mei, stay here with me

522
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,220
Stay with Nanny, Mei

523
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:00,406
Hello

524
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,373
I'd like to make a
long distance call, please

525
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:06,736
It's Tokyo 31-1382

526
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,000
Yes

527
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,439
A cute girl, Kanta

528
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,154
Hello?

529
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:17,459
Yes

530
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:23,685
Hello, may I speak to
Dader. Mr. Kusakabe?

531
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:25,944
It's his daughter, Satsuki

532
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,482
Yes

533
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,286
Daddy?
It's me, Satsuki

534
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:33,739
Hello, what's up?

535
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:38,277
From the hospital?

536
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:40,928
Okay
Ill call them right away

537
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,917
Is there anything wrong
with Mom?

538
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,330
Don't worry

539
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:50,022
I'll check up and
call you right back

540
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,272
I'm hanging up now
stay there

541
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:59,786
May I stay here
until he calls back?

542
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,687
Stay as long as you like

543
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,586
Satsuki

544
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,830
No

545
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:24,005
This corn is for my Mommy

546
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:28,131
No, it's my Mom's

547
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:47,928
Listen, Mei
Mom's not well

548
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:51,094
So she's not coming home
this time

549
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:52,681
No

550
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,053
There's nothing we can do

551
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:57,448
You don't want her
to get worse, do you?

552
01:07:57,874 --> 01:07:59,044
No

553
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:02,737
It's just for
a few more days

554
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:04,196
No

555
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,025
So you don't care
if she dies, do you?

556
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,261
No

557
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,613
Stop being silly. I'm going

558
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,309
Let's go, Mei

559
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,721
! hate you, Satsuki

560
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:01,922
We should bring the washing in

561
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:05,716
Don't worry too much, Satsuki

562
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:09,395
Nanny's here to help
so cheer up

563
01:09:14,082 --> 01:09:16,452
Your Dad said
he'll stop by the hospital

564
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:18,559
to check on her

565
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,581
Besides, it's just a cold

566
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:25,341
she'll be back next week

567
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:34,173
They said it was just a cold

568
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:37,531
when she went into hospital

569
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,821
But what if she dies

570
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,169
Dont be silly, Satsuki

571
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,308
Maybe Mom will

572
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:50,911
Stop it

573
01:09:51,386 --> 01:09:55,017
Nobody would leave two
pretty little girls like you

574
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:59,575
There, there
Don't cry

575
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:03,503
I'll be here until
Daddy comes back, okay?

576
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:49,246
Mei

577
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,700
Mei

578
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:00,422
Mei

579
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,170
Did she come back?

580
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,301
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

581
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:10,658
That's strange

582
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,460
Where has she gone?

583
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,472
! was nasty to her

584
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:16,447
‘cause she was being silly

585
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:19,026
Maybe she's heading
for the hospital

586
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:22,345
The hospital?

587
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,068
It would take
a grown up three hours

588
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:26,565
Ill go look

589
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,307
Kanta, hurry

590
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,152
Tell your dad

591
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,858
that Mei is missing

592
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,223
Stupid Mei
Always getting lost

593
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,260
Mei

594
01:12:03,553 --> 01:12:05,363
Excuse me

595
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:09,886
Have you seen
a little girl pass by?

596
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,789
She's my sister

597
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:14,468
No, ! don't think so

598
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:16,891
I'm sure I would've noticed

599
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:19,871
Maybe she wasn't here

600
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,335
Are you sure
she came this way?

601
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:42,864
I don't know

602
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,727
Mei

603
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,774
Please, stop

604
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:20,682
Jerk. What are you doing?

605
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:22,072
I'm looking for my sister

606
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:24,005
Have you seen a little girl?

607
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:25,857
Your little sister?

608
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:27,625
She's four

609
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,900
! think she's heading
to the hospital

610
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:31,446
Did you see anyone?

611
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,931
No. We just came from there

612
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,321
but we didn't see anyone

613
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:40,281
Thanks anyway

614
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,770
Where have you come from?

615
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:43,989
From Matsugo

616
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,623
Really?

617
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:47,475
Good luck

618
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:50,151
See you

619
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,347
Satsuki

620
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,397
Kanta

621
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:09,166
Find her?
No

622
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,615
And you?

623
01:14:11,347 --> 01:14:13,246
Dad and the others
are looking for her

624
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,399
I'll go to the hospital

625
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,305

626
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:18,963
I guess she got lost

627
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,598
on the way to the hospital

628
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:24,668
They found
a sandal by the pond

629
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,244
We're not sure
if it's hers or not

630
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,384
Did you find her?

631
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,967
Dear Lord
please protect her and...

632
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:32,115
It's too deep here
better search further away

633
01:15:32,595 --> 01:15:34,525
Hey, are there any poles left?

634
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:45,149

635
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:51,572

641
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,937
It's not hers

642
01:16:26,282 --> 01:16:27,832
Where's she gone then?

643
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:29,444

649
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:46,217
Totoro

650
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:50,406

652
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,981

They can't see the bus

656
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:52,005
“FOREST-SWAMP"

657
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:54,641
“CEMETERY-SHRINE“

658
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:57,900
"MEI"

659
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:16,823
Mei...

660
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:27,414
The trees are
moving out of the way

661
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:00,594
Mei

662
01:21:04,727 --> 01:21:09,997
Satsuki...

663
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,126
Mei

664
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,923

Thank you so much

671
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:04,275
I'm sorry

672
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:07,803
They didn't need to send
a telegram just for a cold

673
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:10,580
The girls must be worried

674
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:12,635
I'm sorry to upset them

675
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:15,305
They'll be fine

676
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,754
As long as you're okay

677
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,642
We've all learned to cope

678
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:20,781
This'll just postpone
the enjoyment

679
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:25,464
They've put up with it so well

680
01:22:26,008 --> 01:22:27,588
I'm especially sorry
for Satsuki

681
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,673
she's so sensitive

682
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,685
You're right

683
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,126
I'm going to spoil them
for a while

684
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,130
when I come home

685
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:37,565
Oh no

686
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,093
She's laughing

687
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,157
Looks like she's fine

688
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,298
1 can't wait to
get back on my feet

689
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:02,543
Look

690
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:10,013
Where did that come from?

691
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:13,514
What?

692
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,252
! could swear
! just saw Satsuki

693
01:23:15,591 --> 01:23:17,491
and Mei laughing up
in that tree

694
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:21,982
Maybe they were too

695
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:26,021
Look
“For Mother"
