With ten days off,
figured you'd go abroad.

15
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,769
But you're off to Yamagata, right?

16
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,072
Yes,

17
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,263
Broke up with your boyfriend?

18
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,273
I just prefer the countryside.

19
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,655
- See ya!
- Bye!

20
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,140
Let's go play!

21
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,748
Bye now!

22
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,566
Later!

23
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,075
Did you get good grades?

24
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,077
No. but I don't care.

25
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,283
How come?

26
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,268
As soon as get home,
we'ra traveling to Grandma's.

27
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,778
So l won't get yelled at for ages.

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,940
Lucky you!
Are you going away too?

29
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,980
Yeah, to Nagano.
How about you, Taeko?

30
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,222
I'm not sure.

31
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,773
My Dad bought a summer place.

32
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,640
Wow...that's great!

33
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,354
Such a bad grade in math again.

34
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,961
But I got a “B” in science.

35
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,031
Are we going away for the holidays?

36
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,709
Not really.

37
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,325
Take me someplace.

38
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:12,141
I'll take you to a movie.
Find out what's playing.

39
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,453
Not that. mean to the country...

40
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,719
The country?

41
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,010
Like Grandma's country house.

42
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,709
Grandma lives with us.

43
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,081
- Grandpa's then...
- He's dead.

44
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,070
We don't have relatives
in the country, so don't ask.

45
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,142
My family had lived in Tokyo
for generations.

46
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,406
envied friends who had family
in the countryside.

47
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,478
It's too late to book.
All hotels will be full.

48
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,935
But I really want to go...

49
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,384
What about “Onoya”?

50
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,363
We're regulars.
They'd have a room for us.

51
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:54,987
Where's that?

52
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,275
Good idea.
Taeko's never been there.

53
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,825
That's right.

54
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,503
ls it in the mountains...by the sea?

55
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,640
It's in Atami.

56
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:06,946
Atami?

57
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,490
You get to ride the bullet train.

58
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,666
Sure, you'll love it.

59
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,555
Atami...

60
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,220
Lots of different hot springs...

61
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,513
There's a huge Roman Bath.

62
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:28,096
And others, like
the Swan Bath and the Violet Bath.

63
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,482
The beautiful Violet Bath!

64
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:32,888
The Violet Bath...

65
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,163
Oh yes. It's fantastic.

66
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,152
You love hot springs, right?

67
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,327
Since father's working.
you four go.

68
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,209
What?!

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,090
Us?

70
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,615
Go too?!

71
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,900
I'm amazed you show up every morning.

72
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,837
Everyone else has left town.

73
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,438
Aren't you going anywhere?

74
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,304
- Yes, I am.
- Where?

75
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,506
Atami.

76
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,661
Atami? What's in Atami?

77
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,727
Hot springs.

78
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,193
It's good timing.

79
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,998
We're going away next week.

80
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,732
No-one will be around for ages.

81
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,572
Hello, Okajima residence.

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,359
Nanako? It's Taeko.

83
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,753
l leave today. Any message for
your husband's family?

84
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,762
Not really. Just buy them something.

85
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,903
Say it's from us and
lH pay you back,

86
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,369
Don't worry about it. How's Mom?

87
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,226
She's out today.

88
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:58,368
She was mad you turned down
that guy's proposal.

89
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,405
“At 27, that's the best offer
she's going to get!”

90
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,243
It's all she talks about.

91
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,065
She's got a point.
You're not young anymore...

92
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:10,686
Oh, yeah?

93
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,247
Definitely.

94
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,649
You've got to settle down eventually.

95
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,991
By the way, did you really work
in the fields last year?

96
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,866
Yes, harvesting rice.
This year, I'm picking safflower.

97
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,316
Safflower?

98
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,091
Thanks to you, I finally have family
in the countryside.

99
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,741
So, I'm making the most of it!

100
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,039
Give me a break!

101
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,685
Rather than stay in that old house,

102
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,709
why not treat yourself
to a fancy hotel for once?

103
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,143
Maybe you'd meet a nice boy.

104
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,589
No way. You mean
a hotel like “Onoya”?

105
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,473
“Onoya”?

106
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,623
Not that again!

107
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,853
You've got to get over it.

108
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,942
Let go of that baggage from the past!

109
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,145
My sisters, of course, would never
go to a place like Atami.

110
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,390
Grandma...

111
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,354
Almost done?

112
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,121
Let's go to another bath.

113
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,556
We just went.

114
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,259
Only to the Swan Bath.

115
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,590
Bored to tears, went alone
to the Brothers Grimm Bath

116
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,175
the Mermaid Bath, the Lemon Bath,

117
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,558
and the Violet Bath,
one after the other.

118
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,844
It's enormous!

119
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,707
When I got to the Roman Bath,
my head was spinning.

120
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,578
It's amazing...

121
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,341
And ! fainted.

122
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,790
And with that, my trip was over.

123
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,533
Followed by endless weeks of vacation.

124
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:33,028
The other day, my sisters and
were remmscing,

125
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,121
We couldn't stop laughing

126
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,661
as the memories came flooding back.

127
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,013
Had one before?

128
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,751
No, it’s my first time.

129
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,887
I'm the one who asked for it.

130
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,278
Yeah, we know.

131
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,523
Where did you buy it?

132
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,102
Senbikiya in Ginza.

133
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,660
Must have been expensive.

134
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,830
How do we eat it?

135
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,222
Slice it into rings.

136
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,766
But how?

137
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,206
I don't know.

138
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:12,396
Didn't you ask in the store?

139
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,536
We'll eat it next Sunday.

140
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,003
Why not now?!

141
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,712
We don’t know how.

142
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,407
I'll have a banana.

143
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,165
Me too.

144
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:38,651
Strange fruit they have
in those hot countries.

145
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,308
I'm home!

146
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,580
I know how to eat the pineapple!

147
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,059
Really?

148
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,221
I'll take that.

149
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,266
Mind your fingers.

150
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,548
Wouldn't a carving knife be best?

151
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,760
What a nice smell.

152
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,068
It smells so good.

153
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,023
I see.

154
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,571
Get plates. Quick.

155
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,854
Okay.

156
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,044
Let us eat.

157
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,473
It's hard.

158
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,516
It's not very good.

159
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,202
Not so sweet.

160
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,310
Nothing like the canned stuff.

161
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,039
Live long enough and you see
lots of different things.

162
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,861
- You can have mine.
- Mine too.

163
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,359
It's delicious...

164
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,071
Don't force yourself.

165
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,853
You'll get a stomachache.

166
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,857
What a let down.

167
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,863
Bananas taste much better.

168
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,319
You're so right.

169
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,323
Bananas are still the king of fruits.

170
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,920
I'll have one now.

171
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,809
The king of fruit is...

172
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,652
the banana, after all.

173
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:07,276
The year I fainted at the baths and
had my first pineapple...

174
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:12,131
the Beatles came to Japan,
Started the rock'n'roll band

175
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,279
and electric guitar craze.

176
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,358
My sister Nanako, a freshman in
art school, was up on all the trends.

177
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,814
Yeah, the Beatles’ lyrics are great.

178
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:33,976
When she wore a mini-skirt, she'd
cover her bottom going up the stairs.

179
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,640
My clever sister, Yaeko, was crazy
about some Takarazuka actress.

180
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,593
Yaeko...

181
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,582
I told you to knock!

182
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:56,818
My sisters' memories are
mainly of fashion and pop trends.

183
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,230
For them, 1966 is the
height of nostalgia.

184
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,336
Whereas ! was only ten years old.

185
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,089
My favorite band had yet to debut...

186
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,721
My only memories are the back and
forth between school and home.

187
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,119
...fiine was pinned on the wall!

188
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,358
That's nice.

189
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,623
And it might be entered in
an essay contest.

190
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,478
So, teacher kept it.

191
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,257
- I'd be so happy...
- You didn't finish lunch again.

192
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,558
Why do you hide the pickles
inside the bread?

193
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,611
‘Cause I hate them.

194
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:40,103
I've got to throw it away.
What a waste.

195
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,887
Such a picky eater!

196
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,370
I'd rather you were a good eater
than a good essay writer.

197
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,432
How can you drink that stuff?

198
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,840
Milk's okay. It's onions I hate.

199
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,635
I'm leaving carrots
so I've got no choice.

200
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:23,962
Who decided we can only
leave one thing?

201
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,614
Shall 1 drink it?

202
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,938
Would you?

203
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,057
You'll eat my onions next time?

204
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,895
- Carrots?
- We're allowed one thing!

205
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,194
Two bowls is gross.

206
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,546
People who run in the corridor...

207
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,439
...when the hall monitor says
stop, should be punished.

208
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,221
How are you gonna do that?

209
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,341
They shouldn't do it.

210
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,733
That's right.

211
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,708
You might bump into someone.

212
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,849
If ! bumped into you
I'd bounce a mile!

213
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,468
Get lost!

214
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,851
Running is no big deal.

215
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,243
l agree!

216
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,575
- Let's change the rule.
- But we already decided.

217
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,472
Raise your hand if you want to speak.

218
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,038
- Here!
- Miss Tani.

219
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,365
The hall monitor
should chase the offender,

220
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,152
catch them and punish them.

221
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,166
Mr. Suzuki.

222
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,786
Then the hall monitor should
be punished for running too.

223
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,603
He's right! He's right!

224
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,555
Way to go!

225
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:54,796
He's right.

226
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,824
Miss Tani.

227
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,820
The hall monitor shouldn't
be punished because...

228
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:07,455
.. it's like a policeman
chasing a speeding car.

229
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,233
Any objections?

230
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,934
It makes sense...

231
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,759
No more running.

232
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:27,228
So, the hall monitor
can chase offenders.

233
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,306
Any other issues?

234
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,948
Miss Tani.

235
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,127
- Her again.
- Busybody.

236
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,592
Be quiet.

237
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,966
Some people don't finish lunch.

238
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,892
I just read an article
on the Vietnam War.

239
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,988
There are many
unfortunate people overseas.

240
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,905
We're very lucky.

241
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,873
Lucky to have you near me!

242
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,329
We should be grateful for our food.

243
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:04,095
We're allowed to leave
one thing on our plates,

244
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,411
but I think it's wrong!

245
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,618
Goody two-shoes.

246
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,311
- It can't hurt to leave one thing.
- Let's all leave milk...

247
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,743
- Give it to someone else...
- Of course.

248
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,831
- People hide leftovers in bread.
- That's cheating!

249
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,237
I hate school food.

250
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,979
If you want to speak,
raise your hand!

251
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,232
What a revolting situation.

252
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,911
That night in bed,
after chatting to my sisters

253
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,740
more memories from fifth grade

254
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,296
came rushing back.

255
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:54,862
Our pet dog...school sports day...

256
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,548
being scared by gross
horror comics...

257
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,579
longing for an electric
pencil-sharpener...

258
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:08,246
So many little details,
one after the other...

259
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,725
playing in my head like a movie,

260
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,949
almost overpowering me.

261
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,899
Is there a Miss Okajima here?

262
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:25,633
That's her.

263
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,649
Hirota in our class
says he likes you.

264
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:46,908
Let's go.

265
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,576
We'll say we told you.

266
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,167
Told you.

267
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,671
Where is it?

268
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,836
Over there.

269
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,531
Shuji Hirota and Taeko Okajima

270
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,418
It's true!

271
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,020
What's he like?

272
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,775
- No idea.
- Me, neither.

273
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,271
Taeko, you sure you don't know him?

274
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,053
No...of course not...not at all.

275
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,324
Which one is Hirota?

276
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:28,787
It's the girls from Room 5.

277
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,868
Hirota, they're looking for you.

278
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,370
I'm here!

279
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,862
Don't write silly things on the wall.

280
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,552
Taeko told us to tell you.

281
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,684
I didn't write anything.

282
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,293
You said you liked
Okajima in Room 5.

283
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:48,956
You did.

284
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,554
So, we wrote it for you.

285
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,571
! love you so much...

286
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,428
But you're so far away...

287
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,072
Like gazing up at...

288
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,541
Goodbye.

289
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,636
A far distant star.

290
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,678
Taeko!

291
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,562
We just went to see Hirota.

292
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,379
We told him not to
write things on walls,

293
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,192
Tsuneko!

294
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,760
Ah, no running.

295
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,359
Aren't you glad?

296
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,555
5th Grade. Room 4

297
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,331
Over here.

298
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:54,404
See? That's him.

299
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:04,458
What? Hirota likes Taeko?

300
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,051
He's amazing. A real star.

301
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,103
You mean baseball?

302
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,479
Only Tono can hit his pitches.

303
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,915
Really?

304
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,838
Our team plays his
in the next game.

305
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,658
Go, go, Hirota!

306
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,257
Go for it, Tono!

307
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,436
Hit it, Tono!

308
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,398
Kill it!

309
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,598
Go for it, Hirota!

310
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,539
Taeko's watching you!

311
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,657
Hit it, Tono!

312
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,939
Way to go, Hirota!

313
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,905
Strike him out!

314
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,154
Don't you dare cheer their side!

315
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,403
Of course not!

316
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,135
Go, go, Tono!

317
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,102
Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!

318
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,531
Hit it!

319
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:41,883
One leg stance!

320
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,411
Wow!

321
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,496
Way to go, Hirota!

322
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,294
knew nothing about baseball.

323
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,148
But even could tell he was superb.

324
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,196
Go, go, Hirota!

325
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,548
What's up, Taeko?

326
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:33,444
Between the cold and the excitement.
! ran to the bathroom five times.

327
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,649
Over here, over here!

328
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,246
Game!

329
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,998
Room 4 wins.

330
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,808
Thank you for the game.

331
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,022
You were great Hirota!

332
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,216
Good job.

333
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,131
You were amazing!

334
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,433
It was all your fault.

335
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:00,695
How come?

336
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,193
You don't know anything.

337
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,741
If Tono couldn't hit him,
how could we?

338
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,228
That's right.

339
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,649
You missed the throw and
three runs scored.

340
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,857
That's not true.

341
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,880
Coach said he'd buy us ice cream.

342
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,836
- Really?
- Great!

343
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,305
Hirota, you should go see her.

344
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,181
Yeah, you should.

345
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,470
I'm going home.

346
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,986
What's the matter, Taeko?

347
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,738
Look, she left.

348
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,625
Un...

349
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,041
...that stuff...

350
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,374
...on the wall...

351
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,306
Rainy day or...

352
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,585
cloudy or sunny day...

353
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,664
which do you like?

354
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:09,364
Cloudy.

355
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,622
Me too!

356
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:56,047
Rainy day or cloudy or sunny day.

357
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,915
Which do you like?

358
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,803
Me, too.

359
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:27,029
! didn't intend the ten year-old me
to come on this trip.

360
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,791
But somehow, once she showed up

361
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,137
she wouldn't leave me alone.

362
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:08,527
But why me in the &th grade?

363
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,830
Second hour, all boys play baseball,
all girls to the gym.

364
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,248
How come?

365
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,759
Baseball, great!

366
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:34,115
Today I'm going to talk about
something very important.

367
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:43,562
You'll leave grade school.
then junior school then high school.

368
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:47,496
Then become grown ups and have babies.

369
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,523
A woman's body prepares
to have babies.

370
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,718
Did you know?

371
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,827
Really?

372
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,450
Mom told me
when I was in fourth grade,

373
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,663
since I'm an early-developer.

374
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,791
Early-developer?

375
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,081
That's right.

376
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:16,573
She said tall girls or big girls
get their periods early.

377
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,188
l bet those other girls

378
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,421
already have theirs.

379
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,344
- Are you gonna buy them?
- lam.

380
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,735
I knew it.

381
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,907
You'll buy them, too, right?

382
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,499
Well... yeah.

383
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,002
I think you should.

384
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:43,591
Nurse said
we all need them eventually.

385
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,469
That's true.

386
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,677
The girls are buying underpants
in the infirmary.

387
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,477
Did you know?

388
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:08,728
No.

389
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,690
But why?

390
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,997
How come you're buying underpants?

391
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,480
It's because...

392
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:17,762
Umm...

393
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,879
Why is the school selling underpants?

394
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,574
Are they for swimming?

395
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,953
You told Nakayama?

396
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,029
Why did you do that!?

397
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,927
You shouldn't tell boys.

398
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,649
It's supposed to be our secret.

399
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,580
It's because she likes him...

400
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,613
Did he ask you?

401
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,551
What's going on?

402
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,669
She told Nakayama about periods.

403
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,802
No!

404
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,878
He'll tell everyone.

405
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,511
l said to keep it secret.

406
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,089
You trust him?

407
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,818
- Oh no...
- Boys are disgusting.

408
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,415
Now they'll be looking up our skirts.

409
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:17,755
Pervert!

410
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:23,046
Looking up skirts was all the rage
and periods became an obsession.

411
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,972
You got your period!

412
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,302
Cut it out!

413
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,422
Second period break.

414
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,537
Idiot.

415
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,705
Ouch.

416
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:35,795
Come here!

417
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,556
You've got a period.

418
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,248
No, I don't!

419
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,440
It's all Rie’s fault.

420
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,081
I'm sorry.

421
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,349
What for?

422
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,737
For telling Nakayama.

423
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,423
It doesn't matter.

424
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,468
The nurse said it's very important.

425
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,956
I know.

426
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,985
I started when I was in fourth grade.

427
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,491
Really?

428
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:11,854
That's why I skip P.E. sometimes.

429
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,630
You skip P.E. with a period?

430
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,710
Mom said I should.

431
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:23,337
He even said he falt sorry for us.

432
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,262
You told him about skipping P.E.?

433
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:31,163
He promised not to tell the others.

434
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,072
So, then they'll think

435
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,192
all girls who skip P.E. have periods!

436
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,830
You think so?

437
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:38,976
Of course!

438
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:46,201
Please excuse Taeko from P.E.
because of her cold.

439
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,659
I'm not missing P.E.

440
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,299
Your cold will get worse.

441
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,382
Then I'll stay home.

442
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,408
No. You don't have a fever.

443
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,110
Then I'll do P.E.

444
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,770
Fine, go ahead.

445
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,627
Don't blame me if it gets worse.

446
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,180
See you later.

447
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:17,366
Since when was she so fond of P.E.?

448
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,892
You're bright red.

449
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,551
She's right.

450
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,056
Are you okay?

451
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,201
Il have a cold.

452
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:31,902
You have a fever.

453
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,243
You should skip P.E.

454
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,838
Yeah, you should.

455
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,562
I'll go tall the teacher.

456
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:37,962
No, don't.

457
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,283
Why not?

458
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,815
Mom already wrote a note.

459
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,904
There's no problem then.

460
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,281
Out of the way!

461
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:51,282
Ouch!

462
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,561
I'm missing P.E. too.
Just like you.

463
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,792
Lucky them.

464
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:12,008
I wish I could play, too.

465
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,201
Do you...

466
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,018
...are you having a period?

467
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,641
Yes,

468
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,660
I'm not. [have a cold.

469
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,453
I know, You're sick.

470
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,289
Just sick. That's all.

471
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,439
A period isn't a sickness.

472
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,490
I could still play...

473
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,613
I'm gonna catch a period!

474
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,230
Don't touch it, don't touch it!

475
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,345
That was close.
Almost caught it...

476
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,045
Over here, over here!

477
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,768
“Catch a period”!

478
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,158
What a silly thing to say.

479
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,678
It's no laughing matter!

480
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,696
Taeko?

481
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,702
It's the period pair!

482
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,183
No, we're not!

483
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,305
Stupid boys.

484
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,052
You're so calm about it.

485
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,968
Mom said it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

486
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,964
I guess so, but...

487
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:59,484
Like it or not,
a butterfly must first...

488
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,716
live as a eaterpillar
before it can fly away.

489
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,401
Maybe remember those days because

490
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,462
l was going through the
caterpillar stage.

491
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:30,638
Something definitely changed
when started working.

492
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:37,997
At work and at play we girls were
livelier and more spirited than guys.

493
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,241
It was like
we'd finally found our wings.

494
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,665
But looking back now,

495
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:50,431
maybe we were just
flexing them pointlessly.

496
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,957
Perhaps the fifth grade me
was tagging along

497
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,325
with a message for me to reflect

498
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,767
and rethink my life.

499
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:15,966
Anyway, I decided to sleep
the rest of the way.

500
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,664
Ouch!

501
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,592
Excuse me,
has the Tokyo train gone?

502
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,768
Was that your train?

503
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,013
No...

504
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,591
Taeko Okajima, right?

505
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:31,978
Yas, that’s correct...

506
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,910
Thank goodness.

507
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,598
The car's this way.

508
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,410
Excuse me, but who are you?

509
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,653
You don't remember?

510
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,409
Of course you don't.

511
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,540
I'm Toshio. Kazuo's second cousin.

512
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,267
Oh, I see...

513
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,553
What's so funny?

514
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,565
Nothing. Sorry.

515
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,508
I thought you were trying
to steal my bag.

516
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:17,191
That's terrible.
Didn't 1 ask your name?

517
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:21,829
Yes, you did.
I just thought...sorry...

518
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,962
l beg your pardon.

519
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,487
No problem.

520
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,071
Where's Kazuo?

521
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,460
He asked me last night
to come pick you up

522
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,199
It's been raining?

523
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,864
Yeah, but it'll clear today.

524
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,224
should've used my Dad's car

525
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,439
but I like mine better.

526
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,917
It's a little tight.

527
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,096
May I leave it on?

528
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,768
Sure,

529
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,612
This is unusual music.

530
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:50,424
It's a Hungarian group.

531
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:53,052
Hungarian?

532
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,792
You know a lot about it?

533
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,174
A little. It's farmer's music.

534
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,033
l like it because I'm a farmer.

535
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:02,352
Cool.

536
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,284
Right?

537
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:31,298
Remember last year's party
at the farmhouse?

538
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:37,175
A bunch of guys
turned up, right?

539
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,491
Maybe you don't remember.

540
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:45,301
They came to check out
the girl from Tokyo.

541
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:47,787
I was one of them.

542
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,444
Watch out, jerk!

543
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,440
l heard you're picking safflower.
Do you dye fabric?

544
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,432
Just curious.

545
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:15,648
Safflower's kind of unusual.
Well, maybe not for you.

546
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,430
It's known as a famous
local product but

547
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:24,267
hardly anyone grows it.

548
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:28,772
- Wasn't it big in the old days?
- For the merchants, sure.

549
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:33,817
They got rich, but for farmers,
it was just another crop.

550
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,720
Do you know: In time whose skin
will it grace, this crimson flower.

551
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:46,150
The famous Basho poem?
l read it before coming.

552
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,154
Is that so?

553
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,270
I only learned it last night.

554
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,335
l also read that the flower-pickers

555
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:02,759
couldn't afford to wear
the rouge they made.

556
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,650
Is that where you had the barbeque?

557
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:17,806
There'll be another this year, too.

558
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:33,194
Are market reforms making
agriculture difficult?

559
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,441
Absolutely.

560
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,546
As things go, Japanese farming
might just collapse,

561
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,056
all of sudden, one day.

562
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:43,543
But then again,

563
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:48,528
anything worth struggling for
will be hard work.

564
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,470
Isn't it the same in the city?

565
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,046
Yes,

566
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:56,991
But fewer people live for their work.

567
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,069
What about you?

568
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,312
Me?

569
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:09,098
I don't live for my job
but I don’t hate it either.

570
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,476
l could farm twenty-four hours a day.

571
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:18,026
It's fascinating
to raise living things.

572
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,227
You have livestock?

573
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:28,625
Not that. We've got some animals,

574
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:33,153
but I'm talking about rice. apples,
cherries. They're all living things.

575
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,789
lf we take good care of them,

576
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:41,489
I feel like
they'll do their best for us.

577
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,499
Listen to me preach.

578
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,132
Not at all. 1 get what you mean,

579
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,801
To tell the truth. ] used to
work in an office.

580
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:58,446
l only just started farming.

581
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,666
Is that right?

582
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:07,027
That's why I'm so enthusiastic.
It's very important.

583
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:12,316
I quit work and joined
my friend's organic farm.

584
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,962
People said I'm nuts,
but I! don’t regret it.

585
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,701
Organic farm?

586
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:24,555
“Grown with no
artificial chemicals whatsoever.”

587
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,970
Just blood, sweat and tears!

588
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,613
We use all natural stuff,
no pesticides or anything.

589
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:38,325
I've seen the labels:
“No chemicals used”

590
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,666
But it's not just that.

591
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:45,146
We bring out the plant's life force.

592
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:49,823
It's cool...
like landing nature a hand.

593
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:55,697
Sounds easy, but it's damn hard work.

594
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,174
l was told to take you straight
to the fields.

595
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,367
Yas, I'm starting right away.

596
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,939
Not going to rest?

597
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:15,695
Don't you pick the flowers early
while the thorns are still soft?

598
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,703
That's right, but...

599
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,955
I'm trying to become an early-riser.

600
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,212
That's why I took the night train.

601
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,035
You're certainly eager.

602
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,339
There it is!

603
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:56,485
‘Morning, everyone!

604
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,033
Great to have you back, Taeko.

605
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,015
Thanks for having me.

606
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:15,316
Grandma, you're looking well.

607
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,033
Welcome back dear.

608
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,375
Aren't you tired?

609
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,767
No, not at all.

610
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,879
We made your bed just in case.

611
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,139
That's okay. Look, I'm raring to go!

612
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:32,286
Wearing work pants too!

613
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,371
That's all! brought.

614
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:41,327
Young people here don’t wear
them any more.

615
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,042
You look like the real thing Taeko.

616
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,483
That's right.

617
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:11,821
Taeko!

618
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:14,941
Don't!

619
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:24,158
And so began my second
taste of country life.

620
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:38,758
How could this yellow flower produce
such a bright red?

621
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,117
They told me a sad tale
from the old days.

622
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,668
The girls didn't have gloves,

623
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:52,128
and their bare hands
would get pricked by the thorns.

624
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:56,737
It was their blood that
made the red so deep.

625
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:01,039
! could imagine the resentment

626
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:06,612
they must've felt
toward the fancy city girls.

627
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,929
To make a handful of rouge took
nearly 500 lbs of petals.

628
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:18,953
This rouge was literally worth
its weight in gold.

629
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:50,910
The petals are washed, trodden,
then exposed to the air and the sun.

630
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:55,228
As the petals oxidize,
they gradually turn red.

631
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,706
After a faw more days,

632
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:04,698
fermentation turns them bright red
and they become sticky.

633
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:12,031
Pounded, wrung into balls
and sun-dried, they finally become

634
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:17,098
the basic ingredient of rouge.

635
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:25,813
The liquid from the pressing
wasn't wasted either.

636
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,093
The red pigment in tha yellow broth

637
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:32,586
was used to dye fabric.

638
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,413
Let's go dye our cloth.

639
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,689
Safflower do your best.

640
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,388
Cheer me up with
your pretty color.

641
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:44,648
For those village girls,
with no chance of make-up or kimonos,

642
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:49,089
Safflower dye brought color
into their drab lives.

643
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:58,283
The yellow pigment dissolves in water
leaving clothes a light pink.

644
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,779
So pretty!

645
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:07,013
Machines now take away
some of the work,

646
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:11,971
but the petal's still need
bicking every day.

647
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,710
Rouge cakes soon mould,
and the flowers wait for no one.

648
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:49,975
No sooner are you done picking,
than they bloom again.

649
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:58,477
When the rains come,
work continues into the early hours.

650
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,728
Each day flew by,

651
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:09,141
Pleasantly tired, 1 thought about
the flower-pickers of old.

652
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,922
If l could've worked
like this as a child,

653
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:20,082
my school essays would've been
really interesting.

654
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,253
Mom, I need 5,000 yen.

655
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,812
5,000 yen? ! can't give you that.

656
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,361
You said you'd buy me new sneakers.

657
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,862
Are they that much?

658
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:48,928
Nonsense.

659
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,159
They're Pumas.

660
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,018
- Pumas?
- It's a brand.

661
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:59,598
I'm not sure.
There must be cheaper ones.

662
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:02,064
How about the ones you've got?

663
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,558
Nobody wears them now.

664
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,748
Everyone's getting Pumas.

665
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:09,275
Who's everyone?

666
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:13,096
Kako, Megu, Yachan, Nonchan.

667
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,507
That's only four people.

668
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:18,903
Everyone's wearing them!

669
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:22,502
No. You never do your chores.

670
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,940
Did you ask for a dress for
your Barbie Doll?

671
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,089
Didn't you promise to ask only at
Christmas and your birthday?

672
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,000
You always spoil her.

673
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,015
Is that right, Taeko?

674
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:41,802
All of a sudden,
the ten year-old me was back.

675
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,199
But...

676
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,942
Yaeko got a kimono and
it wasn't even her graduation.

677
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:50,966
It's for tea-ceremony.

678
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,424
You keep asking for
lots of little stuff,

679
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,192
we get one or two big things.

680
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,311
Right?

681
00:57:58,508 --> 00:57:59,587
Yep.

682
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,743
Stop that.

683
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,813
Always picky about food.

684
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,960
Dad loves the onions, right?

685
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:18,234
Anyway. that kimono will be
yours in the end.

686
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:20,808
Always hand-me-downs.

687
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:24,350
- Some people don't get anything.
- Exactly.

688
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,560
Then give me that enamel purse.

689
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:29,378
Didn't you give it to her yet?

690
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:33,392
You're too old for that.
Give it to her.

691
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:42,865
I don’t want it.

692
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,057
Keep the stupid purse.

693
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:50,869
Then ] won't give it to you.

694
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,308
I'm not buying you a new one.

695
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,393
Fine.

696
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:58,562
Good, I actually really like it.

697
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,799
I hate it.

698
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,888
Ready for dinner. Take this away.

699
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,518
See, has to be thrown away.

700
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,644
What a waste.

701
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,364
Don't throw it away! Please Mother.

702
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:17,863
It's your fault.

703
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,788
Finish it yourself next time.

704
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:25,046
You three are so selfish.

705
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,899
Father, buy me an enamel purse.

706
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,746
Yaeko won't give me hers.

707
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:47,826
You said you didn't want it.

708
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,609
Yeah, but...

709
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,262
You said it, you have to do it.

710
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,232
Hurry up and get ready.

711
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,484
I'll wear these!

712
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:14,788
Why is Yaeko coming?

713
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:20,569
You said it was just the three of us.

714
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,858
Because ! finished my homework.
Is that a problem?

715
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,647
It's Chinese food.
The more the merrier.

716
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,589
Grandma's not coming.

717
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,399
She doesn't eat oily food.

718
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,172
If you don't want to come, stay here.

719
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,673
We're going Taeko.

720
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,620
Come on slowpoke.

721
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:13,785
I don't have a purse.

722
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,738
Lend her that enamel one.

723
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:44,830
Here.

724
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:47,596
Ouch.

725
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,668
Let's go.

726
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,377
I'm not going.

727
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,071
Okay. Let's go Mother.

728
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,954
Stay with Grandma then.

729
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:05,497
Not coming Taeko?

730
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,273
No I'm not.

731
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:26,682
We're off then.

732
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:37,953
I'm coming too!

733
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,301
No shoes!

734
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,024
Father please.

735
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,941
A button came off.

736
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:40,862
We didn't go out, of course.

737
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,357
My face was swollen and a cold towel

738
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,833
didn't stop the stinging.

739
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,986
That night I couldn't sleep

740
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:51,915
wondering why it was always me.

741
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:54,502
Figuring I must've been adopted

742
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,511
l cried myself to sleep.

743
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:01,408
Was it the first time he hit you?

744
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:05,005
Yes, the first and only time.

745
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:11,213
Dad slaps me often...well, sometimes.

746
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,540
Maybe that's easier.

747
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:18,328
When it’s only once,
you can't stop thinking why.

748
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:23,566
It's hard to imagine you
a selfish brat.

749
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:26,971
A spoiled brat.

750
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:29,843
I wasn't just fussy about
onions, either.

751
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:34,775
Now ] don’t feel like I'm that bad.

752
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,941
Wait a second!

753
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:41,493
Your poor Mom.
l shouldn't encourage you.

754
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,665
I'm giving up on the Pumas.

755
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:52,227
Good girl.

756
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:56,292
Maybe I'll slip you some pocket money.

757
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,033
Hooray!

758
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:21,567
Hey!

759
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,193
100 yen each.

760
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:32,560
Taeko...

761
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,842
Tomorrow...

762
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:37,284
Let's go for a drive to Zao.

763
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:39,521
- Zao?
- Yes.

764
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:42,537
You went to Yamadera
last year, right?

765
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,752
The family said it was okay.

766
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,748
The views at Zao were beautiful.

767
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:18,214
But Zao had become famous
and touristy.

768
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,730
How come you're not married?

769
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:29,774
Do you find that strange?

770
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,657
Well, no, not really.

771
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,719
Lots of women work now.

772
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,229
Most of my friends are single.

773
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:41,413
Oh, is that right?

774
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:42,931
That's right.

775
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,536
I see.

776
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,064
It's true.

777
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,003
Right.

778
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,241
Really. It's very common.

779
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,273
Toshio?

780
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:01,928
In elementary school, could you
do fractions?

781
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:08,531
When they said reverse the numerator
and denominator, could you do it?

782
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,682
I don't remember.

783
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:14,892
l wasn’t bad at math though.

784
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,564
I see.

785
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,020
Lucky you.

786
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:21,048
l bet you don't remember
‘cause it was easy.

787
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:24,198
Maybe. Why do you ask?

788
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,491
It seams that people who could do it

789
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:30,221
went on to have easy lives.

790
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:36,915
One girl. completely average
...not even good at math,

791
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:40,724
always could do it perfect right away.

792
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,871
She grew up really normal

793
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,087
and now has two kids.

794
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,586
l was no good at it.

795
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:55,879
Not smart enough to know when to quit.

796
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:04,307
Room §, Taeko Okajima, 25 points

797
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:15,482
Before the test...

798
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:21,078
...we had art class.

799
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:26,221
And...um..,we did blow pictures.

800
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,260
Blow pictures?

801
01:08:29,404 --> 01:08:32,865
Yes. We drop paint on the paper...

802
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,163
and blow patterns in it.

803
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:40,005
And?

804
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:45,048
You blow like this,
really hard, right?

805
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,262
Yes?

806
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:52,690
So, I got a headache.
From blowing so hard.

807
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:55,652
That's why you did so badly?

808
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,425
That's right.

809
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:01,326
I see.

810
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:09,553
Do you know the answers now?

811
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,260
The correct answers?

812
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:14,766
Well...

813
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:17,765
Have Yaeko help you with them.

814
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,653
Yaeko?!

815
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:21,193
That's right.

816
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:23,908
Or Nanako, whichever.

817
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:29,050
I'll ask Nanako.

818
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:54,686
Nanako's not back yet.
Can I wait ‘til after dinner?

819
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:06,837
I'll ask Yaeko...

820
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,385
Mother!

821
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,025
Mother! Mother!

822
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:31,763
What is this?!

823
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:33,832
How on earth...?

824
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:37,607
Please teach her.
She doesn't seem to get it.

825
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:42,799
But this is beyond belief!

826
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:44,766
That's why I'm asking you...

827
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,744
ls she alright in the head?

828
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,856
Just help her.

829
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,925
Normally this is easy.

830
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,055
But that child's not normal!

831
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,551
Taeko, your sister's going to help.

832
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:18,490
You had a headache from blowing,
didn't you?

833
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,554
Sit.

834
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,364
Say your times table from the top.

835
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,530
I know that.
I'm in fifth grade already!

836
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,020
Then why so many mistakes?!

837
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,740
It's dividing fractions.

838
01:11:46,369 --> 01:11:50,589
dust flip the top
and the bottom and multiply.

839
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:53,444
They taught you that, right?

840
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,258
Then why do you get it wrong?

841
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,530
Yaeko, one step at a time.

842
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,104
What's dividing a fraction
by a fraction anyway?

843
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:18,970
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter means...

844
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,239
how would this divide

845
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,910
between four people, right?

846
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:34,232
So, it's one. two, three,
four, five, six...

847
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:36,854
one-sixth each, right?

848
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:41,745
No, no, no, no. That's multiplication.

849
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:45,451
How come it's lass when you multiply?

850
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,795
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter...

851
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:54,940
Anyway!

852
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:58,818
Forget about apples...

853
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:03,157
just remember to inverse and multiply.

854
01:13:12,288 --> 01:13:14,128
Is her sister in Takarazuka?

855
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,420
No, $.K.D.

856
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:19,632
- She got “D” in math.
-“D"?

857
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,882
Yes, and just barely.

858
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,868
If she got half right.
it'd be worth scolding her.

859
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,925
Right.

860
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:34,467
Should you get her 1Q checked?

861
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:37,381
They said it was fine
when she started.

862
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:39,273
Maybe she turned dumb?

863
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:42,042
Remember she fell downstairs
as a baby?

864
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:44,884
Right, in her walker!

865
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,124
l thought she was dead.

866
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,156
It was just a bump.

867
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:50,782
It's affecting her now.

868
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,520
That's it!

869
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,299
Nonsense.
She's just no good at math.

870
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,304
She chats too much in class.

871
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,750
If she'd just listen:
even an idiot can do it.

872
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:09,188
it's only two more years
until Junior High.

873
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:13,092
Two-thirds of this apple,

874
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:18,129
divided by a quarter...
Il can't aven picture it.

875
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,891
Two-thirds of this,

876
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,420
into a quarter makes it...

877
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:36,220
Even now. dividing fractions
is difficult.

878
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:46,254
We farmers give up too easily.

879
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:51,526
We just yield to the flow and
follow what they do in the cities.

880
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:54,804
Let's rethink the real
meaning of prosperity.

881
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,767
Return to the old ways of farming.

882
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:01,929
Wow...

883
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:06,723
So, that explains the organic farming?

884
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,696
I'm just quoting my friend.

885
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,719
But I agree with it.

886
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,100
It's great the way you hold onto
your memories of math class.

887
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:25,715
It wasn't meant to impress you.

888
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:31,014
People say you work
in a great place

889
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,416
but I could never give myself
up to it completely.

890
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:40,497
I really admire
your devotion to farming.

891
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,119
You're being sarcastic?

892
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:47,995
Of course not!

893
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,597
There aren't many people like you.

894
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,597
Farming's in total decline, right?

895
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:02,117
So we can’t just carry on as normal.

896
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:05,155
We've got to think about the future.

897
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:09,704
We help each other out,
cheer one another along,

898
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:12,386
otherwise we can't keep it up.

899
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:20,010
Taeko do you ski?

900
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,979
I've been with friends a few times.

901
01:16:24,547 --> 01:16:28,116
Come next winter. I'll teach you.

902
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,677
Are you good?

903
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:35,173
No, but I'm an instructor there.

904
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,701
An instructor? You must be great.

905
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:42,198
All my friends are too. It's nothing.

906
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:10,538
At last. we're in the
middle of nowhere.

907
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,025
“Nowhere” huh?

908
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:17,013
Sorry. 1 didn't mean it like that.

909
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,080
Interesting point though.

910
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:25,680
City people see the trees and rivers

911
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:29,035
and are grateful for “nature”.

912
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:34,285
But what you see here
is all made by man.

913
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:36,744
By man?

914
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:38,342
Farmers.

915
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:44,922
- That wood?
- Yes.

916
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,374
- Those trees?
- Yes.

917
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:49,773
- That stream?
- Yes.

918
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:54,513
Every bit has its history,
not just the fields and rice paddies,

919
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,834
someone's Great-Great Grandpa
planted it, or cleared it,

920
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:01,234
gathered firewood
or picked mushrooms there.

921
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:03,764
I see.

922
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,980
Mankind battles nature
and receives from it.

923
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:12,282
They evolve together,
and create this scenery.

924
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:16,822
So without man, this wouldn't exist?

925
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:22,588
Farmers can't exist without nature.

926
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:27,803
So they've always taken great care

927
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:31,097
to give her a helping hand in return.

928
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:36,992
A collaboration between
man and nature...

929
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:40,357
That's the heart of country life.

930
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:45,230
That's why I feel so at home.

931
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:48,602
[ didn't grow up here.
but somehow always felt...

932
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:53,064
my soul was at home here.

933
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:58,317
So that's it...

934
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,973
My back aches.

935
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:54,616
What's so great about organic farming?

936
01:19:56,325 --> 01:20:00,455
Only the theory. Like I said...

937
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:04,200
giving nature a hand is hard work,

938
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,760
Things haven't changed
in a hundred years.

939
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:12,337
No, even “organic” rice
uses weed-killer.

940
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:17,285
There's not enough labor
to weed by hand.

941
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,839
You're really working hard.

942
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,163
How about some tea?

943
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:28,309
Fantastic.

944
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,014
I felt like a break.

945
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,357
Toshio let me try
a variety of things...

946
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:48,874
...until I felt 1 knew
all about country life.

947
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,839
That's great...

948
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:43,141
“Behold, the crows fly home.
First one...”

949
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:48,865
At last I can say this
in the right setting.

950
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:55,625
It was my line in a school play.

951
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,041
Iwas “Village Child A”.

952
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:00,710
Oh, ! see.

953
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:04,946
l only ever had small roles too.

954
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:06,634
And you Naoko?

955
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:11,579
Only lead roles,
since there are so few of us.

956
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:16,637
These days people leave
and go to the cities.

957
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:21,232
And now there are fewer kids.

958
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:26,290
Il see. But getting the big
roles must be fun.

959
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:32,025
Not really. I prefer sports.
I'm a pretty fast runner.

960
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:36,248
Good for you.
l was always mediocre.

961
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,894
The sports version
of “Village Child A”

962
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:43,791
Still. I'll never forget that line
as long as I live.

963
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:48,443
It was going to make me a star.

964
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:49,947
A star?

965
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:51,035
Yes,

966
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,290
What kind of star?

967
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,704
That tiny role?

968
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,239
Yes,

969
01:22:56,038 --> 01:22:57,878
Even though you weren't the lead?

970
01:22:58,507 --> 01:22:59,177
Yes,

971
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:01,364
Because I was the most enthusiastic.

972
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,688
‘Cause you were the cutest?

973
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:07,254
No, not that!

974
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,553
l rehearsed endlessly
in front of the mirror.

975
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:13,906
Even for “Village Child A”...

976
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:19,643
The line was so short,
I felt something missing.

977
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:24,849
“Behold, the crows fly home.
First one...”

978
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:27,584
I know, You made up more!

979
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:29,503
Exactly.

980
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:36,393
Look up there, the crows fly home.

981
01:23:38,647 --> 01:23:40,547
- First one...
- Then two...

982
01:23:40,916 --> 01:23:42,906
- Then three...
- Then four...

983
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:47,690
Farewell dear crows.
You take care now.

984
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,570
And your teacher loved it.

985
01:23:53,929 --> 01:23:54,629
dust the opposite.

986
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:56,973
Very good everyone.

987
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:02,570
But let's stick to the script.

988
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,590
After all that.

989
01:24:16,952 --> 01:24:20,552
it wasn't a good line,
so! didn't mind.

990
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:24,326
! wasn't discouraged at all.

991
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:29,447
! realized that could act
even when there were no lines.

992
01:24:35,037 --> 01:24:37,817
Behold, the crows fly home.

993
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,171
- First one.
- Then two.

994
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,507
- Then three.
- Then four.

995
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:10,727
That was all.

996
01:25:11,974 --> 01:25:16,074
It was worth the effort.
“Village Child A” was a hit.

997
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:18,644
Believe it or not.

998
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:25,061
People asked if I'd had lessons.
Teachers praised me...

999
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:29,191
Then something amazing happened.

1000
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,421
Anyone home?

1001
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:35,476
Coming.

1002
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:40,384
...and then the dynamite blew up
right in my face!

1003
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,536
...Fight in my face!

1004
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:44,748
What? Our Taeko?

1005
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:54,011
We need a girl to star
in our college play.

1006
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:59,005
As a service to the community,

1007
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:02,114
please let your daughter perform.

1008
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:03,861
A star!

1009
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,390
We'd rehearse Saturday afternoons.

1010
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:10,375
We wouldn't take too long.

1011
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:13,259
Well, but...

1012
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:16,832
Of course we'd bring her
straight home.

1013
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:19,293
I'll be in a real play.

1014
01:26:19,608 --> 01:26:23,208
Not with a bunch of kids
but with real grown-ups!

1015
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:25,296
I'll be a star!

1016
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:34,025
Oh, oh, oh,
oh what a wonderful day

1017
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:40,567
Cock-a-doodle-doa!

1018
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:55,836
Mother!

1019
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:58,085
So? So?

1020
01:26:58,447 --> 01:27:01,727
A nice boy from the university
wants you in their drama.

1021
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,480
You were so good
in the school play.

1022
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:07,577
And? And?

1023
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:12,402
He practically begged ma!

1024
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,921
Wow that's great!

1025
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:24,294
At least you're good at something.

1026
01:27:24,673 --> 01:27:27,072
She writes good essays too.

1027
01:27:27,509 --> 01:27:31,819
She's certainly better at that
than she is at math.

1028
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:34,341
That's right. That's right.

1029
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:39,279
l was lead in “The Poor Sparrow”
but no one came for me.

1030
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,738
You see, you see!

1031
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,030
Are you going to do it?

1032
01:28:07,816 --> 01:28:10,626
This could lead to a career.

1033
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,837
Join the Takarazuka Theater.

1034
01:28:14,156 --> 01:28:17,146
Start rehearsing now,
it's perfect timing.

1035
01:28:18,827 --> 01:28:20,497
Acting is out.

1036
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:24,313
Show business people
are no good.

1037
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,920
“Show business”...
don't exaggerate...

1038
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:30,540
That's right. It's...

1039
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:32,109
I said no.

1040
01:28:33,175 --> 01:28:33,755
Dinner.

1041
01:28:54,196 --> 01:28:56,416
Father's so stubborn.

1042
01:28:56,965 --> 01:29:00,305
Why did you have to
mention a career?

1043
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:03,648
- Can I bathe first?
- Sure.

1044
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,626
Or Takarazuka..,.?

1045
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:10,575
Or show business?
You know Dad...

1046
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:14,992
Why did you say that Nanako?

1047
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:17,434
That's enough.

1048
01:29:22,157 --> 01:29:30,507
Poor boy, poor boy,
Don't you feel sorry for me?

1049
01:29:32,334 --> 01:29:34,733
We won't take much of her time.

1050
01:29:35,337 --> 01:29:37,417
know but...

1051
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,700
l beg you.

1052
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:45,180
She's rather shy...

1053
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,511
the timid type...

1054
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:55,953
Sorry you came so far for nothing.

1055
01:29:56,625 --> 01:30:01,195
Poor boy, poor boy...

1056
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:06,060
...such a long way from home...

1057
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:11,081
Poor boy

1058
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:25,369
Aoki's going to play the part instead.

1059
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:27,443
I see.

1060
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,354
She's boasting to everyone.

1061
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:33,778
I see.

1062
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,835
Today her Mom met her at school

1063
01:30:37,332 --> 01:30:41,342
to get her changed into a fancy dress.

1064
01:30:42,137 --> 01:30:44,857
A frilly thing out to here...

1065
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:51,754
Don't tell anyone
you got the first offer.

1066
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:58,016
Because that would hurt
Aoki very much.

1067
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:04,451
Do you understand?

1068
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:08,719
Do you understand?

1069
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:42,264
Breaking through the waves

1070
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,352
Shooting through the clouds

1071
01:31:49,771 --> 01:31:55,041
Where is it heading, Hyokkori Pumpkin
Island? Where will it take us?

1072
01:32:00,582 --> 01:32:05,092
Something special waits for us,

1073
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:10,040
just over the horizon

1074
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:15,415
There'll be hard times,
there'll be sad times,

1075
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:18,317
but we'll never lose heart

1076
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,510
We hate to ery,
so let's laugh instead

1077
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:23,749
Let's go!

1078
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:28,835
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!

1079
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:49,502
Poor you.

1080
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,660
I joined the drama group
in high school.

1081
01:32:56,571 --> 01:33:00,201
l couldn't forget what had happened.

1082
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:01,932
And then?

1083
01:33:02,811 --> 01:33:05,771
It was a lot of fun, acting and all...

1084
01:33:07,282 --> 01:33:11,642
but it wasn't for me.
As for becoming a star...

1085
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,193
that was a joke.

1086
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:15,789
But...

1087
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:21,949
1 guess Dads are the same all over.

1088
01:33:24,466 --> 01:33:28,096
When I was in high school.
l so wanted to live in Tokyo.

1089
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,970
I even wrote to my cousin
about schools there.

1090
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:38,999
Did you really?

1091
01:33:40,515 --> 01:33:43,675
l gave up. But it annoyed me

1092
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:47,469
to hear other guys
bragging about life in Tokyo.

1093
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:52,589
Not anymore though.
l respect my Dad...

1094
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:54,971
He's an expert farmer.

1095
01:33:57,398 --> 01:33:59,738
But I know how you felt.

1096
01:34:00,168 --> 01:34:02,447
Mine's just a funny story.

1097
01:34:02,871 --> 01:34:04,741
No it's the same, ] understand.

1098
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:13,436
But we'll never lose heart, we hate
to cry, so let's laugh instead.

1099
01:34:14,616 --> 01:34:16,486
l also watched
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island.

1100
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:17,908
Really?

1101
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,383
Machine Gun Dandy was so cool.

1102
01:34:20,722 --> 01:34:22,331
He was my hero!

1103
01:34:23,558 --> 01:34:24,988
Of course.

1104
01:34:25,293 --> 01:34:28,423
Those songs were full
of encouragement.

1105
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:31,242
What was that other one...?

1106
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:35,416
“If today's no good.
you'll have tomorrow”

1107
01:34:36,471 --> 01:34:38,611
“If tomorrow's no good,
you'll have the next day”

1108
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:41,327
“If that's no good.
there'll be another”

1109
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:44,019
“There's always a tomorrow”

1110
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:49,125
What a weird song!

1111
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:56,286
That song, about putting things off,
Toshio took

1112
01:34:57,025 --> 01:35:00,125
ina positive, affirmative way.

1113
01:35:01,329 --> 01:35:04,518
liked his approach to life.

1114
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,500
You're going tomorrow?

1115
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:27,897
Thank you for having me for so long.

1116
01:35:28,623 --> 01:35:30,322
Thank you, my dear.

1117
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:39,931
Do you like it here?

1118
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:44,338
Very much. I feel so at home.

1119
01:35:44,973 --> 01:35:48,043
Glad to hear it.

1120
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:51,720
I've lived here all my life.

1121
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:57,523
Been to Tokyo just once.
For your sister's wedding.

1122
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:00,979
You think it's better than Tokyo?

1123
01:36:01,723 --> 01:36:03,423
Without a doubt.

1124
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:08,878
Tokyo's packed with cars. buildings...
People shouldn't live like that.

1125
01:36:09,731 --> 01:36:12,571
This is a different world.

1126
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:16,817
You really like it here then?

1127
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:21,218
Yes. The nice surroundings.
the kind people...

1128
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:26,676
Taeko.

1129
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:30,935
Why don't you live here? With Toshio?

1130
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:39,405
Since his brother moved to Tokyo,

1131
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:44,391
why don't you stay here
and marry Toshio?

1132
01:36:45,066 --> 01:36:46,206
Granny!

1133
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:49,366
Mother... you've gone too far!

1134
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:52,074
Taeko's shocked.

1135
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,433
Please think it over.

1136
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,514
Don't pay any attention, She's joking.

1137
01:36:59,447 --> 01:37:00,997
Joking, right, Granny?

1138
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:03,656
No. I'm serious.

1139
01:37:04,085 --> 01:37:06,425
Don't deny you wouldn't like it.

1140
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:10,574
It's not a matter of what we'd like...

1141
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:13,622
Of course we'd love it.

1142
01:37:14,062 --> 01:37:18,892
But Taeko's a city person.

1143
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,567
Of course.

1144
01:37:20,802 --> 01:37:24,342
But she loves it here,

1145
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:28,839
she works so hard on the land.
it's a joy to watch.

1146
01:37:29,544 --> 01:37:33,354
There'd be nothing better
than her marrying Toshio.

1147
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:37,460
You're being rude.
You're embarrasing her.

1148
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:43,249
She's got a decent job in Tokyo.
Besides, she’s older than him.

1149
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:47,501
There are jobs in Yamagata too.

1150
01:37:49,464 --> 01:37:52,304
Please don't be angry.

1151
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:56,983
Most of the young wives
work these days, so...

1152
01:37:57,638 --> 01:38:00,538
What're you talking about?

1153
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:05,626
She's only been here
twice on holiday.

1154
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:08,697
Suddenly bringing this up...
you're upsetting her.

1155
01:38:09,117 --> 01:38:10,957
So you're against it?

1156
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:15,329
I didn't say that.
I said let's be realistic.

1157
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:19,830
We don’t even know
how Toshio feels.

1158
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:23,071
One look at him and it’s obvious.

1159
01:38:23,531 --> 01:38:28,601
Don't dismiss it before
we've asked her.

1160
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:31,404
Taeko!

1161
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:38,765
Let her be.

1162
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:45,432
See what you did.
You can't rush these things.

1163
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:49,414
I don't think I was wrong.

1164
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:08,485
I'd never even thought
of being a farmer's wife.

1165
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:13,107
l was strangely moved,

1166
01:39:13,714 --> 01:39:15,524
even imagining it might be possible.

1167
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:20,681
If only ! could've replied:

1168
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:23,509
‘I'd love to...” like in a movie.

1169
01:39:24,926 --> 01:39:26,296
But ! couldn't.

1170
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:31,675
Suddenly my love of the country,
and my play-farming,

1171
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,370
seemed so phony.

1172
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:39,280
Declaring my love for country life

1173
01:39:39,841 --> 01:39:43,301
based on a ten day vacation,
now felt so embarrassing.

1174
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:47,756
Then with no warning...

1175
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:51,597
averyone seeing right through me.

1176
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,038
it was unbearable.

1177
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:03,670
fl ain't shaking hands with you.

1178
01:40:06,968 --> 01:40:09,458
That shirt he wore today...

1179
01:40:09,904 --> 01:40:10,544
What about it?

1180
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:13,138
Tanaka's old shirt.

1181
01:40:13,641 --> 01:40:14,781
Don't tell anyone.

1182
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:20,052
When it's his turn to feed the ducks,
he takes the bread home.

1183
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:23,808
Did you see his hands?

1184
01:40:24,318 --> 01:40:25,898
Glad he's not sitting next to me.

1185
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:28,077
Poor Taeko.

1186
01:40:28,356 --> 01:40:30,496
Have him switch places.

1187
01:40:30,892 --> 01:40:34,052
He should sit with the boys.

1188
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:35,965
Right Taeko?

1189
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:39,751
I don't mind.

1190
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:42,328
You shouldn't talk like that.

1191
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:44,240
You don't mind?

1192
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:45,969
Don't be a goody-goody.

1193
01:40:46,641 --> 01:40:49,250
Don't you dare tell anyone
what we said.

1194
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:55,748
I'll beat you up!

1195
01:41:03,324 --> 01:41:04,433
Don't go!

1196
01:41:17,505 --> 01:41:19,025
What are you doing out here?

1197
01:41:19,941 --> 01:41:22,691
Nothing. Taking a walk.

1198
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:27,156
You're getting wet. Quick, get in.

1199
01:41:44,165 --> 01:41:45,685
A little souvenir.

1200
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:48,204
Some of Mom's pickles.

1201
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:57,266
Please don't go back yet.

1202
01:41:57,645 --> 01:41:58,815
Why not?

1203
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,890
Just drive...anywhere.

1204
01:42:02,817 --> 01:42:04,107
Something wrong?

1205
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:09,119
I knew a boy named Abe.

1206
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:14,978
He came from another school.
He sat next to ma.

1207
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:18,684
He once said,

1208
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,120
“lL ain't shaking hands with you.”

1209
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:52,651
His family was poor.
He never had sports gear.

1210
01:42:54,268 --> 01:42:58,368
Always picking his nose
or wiping it on his sleeve...

1211
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:04,170
And if 1 complained or
even dared frown at him,

1212
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:07,939
he'd threaten to hit me.

1213
01:43:09,984 --> 01:43:14,464
I hated it. l longed for
the end of the term,

1214
01:43:15,356 --> 01:43:17,135
so we could change seats.

1215
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:22,799
I hated holding hands
in dance class,

1216
01:43:23,964 --> 01:43:27,744
hated having to lend him
my homework.

1217
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:35,501
The girls gossiped
and called him names.

1218
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:41,415
But ! wouldn't join in.

1219
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:46,636
[ thought it was terrible
to talk behind his back.

1220
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:50,153
But one day...

1221
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:55,235
He was transferred in
the middle of the term.

1222
01:43:56,831 --> 01:44:00,961
The teacher made us all
shake hands and say goodbye.

1223
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:05,910
A feeling of disgust swept the room.

1224
01:44:08,843 --> 01:44:12,473
His hands were filthy.

1225
01:44:14,949 --> 01:44:19,638
Walking around.
shaking hands with us,

1226
01:44:20,688 --> 01:44:22,498
he looked so nervous.

1227
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:29,648
Back at his own desk,
only I was left.

1228
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,360
When I held out my hand he said,

1229
01:44:39,807 --> 01:44:41,587
“lL ain't shaking hands with you.”

1230
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:47,054
“lL ain't shaking hands with you.”

1231
01:44:55,556 --> 01:44:58,776
l hated him the most.

1232
01:45:01,228 --> 01:45:04,098
He knew that.

1233
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,880
That's why he didn't shake my hand.

1234
01:45:15,709 --> 01:45:17,579
What happened at the farmhouse?

1235
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:22,642
Ever since I was little...

1236
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:26,992
I just pretend to be nice.

1237
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:29,545
Nothing's changed.

1238
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:43,995
You're strange, today.
Not the usual you.

1239
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:49,294
I don't know what happened, but...

1240
01:45:49,743 --> 01:45:53,113
It's nothing to do with that.

1241
01:45:57,785 --> 01:45:59,075
I'm sorry.

1242
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:05,194
I just feel bad about what happened.

1243
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:12,142
I think that boy was stupid.

1244
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,250
Maybe he didn't shake your hand
because he liked you.

1245
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:21,948
No, he liked the class president.

1246
01:46:22,643 --> 01:46:24,373
He was always acting tough with me.

1247
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:31,772
Hands in pockets, spitting.
swearing, swaggering along,

1248
01:46:33,254 --> 01:46:34,864
... showing off.

1249
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:36,529
Exactly.

1250
01:46:36,991 --> 01:46:40,121
l know how he feels.
When I was little,

1251
01:46:40,661 --> 01:46:43,001
l used to bully the girl I liked.

1252
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:45,010
That's not it.

1253
01:46:45,332 --> 01:46:49,232
He shook hands with everyone but me.

1254
01:46:50,271 --> 01:46:52,760
There's the problem.

1255
01:46:54,008 --> 01:46:56,438
Girls never understand how boys feel.

1256
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:59,181
As if you know...

1257
01:46:59,847 --> 01:47:01,777
Let me guess, then...

1258
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:05,780
He wasn't that tough.

1259
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:11,440
He couldn't bully any boys.
He had no friends.

1260
01:47:14,795 --> 01:47:19,075
You sat next to him, an easy target.

1261
01:47:20,301 --> 01:47:22,931
He needed you to be tough with.

1262
01:47:23,404 --> 01:47:26,864
No way he wanted
to shake hands with everyone.

1263
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:32,191
He could only prove how
tough he was with you.

1264
01:47:58,339 --> 01:48:00,119
Don't be filthy!

1265
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:48,938
I felt so guilty and so sorry for him

1266
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:52,277
that I began copying him.

1267
01:48:54,728 --> 01:48:56,398
Too late though, huh?

1268
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:59,410
l couldn't take back

1269
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:02,483
the pain I caused him.

1270
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:14,275
It's stopped raining.

1271
01:49:15,282 --> 01:49:16,712
Oh, yes.

1272
01:49:21,688 --> 01:49:23,088
The moon's out.

1273
01:49:33,634 --> 01:49:37,034
Sometimes at night
you see raccoons here.

1274
01:49:39,773 --> 01:49:40,853
Shall we go back?

1275
01:49:41,108 --> 01:49:44,708
They must be worried about me.

1276
01:49:48,382 --> 01:49:51,541
This'll be the talk of the town.

1277
01:49:52,453 --> 01:49:55,583
I'm sorry, You've been so kind.

1278
01:49:56,857 --> 01:49:59,257
I wonder what happened
at the house, though?

1279
01:49:59,693 --> 01:50:03,913
Please. for my sake.
don't ask anyone.

1280
01:50:08,202 --> 01:50:10,162
Shall l play that music?

1281
01:50:49,176 --> 01:50:52,246
! began to think of
my feelings for him,

1282
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:57,807
and of his feelings for me,
for the very first time.

1283
01:51:02,422 --> 01:51:07,932
How come he seemed to sort out
my mixed-up thoughts?

1284
01:51:09,429 --> 01:51:13,439
How come let him get so close?

1285
01:51:15,536 --> 01:51:19,106
Somehow he seemed older than me.

1286
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:26,261
He was the one wanted
to shake hands with.

1287
01:51:29,716 --> 01:51:31,116
dust shake hands?

1288
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:05,320
What was this feeling?

1289
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:10,820
My mind raced as I sat beside him.

1290
01:52:38,352 --> 01:52:40,162
Have you got everything?

1291
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,040
Yas, I'm fine.

1292
01:52:42,456 --> 01:52:44,386
We'll see you in the winter.

1293
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:48,157
I'll do my farming homework.

1294
01:52:48,729 --> 01:52:50,719
What about skiing?

1295
01:52:51,398 --> 01:52:53,478
That just takes practice.

1296
01:52:54,301 --> 01:52:57,111
Consider what ! said, Taeko.

1297
01:52:57,771 --> 01:52:58,911
What's that?

1298
01:52:59,172 --> 01:52:59,812
What?

1299
01:53:00,307 --> 01:53:03,647
That's our secret.

1300
01:53:04,745 --> 01:53:07,644
Something was strange yesterday.

1301
01:53:08,148 --> 01:53:11,138
Sorry. Next time I'll be fine,

1302
01:53:11,652 --> 01:53:14,112
I'll leave the ten year-old me,
at home.

1303
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:29,291
Wait for me!

1304
01:53:30,737 --> 01:53:32,347
Take care Naoko.

1305
01:53:41,882 --> 01:53:43,081
Goodbye.

1306
01:54:23,523 --> 01:54:30,143
Some say love, it is a river

1307
01:54:31,932 --> 01:54:36,822
that drowns the tender reed.

1308
01:54:39,272 --> 01:54:45,102
Some say love, it is a razor

1309
01:54:47,848 --> 01:54:53,178
that leaves your soul to bleed.

1310
01:54:55,322 --> 01:55:01,122
Some say love, it is a hunger,

1311
01:55:03,764 --> 01:55:09,184
an endless aching need.

1312
01:55:11,438 --> 01:55:17,968
! say love, it is a flower,

1313
01:55:20,113 --> 01:55:25,763
and you its only seed.

1314
01:55:31,525 --> 01:55:37,644
it's the heart, afraid of breaking,

1315
01:55:39,733 --> 01:55:45,213
that never learns to dance.

1316
01:55:46,807 --> 01:55:52,897
It's the dream, afraid of waking,

1317
01:55:54,748 --> 01:56:00,487
that never takes a chance.

1318
01:56:02,155 --> 01:56:08,275
it's the one who won't be taken,

1319
01:56:10,330 --> 01:56:16,450
who cannot seem to give.

1320
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:24,731
And the soul, afraid of dyin’,

1321
01:56:26,913 --> 01:56:33,213
that never learns to live.

1322
01:56:38,058 --> 01:56:44,178
When the night has been too lonely

1323
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:51,402
and the road has been too lone.

1324
01:56:53,607 --> 01:56:59,557
And you think that love is only

1325
01:57:01,548 --> 01:57:07,468
for the lucky and the strong,

1326
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:16,035
dust remember in the winter

1327
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:22,870
far beneath the bitter snows,

1328
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:31,881
Lies the seed,
that with the sun's love,

1329
01:57:34,147 --> 01:57:41,267
in the Spring becomes the Rose.
