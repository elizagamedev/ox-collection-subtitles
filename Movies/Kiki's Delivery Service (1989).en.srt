1
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,871
<Now the latest weather forecast
<for northwest Koriko.

2
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,273
<Skies are clearing up,
<thanks to a high-pressure front...

3
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,419
<moving in from the continent.

4
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,856
<Mild winds will be
<blowing in from the west...

5
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,916
<clearing out the clouds
<by this evening.

6
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,919
<We'll also have
<a beautiful full moon tonight...

7
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,802
<so pack up your picnic baskets because
<the weather is going to be just fine.

8
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,833
<More news in just a minute.

9
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,631
<First this word from
<the courteous people at Central Market.

10
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,233
Jiji, I've decided!
I'm gonna do it tonight!

11
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,244
Mom! Hey! I decided!

12
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,407
Oh, hi, Miss Dora.
It's gonna be completely clear tonight.

13
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,080
I heard the weather forecast.
There's gonna be a big full moon.

14
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,377
Did you borrow your father's radio
without permission again?

15
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,383
Is it okay? I'm sorry!

16
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,036
Happy to see you, Miss Dora.

17
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,327
Mom, my mind's made up.
It's tonight.

18
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,874
Weren't you gonna
put it off a month?

19
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,463
But the next full moon
might be on a cloudy night.

20
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,715
I want to make sure I leave
on the perfect night.

21
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,882
Kiki, wait!

22
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,224
My, my.
What's this leaving business?

23
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,651
It's one of our old customs.

24
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,243
When a witch turns 13 she leaves home
for a year to begin her training.

25
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,747
Your little baby is 13?

26
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,683
My, my. Time flies so quickly,
doesn't it?

27
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,823
I'm afraid so. But nobody
leaves home that young anymore.

28
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,670
l remember perfectly well...

29
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,816
the exact day
you arrived in this town.

30
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,448
A little 13-year-old girl
came down from the sky...

31
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,475
riding a broomstick,
her eyes shining.

32
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,608
I thought you were
a bit stuck-up.

33
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,329
But Kiki doesn't know much
besides flying.

34
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,391
She hardly knows any
of my formulas.

35
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,920
After I'm gone,
who will make this medicine?

36
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,004
Sign of the times,
I'm afraid.

37
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,079
Everything changes,
bit by bit.

38
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,471
But I have to say,
nothing works as well for my rheumatism.

39
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,897
You're always telling me to hurry!
Now who's the slowpoke?

40
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:59,013
I think it's better to leave
with decorum and great dignity.

41
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,726
If we put it off for a month, and I find
some wonderful boyfriend, then what?

42
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,164
We'll never leave!

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,130
I'm worried about this.
Once you've decided, you can't go back.

44
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,519
Of course.
I know that.

45
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:12,972
Good. It's there.

46
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,216
I'm so excited!
It's like getting a birthday present!

47
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,678
You won't believe it, Dad!

48
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,156
I've decided
to go away tonight!

49
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,002
- Tonight?
- Yeah! I just decided!

50
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,872
Well, yes, but what about
our camping trip for this weekend?

51
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,816
Sorry, Dad!

52
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,448
Yes. I'll expect you then.
Thanks.

53
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,591
Hi, Mom. I wanted to make sure
you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.

54
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,215
Yes, at midnight.

55
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,805
- Not bad.
- wish it were a different color.

56
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,065
Witches have worn this color
for over a thousand years.

57
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,629
Black cat, black clothes.

58
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,452
It's not really important
what color your dress is.

59
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,138
What matters is
the heart inside it.

60
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,107
I know that having a good heart
is very important.

61
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,110
I wish I could show you
that my heart is ready.

62
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,233
Just follow that heart
and keep smiling.

63
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,525
Okay.

64
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,001
Be sure to write home
as soon as you've found a place.

65
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,622
Dad, can I please
take the radio?

66
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,378
Mom, you said
I could have his radio.

67
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,390
<- Yea!
<- Well, the radio's yours now.

68
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,837
Okay. Now let me have
a look at my little witch.

69
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,868
You look just like your mother did
when she was your age.

70
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,037
Dad...

71
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,586
would you pick me up
like you used to?

72
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,289
Well...

73
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,912
How come you never told me
you were growing up so fast?

74
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,033
You can always come home
if things don't work out.

75
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,736
Come back to my old room?
No, thanks.

76
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,028
I hope you find a good town.

77
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,645
I bet it's real tough to find
a town to live in by yourself.

78
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,952
Don't worry.
Kiki will be fine.

79
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,001
- What kind of town are you looking for?
- A big town?

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,700
Yeah.
By the ocean, I hope.

81
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,666
-Wow!
- I'm so jealous of you!

82
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:57,719
But I'm not going for a good time.
I'll be in training at least a year.

83
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,068
Yeah, but they'll have discos,
won't they?

84
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,496
- Kiki, it's almost time.
- Okay!

85
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,338
That's the broom
you're leaving on?

86
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,160
Yeah. I just made it.
Pretty cute, huh?

87
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:17,297
It's cute, but you can't start witching
on a broom that's too small. Take mine.

88
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,581
But, Mom, that one's so old.

89
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:24,483
That's why you should have it.
It never loses its way, even in a storm.

90
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,268
Kiki, trust me.

91
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,494
But I worked so hard on it.
Right, Jiji?

92
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,390
Your mother's broom would be better.

93
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,317
You rotten traitor.

94
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:40,379
He's right. You can make yourself
another broom when you get settled down.

95
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,664
- Be careful.
- Go get ‘em.

96
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,630
- Bye!
- Have a good time!

97
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,712
Go, go, Kiki!
Go, go, Kiki!

98
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,452
She hasn't got the hang of it yet.

99
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,669
She's well past the lake
and doing just fine.

100
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,139
I'm going to miss the sound
of that little bell.

101
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,896
Which way are we headed?

102
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,034
I think south, to the ocean.

103
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:52,174
Climb up and turn on the radio.
I don't think I can.

121
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,984
- Good evening!
- It was.

122
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,099
Newcomer, I suppose.

123
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,481
I must be.
I just left home tonight.

124
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,121
Would you mind
turning off that music?

125
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,060
I prefer to fly
without accompaniment.

126
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,325
Is it really hard to get settled
into a place you've never been?

127
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,936
Oh, yes.
Lots can go wrong.

128
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,363
But since I'm good at fortune-telling,
I can handle anything.

129
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:54,973
Fortunes?

130
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,218
In fact, I've started
telling fortunes about love lately.

131
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,841
What's <your> special skill?

132
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,375
I haven't made up my mind yet.

133
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,550
Uh-hhuh. Well, I'm nearly finishe
with my training period.

134
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,591
It'll be terrific
to go home with confidence.

135
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,853
That's my town down there.

136
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,487
It's not big or terribly interesting,
but I like it.

137
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,094
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

138
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,017
Good-bye!

139
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,925
Disgusting.
What a stuck-up cat.

140
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,041
I have to have a special skill.

141
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,107
What was that about good weather?

142
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,329
Il hope you're not going to do
what I think you're going to do.

143
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,317
We'll sleep here
until the storm's gone.

144
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,282
- Won't we get into trouble?
- Not if nobody finds us.

145
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,551
I'm soaked through.

146
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,781
Do you feel anything moving?

147
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,118
This smells great.

148
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,824
Sorry. We didn't mean to fall asleep
in your breakfast.

149
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,148
Jiji, you've gotta
come see the ocean.

150
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,658
I don't believe it!
It's huge!

151
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,977
- It's only a puddle to me.
- Aw, come on.

152
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,835
That one's giant. Think there
might be other witches there?

153
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,417
How would I know?

154
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,239
Let's go!

155
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,626
You all right back there?

156
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,949
Look.
A big town by the sea.

157
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,435
Can you believe my luck?
A clock tower and everything!

158
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,245
What if there< are
some witches living here?

159
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,834
There may not be.

160
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,094
- Am I gonna like it here!
- It's a trifle large for my taste.

161
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,137
Bless my hourglass!
If that ain't a witch!

162
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,753
Good morning!

163
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,064
Are there any other witches
in this town?

164
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,880
No. Can't say as I've seen
a single one of ‘em lately.

165
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,794
How about that? Our trip is over.
We're gonna settle down right here.

166
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,262
- Thanks, mister! Bye!
- Don't mention it!

167
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,915
- Tell me we're not landing down there.
- Of course we are.

168
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,810
Everybody's looking at us.

169
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,985
I know. Smile and make
a good first impression.

170
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,352
Well, you see, I'm a witch.
My name is Kiki.

171
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,728
This is my black cat Jiji.

172
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,207
We'd be honored
if we could live here.

173
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,290
We'd love to live here.
You have a wonderful bell tower.

174
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,291
We're glad you like it, my dear.
Bye!

175
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,600
Hey, kid, what were you doing
jumping into the street like that?

176
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,760
You almost caused an accident.

177
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,642
You must be crazy,
zooming around on a broom in public.

178
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,645
I'm a new witch, sir.
We're supposed to fly around.

179
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,647
You're supposed to obey the law
the same as other people.

180
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,771
What's your name and address?

181
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,533
- Are you gonna tell my parents?
- Of course, if it's necessary.

182
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,777
I have to.
You're a minor.

183
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,888
Thief! Somebody stop him!
Stop, thief!

184
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,248
Don't you move from there!

185
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,341
Kiki.

186
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,869
Wait up!
It worked out pretty good, huh?

187
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:04,002
Good plan to get rid of that cop, huh?
I was the one yelling "Thief!"

188
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,920
You're a real witch, right?

189
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,570
Could I look at that broom?

190
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:13,709
Hey, Tombo! Isn't it a bit early
for girl hunting?

191
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,437
Hey, you guys, shut up.

192
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,549
Let me look at your broom.
Please? Just for a minute.

193
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,773
I didn't ask for your help.

194
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,775
I guess I have to thank you...

195
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,007
but it was rude for you to do something
without introducing yourself.

196
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,871
How old-fashioned.
You sound like my grandma.

197
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,995
Go away and leave me alone!

198
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,134
What a cool witch.

199
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,214
Stay here alone? I don't understand.
Aren't your parents here with you?

200
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,504
No. I'm a witch, so since I'm 13, I'm
supposed to be completely independent.

201
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,019
May I see some identification?

202
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,925
Never mind then.

203
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,468
- Are you going to eat that?
- You can have it.

204
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,561
It's going to be getting dark
fairly soon.

205
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,625
Let's go.

206
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,634
Let's just find another town.
There must be plenty of nice ones.

207
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,241
Perhaps one
even bigger than this one.

208
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,264
Lady! Your pacifier!

209
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,580
Lady, you forgot this!

210
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,476
When that baby wakes up
and doesn't find this, she's gonna cry.

211
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,540
I'm sorry, sir, but could you wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.

212
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:13,292
- 1 could bring it down to her.
- What?

213
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:17,476
The woman with the baby carriage, right?
It'd be easy. I'd really like to.

214
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,807
That'd be a big help.

215
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,136
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

216
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,246
Let's go, Jiji.

217
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,887
Wow!

218
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,865
Sorry to startle you, but
you left this pacifier in the bakery.

219
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,315
Here you go.

220
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,793
- I'd like one of those.
- Sure. Hi! Come on in.

221
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,874
Thank you.

222
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,237
Thank you. Bye.

223
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,218
There you are.

224
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:39,275
I must say, I nearly fainted
when I saw you fly off.

225
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,782
That woman told me
to give you this message right away.

226
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,468
“I got the pacifier you sent.

227
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,840
Be sure to thank your little friend.
She's an absolute angel.*

228
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,919
I'm glad I could help you out.
Bye!

229
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,363
Where are you going so fast?
Have something to drink.

230
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,920
Come up here.

231
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,406
Sit down and relax.
I'll make some hot chocolate.

232
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,123
- Thank you very much.
- And this is for you.

233
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,851
Let me guess.
You're a witch in training.

234
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,377
Yes, but people don't seem
fond of witches in this town.

235
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,697
There are many kinds of people
in this town who will like you.

236
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,970
Take me, for instance.
l like you very much.

237
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,009
Found a place to stay yet?

238
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,839
You should have told me
you hadn't.

239
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,848
We have a vacant room in the attic
you can stay in.

240
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,298
You'd give me a room?

241
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,071
I'd be happy to.

242
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,516
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Osono.

243
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,016
My name's Kiki.

244
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,064
This is my black cat Jiji.

245
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,673
It's not very clean at the moment,
but it's all yours.

246
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,100
Thank you.

247
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,858
Bathroom and water
are downstairs.

248
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,723
- Don't hesitate to ask for anything.
- Thank you!

249
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,517
There's flour everywhere.

250
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,348
At this rate,
I'll be a white cat by morning.

251
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,572
Jiji, come look
at the ocean from here.

252
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,562
Shall we try to find
another town?

253
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,890
<The> Freedom Adventurer...

254
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,772
<sponsored by the World Airship
<Popularization Association...

255
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,790
<has commenced its maiden voyage
<to Antarctica.

256
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,264
What a snob she is.

257
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,157
I've decided
not to leave this town.

258
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,099
Maybe I can find others
like Osono...

259
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,542
who will like me and accept me
for what I am.

260
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,519
How much do you think a phone
would cost to put in here?

261
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,872
- A phone?
- Yeah. For my business.

262
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,927
Good morning, everyone.

263
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,219
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes!

264
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,151
That smells good
Can I help out?

265
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,315
A delivery service, huh?

266
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,948
I have one skill-- flying-- so I thought
a delivery service was a good idea.

267
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,623
Everyone will love it.
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.

268
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:02,056
And you can base the business
out of your room upstairs...

269
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:03,668
if you want to.

270
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,639
“If l want to"?
Oh, boy!

271
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,938
- I'd like to put a phone up there.
- But a phone costs money.

272
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,078
-l have some saved up already.
- Don't waste it.

273
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,702
Why not use our phone?

274
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,261
It takes time
to get regular customers.

275
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:22,437
If you help around the bakery, you won't
have to pay rent or the phone bill.

276
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,251
I need a lot of help
since I'm expecting a baby.

277
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,624
And I'll throw in
free breakfast too.

278
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,780
Thank you!

279
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,125
I'll do my very best for you.

280
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,009
You're such a wonderful person!

281
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,896
Jiji, come on!
I'm all done!

282
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,814
It's time to go shopping.

283
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,855
Stop jumping out into the street.
We're not at home.

284
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,355
I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

285
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,603
I've never been more embarrassed
in my whole life.

286
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,834
It was so terrible!

287
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,483
I wish I had something pretty to wear
besides this robe.

288
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,048
Boy, this is expensive.

289
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,354
Kiki, look! It's me!

290
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,095
- Do you have any money left?
-A little.

291
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,098
We'll just have to eat
a lot of pancakes for a while.

292
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,649
Wow!
Those are beautiful.

293
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,049
Wait!
Pull over a second!

294
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,753
Hey, yo! Miss Witch!
Turn around!

295
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,860
Nice goin’, Tombo!

296
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,612
Not flying today?

297
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,402
What'd I tell you?
Black is all she wears.

298
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,545
Wait! Come back! I'm sorry!
I was only kidding!

299
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,335
Perfect timing, Kiki.

300
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,706
A lady wants you to deliver something.
She's your first customer.

301
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,293
Customer?
I'll be right back!

302
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,753
The map!

303
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,043
This lady is a customer of ours.

304
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,445
We were talking about
your delivery service.

305
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,825
- You are a cute little witch.
- My name's Kiki, ma'am.

306
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,738
I've heard wonderful things about you.
Could you deliver this by tonight?

307
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,120
- Yes!
- It's my nephew's birthday.

308
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:05,043
An urgennt job came up, so I can't ge
there myself to give him his present.

309
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,347
Where do you want it delivered?

310
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,405
That's me.

311
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,994
It won't be too far?

312
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,166
I can fly there
directly from here.

313
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,688
- How much do you want?
-l haven't really set a price yet.

314
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,640
Is this enough?

315
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,855
This is more than enough.
Thank you very much, ma’am.

316
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,449
Oh, wow! That's great!

317
00:33:56,801 --> 00:34:00,610
- I certainly wish I could fly.
- Yeah! Hey, do you know that girl?

318
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,987
How high do you intend to go?

319
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,857
It's my first delivery. I don't want
to be stopped by that police officer.

320
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:31,129
I was afraid you were going to
deliver it to the angels.

321
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,925
I'm guessing
it's just beyond the cape.

322
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,283
Here we go!

323
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,219
I'm liking this town
more and more.

324
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,262
I'm not sure what I think.

325
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,144
I'll finally be able
to write Mom.

326
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,722
Those are wild geese.
Wonderful!

327
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,530
They're flying along with us!

328
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,215
- They seem awfully upset.
- They say a wind's coming.

329
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,937
They also say
they're going higher.

330
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,561
I'm sorry. I-- Oww!

331
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:43,394
Please! I'm sorry!
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs!

332
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,481
I've never been so scared.

333
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:58,243
It's your fault. They warned us
of that wind, but you didn't listen.

334
00:36:58,817 --> 00:36:59,897
You're right.

335
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,921
That's beautiful. They were able
to fly that high up with the wind.

336
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,242
Kiki!

337
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:10,884
The toy is gone!

338
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,610
We've gotta go back
to where we fell!

339
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,442
They're saying,
“The egg thief's coming again!"

340
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,553
What are we gonna do?

341
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,394
Hey! Stop that!

342
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,543
Don't do that!

343
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,575
Stop it!

344
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,929
We're in trouble.
They're still upset.

345
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,688
Witches get no respect these days.

346
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,374
Crows used to be
witches’ servants.

347
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,634
That was a long time ago, okay?

348
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,610
How about we go in after the forest
is dark, get it and get out?

349
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,391
We'll never make it in time.

350
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,824
There's only one way to do it.

351
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,876
They'll find out I'm a fake.

352
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,048
After I find it,
I'll be right back to help you out.

353
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,232
- Is that the place?
- Yes. Don't move a muscle.

354
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,867
- Can I breathe?
- Hold it as long as you can.

355
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,564
Yea!
Give me my present!

356
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,779
That's pretty weird.

357
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,346
A bit late, aren't you?

358
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:16,168
After my sister telephoned,
we were wondering where you were.

359
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,791
I'm sorry. Oh.

360
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,836
Could I please have
your signature?

361
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,415
Mom, can I put
the canaries in here?

362
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,672
Uh-huh, but be careful
you don't let any of them escape.

363
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,779
Okay.

364
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,706
Thank you very much.
Have a nice day.

365
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,459
Come on, birdie!

366
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,792
I'm gonna put you
in a bigger house!

367
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,198
Please hurry, Kiki.

368
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:33,057
I know it was here,
so it's gotta be around someplace.

369
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:48,575
There it is!

370
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,384
Excuse me! Anybody home?

371
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,183
Can you please help me?
Anybody?

372
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,267
Anybody here?

373
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,225
Yeah! I can't come down right now.
Why don't you come up?

374
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,064
What do you want?

375
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,748
That stuffed black cat
you put behind your window?

376
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,452
I'm sorry, but it's mine.
I dropped it.

377
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,803
Be good,
and don't move yet.

378
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,721
I found it in the forest.

379
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,000
Would you give it back
to me, please?

380
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,113
Hang on a minute.
I can't stop just now.

381
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,303
Nice. Very nice.

382
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,989
You're beautiful
just the way you are.

383
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,874
You really should have told me
you were in a hurry.

384
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,330
- 1 got sort of fond of it.
- I'm sorry.

385
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,703
The stuffing's coming out.

386
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,585
I'll bet the crows did it.
They were making a big fuss over it.

387
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,588
What am I gonna do?
I can't deliver it like this.

388
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,823
Say!
How about we work out a deal?

389
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,491
That's pretty exciting.
And at 13 too.

390
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,108
To be completely independent.
That's great.

391
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:39,071
- Can you fix it?
- Trust me.

- You've done enough. Go help him.

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,330
It is strange, you know.

401
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:27,439
He adores that stuffed cat.
He won't leave it alone.

402
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,602
He thinks it's a puppy.

403
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:32,484
Your sister's not going to be
happy to hear that.

404
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,685
- That's okay. I gave it to Jeff anyway.
- Remember to tell Auntie "thank you."

405
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:43,136
You should be nicer to him.
Jeff is a very old dog.

406
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,191
But, Grandma,
all he does is sleep!

407
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,287
I suppose that's true.

408
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,310
Ketto, go open the door.
Jeff wants to go out.

409
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,275
Be sure to push the door shut
when you're finished.

410
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,994
- Jiji!
- Kiki, what took you so long?

411
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:10,487
I'm sorry.

412
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,111
That marvelous dog
helped me escape.

413
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,339
He said he'd be happy
to help us out if he could.

414
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,337
Would you take this back in?

415
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,992
What's the matter?

416
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,254
- I'm famished.
- Yeah, me too.

417
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,300
And I'm tired too.

418
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,592
But it sure was
a wonderful adventure.

419
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,917
And that painter who found the stuffed
cat wants to do a drawing with me in it.

420
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:16,242
- Naked?
- Don't be silly!

00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:04,663
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be minding the shop.

424
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,666
lam,
but nobody's coming in today.

425
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,869
- But it always gets busy around now.
- know, but that's not what I mean.

426
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,174
I mean< my> customers.

427
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:18,563
Jiji, if nobody comes in
I'll have to eat pancakes forever...

428
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:22,136
and be fat, fat, fat!

429
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,776
So, what am I supposed to do?

430
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:28,598
I think pancakes are superb,
providing they're not burned, of course.

431
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:33,073
You're no help.
When you get fat, see if I care.

432
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,451
Beautiful, isn't she? Somebody told me
she's a fashion designer.

433
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:47,054
Personally, I'm not very fond
of her conceited cat.

434
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,911
Hello. Gutiokipan Bakery.

435
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,487
Pardon? Yes, ma'am.

436
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,210
About time we got a customer.

437
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:01,656
4:30 will be a perfect time
to pick it up. If you'll just--

438
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:04,343
Uh-huh. And the address?

439
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:07,232
Yes. The blue roof.
Right.

440
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,638
Yes, I'm sure I have it all.

441
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:11,764
Thank you very much.

442
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,856
Hi.

443
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,089
I'll take this one.

444
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,594
Okay?

445
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:35,875
Thank you very much.
Good afternoon.

446
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,047
Are you still mad at me?

447
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,489
We're having a party
at the club tonight.

448
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:44,188
It's called the flying club,
and we'd really like you to come.

449
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,418
Here's your invitation.

450
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,674
It really is a serious club.

451
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:55,607
Everybody would be very happy
if you came.

452
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,400
May I help you?

453
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:00,245
They tell me
you have a delivery service.

454
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,868
Oh. Pardon me.
Yes, of course we do.

455
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,077
It's urgent this package arrive tonight.
Can you do it?

456
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,620
Of course we can--

457
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,676
Are you gonna be all right?

458
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,408
- Uh-huh
- Can I help you?

459
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,940
Uh-uh.

460
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:33,057
I'll be back at 6:00,
so make up your mind by then.

461
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:35,060
How much will that be?

462
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,916
Will that be inside
or outside the city limits?

463
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,409
-l wrote it down on the box.
- The box? Oh, I'm sorry.

464
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:46,566
Osono!

465
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:49,834
I got an invitation to a party
at Tombo's flying club.

466
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,017
Terrific!
You'll have a wonderful time.

467
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,459
But what am I gonna wear?

468
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:58,571
Kiki, l wouldn't worry too much.
You look fine in that.

469
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,299
It makes you look beautiful
and mysterious.

470
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,742
- You mean it?
- Any work yet?

471
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:06,878
l almost forgot about it!
It's already 4:00!

472
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,854
Oh, no!

473
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,536
Can you watch the store
till l get back? Jiji! Jiji!

474
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:32,066
Why are you going to this party
when you're so mad at him?

475
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:36,023
I have to concentrate.
This thing is so heavy. Be quiet.

476
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:56,956
Thank you.

477
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,422
Come on!

478
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:06,304
Our next appointment is at 4:30.

479
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,107
There's the blue roof.

480
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:45,601
My name's Kiki. Someone telephoned
for a delivery service, so here l am.

481
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,966
Right this way, dear.

482
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:56,938
- You're right on time.
- Yes, ma'am.

483
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,975
Madam, the delivery girl is here.

484
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,672
What? Oh, my goodness.
Is it that time already?

485
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:09,902
What a pleasant surprise.

486
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:12,183
Please make yourself at home,
my dear.

487
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,293
- Come, come.
- Thanks.

488
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,355
May I take that for you?

489
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,005
Broom and black cat.

490
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,207
It's just like my great-grandmother
always told me.

491
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,822
My name is Kiki,
and I'm a witch.

492
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,098
Oh, but what a cute
little girl you are.

493
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:43,301
I'm so sorry, but that pie you were
supposed to deliver isn't ready yet.

494
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,875
The temperature
doesn't seem to go up at all.

495
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,589
Something's wrong.

496
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,880
Machines don't work
when they become old like me.

497
00:53:57,501 --> 00:54:00,981
I was hoping you could deliver it hot
to my grandchild's birthday party.

498
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:05,882
It's one of my favorite recipes:
herring and pumpkin pie.

499
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,687
I guess I have to admit defeat.

500
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,479
I'll have to phone her
and tell her I'm sorry.

501
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,755
I feel just awful
having you come here for nothing.

502
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,942
Bertha!

503
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:22,037
Would you get her money, please.

504
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,656
Certainly, ma'am.

505
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,267
All of it.
Pay her the amount we agreed on.

506
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:29,067
- Oh, no. Please!
- Now, don't be silly.

507
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,340
It's not your fault
it wasn't ready.

508
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,544
I have no other jobs today.
Maybe I could help.

509
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:38,674
Does that oven over there work?

510
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,179
You mean that one?

511
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,910
It used to be the only one I ever used,
but I haven't opened it in years.

512
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:51,618
If it burns firewood, I can help.
l used to help my mom all the time.

513
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,369
It's a big job to build a fire.

514
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,428
It's a great idea, madam.

515
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,980
I never did like that electric thing,
and we have plenty of firewood.

516
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:01,761
I can build a fire.

517
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,932
Well, I'm not sure,
but if you think you can build it--

518
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,704
Have you considered that this might
make you late for< your> party?

519
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:15,908
I can't take money for nothing.

520
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:25,891
Come on.
We have to hurry up.

521
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:30,158
Look what I found.
And it works!

522
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:34,344
You're very good at this, my dear.
Your mother taught you well.

523
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,391
Oh, my goodness,
it's so exciting.

524
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:49,387
Never did like electricity.

525
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,797
It should be about time.

526
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,828
Yes, very good.
Well done.

527
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:20,953
And now we wait.

528
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:23,828
- About 40 minutes or so. Right?
- Exactly right.

529
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:28,151
- So why don't we take a little break?
- Do you need help with anything else?

530
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:32,265
Oh! Well,
if you'd really like to--

531
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,047
Thanks very much.

532
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,995
You're very welcome.

533
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:41,608
- You're going to be late for the party.
- Stop worrying.

534
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,154
It'll only take me 15 minutes
if I fly there fast.

535
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,710
Would you care for some tea?
I just made it fresh.

536
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,515
[ just remembered.
Won't you be late for your party?

537
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:57,725
It won't be a problem.
It'll take me 15 minutes from here.

538
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:03,283
But, my dear, that clock
runs about ten minutes slow.

539
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:06,694
- What'll 1 do?
- See if the pie's ready.

540
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:09,895
Bertha! Bertha!

541
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,761
- Is the pie ready?
- It smells fine, so you'd better hurry.

542
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:32,808
Better hurry!
Come on!

543
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,800
- Okay.
- Don't forget your money.

544
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,836
- That's way too much.
- Not for what you've done.

545
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,249
Hurry up, Kiki,
or you'll be late!

546
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,966
- Have a good time!
- Be careful!

547
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:54,045
What happened
to all that good weather?

548
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:56,108
My whiskers are tingling.

549
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:24,103
- Could we get out of the rain?
- We can't! That'll only make us later!

550
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:26,405
Besides, the food will get cold
if we stop.

551
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,980
Yes?

552
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,904
I have a delivery.

553
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,576
But it's completely wet.

554
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:38,881
I'm sorry. It began to rain on the way.
But the food came through all right.

555
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:42,293
I told Grandma
I didn't want that.

556
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:46,649
Oh, boy! Grandma sent over another one
of her crummy herring pies again!

557
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:50,624
Um, would you please sign
this receipt for me?

558
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,725
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.

559
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:02,049
She can't possibly have been
her granddaughter.

560
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:17,521
Do you think we can still
make it in time?

561
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,375
Look!
Tombo's down there!

562
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,723
We can still make it.

563
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,988
That certainly was
quite an ordeal.

564
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,287
That boy waited
a very long time.

565
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,642
Doesn't matter anyway.
I can't go in these wet clothes.

566
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:13,725
Kiki, what's wrong?

567
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,674
Do you have a headache?

568
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,470
Why don't we grab a bite to eat?
I know I'm famished.

569
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,307
Kiki!

570
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,330
Not feeling very well, huh?

571
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:18,775
- You have quite a fever.
- Is someone pounding on my head?

572
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:21,995
I'll bet you never dried yourself off
completely yesterday.

573
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,583
Am I gonna shrivel up and die?

574
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:32,006
You have a cold, is all
I'll bring up some medicine.

575
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,152
And you should eat something.

576
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:36,505
I'm not hungry.

577
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,033
It'll be better if you eat now.

578
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:42,116
How about some oatmeal with raisins?
Like some, Jiji?

579
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,691
Oatmeal's the best thing
for a cold.

580
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:52,917
There you go.

581
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,327
Don't burn your tongue.

582
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:03,413
Come and eat your oatmeal
before it gets cold.

583
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,650
Do I have to eat?

584
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,212
If you want to get well.

585
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,439
That boy was in the shop
a while ago this morning.

586
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,184
Huh?

587
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:17,085
When I told him you were sick,
he asked how a witch could catch a cold.

588
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,908
Oh, yes. He said he wanted
to visit you a little later.

589
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:22,561
Oh, no!

590
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,997
I figured you might say that,
so I politely refused.

591
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:29,707
You're tired.
Just relax and sleep.

592
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:34,642
I'll just open this window
so you have a little air.

593
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,737
- Osono.
-Hmm?

594
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,116
Um, never mind.

595
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:15,731
Jiji!

596
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,883
Jiji!

597
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,452
What?

598
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:50,031
Jiji!
Breakfast is ready!

599
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,500
Kiki?

600
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:54,915
- Feeling better this morning?
- Much better, thank you.

601
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,418
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I'd overslept.

602
01:04:57,794 --> 01:05:01,364
That's okay. Come down here.
I have a favor to ask of you.

603
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:03,365
Okay.

604
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,036
“Koppori.”
Is that right?

605
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,145
Uh-huh.
Is this enough money?

606
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:10,054
That's all right.
It's close enough to walk from here.

607
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:12,697
Don't be silly.
Work is work.

608
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,009
And be sure to deliver it
to him direct.

609
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:19,211
Jiji!

610
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,933
- You have work?
- It's not far away.

611
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,496
Who's your friend?

612
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,304
Lily's her name.
I'll be down.

613
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:31,187
Don't worry. I'll be back in a minute.
Pleasure to meet you.

614
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,278
Ahh!

615
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,139
Wonderful.

616
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,480
Hey! Miss Witch!

617
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:40,576
- Taking a walk?
- I'm looking for someone named Koppori.

618
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:43,462
Hey, that's my name!

619
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:48,018
Go around that way.
I'll be right with you.

620
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,049
I'll bet Osono planned this.

621
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,719
Gee, thanks a lot.

622
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,845
I want to apologize
for making you wait the other night.

623
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,530
I'm sorry you got wet.

624
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,902
Want to come over to my place?
I have something to show you.

625
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:19,701
Come on! Hurry!

626
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,481
That party was to celebrate
the completion of this thing.

627
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,606
This is the engine
of a man-propelled plane.

628
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,979
Like it?

629
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,778
We're assembling the wings and the frame
at somebody else's house.

630
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:39,482
I'm planning on flying this thing
during my summer vacation.

631
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:48,457
I got it! Let's go to the beach where
that dirigible made a forced landing!

632
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:50,629
“Dirigible"?

633
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:52,677
You didn't see it on TV?

634
01:07:53,036 --> 01:07:55,436
-l was sleeping.
- Then we have to go!

635
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:58,332
- We're going with this?
- Why not?

636
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:01,845
Il have to practice anyway.
Gotta build up my legs.

637
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,048
Okay. Ready?

638
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,303
I've never ridden
a bicycle before.

639
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:14,325
Oh, boy! Even better!

640
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:18,154
Brace the bike with your foot
until I get her revved up. Let's go!

641
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:26,957
Okay!

642
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,649
- Should I get off?
- No!

643
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,241
Go faster! Go!

644
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:09,322
That's great!
Hang in there!

645
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:16,272
Swing your body to the inside
when we go around the curve.

646
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,869
Otherwise it won't turn
very well.

647
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,486
Now!

648
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,657
Great!
You're doing fine!

649
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,948
Yahoo! Great!

650
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:51,602
- The dirigible, right?
- Right.

651
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:01,623
We're flying!

652
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,928
Tombo, are you okay?

653
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,720
- Yeah. Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

654
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:57,291
Does my face look that funny?

655
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:02,862
I'm sorry, but when we flew
over that cliff, was so scared!

656
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,920
I was scared too.

657
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,799
I'll bet you used some magic.

658
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:14,385
I'm not sure.
I was so frightened.

659
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:16,824
Your poor bike.
It's a mess.

660
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:21,646
Oh, no!
Am I in trouble!

661
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:25,108
- Will you look after the bike for me?
- What went wrong?

662
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:28,458
I pedaled too hard!
That's why it busted!

663
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,211
Wait there!

664
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:55,454
Sure would be terrific to go around
the world in a dirigible like that.

665
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,948
How'd it make you feel,
the first time you ever went flying?

666
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,758
I can't recall.
I was too young to remember.

667
01:12:02,185 --> 01:12:04,735
But my mom told me
I wasn't scared a bit.

668
01:12:05,188 --> 01:12:08,618
Gosh, I sure wish I was born
into a witch family.

669
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:11,942
You can just fly away
on a broomstick, but me--

670
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,448
That's all can do.

671
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:19,179
I don't find flying that much fun.
It's more of a job to me.

672
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:23,065
It's not fun for you, but I'd think it
would be, putting your talents to work.

673
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,749
I sort of feel
my confidence slipping.

674
01:12:26,142 --> 01:12:30,012
But I'm glad I came with you today.
I feel better sitting by the ocean.

675
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,986
I could bring you here anytime you want
and train myself at the same time.

676
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:37,330
- You're a very nice person.
- You just found out?

677
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,690
l used to think
you were some sort of clown.

678
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:41,785
My mom says the same thing.

679
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:45,488
“You clown! Quit looking up to the sky
and get back to your books!"

680
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,750
- Tombo!
- Huh?

681
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:58,308
- Hey! Guess what!
- What?

682
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,928
Something good!
Come here!

683
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:03,014
I'll be right back.
Wait here.

684
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,486
They said we could go
in the dirigible. Coming?

685
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:11,439
They what?
Wow! Of course!

686
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,424
Hey, who's your girlfriend?

687
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,716
That's Kiki the Witch.
She even flies. Come on over, Kiki!

688
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,385
They're gonna show us around
inside that dirigible!

689
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:21,980
No, thanks.

690
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,861
Ah, come on.
It'll be fun.

691
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:27,884
Express Home Delivery.
I'm positive that's her.

692
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,997
- You mean she's a working girl?
- My, how independent.

693
01:13:31,474 --> 01:13:33,694
Come on.
I'll introduce you to everybody.

694
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,360
No, thanks.
See you later.

695
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:37,709
What's the matter?

696
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,758
What are you so mad about?

697
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,610
I'm not mad at all.

698
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,911
Il have a lot of work to do,
so just leave me alone.

699
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,242
Tombo, forget her!
Come on!

700
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:35,195
I think something's wrong with me.

701
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,851
I make friends, then suddenly
I can't bear to be with any of them.

702
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:41,212
Seems like that other me,
the cheerful and honest one...

703
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,240
went away somewhere.

704
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:54,185
Some friend you are.

705
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,960
Jiji, ] don't care
if you do have a girlfriend.

706
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:30,434
You can't be late
for every meal.

707
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,490
And clean up after yourself.

708
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:36,232
What are you talking
like a cat for?

709
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:45,423
Jiji.

710
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,744
Oh, no! Talk to me!

711
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,807
You mean
you can't speak anymore?

712
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:54,849
Jiji!

713
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:56,844
I wonder what happened to him.

714
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:00,139
Il can't figure out
a word he says anymore.

715
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:01,759
Oh, my gosh!

716
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,711
I'm losing my witch's powers.

717
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,489
You can't fly anymore?
Have you lost your magic?

718
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:35,460
It's become very weak, so I think I've
gotta take a break from delivery work.

719
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:39,928
But I'll work really hard in the bakery,
so please let me stay in my room.

720
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,612
Of course you can stay.

721
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:45,435
Will your powers come back
after you've rested?

722
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:48,788
I don't know. Maybe.
I can make another broom, but...

723
01:18:53,996 --> 01:18:55,426
Hey, look!

724
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:34,635
It's me, Tombo. Did you see me today?
I was waving at you from the dirigible.

725
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:37,884
The captain allowed me into the
control cabin during the test flight.

726
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,630
It was great!

727
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,078
<Hello?
<Kiki, are you there?

728
01:19:42,478 --> 01:19:44,208
Please don't call me anymore.

729
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:48,526
<What? I can barely hear you.
<The captain said he'd like to meet you.

730
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,264
What? Hey, come on!
Don't hang up!

731
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:57,137
What's wrong?
You don't look like you feel well.

732
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,434
I'm still training
to be a witch.

733
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:04,046
If llose my magic, that means
I've lost absolutely everything.

734
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,285
Kiki!

735
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,394
Hi!

736
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:43,295
You didn't come pay me a visit,
so I had to come visit you.

737
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,089
- I'm sorry.
- Well, l also came to shop a little.

738
01:20:47,643 --> 01:20:50,393
Come on in. I'm done now.
We can take a break.

739
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:53,099
You'd better believe I will.

740
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,135
- Nice place you have.
- Help yourself to these.

741
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:02,367
- I'll make some fresh tea.
- No tea, thanks. Do you have some milk?

742
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,088
Sure.

743
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:11,509
Well, well.
Positively amazing.

744
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:15,367
He's the spitting image of
that stuffed cat. You're Jiji, right?

745
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:20,473
How's the home delivery business?

746
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:28,102
- That bad, huh?
- I'm not working much now.

747
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:40,583
I thought
you seemed depressed.

748
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:43,369
I didn't know things like that
happened to witches.

749
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:51,921
Hey! Why not come and stay
at my little place?

750
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:53,894
Huh?

751
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:57,398
Tell your boss you need a break.
They can live without you for a night.

752
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,406
How about it, pussy cat?

753
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,390
Rather be
with your girlfriend, huh?

754
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:08,212
Come on! Let's go!

755
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,111
Hurry!
The bus is leaving!

756
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:13,647
I'm bushed!

757
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,994
It's so beautiful here.

758
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:30,171
Must've been blind, with two
beautiful girls in front of him.

759
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:55,711
What do you mean,
you thought I was a boy?

760
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:58,304
Well, look at the way
you're dressed.

761
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,480
Tell me what kind of boy
has these legs, mister.

762
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:12,528
- Crows!
- We've become real close friends.

763
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:14,210
Wow.

764
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:16,973
Hello, everybody.
We're home again.

765
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,818
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry I bothered you before.

766
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:28,657
Make yourself at home
while I get some water.

767
01:25:23,986 --> 01:25:25,215
Like it?

768
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:26,567
Amazing.

769
01:25:26,822 --> 01:25:29,432
I got the idea for it
after we met the first time.

770
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:33,882
But I really haven't got
the girl's face right.

771
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:36,826
I've been waiting for you to come back
to get it right.

772
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:39,545
- You mean, that's me?
- Yes.

773
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,018
Would you be my model?

774
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:44,244
But I'm not very beautiful.
Why do you want me?

775
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:53,064
You've got a great face. Besides,
it's prettier than it was the last time.

776
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:56,371
Come on. Don't be scared.
Sit here.

777
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:02,062
Lift up your head a little.

778
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:05,234
Look beyond the horizon.
Don't move. Very good.

779
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:09,579
Painting and magical powers
seem to be very similar.

780
01:26:10,032 --> 01:26:13,752
- Sometimes I can't paint a thing.
- You mean it? Then what happens?

781
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:16,739
Kiki, don't move!
Don't look over here.

782
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:22,604
Without even thinking about it
l used to be able to fly.

783
01:26:23,145 --> 01:26:26,275
Now I can't even begin to remember
how I ever managed to do it.

784
01:26:29,084 --> 01:26:31,773
At times like that,
you know what I do? Paint.

785
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,857
That gets rid of my frustrations.

786
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:38,029
- But still, if] can't fly--
- Then I just stop.

787
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,800
Take long walks,
look at the scenery, doze off at noon.

788
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,866
Don't do a single thing.

789
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,308
Then, suddenly,
you'll be able to fly again.

790
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:46,961
Maybe that'll help.

791
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:50,014
Trust me. It'll happen.
Come on, don't ruin the pose.

792
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:15,493
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to become an artist.

793
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:19,204
Il loved painting.
l even painted in my sleep.

794
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:22,514
Then one day, for no reason,
I became unable to paint.

795
01:27:24,139 --> 01:27:27,009
So I painted and painted some more,
but none of it was any good.

796
01:27:27,509 --> 01:27:31,429
They were copies of paintings
I'd seen somewhere before.

797
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,710
Just copies of ones
I'd seen somewhere.

798
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:37,143
I swore I'd paint my own pictures.

799
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,600
That must've been hard.

800
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:44,476
But after that...
it's not much easier now.

801
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:48,273
I think I found what painting means,
at least for me.

802
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:53,139
To fly, you don't chant
a spell or something, right?

803
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:56,058
Mm-hmm.
We fly with our spirit.

804
01:27:56,505 --> 01:27:59,495
The witch's spirit? Perfect!
That's what I'm talking about.

805
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:02,617
The spirit of witches.
The spirit of artists.

806
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:04,568
The spirit of bakers!

807
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:08,234
I suppose it must be
a power given by God.

808
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:10,496
Sometimes you suffer for it.

809
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:15,060
I guess I never gave witchcraft
much thought.

810
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:19,050
That talk about discipline and training
was so old-fashioned.

811
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,237
I was so happy that you came
all that way to see me.

812
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:26,857
If l had been alone tonight, I would've
been one giant ball of frustration.

813
01:28:27,536 --> 01:28:32,196
There have been many times I've thought
of painting over that painting.

814
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:35,050
Why?
It's so beautiful.

815
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:36,673
You know,
when I saw you today...

816
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:39,495
l looked at your sad face
and thought, "I've found it!"

817
01:28:39,948 --> 01:28:42,938
- 1 knew I could paint you.
- But that's not fair!

818
01:28:45,387 --> 01:28:47,786
All's fair in love and art.

819
01:28:48,223 --> 01:28:49,923
- Let's go to sleep.
- Okay.

820
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:55,977
- Sorry about taking your bed from you.
- Don't worry about it.

821
01:28:59,201 --> 01:29:01,011
Can I visit you
once in a while?

822
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:04,709
Sure. Anytime during the summer.
That is, if l can visit you too.

823
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:06,503
Uh-huh!

824
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:13,032
<The intercontinental dirigible
Freedom Adventurer...

825
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:15,118
<recently downed
<in a spectacular forced landing...

826
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:18,519
<due to torrential rains
<just outside the city limits...

827
01:29:19,054 --> 01:29:20,834
<has now been repaired.

828
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,149
Hello.
Gutiokipan Bakery.

829
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:25,195
Kiki, how was it?

830
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:29,852
Take plenty of time
and get rested up.

831
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:33,355
<That elderly lady you made the delivery
<for has something else for you to take.

832
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:35,539
<Should I tell her no?

833
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:39,091
I've told her you'd be away
for some time, but she kept insisting.

834
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:43,162
Then stop on your way back.
Bye.

835
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:04,971
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Well, well.

836
01:30:05,367 --> 01:30:07,887
We've been expecting you.
Come in.

837
01:30:10,205 --> 01:30:13,455
<There are less than five minutes
<to takeoff now.

838
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:18,666
- Very nice to see you again, ma'am.
-I'm glad you came.

839
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:23,190
Excuse me for not standing, but my legs
are bothering me more than usual.

840
01:30:23,852 --> 01:30:25,022
Bertha, bring the package.

841
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:26,597
Yes!

842
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:28,558
l hope it hasn't taken off yet.

843
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:29,970
Not yet.

844
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:33,295
Bertha's absolutely mad
about lighter-than-air travel.

845
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:35,498
I'm the adventuresome type.

846
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:38,568
Turn the volume down.

847
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:41,884
Would you open the box?

848
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,534
Uh-huh.

849
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,239
You want me to deliver it?

850
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:55,097
Would you please deliver it
to a girl named Kiki?

851
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:57,480
She was kind to me
and a tremendous help.

852
01:30:57,852 --> 01:30:59,522
It's my way of saying "thank you.”

853
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:03,284
And would you find out
when her next birthday might be?

854
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:06,408
Then I'll be able
to bake her another one.

855
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,230
Kiki.

856
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:20,315
I will. And I'm sure Kiki will
want to know the lady's birthday...

857
01:31:20,909 --> 01:31:23,098
so she'll be able
to give her a present.

858
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:25,181
You've got a deal.

859
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:42,021
- What happened?
- There's been a terrible catastrophe.

860
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,927
<Oh, no! The tie-down ropes holding
<the blimp are breaking one by one!

861
01:31:45,367 --> 01:31:47,417
<It's drifting straight toward
<our television cameras.

862
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:50,291
<My God, it's going to--

863
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,280
Oh! They always leave me hanging
at the most exciting part!

864
01:31:56,945 --> 01:31:59,115
These winds always come
in midsummer.

865
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,444
They'll be hitting us
pretty soon.

866
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,223
It'll pass by quickly.
Don't worry.

867
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:09,425
Oh, goody, it's back on.
Look!

868
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:16,661
Look at that!
It's completely upside-down!

869
01:32:17,232 --> 01:32:19,372
<The> Freedom Adventurer
<has been shaken by great winds--

870
01:32:19,768 --> 01:32:21,518
It's like a balloon
in that position.

871
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:25,269
<It has broken loose from its mooring and
<drifted into an upside-down position.

872
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,270
<A desperate, last-ditch effort is
<being made to tie the dirigible down...

873
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:31,544
<and keep it from drifting away.

874
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:37,564
<It's extremely doubtful whether
<it can be done-- Oh, no! It's useless!

875
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:41,359
That's my friend Tombo
holding on to that rope!

876
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,880
<.,.attached to the end of the cable
<as though it were a toy!

877
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:48,003
<There's a young boy
<hanging on to the cable!

878
01:32:48,463 --> 01:32:51,273
<He's being lifted away
<along with the police car!

879
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,576
<I don't believe what I'm seeing!
<Oh, the humanity!

880
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:58,030
- Are you sure it's your friend?
- Il have to go!

881
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:00,910
- Be careful!
- Oh, dear. What's happening?

882
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:28,273
Hold on there, son!
Just hold your grip steady!

883
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,440
Release the helium
from the tail!

884
01:33:55,897 --> 01:34:00,347
<All citizens are requested
<to remain calm. Do not panic.

885
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:03,619
<The helium inside the dirigible
<will not explode.

886
01:34:04,772 --> 01:34:06,062
Tombo.

887
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:09,195
Any word about the boy
hanging on the rope?

888
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:12,631
The latest report was that
the police car dropped into a pool!

889
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:28,701
<Clear the street!
<Get on the sidewalk!

890
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:30,903
<You there in that car!
<Do not block the street!

891
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:38,480
Are you feeling all right?

892
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,887
Please, sir,
may I borrow your broom?

893
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,679
- Huh?
- 1 promise I'll bring it right back.

894
01:34:48,116 --> 01:34:50,666
- Well, l suppose that's okay.
- Thank you very much!

895
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:29,196
Fly.

896
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,290
Oh, my goodness!

897
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,230
Hey! Oh, no!

898
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:53,477
Look out!

899
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:03,446
Straighten up and fly right,
or I'll burn you!

900
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:12,469
The boy appears safe...

901
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,727
but the dirigible is on a collision
course directly for the clock tower.

902
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:17,183
If the wind doesn't shift direction...

903
01:36:17,572 --> 01:36:20,352
the< Freedom Adventurer
will surely smash into the tower!

904
01:36:22,677 --> 01:36:25,337
We gotta get up higher!
We're gonna hit the tower!

905
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:27,243
There's not enough helium!

906
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:29,657
Before we hit,
jump onto the tower!

907
01:36:30,051 --> 01:36:31,281
Aye, aye, Captain!

908
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:33,661
Hey there!
Over here! Come on!

909
01:36:34,055 --> 01:36:36,715
- Get out of the way!
- Grab hold of this!

910
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:56,012
That way! Hurry!

911
01:36:56,377 --> 01:36:57,667
Oh, no!

912
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:14,206
That sound
is the helium gas leaking.

913
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:17,725
The condition of the boy is unknown.
From where I'm standing-- Oh, no!

914
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:25,721
Too much gas has escaped,
and it's falling!

915
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:38,287
It's snagged
on another building!

916
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:41,228
- Hey, look! Over there!
- It's a miracle!

917
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:44,059
The boy has managed
to keep hold of the rope!

918
01:37:44,492 --> 01:37:47,042
It's a miracle!
But how can anyone rescue him now?

919
01:37:47,495 --> 01:37:49,894
That boy is hanging on
for dear life.

920
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:52,001
Something just flew by!

921
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:53,562
Is it a bird?

922
01:37:53,835 --> 01:37:56,645
No, no, it's not a bird!
It's a young girl!

923
01:37:57,138 --> 01:37:59,688
<Yes, there is a young girl
<soaring through the sky!

924
01:38:00,141 --> 01:38:01,811
Wow! Go, girl!

925
01:38:02,143 --> 01:38:04,453
- She can fly now!
- Get ‘em, Kiki!

926
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:05,989
Tombo!

927
01:38:07,248 --> 01:38:08,298
Kiki!

928
01:38:10,852 --> 01:38:14,102
Come on!
Be a good broom and help me out!

929
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:16,554
Hang on, young fella!
Don't give up!

930
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:19,354
Hold on!
She's almost there!

931
01:38:19,794 --> 01:38:21,983
Tombo!

932
01:38:22,397 --> 01:38:23,327
Kiki!

933
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:31,074
Hold on!
Don't give up now!

934
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:35,040
Don't give up, son.

935
01:38:39,347 --> 01:38:41,897
Don't give up! Don't give up!

936
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:53,521
She caught him in midair!
I've never seen anything so amazing!

937
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:19,434
That broom is mine.
I gave it to her myself.

938
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:22,107
She did it!
She did it!

939
01:39:23,524 --> 01:39:25,194
You're so brave, Kiki.

940
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:26,956
Positively amazing.

941
01:39:29,397 --> 01:39:31,067
Better call the hospital.

942
01:39:31,399 --> 01:39:33,069
I'll be ready any minute now.

943
01:39:41,209 --> 01:39:42,438
Jiji!

944
01:42:23,938 --> 01:42:25,958
We just got a letter
from Kiki!

945
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:34,094
“Dear Mother and Father,
How are you doing? Jiji and I are fine."

946
01:42:34,749 --> 01:42:37,179
<Regarding my work, it certainly seems
<everything is falling into place.

947
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:39,488
<I'm even starting
<to gain some confidence.

948
01:42:39,854 --> 01:42:41,754
<There are still times
<when I feel sad...

949
01:42:42,123 --> 01:42:43,992
<but all in all,
<I sure love this town.
