1
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,655
This is the story of how I died.

2
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,639
But don't worry, this is a fun story,
and the truth is, it isn't even mine.

3
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,878
This is the story of a girl
named Rapunzel.

4
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,068
And it starts with the sun.

5
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,359
And it starts with the sun.

6
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:16,746
Once upon a time, a single drop
of sunlight fell from the heavens.

7
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:22,361
And from this small drop of sun
grew a magic golden flower.

8
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,794
It had the ability to heal
the sick and injured.

9
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,791
You see that old woman over there?
You might want to remember her.

10
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,196
She's kind of important.

11
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,858
Centuries passed

12
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,157
and a hop, skip and a boat ride away
there grew a kingdom.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,180
The kingdom was ruled
by a beloved king and queen.

14
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,878
And the queen
was about to have a baby.

15
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:48,808
But she got sick.

16
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:50,926
Really sick.

17
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:52,952
She was running out of time,

18
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,872
and that's when people
Start to look for a miracle.

19
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,250
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.

20
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,704
! told you she'd be important.

21
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,012
Instead of sharing the sun's gift,

22
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,732
this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power

23
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,061
and used it to keep herself young
for hundreds of years.

24
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,585
And all she had to do
was sing a special song.

25
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,959
Flower, gleam and glow

26
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,417
Let your power shine

27
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,218
Make the clock reverse

28
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,084
Bring back what once was mine

29
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,432
What once was mine

30
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,491
You get the gist. She sings to it,
she turns young. Creepy, right?

31
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,740
We found it!

32
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:01,147
The magic of the golden flower
healed the queen.

33
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:06,956
A healthy baby girl, a princess
was born, with beautiful golden hair.

34
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,940
I'll give you a hint, that's Rapunzel.

35
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,344
To celebrate her birth,

36
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,502
the king and queen
launched a flying lantern into the sky.

37
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,158
And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.

38
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,827
And then that moment ended.

39
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,357
Flower, gleam and glow

40
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,990
Let your power shine

41
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,414
Make the clock...

42
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,708
Gothel broke into the castle,
stole the child,

43
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,889
and just like that, gone!

44
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,339
The kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the princess.

45
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,773
For deep within the forest,
in a hidden tower,

46
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,542
Gothel raised the child as her own.

47
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,291
Save what has been lost

48
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:21,224
Bring back what once was mine

49
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,075
What once was mine

50
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,777
Gothel had found
her new magic flower,

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,539
but this time,
she was determined to keep it hidden.

52
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,757
Why can't I go outside?

53
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,483
The outside world is a dangerous place,

54
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,099
filled with horrible, selfish people.

55
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,202
You must stay here, where you're safe.

56
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,080
Do you understand, flower?

57
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,553
Yes, Mommy.

58
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:52,003
But the walls of that tower
could not hide everything.

59
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,156
Each year, on her birthday,

60
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,530
the king and queen released
thousands of lanterns into the sky

61
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:05,487
in hope that one day
their lost princess would return.

62
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,702
Well, l guess
Pascal's not hiding out here.

63
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,188
Gotcha!

64
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:42,051
That's 22 for me.
How about 23 out of 45?

65
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,883
Okay. Well, what do you want to do?

66
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:53,142
Yeah. I don't think so.
l like it in here, and so do you.

67
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,566
Come on, Pascal.
It's not so bad in there.

68
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,045
Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup

69
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,099
Start on the chores
And sweep till the floor's all clean

70
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,274
Polish and wax, do laundry
and mop and shine up

71
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:28,688
Sweep again and by then it's, like, 7:15

72
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:33,192
And so I'll read a book
Or maybe two or three

73
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:37,547
lll add a few new paintings
to my gallery

74
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,943
ll play guitar and knit
and cook and basically

75
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,519
Just wonder when will my life begin?

76
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,139
Then after lunch it's puzzles
and darts and baking

77
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,654
Papier-machÃ©, a bit of ballet and chess

78
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,658
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle-making

79
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,295
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch
Take a climb, sew a dress

80
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,426
And I'll reread the books
If l have time to spare

81
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,844
lll paint the walls some more
I'm sure there's room somewhere

82
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:26,315
And then I'll brush and brush
and brush and brush my hair

83
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,927
Stuck in the same place
I've always been

84
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:35,974
And I'll keep wondering and wondering
and wondering and wondering

85
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,650
When will my life begin?

86
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:45,022
Tomorrow night

87
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,262
the lights will appear

88
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,342
Just like they do

89
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,060
on my birthday each year

90
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,050
What is it like

91
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,984
out there where they glow

92
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,719
Now that I'm older

93
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,676
Mother might just let me go

94
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,671
Wow! I could get used
to a view like this.

95
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,798
Rider, come on!

96
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:51,697
Hold on. Yep. I'm used to it.
Guys, I want a castle.

97
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,292
We do this job,
you can buy your own castle.

98
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,778
-Hay fever?
-Yeah.

99
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,270
Wait! Hey, wait!

100
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,887
Can't you picture me in a castle
of my own? Because I certainly can.

101
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,816
All the things we've seen,
and it's only 8:00 in the morning!

102
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,953
Gentlemen, this is a very big day!

103
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,540
This is it! This is a very big day, Pascal.

104
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,601
I'm finally going to do it.
I'm going to ask her.

105
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,855
Rapunzel!

106
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,107
Let down your hair!

107
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,180
It's time!

108
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,485
I know, I know.
Come on. Don't let her see you.

109
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:51,701
Rapunzel!
I'm not getting any younger down here!

110
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,402
Coming, Mother!

111
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,135
Hi. Welcome home, Mother.

112
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,394
Rapunzel, how you manage to do that

113
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,641
every single day without fail.

114
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,238
It looks absolutely exhausting, darling.

115
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,710
Oh, it's nothing.

116
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,089
Then I don't know why it takes so long.

117
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,578
Oh, darling, I'm just teasing.

118
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,233
All right.

119
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,374
So, Mother, as you know
tomorrow is a very big day...

120
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,248
Rapunzel, look in that mirror.

121
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,836
You know what I see?

122
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,654
l see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

123
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,189
Oh, look, you're here, too.

124
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,545
I'm just teasing.
Stop taking everything so seriously.

125
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,149
Okay. So, Mother,
as I was saying, tomorrow is...

126
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,735
Rapunzel,
Mother's feeling a little run-down.

127
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,741
Would you sing for me, dear?
Then we'll talk.

128
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,221
Of course, Mother.

129
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,078
Flower, gleam and glow
Let your power shine

130
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,776
Make the clock reverse
Bring back what once was mine

131
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,631
Heal what has been hurt
Change the Fates' design

132
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,730
Save what has been lost
Bring back what once was mine

133
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,605
-Rapunzel!
-So, Mother,

134
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,411
earlier l was saying tomorrow
is a big day, and you didn't respond.

135
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,257
So, I'm just going to tell you,
it's my birthday!

136
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,242
-Ta-da!
-No, no, no. Can't be.

137
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,626
I distinctly remember.
Your birthday was last year.

138
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,913
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

139
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:49,221
Mother, I'm turning 18,
and I wanted to ask...

140
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,647
What I really want for this birthday...

141
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,128
Actually what I wanted
for quite a few birthdays now...

142
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,385
Rapunzel, please,
stop with the mumbling.

143
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,030
You know how I feel about
the mumbling. Blah-blah-blah-blah.

144
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,793
It's very annoying!
I'm just teasing. You're adorable.

145
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,803
l love you so much, darling.

146
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,327
I want to see the floating lights.

147
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,168
What?

148
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,746
I was hoping you would take me
to see the floating lights.

149
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,157
You mean the stars.

150
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,790
That's the thing.

151
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,962
I've charted stars,
and they're always constant.

152
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,785
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

153
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,053
Only on my birthday.

154
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:39,898
And I can't help but feel like
they're meant for me.

155
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,064
I need to see them, Mother.

156
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:46,466
And not just from my window, in person.

157
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,280
I have to know what they are.

158
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,242
You want to go outside?
Why, Rapunzel...

159
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,927
Look at you, as fragile as a flower

160
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,381
Still a little sapling, just a sprout

161
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,438
You know why we stay up in this tower

162
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,254
-l know, but...
-That's right.

163
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,922
To keep you safe and sound, dear

164
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,830
Guess I always knew
this day was coming

165
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,530
Knew that soon
you'd want to leave the nest

166
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,613
Soon but not yet

167
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,085
Shh!
Trust me, pet

168
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,071
Mother knows best

169
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,564
Mother knows best
Listen to your mother

170
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,624
It's a scary world out there

171
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,420
Mother knows best

172
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,325
One way or another
Something will go wrong

173
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,214
! swear

174
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,949
Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand

175
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,229
Cannibals and snakes, the plague

176
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,521
-No!
-Yes.

177
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,069
Also large bugs
Men with pointy teeth

178
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,485
And stop! No more, you'll just upset me

179
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,629
Mother's right here
Mother will protect you

180
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,942
Darling, here's what I suggest

181
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,069
Skip the drama
Stay with Mama

182
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,866
Mother knows best

183
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,177
Mother knows best
Take it from your mumsy

184
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,079
On your own, you won't survive

185
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,072
Sloppy, underdressed
Immature, clumsy

186
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,015
Please, they'll eat you up alive

187
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,212
Gullible, naive
Positively grubby

188
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,098
Ditsy and a bit... Well, hmm, vague

189
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,024
Plus, ! believe, getting kind of chubby

190
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm just saying âcause I wuv you

191
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,300
Mother understands
Mother's here to help you

192
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:43,378
All l have is one request

193
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,401
-Rapunzel?
-Yes?

194
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,558
Don't ever ask to leave this tower again.

195
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,110
Yes, Mother.

196
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,263
l love you very much, dear.

197
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,640
Il love you more.

198
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,042
l love you most.

199
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,345
Don't forget it

200
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,901
You'll regret it

201
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:19,367
Mother knows best

202
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,743
Ta-ta! I'll see you in a bit, my flower!

203
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,822
I'll be here.

204
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,860
Oh, no.

205
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,480
This is bad. This is very, very bad.

206
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,218
This is really bad.

207
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,674
They just can't get my nose right.

208
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,230
Who cares?

209
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,218
It's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.

210
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,543
All right. Okay.
Give me a boost and I'll pull you up.

211
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,646
Give us the satchel first.

212
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,138
I can't believe that after all we've been
through together, you don't trust me?

213
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,025
Ouch.

214
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,904
Now help us up, pretty boy!

215
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,699
Sorry, my hands are full.

216
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,040
What?

217
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,781
Rider!

218
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,232
Retrieve that satchel at any cost!

219
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,700
Yes, sir!

220
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,662
We got him now, Maximus.

221
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,105
Come on, fleabag! Forward!

222
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,119
No.

223
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:50,271
Stop it! Stop it!
Give it to me! Give me that!

224
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,395
Alone at last.

225
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,069
Okay. I've got a person in my closet.

226
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,792
I've got a person in my closet.

227
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,749
I've got a person in my closet!

228
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,166
Too weak to handle myself out there,
huh, Mother?

229
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,305
Well, tell that to my frying pan.

230
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,723
Rapunzel!

231
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,213
Let down your hair!

232
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,202
One moment, Mother!

233
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,220
I have a big surprise!

234
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,593
I do, too!

235
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,995
I bet my surprise is bigger!

236
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,661
l seriously doubt it.

237
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:32,305
I brought back parsnips. I'm going
to make hazelnut soup for dinner.

238
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,898
Your favorite. Surprise!

239
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,367
Well, Mother,
there's something I want to tell you.

240
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,246
Oh, Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

241
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,833
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

242
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,279
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said earlier.

243
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,854
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

244
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,377
"Floating lights,"
and, yes, I'm leading up to that.

245
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,959
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

246
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,182
No, Mother, I'm just saying,

247
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,711
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

248
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,949
I know you're not strong enough
to handle yourself out there.

249
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,316
-But if you just...
-We're done talking about this.

250
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,007
-Trust me! I know what I'm...
-Rapunzel.

251
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,639
-Oh, come on!
-Enough with the lights!

252
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,925
You are not leaving this tower! Ever!

253
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:24,035
Great. Now I'm the bad guy.

254
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,439
All l was going to say, Mother, is that...

255
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,891
I know what I want for my birthday now.

256
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,072
And what is that?

257
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,898
New paint.

258
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,660
The paint made from the white shells
you once brought me.

259
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:55,673
That is a very long trip, Rapunzel.
Almost three daysâ time.

260
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:01,022
I just thought it was a better idea
than the stars.

261
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,831
You'll be all right on your own?

262
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,321
I know I'm safe as long as I'm here.

263
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,865
I'll be back in three days' time.

264
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,122
l love you very much, dear.

265
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,505
l love you more.

266
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,601
l love you most.

267
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,439
Okay.

268
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,873
Is this hair?

269
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,754
Struggling... Struggling is pointless.

270
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,694
I know why you're here,
and I'm not afraid of you.

271
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,091
What?

272
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,032
Who are you?
And how did you find me?

273
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,872
Who are you, and how did you find me?

274
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,312
I know not who you are,
nor how I came to find you.

275
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,554
But may I just say...

276
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,670
Hi.

277
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,524
How you doing?
The name's Flynn Rider.

278
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,069
How's your day going?

279
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,885
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Rider?

280
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,272
-All right, blondie.
-Rapunzel.

281
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,094
Gesundheit. Here's the deal.

282
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,923
l was in a situation,
gallivanting through the forest.

283
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,362
Il came across your tower and...

284
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,226
Where is my satchel?

285
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,488
I've hidden it.
Somewhere you'll never find it.

286
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,434
It's in that pot, isn't it?

287
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,113
Would you stop that?

288
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,918
Now it's hidden
where you'll never find it.

289
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,612
So, what do you want with my hair?
To cut it?

290
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,282
-What?
-Sell it?

291
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,757
No! Listen, the only thing
l want to do with your hair

292
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,647
is to get out of it, literally.

293
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:28,187
Wait. You don't want my hair?

294
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:30,314
Why on earth would I want your hair?

295
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,928
Look, I was being chased,
l saw a tower, I climbed it.

296
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,602
-End of story.
-You're telling the truth?

297
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,164
Yes.

298
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,745
I know. l need someone to take me.

299
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,931
I think he's telling the truth, too.

300
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:58,057
He doesn't have fangs.
But what choice do I have?

301
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,825
Okay, Flynn Rider,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

302
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,995
-Deal?
-Look this way.

303
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,273
Do you know what these are?

304
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,442
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

305
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,416
Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars.

306
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,984
Well, tomorrow evening,

307
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,766
they will light the night sky
with these lanterns.

308
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:28,467
You will act as my guide,
take me to these lanterns,

309
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,377
and return me home safely.

310
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:34,456
Then, and only then,
will l return your satchel to you.

311
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,129
That is my deal.

312
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,551
Yeah.

313
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,010
No can do.

314
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,625
Unfortunately the kingdom and I
aren't exactly simpatico at the moment,

315
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,149
so won't be taking you anywhere.

316
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,845
Something brought you here,
Flynn Rider.

317
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,565
Call it what you will,

318
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,296
-fate, destiny...
-A horse.

319
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,759
So I have made the decision
to trust you.

320
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,041
A horrible decision, really.

321
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,966
But trust me when I tell you this.

322
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,354
You can tear this tower apart
brick by brick,

323
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:17,014
but without my help, you will never find
your precious satchel.

324
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,327
Let me get this straight.

325
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,402
l take you to see the lanterns,
bring you back home,

326
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,504
and you'll give me back my satchel?

327
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,140
I promise.

328
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:33,301
And when I promise something,
I never, ever break that promise.

329
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,445
Ever.

330
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,962
All right, listen.
I didn't want to have to do this,

331
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,868
but you leave me no choice.

332
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,491
Here comes the smolder.

333
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,804
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.

334
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,947
Fine! I'll take you to see the lanterns.

335
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,436
Really?

336
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,504
Oops.

337
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,436
You broke my smolder.

338
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,960
Are you coming, blondie?

339
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,342
Look at the world so close
And I'm halfway to it

340
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:32,634
Look at it all so big
Dol even dare

341
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:37,466
Look at me, there at last
I just have to do it

342
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:42,236
Should 1? No
Here I go

343
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:18,532
Just smell the grass, the dirt
Just like 1 dreamed they'd be

344
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:25,339
Just feel that summer breeze
The way it's calling me

345
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:32,346
For, like, the first time ever
I'm completely free

346
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:37,826
! could go running and racing

347
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,037
And dancing and chasing

348
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,938
And leaping and bounding
Hair flying, heart pounding

349
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:48,133
And splashing and reeling
and finally feeling

350
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:54,937
That's when my life begins

351
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,935
l can't believe I did this!

352
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,775
l can't believe I did this.
l can't believe I did this!

353
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,573
Mother would be so furious.

354
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,830
But that's okay. What she doesn't know
won't kill her, right?

355
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,766
Oh, my gosh! This would kill her.

356
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,146
This is so fun!

357
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,530
lam a horrible daughter.
I'm going back.

358
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,300
lam never going back!

359
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,423
lam a despicable human being!

360
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,098
Best day ever!

361
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,490
You know,
I can't help but notice you seem

362
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,193
a little at war with yourself here.

363
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,653
-What?
-I'm only picking up bits and pieces.

364
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,266
Overprotective mother,
forbidden road trip. This is serious stuff.

365
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,037
But let me ease your conscience.
This is part of growing up.

366
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:09,207
A little rebellion, a little adventure,
that's good. Healthy, even.

367
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,586
You think?

368
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,574
I know. You're way over-thinking this,
trust me.

369
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,841
Does your mother deserve it? No.

370
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,745
Would this break her heart
and crush her soul? Of course.

371
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,009
But you've got to do it.

372
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,445
"Break her heart"?

373
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,387
-In half.
-"Crush her soul"?

374
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,791
Like a grape.

375
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,672
She would be heartbroken. You're right.

376
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,215
lam, aren't I? Oh, bother.

377
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,189
All right. l can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm letting you out of the deal.

378
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,481
-What?
-That's right, but don't thank me.

379
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,737
Let's turn around and get you home.
Here's your pan, here's your frog.

380
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,307
l get back my satchel,

381
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,492
you get back a mother-daughter
relationship based on mutual trust,

382
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:56,779
and voila,
we part ways as unlikely friends.

383
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,929
No. lam seeing those lanterns.

384
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,565
Oh, come on! What is it going to take
for me to get my satchel back?

385
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,509
I will use this.

386
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,597
ls it ruffians? Thugs?
Have they come for me?

387
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,367
Stay calm. It can probably smell fear.

388
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,189
Sorry. Guess I'm just a little bit jumpy.

389
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:29,027
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians
and thugs, though.

390
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,505
Yeah, that would probably be best.

391
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,562
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.

392
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,065
Where?

393
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,681
Don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.

394
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,678
A palace horse.

395
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,611
Where's your rider?

396
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:28,862
Rapunzel!

397
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,658
Rapunzel! Let down your hair!

398
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:56,485
I know it's around here somewhere.

399
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,752
Ah, there it is! The Snuggly Duckling.

400
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,626
Don't worry. Very quaint place.
Perfect for you.

401
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,192
Don't want you scaring and giving up
on this whole endeavor now, do we?

402
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,712
-Well, I do like ducklings.
-Yay!

403
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,784
Garcon, your finest table, please!

404
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,810
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.

405
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,563
Really let that seep in.
What are you getting?

406
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:31,196
To me, it's part man-smell and the other
part is really bad man-smell.

407
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,560
I don't know why, but overall it smells
like the color brown. Your thoughts?

408
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,067
That's a lot of hair.

409
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,506
She's growing it out.
Is that blood in your mustache?

410
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,202
Goldie, look at all the blood
in his mustache!

411
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,468
Good sir, that's a lot of blood!

412
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:50,875
You don't look so good, blondie. Maybe
we should get you home, call it a day.

413
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:54,086
Probably better off.
This is a five-star joint.

414
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:57,441
If you can't handle this place, maybe
you should be back in your tower.

415
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:57,672
If you can't handle this place, maybe
you should be back in your tower.

416
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,194
Is this you?

417
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,948
-Now they're just being mean.
-It's him, all right.

418
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,710
-Now they're just being mean.
-It's him, all right.

419
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,198
Greno, go find some guards.

420
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,581
That reward
is going to buy me a new hook.

421
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:16,111
-l could use the money.
-What about me? I'm broke!

422
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,478
Get back!

423
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:18,856
-Mine!
-Ruffians, stop!

424
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:21,587
-We can work this out!
-Leave him alone!

425
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,083
Gentlemen, please!

426
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,263
Give me back my guide! Ruffians!

427
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,423
Not the nose! Not the nose!

428
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,204
Put him down!

429
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,682
I don't know where I am, and I need him
to take me to see the lanterns

430
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,809
because I've been dreaming about them
my entire life!

431
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:55,572
Find your humanity!
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?

432
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,569
l had a dream once.

433
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:23,721
I'm malicious, mean and scary
My sneer could curdle dairy

434
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,435
And violence-wise
my hands are not the cleanest

435
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:31,625
But despite my evil look
And my temper and my hook

436
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,334
I've always yearned
to be a concert pianist

437
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,526
Can't you see me on the stage
performing Mozart

438
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,828
Tickling the ivories till they gleam

439
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,714
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show tune medley

440
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,089
Thank you!

441
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,690
âCause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

442
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,083
He's got a dream
He's got a dream

443
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:59,053
See, ain't as cruel and vicious
asi seem

444
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:02,850
Though I do like breaking femurs
You can count me with the dreamers

445
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,890
Like everybody else I've got a dream

446
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,390
I've got scars and lumps and bruises
Plus something here that oozes

447
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,697
And let's not even mention
my complexion

448
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,493
But despite my extra toes
And my goiter and my nose

449
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,924
! really want to make a love connection

450
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,674
Can't you see me
with a special little lady?

451
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:33,128
Rowing in a rowboat down the stream

452
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,971
Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover not a fighter

453
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,085
âCause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

454
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,118
-l've got a dream
-He's got a dream

455
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,110
-l've got a dream
-He's got a dream

456
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,372
And I know one day
romance will reign supreme

457
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,519
Though my face
leaves people screaming

458
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,547
There's a child behind it dreaming

459
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,602
Like everybody else, I've got a dream

460
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,272
Thor would like to quit and be a florist

461
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,963
Gunther does interior design

462
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,590
-Ulf is into mime
-Attila's cupcakes are sublime

463
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,150
Bruiser knits, Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows

464
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:14,677
And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns

465
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,591
-What about you?
-I'm sorry, me?

466
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,057
What's your dream?

467
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,831
No, no, no. Sorry, boys. I don't sing.

468
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,212
! have dreams like you
No, really

469
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:27,921
Just much less touchy-feely

470
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,879
They mainly happen
somewhere warm and sunny

471
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:34,516
On an island that l own
Tanned and rested and alone

472
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,674
Surrounded by enormous
piles of money

473
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,770
-l've got a dream
-She's got a dream

474
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,589
-l've got a dream
-She's got a dream

475
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,770
! just want to see
the floating lanterns gleam

476
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:50,117
And with every passing hour
I'm so glad I left my tower

477
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,198
Like all you lovely folks
I've got a dream

478
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,133
She's got a dream
He's got a dream

479
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,026
They've got a dream
We've got a dream

480
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,158
So our differences
ain't really that extreme

481
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,191
We're one big team

482
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,473
-Call us brutal
-Sick

483
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,864
-Sadistic
-And grotesquely optimistic

484
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,220
âCause way down deep inside
we've got a dream

485
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:14,086
-l've got a dream
-l've got a dream

486
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:22,569
Yes, way down deep inside
I've got a dream

487
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,022
I found the guards!

488
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,703
Where's Rider? Where is he?

489
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,292
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him.

490
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,408
Turn the place upside down
if you have to!

491
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,023
Go. Live your dream.

492
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,986
-I will.
-Your dream stinks.

493
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:05,868
l was talking to her.

494
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,491
Thanks for everything.

495
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,597
I believe
this is the man you're looking for.

496
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,928
You got me!

497
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:18,069
You got me!

498
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,359
Sir, there's no sign of Rider.

499
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,485
Maximus!

500
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:35,288
What's he doing?

501
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:46,642
A passage! Come on, men. Let's go.

502
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,419
Conli! Make sure those boys
don't get away.

503
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,329
Play it safe

504
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,788
or go get the crown?

505
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,479
l got a dream
! got some dreams

506
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:16,281
Somebody get me a glass!

507
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,904
Because I just found me
a tall drink of water.

508
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,962
Oh, stop it, you big lug.

509
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:26,766
Where does that tunnel let out?

510
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,298
Knife!

511
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:35,212
I didn't know you had that in you
back there. That was pretty impressive.

512
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,017
I know!

513
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,170
I know.

514
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:46,310
So... Flynn? Where are you from?

515
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,957
Whoa! Sorry, blondie,
I don't do back-story.

516
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,603
However, lam becoming
very interested in yours.

517
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,273
I know I'm not supposed
to mention the hair.

518
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,032
-Nope.
-Or the mother.

519
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:58,607
-Uh-uh.
-I'm too scared to ask about the frog.

520
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,300
-Chameleon.
-Nuance.

521
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:04,718
Here's my question, though,
if you want to see the lanterns so badly

522
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,039
why haven't you gone before?

523
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:10,957
Well...

524
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:19,245
Flynn?

525
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:21,004
Rider?

526
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,952
Run. Run!

527
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,559
-Who's that?
-They don't like me.

528
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,837
-Who's that?
-They don't like me either.

529
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,207
Who's that?

530
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:51,026
Let's assume that everyone in here
doesn't like me.

531
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,502
Here.

532
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,469
I waited a long time for this.

533
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,360
Oh, mama!
I have got to get me one of these!

534
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,962
You should know that this
is the strangest thing I've ever done!

535
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,432
How about two out of three?

536
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:44,644
Flynn, look out!

537
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,917
You should see your faces,
because you look...

538
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,513
.fidiculous.

539
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:04,221
Come on, blondie! Jump!

540
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:36,174
It's no use. I can't see anything.

541
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:44,766
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch-black down there.

542
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,810
This is all my fault.

543
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,426
She was right.
I never should have done this.

544
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,823
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

545
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:16,906
Eugene.

546
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:19,486
What?

547
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,881
My real name is Eugene Fitzherbert.

548
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,605
Someone might as well know.

549
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,129
I have magic hair
that glows when I sing.

550
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,197
What?

551
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,783
Il have magic hair that glows
when I sing!

552
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:44,239
Flower gleam and glow
Let your power shine

553
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,666
We made it.

554
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,987
-Her hair glows.
-We're alive. I'm alive!

555
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,634
I didn't see that coming.
The hair actually glows.

556
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,574
-Why does her hair glow?
-Eugene!

557
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,726
What?

558
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,569
It doesn't just glow.

559
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:54,184
Why is he smiling at me?

560
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,970
I'll kill him. I'll kill that Rider!

561
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:27,324
We'll cut him off at the kingdom
and get back the crown. Come on!

562
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,316
Or...

563
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,839
Perhaps you want to stop
acting like wild dogs

564
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,252
chasing their tails
and think for a moment.

565
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:42,978
Oh, please, there's no need for that.

566
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,009
Well, if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

567
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:55,153
Il was going to offer you something
worth 1,000 crowns.

568
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,013
Would have made you
rich beyond belief,

569
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,894
and that wasn't even the best part.

570
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:02,696
Oh, well. C'est fa vie. Enjoy your crown!

571
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,488
What's the best part?

572
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:06,600
What's the best part?

573
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:11,197
It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider.

574
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:20,446
You're being strangely cryptic

575
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:23,641
as you wrap your magic hair
around my injured hand.

576
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:25,852
Sorry.

577
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:30,754
Just don't... Don't freak out.

578
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,077
Flower, gleam and glow

579
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,808
Let your power shine

580
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:48,526
Make the clock reverse

581
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:52,313
Bring back what once was mine

582
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:56,664
Heal what has been hurt

583
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,918
Change the Fates' design

584
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:05,256
Save what has been lost

585
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,529
Bring back what once was mine

586
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:13,745
What once was mine

587
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,436
Please don't freak out!

588
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,651
I'm not freaking out.
Are you freaking out?

589
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,853
I'm just interested in your hair
and the magical qualities it possesses.

590
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,779
How long has it been
doing that exactly?

591
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,407
Forever, I guess.

592
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,490
Mother says when I was a baby,
people tried to cut it.

593
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,633
They wanted to take it for themselves.

594
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:56,776
But once it's cut,
it turns brown and loses its power.

595
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,955
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

596
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,419
That's why Mother never let me...

597
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:10,758
That's why I never left and...

598
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,335
You never left that tower.

599
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,227
And you're still going to go back?

600
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:24,753
No! Yes.

601
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:28,931
It's complicated.

602
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,320
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

603
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,583
Ah, yeah. Well...

604
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,815
I'll spare you the sob story
of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert.

605
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,188
It's a little bit of a downer.

606
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:01,375
There was this book I used to read
every night to all the younger kids.

607
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,425
The Tales of Flynnagan Rider.

608
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:07,744
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man
alive, not bad with the ladies either.

609
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,625
Not that he'd ever brag about it,
of course.

610
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,028
Was he a thief, too?

611
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:16,342
Well, no.

612
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:19,701
He had enough money to do anything
that he wanted to do.

613
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,520
He could go anywhere
that he wanted to go.

614
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,966
And for a kid with nothing,
I don't know, I...

615
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,678
Just seemed like the better option.

616
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,204
You can't tell anyone about this, okay?

617
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,804
It could ruin my whole reputation.

618
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:38,561
We wouldn't want that.

619
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,055
A fake reputation is all a man has.

620
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:50,968
Well, I should...

621
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,436
I should get some more firewood.

622
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:02,404
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than Flynn Rider.

623
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,046
Then you'd be the first. But thank you.

624
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:22,113
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

625
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:23,812
Mother?

626
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:25,371
Hello, dear.

627
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,829
How did you find me?

628
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,926
It was easy, really.

629
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:36,096
I just listened for the sound of complete
and utter betrayal and followed that.

630
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:42,732
-We're going home. Now.
-You don't understand.

631
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,170
I've been on this incredible journey,
and I've seen and learned so much.

632
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,659
l even met someone.

633
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,567
Yes, the wanted thief. I'm so proud.
Come on.

634
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,620
Mother, wait. I think...

635
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,004
I think he likes me.

636
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,819
Likes you?
Please, Rapunzel, that's demented!

637
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,036
This is why you never should have left

638
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,006
Dear, this whole romance
that you've invented

639
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:13,473
Just proves you're too naive to be here

640
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,087
Why would he like you?
Come on now, really

641
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,761
Look at you!
You think that he's impressed?

642
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,988
Don't be a dummy, come with Mummy

643
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:27,433
Mother...

644
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:28,850
No!

645
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,050
No?

646
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:35,401
Oh, I see how it is

647
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:41,471
Rapunzel knows best
Rapunzel's so mature now

648
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,635
Such a clever grown-up miss

649
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:48,689
Rapunzel knows best
Fine, if you're so sure now

650
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,162
-Go ahead, then give him this!
-How did you...

651
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,763
This is why he's here
Don't let him deceive you

652
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:58,173
Give it to him, watch, you'll see

653
00:57:58,542 --> 00:57:59,392
I will!

654
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,419
Trust me, my dear
That's how fast he'll leave you

655
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,169
! won't say I told you so

656
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:10,523
No, Rapunzel knows best
So, if he's such a dreamboat

657
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,264
Go and put him to the test

658
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:14,527
Mother, wait!

659
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:19,618
If he's lying, don't come crying

660
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:25,511
Mother knows best

661
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,942
So, can l ask you something?

662
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:39,346
Is there any chance that I'm going to get
super strength in my hand?

663
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,870
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.

664
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,614
Hey, you all right?

665
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:51,444
Sorry, yes. Just lost in thought, I guess.

666
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:55,718
Here's the thing,

667
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:58,836
superhuman good looks,
I've always had them. Born with it.

668
00:58:59,336 --> 00:59:02,995
But superhuman strength. Can you
imagine the possibilities of this?

669
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,511
Patience, boys.

670
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:14,044
All good things to those who wait.

671
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,174
Well, hope you're here to apologize.

672
00:59:39,476 --> 00:59:41,726
No, put me down. Stop it! No!

673
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:43,875
Let me go!

674
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,431
Give me him!

675
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,500
Stop, stop, stop!

676
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:00,579
Easy, boy. Easy! Settle down.

677
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,433
Easy, boy. Easy.

678
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,223
Easy.

679
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:09,575
That's it.

680
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:14,073
Now sit.

681
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:16,975
Sit!

682
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,444
-What?
-Now drop the boot.

683
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,330
Drop it.

684
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:28,021
You're such a good boy! Yes, you are!

685
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:33,257
You all tired from chasing this bad man
all over the place?

686
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:37,197
-Excuse me?
-Nobody appreciates you, do they?

687
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:38,756
Do they?

688
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,782
Oh, come on. He's a bad horse!

689
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,418
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.

690
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,140
Isn't that right...

691
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,200
Maximus?

692
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,159
You've got to be kidding me.

693
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:55,678
Look. Today is kind of
the biggest day of my life,

694
01:00:56,853 --> 01:01:00,223
and the thing is,
I need you not to get him arrested.

695
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,541
Just for 24 hours,

696
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:06,132
and then you can chase each other
to your heart's content.

697
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:14,404
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.

698
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:08,053
Excuse me. Sorry.

699
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:32,821
Thank you!

700
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,345
It's for the lost princess.

701
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,585
To the boats!

702
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:22,928
Hey, Max!

703
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:28,986
What? I bought them.

704
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,495
Most of them.

705
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:36,775
Where are we going?

706
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:40,473
Best day of your life?
I figured you should have a decent seat.

707
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:00,666
You okay?

708
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:03,098
I'm terrified.

709
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,310
Why?

710
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:10,049
I've been looking out a window
for 18 years,

711
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:14,863
dreaming about what it might feel like
when those lights rise in the sky.

712
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:19,986
What if it's not everything
that dreamed it would be?

713
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,189
It will be.

714
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:29,865
And what if it is? What do I do then?

715
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:35,237
That's the good part, I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.

716
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:13,946
All those days
watching from the windows

717
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:17,794
All those years, outside looking in

718
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:23,325
All that time, never even knowing

719
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:28,197
Just how blind I've been

720
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:33,361
Now I'm here, blinking in the starlight

721
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,879
Now I'm here, suddenly I see

722
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:42,855
Standing here, it's, oh, so clear

723
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:47,536
I'm where I'm meant to be

724
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:51,917
And at last 1 see the light

725
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:56,315
And it's like the fog has lifted

726
01:07:57,507 --> 01:08:01,487
And at last 1 see the light

727
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:05,455
And it's like the sky is new

728
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:10,853
And it's warm and real and bright

729
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:16,181
And the world has somehow shifted

730
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:24,142
All at once, everything looks different

731
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:28,584
Now that I see you

732
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:38,115
l have something for you, too.

733
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:41,594
I should have given it to you before,
but I was just scared.

734
01:08:42,385 --> 01:08:46,365
And the thing is, I'm not scared
anymore. You know what I mean?

735
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:50,755
I'm starting to.

736
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:59,048
All those days
chasing down a daydream

737
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:03,346
All those years, living in a blur

738
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:08,384
All that time, never truly seeing

739
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:12,265
Things the way they were

740
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:18,036
Now she's here, shining in the starlight

741
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,200
Now she's here, suddenly I know

742
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:27,269
If she's here, it's crystal clear

743
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:31,500
I'm where I'm meant to go

744
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:36,080
And at last 1 see the light

745
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:40,368
And it's like the fog has lifted

746
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:44,756
And at last 1 see the light

747
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,981
And it's like the sky is new

748
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:53,826
And it's warm and real and bright

749
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:59,240
And the world has somehow shifted

750
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:07,389
All at once, everything is different

751
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:12,904
Now that I see you

752
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,950
Now that I...

753
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:23,246
see you

754
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,612
Is everything okay?

755
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:48,994
Oh, yes.

756
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,539
Yes, of course. I just...

757
01:10:58,688 --> 01:11:00,708
I'm sorry. Everything is fine.

758
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,337
There's just something
I have to take care of.

759
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:07,426
Okay.

760
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:10,882
I'll be right back.

761
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:18,946
It's all right, Pascal.

762
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:28,222
There you are!

763
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:30,801
I've been searching everywhere
for you guys since we got separated.

764
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,910
The sideburns are coming in nice, huh?
Got to be excited about that.

765
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:41,562
Anyhow, I just wanted to say
I shouldn't have split.

766
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:46,777
The crown is all yours. I'll miss you,
but I think it's for the best.

767
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,098
Holding out on us again, eh, Rider?

768
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:55,559
-What?
-We heard you found something.

769
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,532
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

770
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,346
We want her instead.

771
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,805
I was starting to think you ran off
with the crown and left me.

772
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:24,705
He did.

773
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,821
What? No. He wouldn't.

774
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:30,642
See for yourself.

775
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:36,681
Eugene?

776
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,225
Eugene!

777
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:48,066
A fair trade. A crown
for the girl with the magic hair.

778
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:53,209
How much do you think someone would
pay to stay young and healthy forever?

779
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:56,319
No. Please. No!

780
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:07,392
Rapunzel!

781
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,518
Mother?

782
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,761
Oh, my precious girl!

783
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:20,045
Mother.

784
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,843
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

785
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,332
-How did you...
-l was so worried about you, dear.

786
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,969
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you and...

787
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:32,786
Oh, my. Let's go before they come to!

788
01:14:03,339 --> 01:14:06,799
You were right, Mother.
You were right about everything.

789
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,407
I know, darling. I know.

790
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:26,625
Look!

791
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:28,566
The crown!

792
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:37,441
No! Wait, guys!

793
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,440
Let's get this over with, Rider.

794
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:06,975
Where are we going?

795
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:17,411
There. It never happened.

796
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:24,295
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazelnut soup.

797
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:34,068
l really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you what was out there.

798
01:15:35,398 --> 01:15:39,298
The world is dark and selfish and cruel.

799
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:42,545
If it finds
even the slightest ray of sunshine,

800
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,393
it destroys it.

801
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,244
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!

802
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:33,073
It wasn't us! It was the old lady!

803
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:34,596
Old lady?

804
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:38,122
Wait. No! Wait!

805
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,007
You don't understand!
She's in trouble! Wait!

806
01:17:44,627 --> 01:17:46,177
What's going on up there?

807
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,029
Are you all right?

808
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:54,909
I'm the lost princess.

809
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,584
Please speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

810
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:03,084
lam the lost princess. Aren't I?

811
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,808
Did 1 mumble, Mother?

812
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:11,455
Or should I even call you that?

813
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:15,512
Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

814
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:18,298
Why would you ask
such a ridiculous question?

815
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:21,747
It was you! It was all you!

816
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:27,340
Everything I did was to protect you.

817
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:34,295
I've spent my entire life hiding from
people who would use me for my power

818
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:38,588
when I should have been hiding
from you!

819
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:41,918
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.

820
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:44,058
What did you do to him?

821
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,630
That criminal is to be hanged
for his crimes.

822
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:51,233
-No.
-Now, now, it's all right.

823
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:55,637
Listen to me.
All of this is as it should be.

824
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:59,705
No! You were wrong about the world.

825
01:19:00,703 --> 01:19:02,873
And you were wrong about me!

826
01:19:03,272 --> 01:19:06,812
And I will never
let you use my hair again!

827
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:18,622
You want me to be the bad guy?

828
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:22,361
Fine, now I'm the bad guy.

829
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:38,409
What's this?

830
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:40,287
Open up!

831
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:43,357
-What's the password?
-What?

832
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:45,672
-Nope.
-Open this door!

833
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:47,598
Not even close!

834
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:50,416
You have three seconds! One...

835
01:19:51,687 --> 01:19:52,887
Two...

836
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:55,889
Three.

837
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:03,557
Frying pans! Who knew, right?

838
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:34,472
-Head down.
-Head down.

839
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,660
-Arms in.
-Arms in.

840
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:37,328
-Knees apart.
-Knees apart. Knees apart?

841
01:20:38,734 --> 01:20:40,314
Why do I need
to keep my knees apart...

842
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:51,557
Max! You brought them here?

843
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:55,053
Thank you.

844
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:58,902
No, really. Thank you.

845
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,330
I feel maybe this whole time,

846
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,261
we've just been misunderstanding
one another,

847
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:06,083
and we're really just...

848
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:07,804
You're right, we should go.

849
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:16,507
Max?

850
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:33,169
Okay, Max.
Let's see how fast you can run.

851
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:53,898
Rapunzel?

852
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:57,448
Rapunzel, let down your hair!

853
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,945
Rapunzel,
thought I'd never see you again.

854
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:27,023
Now look what you've done, Rapunzel.

855
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:31,255
Oh, don't worry, dear.
Our secret will die with him.

856
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:34,885
And as for us...

857
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:40,492
We are going where no one
will ever find you again.

858
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:48,592
Rapunzel, really!

859
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:52,825
Enough already! Stop fighting me!

860
01:22:53,936 --> 01:22:55,715
No! I won't stop!

861
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,851
For every minute of the rest of my life,
I will fight!

862
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:02,741
I will never stop trying
to get away from you!

863
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:09,597
But if you let me save him,
I will go with you.

864
01:23:10,953 --> 01:23:13,503
No! No, Rapunzel.

865
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:17,630
I'll never run. I'll never try to escape.

866
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:21,256
Just let me heal him
and you and I will be together,

867
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:23,576
forever, just like you want.

868
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:25,661
Everything will be the way it was.

869
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:28,196
I promise.

870
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:30,824
Just like you want.

871
01:23:34,076 --> 01:23:37,006
Just let me heal him.

872
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:45,915
In case you get any ideas
about following us.

873
01:23:56,565 --> 01:23:58,674
I'm so sorry.
Everything is going to be okay, though.

874
01:23:59,067 --> 01:23:59,937
No, Rapunzel.

875
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:03,128
I promise. You have to trust me.
Come on. Just breathe.

876
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:05,039
I can't let you do this.

877
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:07,781
And I can't let you die.

878
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:11,830
But if you do then you will die.

879
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,601
Hey. It's going to be all right.

880
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:24,352
Wait.

881
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:34,515
Eugene...

882
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:36,631
No!

883
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:48,143
What have you done?
What have you done?

884
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:29,162
No, no, no. Eugene.

885
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,970
No! Look at me. I'm right here.
Don't go. Stay with me.

886
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,821
Flower, gleam and glow
Let your power shine

887
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:43,172
Make the clock reverse
Bring back what once was mine

888
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:45,736
What?

889
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,184
You were my new dream.

890
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,240
And you were mine.

891
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,884
Heal what has been hurt

892
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:30,909
Change the Fates' design

893
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:35,111
Save what has been lost

894
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,620
Bring back what once was mine

895
01:26:44,466 --> 01:26:46,136
What once was mine

896
01:27:43,892 --> 01:27:45,121
Rapunzel?

897
01:27:46,328 --> 01:27:47,528
Eugene?

898
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:52,345
Did I ever tell you
I've got a thing for brunettes?

899
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:38,540
Well, you can imagine
what happened next.

900
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:44,539
The kingdom rejoiced,
for their lost princess had returned,

901
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:49,180
The party lasted an entire week, and
honestly 1 don't remember most of it.

902
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:52,199
Dreams came true all over the place.

903
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,390
That guy went on to become the most
famous concert pianist in the world,

904
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:57,321
if you can believe it!

905
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:02,087
And this guy?
He eventually found true love.

906
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:07,128
As for this guy, l assume he's happy.
He's never told me otherwise.

907
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:10,801
Thanks to Maximus,

908
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:13,699
crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost overnight.

909
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:17,427
As did most of the apples.

910
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:21,937
Pascal never changed.

911
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,901
At last Rapunzel was home.
And she finally had a real family.

912
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,440
She was a princess worth waiting for.

913
01:30:34,863 --> 01:30:37,883
Beloved by all, she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom

914
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,660
that her parents did before her.

915
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,922
And, as for me,
! started going by Eugene again,

916
01:30:44,406 --> 01:30:46,246
stopped thieving
and turned it all around.

917
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,828
But I know what the big question is.

918
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:51,114
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?

919
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:52,439
I'm pleased to tell you

920
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:56,521
that after years and years
of asking and asking and asking...

921
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:00,827
I finally said yes.

922
01:31:01,156 --> 01:31:04,906
-Eugene.
-All right, l asked her.

923
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:07,667
And we're living happily ever after.

924
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:09,923
Yes, we are.

925
01:40:55,516 --> 01:40:56,366
