1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:05,447
Avici Hell.
Also known as Continuous Hell Uninterrupted time

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,823
Unlimited space.
Boundless suffering for the fallen souls

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,910
Uninterrupted time

4
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:14,904
Time

5
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,002
I still remember my first arrest

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,801
Year: 1991

7
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,334
It was December 12, 1980

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,333
My partner and I were patrolling Hano Road

9
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:32,593
Shit was going down at New World Centre

10
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,637
We rushed over

11
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,352
A gang fight was taking place

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,259
About fifteen or so were already down

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,939
Lots of blood on the ground

14
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,903
Plus a severed hand, still holding a knife

15
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,381
My partner told me to draw my piece

16
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,797
I was a rookie so ! did what he told

17
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,565
But before I could open the holster

18
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:06,874
My partner already dropped

19
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:12,205
This kid stabbed a pipe into his belly

20
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,336
Blood gushed out of the sawed-off opening

21
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,455
I didn't know what to think

22
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,154
I simply put all six of my bullets

23
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,866
straight into that kid!

24
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,744
I don't remember how many years he got

25
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,975
But when I saw him again two years ago

26
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,178
he was boozing in a club, looking sharp

27
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,189
His buddies were all Kwun's goons!

28
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,737
Evil prevails. Only the good die young

29
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,768
I can barely recall my partner's face now

30
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:02,932
l regret

31
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,674
The six bullets weren't put into that kid's skull

32
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,333
The world shouldn't be like this

33
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,977
It's not the way to be, Sam

34
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,693
How long have you been around Tsim Sha Tsui?

35
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,693
Almost two years now

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,730
Do you know why I haven't messed with you?

37
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,397
‘Cause I am handsome!

38
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,417
Maybe so

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,899
‘Cause I think you're a decent guy

40
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,381
I'd rather you be in charge

41
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,059
Forget about it

42
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,587
You couldn't waste the kid even with six bullets

43
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,576
That makes you a decent guy, too. Right?

44
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,245
I don't want to be one

45
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,585
Kwun gave me everything, even my life

46
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:17,324
If! turned against him

47
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,714
I'd be despicable even in your eyes. Right?

48
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,549
I knew you'd say that

49
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,400
Chivalry means little to the Ngai Family

50
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,923
The Master often says

51
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,712
Retribution knows its time

52
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,287
Who knows how you and I will end up?

53
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,528
Time to work!

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,310
This early?

55
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,373
I've got to eat! So do my boys!

56
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,012
Take the whole box

57
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,457
That's okay. Keep it

58
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,365
Don't worry about it! Just go!

59
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,675
Want to use the back door?

60
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,385
Ain't no rules against schmoozing with cops

61
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,255
The front door's fine. Got used to it

62
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:37,927
Prat Avenue!

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,370
Prat Avenue

64
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,051
Is Uncle Kwun in?

65
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,634
Uncle Kwun! Someone's looking for you!

66
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,682
Bye, Mary

67
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,615
They say this American antique's got...

68
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,664
..sweet high, crisp middle and strong bass

69
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,399
Bullshit!

70
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,438
180 grand!

71
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,832
Who can afford it in Hong Kong?

72
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,465
Sit

73
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,734
Only around ten thousand people can afford it

74
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,487
Sam asked you to be a mole in the force

75
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,953
If you don't like it, [ can talk to him

76
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,923
You're my boy after all

77
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:21,760
It's fine with me

78
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,433
Sure?

79
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,162
Positive

80
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,650
Hand me that bag

81
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,182
Mary

82
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,645
[ thought you'd been dreading it

83
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,129
Hide in Tuen Mun till things quiet down

84
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,856
Stay fit for the Academy's new term

85
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,561
The money ! gave you, spend wisely

86
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,598
You like the song?

87
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,658
Yeah

88
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,420
It's yours

89
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,590
It won't sound as good on another player

90
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,610
Someday I'll pick out a good one for you

91
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,252
What? Don't like it?

92
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:23,963
Not at all

93
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,431
Sam gave you this watch, didn't he?

94
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,053
None of your business

95
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,365
Only you and I...

96
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,680
..know about tonight

97
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:40,786
I don't want Sam to know

98
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:42,978
Why's that?

99
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,357
Women are simple

100
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,507
A man treats me well, I'd do anything

101
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,719
Now go home. I'm very busy tonight

102
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,598
It's either you or me

103
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,184
The boss said I would see blood today

104
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,636
The Mainlander kept asking...

105
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,986
Got a Mercedes today, Keung?

106
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,678
l said, "Of course." And here I am!

107
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,555
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here with you

108
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:36,185
Mainland girls in arms

109
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,990
That's for sure!

110
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,773
Hey, got a cigarette?

111
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,480
I don't smoke

112
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,680
Let's forget about it. My car's fine

113
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,386
See! She says it's all good

114
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,989
Dressed all dandy

115
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,695
Don't want any trouble, do you?

116
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,813
Look at me. All beaten up by you

117
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,805
Who do you think the judge would believe?

118
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,150
bet you guys never go to Tsim Sha Tsui East, huh?

119
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,807
Know who I am? I'm Keung!

120
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,870
Sam's top dog. Del Piero's boy

121
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,670
I'll kick your ass every time I see you

122
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,099
And you can count on that

123
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,955
How about calling an ambulance, sir?

124
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,928
Look at all the blood!

125
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,776
Have them bring 500 cc Type O. It's rare!

126
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,092
Shut up!

127
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,329
Wait till we're back to the station

128
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,027
Why do I have to go to the station?

129
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,103
l only stole a piece of junk, sir!

130
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:16,505
What've I done to deserve the OCTB?

131
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:17,186
Just shut up!

132
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:17,957
Does that deserve an OCTB beating?

133
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,940
Don't you know you're just a cadet?

134
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,260
And you are expected to get a medal this year

135
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,433
Don't ever let Yip know about this!

136
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,680
Happy birthday!

137
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,775
What's there to be happy about?

138
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,661
Ten years in the Academy. A rustic hell

139
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,100
You even managed to get me out

140
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,305
Your case's now ancient history

141
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,198
Get yourself out

142
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,983
So what if the Commissioner's Chinese now?

143
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,856
Still six more years till the hand-over

144
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,425
I'll be 48 by then!

145
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:10,098
Might as well train a few good cops here!

146
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,781
The world is yours after 1997!

147
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,397
27149! Cheers!

148
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:19,858
Yan

149
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,083
Been beeping the whole day

150
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:21,981
How come you don't call back?

151
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,151
Girlfriend?

152
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,046
Cheers, sir! Cheers!

153
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:27,756
Just leave me alone!

154
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,093
It's none of my business ! don't want to know a thing

155
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,949
Go! Leave me alone!

156
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,716
Law

157
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:39,755
What do you want?

158
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,024
My father just passed way

159
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,827
It was his wish to inform his children...

160
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,627
when something bad happened to him!

161
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,343
Sorry to have bothered you!

162
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,480
Stop watching TV! Eat first, Negro!

163
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,660
l wonder what they have on Kwun's death

164
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,468
Did you do it, Ching?

165
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,448
I've got a big mouth. Had ! done it...

166
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,866
.. you would've heard about it!

167
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,438
Ask Wah and Gandhi

168
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,650
When Kwun died, I was in Macau

169
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,044
Everybody knows!

170
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,478
But I bet his kids think I did it

171
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,654
[ain't scared of nothing

172
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,423
The eldest son's a doctor The youngest a brat

173
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:50,846
The daughter's married for ages

174
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,954
Only the middle son's running the show

175
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,506
If they go too far, I'll show them!

176
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,251
We failed to protect Kwun. It's our fault!

177
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,747
That's enough, Uncle John

178
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,665
Dad used to say

179
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,825
What goes around comes around

180
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,765
It came later than expected already

181
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,926
Wah, Ching, Negro and Gandhi

182
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,969
Guess what those four are thinking?

183
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,369
Thank you. Thank you all!

184
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,851
How's mom doing, sis?

185
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,974
She's fine. Been sleeping

186
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,130
Bring some cigs to the morgue for dad

187
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,670
I'll go get them

188
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,359
B Team, watch Tak Shing Street

189
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,376
C Team, watch the Austin Road exit...

190
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,659
..Of that financial building

191
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,396
It has two exits

192
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,425
One on Tak Shing Street. One on Austin...

193
00:15:58,858 --> 00:15:59,497
Sorry

194
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:04,980
Hello?

195
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,468
Something this big, why didn't you call?

196
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,343
l called everybody the minute it happened!

197
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,540
Kwun's boys can't sit still for sure

198
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,409
Shit will hit the fan tonight!

199
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,820
It's the 14th already. You know that?

200
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,302
The 14th. Time to pay the Ngai Family

201
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,310
I'm the youngest here

202
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,006
So let me be the jackass

203
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,728
I'm not paying the Ngai's any more

204
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,036
What do you three think?

205
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,470
Inspector Wong

206
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,420
What's up?

207
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,919
What're your men doing outside Wah's building?

208
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:29,154
Not a good day for chit chat

209
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,072
Are you into something?

210
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,856
Fine, fine. Next time

211
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,413
What's the occasion?

212
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,475
Come on. Where's my seat?

213
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,476
Only if you're here for the food

214
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,887
All other businesses have to wait

215
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,266
The food. It's all about the food

216
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:04,926
Tonight's gonna be the shit!

217
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,049
Let the Big Four do their things

218
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,621
We'll deal with the aftermath

219
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,592
Don't let them start fighting

220
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,735
Or you'll see bodies

221
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,706
What? Not satisfied?

222
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,873
You know the rule. Pick a card

223
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,141
Okay. Higher points win

224
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,213
Come on!

225
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,313
There's nothing left to talk about

226
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:43,901
What's up, Hau?

227
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,439
Wah

228
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:46,572
Nothing much

229
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,226
Heard you're planning a casino in Macau

230
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,393
I've got the government in my pocket

231
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,412
How about a joint venture?

232
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,374
Uncle Kwun's dead

233
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,079
I'm not in the mood

234
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,698
lsee

235
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,914
The Macau trip wasn't all business

236
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,494
I know you had fun with Gandhi's wife

237
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,568
Sorry, but I can't let go of my casino in Macau

238
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:42,838
Gotta go

239
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,493
What are Sam's people doing?

240
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,702
I know Wah paid up

241
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,149
Don't change the subject

242
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,577
Tell me something I don't know!

243
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,841
Call me when you get your shit straight!

244
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,712
Hau took care of Wah in ten minutes

245
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,355
The Big Four are having a tough time

246
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,802
Hau took out a million's worth of coke

247
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,683
What?

248
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,662
Mafia road block or what?

249
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,721
[ don't know why Wah paid up, Hau

250
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:07,482
But I ain't gonna negotiate

251
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,812
I don't plan to negotiate, either

252
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,491
Pass the phone to Negro

253
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,134
Hey, Negro

254
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,985
Don't know why he calls you from my hood

255
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,165
What's up, Hau?

256
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,753
I'm with Gandhi all the way

257
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,799
He's not paying, neither will I!

258
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,533
Heard you and Gandhi have been tight

259
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,310
The heroin you two smuggled got robbed

260
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,277
Lost several millions each, right?

261
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,788
Luckily ! found the stuff in your warehouse

262
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,607
Want me to hand it back to Gandhi now?

263
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,730
What's he talking about?

264
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,123
Among the Tsim Sha Tsui Big Fives...

265
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,411
Wah and Negro paid up

266
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,532
Counting Sam, that's 3 to 2

267
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,711
I'm the youngest here. Gotta pay!

268
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,035
See ya!

269
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,296
Don't think too much. Cheers!

270
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:35,987
Pay my share for me!

271
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,303
Mr. Ngai went to eat, Inspector Wong

272
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,316
A bit late for chowing, don't you think?

273
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,190
My dad always came here after work

274
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,363
l have to keep up the ritual

275
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,346
Want to join us?

276
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,456
It's your seat from now on. Must be tough

277
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:39,884
Not at all

278
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,326
You guys worked all night for nothing

279
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,382
Now that's tough

280
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,331
Well done, Hau

281
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,753
Hope you can keep it up

282
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,879
Don't let it turn into a tragedy. Let's go

283
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,592
What did you say?

284
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,909
We want to celebrate

285
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,019
Kwun's dead

286
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,950
Time to pop the champagne

287
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,365
Want me to pop one for you?

288
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:24,889
What?

289
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,681
Want to mess with cops?

290
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,135
Officers!

291
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,440
The Ngai's are in mourning

292
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,566
What more do you want?

293
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,794
Let's go

294
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:54,986
Sam

295
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,488
Dad used to operate street gambling here

296
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,694
Started out as...

297
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,420
a dime-and-nickel business

298
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,331
Now who doesn't know his name?

299
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,850
He often said

300
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:39,827
What goes around comes around

301
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,847
And now he's...

302
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,412
I'll always remember this day

303
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,803
It's all good, honey. Want some snacks?

304
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,969
Good to hear that. Just come home

305
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,909
27149

306
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,190
An officer has to have a clean background

307
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,878
Though you cut your ties with the Ngai's...

308
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:04,972
..you still share the same father with Hau

309
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,739
That means you lied on your application

310
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,972
l have but to let you go

311
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,892
But before you leave...

312
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,821
..go see "Mr. Wrong Socks" first

313
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,099
Still want to be a cop?

314
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,412
Can I still?

315
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,264
Only if you can give me a good reason

316
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,568
l want to be a righteous person

317
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:15,723
If you want to be a cop...

318
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,244
..then lend me a hand. Simple as that

319
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,947
You pick me 'cause I'm Hau's brother right?

320
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,372
When the time comes will you arrest him yourself?

321
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:29,844
How do I start?

322
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,506
Brace

323
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,458
You okay?

324
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,469
Hanging in there?

325
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,579
3G
What's wrong?

326
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:11,718
Does it still hurt?

327
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,021
My dad passed away today

328
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,501
He was so good to me

329
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,024
l asked the officer...

330
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:25,607
..if ! could go to his funeral

331
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,610
The officer said...

332
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:32,784
Know what it means to be a prisoner?

333
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,300
It means you're not allowed

334
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,671
even to attend your father's funeral

335
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,987
Don't you know that?

336
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,820
Get out of here!

337
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,621
Come on. Stop that

338
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,387
Time

339
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,901
Year: 1995

340
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,374
Are you nuts?

341
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,349
You sent Yan to be a mole?

342
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,818
Don't you know Hau's his half-brother?

343
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,828
So what?

344
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,774
Bring me his file!

345
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,566
So you're playing the boss now, huh?

346
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,026
You damn well know you the files are classified

347
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,210
I treat you like a bro. Is this what I get?

348
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,804
If you're a real bro, stop asking!

349
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,391
It's okay

350
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,390
Calm down!

351
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,412
Speak slowly!

352
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,536
She had an abortion!

353
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,884
It's no big deal. Just a baby

354
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,597
You can always have another one

355
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,949
I've been with you for four years

356
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,524
And I've bailed you out tons of times

357
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,338
One minute we're dining with my folks...

358
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,570
..the next you'll be in a gang fight

359
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,489
I don't want our baby to grow up like you

360
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,601
Do you understand?

361
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:56,242
Why so uptight?

362
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,018
No, nothing

363
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,611
Uncle John says you're doing well

364
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,732
Ever thought about helping the family out?

365
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,817
[know you want to keep a distance from the Ngai's

366
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,139
But we're blood brothers. It's a fact

367
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,577
It's my daughter's birthday this Sunday

368
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,699
You're invited

369
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,993
You really hate talking to me, huh?

370
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,615
No

371
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,381
Promoted already? Soon you'll be a superintendent

372
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,299
Might as well become a full time cop

373
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,648
Sam's kidding. Go ahead give me a smile

374
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,210
Thanks for your intel these couple years

375
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,410
When you were still a rookie...

376
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,024
l helped you catch some small potatoes

377
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,393
It's about time you caught some big shots

378
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:16,123
How about catching me?

379
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,589
Why so dirty? Or you can catch this hot chicks

380
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,151
What're you doing?!

381
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,466
What a hot hootchie mama!

382
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:26,252
Your man must be one good-looking bastard

383
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:27,857
It's you! Who else?

384
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,105
Gotta go

385
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,493
Gotta go meet Mr. Ngai

386
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,044
Sam's so good to you!

387
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,341
But he's not good to himself

388
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,038
It's been four years

389
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,749
He could be in charge now

390
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,692
But he gave everything to the Ngai's Already?

391
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,567
Now the Ngai Family's all big and bad

392
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:16,218
Hau must've figured it out

393
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,129
For the past four years

394
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,011
I haven't been sleeping well

395
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,355
I'm Inspector Wong Chi-Shing

396
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,850
Don't worry, Mary

397
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,022
l won't let anything happen to you

398
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,693
Words, words, words

399
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,908
I promise

400
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:14,945
Toss it up!

401
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,752
Two days ago, a real estate agent came

402
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,315
Guess how much he offered?

403
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,644
One hundred sixty million!

404
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,914
What's wrong with Hong Kong? Tell me!

405
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,523
When my dad bought it

406
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,189
it was 9 million...280 thousand

407
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,375
What a world!

408
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,045
Moving, Mr. Ngai?

409
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,574
1997 is approaching. Time to emigrate

410
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,681
No big deal

411
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,093
Communication's easy these days

412
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,381
We're just a phone call away

413
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,944
I'm just worried about the phone bill

414
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,727
The phone company's greedy, you know

415
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,294
I've discussed it with mom

416
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:09,087
Our businesses are on the right track

417
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,171
You guys helped out so much in the past

418
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,679
don't want to be ungrateful

419
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,565
l want to split the business up...

420
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,788
among you guys

421
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:26,136
Treat it as a gift or a retirement fund

422
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,371
Let's eat! Take whatever you want!

423
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,734
We should hang out like this more often

424
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:45,899
Mr. Ngai

425
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:47,971
Are you leaving for real?

426
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,417
After you're gone, hell will break loose!

427
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,716
You're a Buddhist, aren't you, Sam?

428
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,863
Easy to start. Hard to let go

429
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,757
I'm letting go. Be happy for me

430
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,349
I've thought about it

431
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,528
Cocaine will be the future

432
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,408
Those four ship it in small bags from S. America

433
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,351
Small-timers!

434
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,884
I've closed a deal with the Thais

435
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:23,884
You'll have the monopoly

436
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,292
You'll be the top dog. Leader of the pack

437
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:32,353
Go to Thailand and wrap up the logistics

438
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,563
You plan to get rid of those four?

439
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,377
Move closer to the right, please

440
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:09,863
Yan

441
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:11,505
Come join the family portrait

442
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,067
Stand next to me!

443
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,080
l haven't been around much these two years

444
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,502
It's rare to spend time...

445
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:32,136
.. With the whole family like this

446
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,831
Your siblings are in legit businesses

447
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,940
It's time you helped out the family

448
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,400
Everything dad did was for the family

449
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,158
I did the same

450
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,044
Hope you will, too

451
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,659
A deal's coming up next week Come with me

452
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:02,636
I'll call you

453
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:33,709
I think he's taking the deal seriously

454
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,455
He'll go in person next Wednesday

455
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,866
The 14th... Kwun's memorial

456
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:42,676
Hau wants to whack the Big Four

457
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,566
Why does he send Sam away?

458
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:52,444
Don't know. Sam should be of help to him!

459
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,386
Unless he wants to kill Sam also!

460
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,596
I've been following you around for days!

461
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:17,937
I'm your superior after all

462
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,459
I want to know what your plan is

463
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,791
The Ngai's are your family

464
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,007
Do you really know what you're doing?

465
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:38,432
Sirl

466
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,997
I'm a cop!

467
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:45,822
Good

468
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:47,547
Give me a salute

469
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,287
I've booked a table. Care for dinner?

470
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:00,827
Do I look good in my cap?

471
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:18,892
Looking good?

472
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,781
What'll you do in Thailand in that outfit?

473
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:24,783
Have some shark fin

474
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,319
A massage. Get two whores for a threesome

475
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,682
That's for sure

476
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:33,056
Honey!

477
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:34,064
What?

478
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,069
Why didn't you tell me about your trip?

479
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,104
It's a business trip! Not for fun!

480
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,829
Don't worry. I'll behave

481
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,482
Hau plans to whack Wah and those guys

482
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,450
l know

483
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:48,911
But do you know you're his target too?

484
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,781
Nonsense! How can that be?

485
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:56,201
Just wait for me at the airport!

486
00:44:58,496 --> 00:44:59,756
Time to board, Sam!

487
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,406
That's all 1 can do for now

488
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:24,928
Call Sam again when the plane lands

489
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,430
I'm going to kill Hau tonight

490
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,606
Don't do anything rash!

491
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:35,829
I'm not being rash!

492
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:41,344
Four years ago...

493
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:44,346
.. you told me to kill Kwun

494
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,561
So what? Want to blackmail me now?

495
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,310
I'm not blackmailing you

496
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,813
We simply passed the point of no return!

497
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,654
I'll send everybody away

498
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,845
Tonight's operation's top secret

499
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:41,648
We're divided into three teams

500
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,547
Team A watches here

501
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:46,920
Team B here

502
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,025
Wait for my order before doing anything

503
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,544
Team C follows the target until...

504
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,839
Nobody told me about the date change!

505
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,876
You know Hau changes his mind all the time

506
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,556
You think Yan's the only mole?

507
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,832
My man's been undercover for seven years!

508
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:12,444
Where's the deck of cards?

509
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,540
We'll run the show together tonight

510
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:33,720
Let's go!

511
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,703
Sir

512
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,519
How are you?

513
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,792
Don't move...

514
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:06,900
Hau

515
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,658
Zipping it till your lawyer gets here?

516
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:12,425
Come on, cooperate with us!

517
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:16,737
In fact, l appreciate your cooperation

518
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,647
Are you speaking Zen, Mr. Ngai?

519
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,004
I don't get it

520
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:25,904
Dad used to say...

521
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:30,778
.. the way things work in the streets...

522
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,122
... what goes around always comes around

523
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:38,416
He died four years ago. It's about time

524
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:50,442
The stove's hot enough now

525
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:08,354
She's here, boss

526
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:52,615
You're here now

527
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:54,757
What can you swing?

528
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:56,472
Wait and see

529
00:52:58,308 --> 00:52:59,478
Got it! Sir

530
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,360
The two foreigners are private eyes

531
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,122
Honey! Where are you?

532
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:16,846
Thailand, of course

533
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,518
Come back right away!

534
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,558
Are you nuts? Why should I come back?

535
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,738
Don't ask questions! Just come back!

536
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:24,677
Hau wants you dead!

537
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:26,799
Nonsense! I'm working for him as we speak!

538
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:28,854
Listen to me!

539
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,724
I killed Kwunt

540
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:45,968
You've got a VCR?

541
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:52,639
Isn't it good?

542
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,553
What an awesome show!

543
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,830
Take care. Run if you have to

544
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:02,525
What did Hau say?

545
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:18,524
Sam. Sunny!

546
00:55:19,216 --> 00:55:21,906
Mr. Ngai told me to take good care of you!

547
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,967
Four years ago...

548
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:11,863
.. you told me to kill Kwun

549
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,957
So what? Want to blackmail me now?

550
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,529
I'm not blackmailing you

551
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,353
We simply passed the point of no return!

552
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,853
I'll send everybody away

553
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,038
l hired Alan and Johnson...

554
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:39,095
..to investigate my father's murder

555
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,639
Who would've known? The police conspired...

556
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,762
to murder my father

557
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,348
A law-abiding citizen

558
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,343
SP Luk

559
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,514
Isn't that an officer in the video?

560
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:29,607
Whether to nail him or not...

561
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:31,731
. that's up to you

562
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:24,923
What a good show!

563
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:31,684
You're so friggin’ photogenic

564
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:08,497
Four years ago...

565
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:12,377
How much did Sam's woman pay you?

566
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:18,747
Give me another chance, Mr. Ngai

567
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:53,932
I gave them a chance four years ago

568
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,001
They didn't take it

569
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,795
If l give you a chance

570
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:04,713
Are you going to take it today?

571
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,076
You've been with us for seven years now

572
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,089
You're a cop

573
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:29,508
We're the bad guys

574
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,344
Time to accept our fates

575
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:38,704
You can't blame me

576
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:43,103
Your Inspector Wong killed my dad

577
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:28,904
Any words from Sam?

578
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,404
Sam called me

579
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:33,792
He said he was fine

580
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:38,147
He asked you to wait for him here

581
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,600
Where're your folks?

582
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,470
All emigrated

583
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,041
You didn't go with them?

584
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:30,799
Let's go, Sam! We got rid of the Thais

585
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:32,387
Let's go!

586
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,254
You know you're not going to make it

587
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:38,884
l know

588
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:42,587
My girl's in danger in Hong Kong

589
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,703
Please help me

590
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,682
Why should I?

591
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,341
‘Cause I'll help you whack your boss

592
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,422
I Know you want to be in charge

593
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:57,392
Moreover

594
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,390
I've been treating you as a pal

595
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,368
Don't believe him, Sam! Don't!

596
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:31,814
Get lost!

597
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,581
Don't believe him! Get lost!

598
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:53,499
Sorry, Sam

599
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,549
Are you here to arrest me?

600
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:13,912
If you're going to kill Hau

601
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,081
I will

602
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,038
Then there's nothing to talk about

603
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:26,701
l spoke with my superiors

604
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:30,014
They're with you all the way this time

605
01:08:31,506 --> 01:08:32,406
How?

606
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:33,882
[ conspired in murder!

607
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,266
Even the Brits agree that...

608
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,788
..we can't let the triads break us

609
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:49,566
The whole department's behind you

610
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:51,453
Good enough?

611
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,024
Where's your deck of cards?

612
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:05,687
The higher points win

613
01:09:08,044 --> 01:09:10,184
Come back with me to the department

614
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:14,780
The key!

615
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:17,996
Forget it. l screwed up

616
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:19,577
No need to drag everyone down with me

617
01:09:39,809 --> 01:09:41,589
We found this deck in our first outing together

618
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:42,895
You've been keeping it all this time

619
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:44,536
I knew that all along

620
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:51,377
I've let you get your way in the past

621
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,141
It's your turn to listen for once

622
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:55,017
We're like brothers

623
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,581
Think I'm just gonna be a spectator?

624
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:06,537
Law's my snitch in the Ngai Family

625
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:10,485
He hasn't contacted me for days

626
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:13,705
Neither has Yan!

627
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:16,872
The key!

628
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,422
Help!

629
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:06,891
Help! Get some help!

630
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:50,772
Why did you lie to me?

631
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:53,965
I didn't!

632
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,467
Something happened to Sam!

633
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,960
I told you I was a simple woman

634
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:02,723
l have to do something for my husband

635
01:13:03,646 --> 01:13:04,606
I'm going to Thailand

636
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:06,921
Please don't go!

637
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:11,393
Forget it! You don't have to follow us anymore

638
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:15,579
[ mean, I don't want you to go

639
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:24,307
You've been with Sam for years

640
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,132
Has it occurred to you...

641
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:30,445
Maybe Sam's dead!

642
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:31,623
What did you say?

643
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:33,505
l can take care of you

644
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:40,804
What're you doing?

645
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,049
I don't want you to go!

646
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,387
You're out of line!

647
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:55,767
Listen up!

648
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,056
I'm your boss's woman!

649
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,370
Don't let me see your face again!

650
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:01,739
She will go to the airport tonight...

651
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:04,031
Hello? Hello?

652
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,499
I killed Kwunt

653
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:34,732
Aman treats me well

654
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,351
I'd do anything

655
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:23,335
Time

656
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,730
Year: 1997

657
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:31,638
File number 103142

658
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:34,801
About Inspector Wong conspiring in murder

659
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:39,263
This is the 11th internal hearing

660
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:41,669
Inspector Wong

661
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:43,484
do you have any question?

662
01:17:44,627 --> 01:17:45,617
No...

663
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:46,958
No

664
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:50,450
An inspector should possess leadership skills

665
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:51,583
Mr. Lau

666
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:53,101
you joined as a police constable

667
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:54,722
Could you tell the promotion board

668
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:56,784
why you deserve to be promoted?

669
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:58,136
Of course

670
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:01,300
On April 11, 1995...

671
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:04,504
The department received this tape

672
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,393
Accusing you of conspiring in a murder

673
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:09,981
l confess, sir

674
01:18:10,553 --> 01:18:11,633
It's already 1997

675
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:13,450
Before the 1st of July

676
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:15,386
If we don't receive your PO assessment report

677
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,038
Do you still think you can be promoted?

678
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:18,793
In Chinese, there is a saying

679
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:21,278
With a new king come new followers

680
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,727
So, I guess we will have to start all over again

681
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:27,348
What happened to you?

682
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:31,134
If I told you...

683
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:34,597
..that the evidence couldn't stand

684
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:37,839
would you like to start over?

685
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,890
I'm sorry. I broke the law

686
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,820
What do you think of the police force's
morale after 1997?

687
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:50,391
Chinese people are sentimental

688
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,240
I hope the law will continue to back me up

689
01:18:53,696 --> 01:18:57,296
But, I strongly believe in myself, sir!

690
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,620
I'm grateful to all of you

691
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,450
But I've got no confidence left. I lost!

692
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:06,337
What about Luk then?

693
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:09,599
Can you face him if you give up now?

694
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,659
The war's not over

695
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:18,554
We all want a closure to this incident

696
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:24,583
Hong Kong is not run by the Ngai Family

697
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,736
Here's a file from the Interpol

698
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:34,626
Read it before your make up your mind

699
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,389
Ever been to a funeral in Thailand?

700
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:03,584
A few months ago...

701
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,483
[had one for my wife

702
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:12,230
The monks chanted for three full days

703
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:19,388
I didn't shed a single tear

704
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:24,515
On the day of the burial...

705
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:30,595
.. they left the casket in the living room

706
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:33,924
l was mad

707
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:35,807
l wanted to beat them up

708
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,910
The monk told me

709
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,541
it's a tradition in Thailand

710
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,372
The deceased...

711
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:51,352
As long as we keep her company...

712
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:54,058
for a little while longer

713
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,325
she can attain eternal peace

714
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,447
But I asked the monk

715
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:10,376
what if my wife was not in the coffin?

716
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,364
Could she still attain eternal peace?

717
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:23,984
Sorry about your wife

718
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:32,833
The monk placed his hand here

719
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,974
He said, "No problem

720
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:41,721
Your wife's here."

721
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:49,523
And here's exactly...

722
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,324
..where the Thais shot me!

723
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:00,878
So I told myself

724
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,526
I've passed the point of no return

725
01:22:14,797 --> 01:22:18,717
Testifying against Hau could be dangerous

726
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:26,522
I believe in you. You're so handsome

727
01:22:30,746 --> 01:22:33,496
Haven't heard that for ages. Thanks

728
01:22:36,752 --> 01:22:37,862
What's your plan?

729
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,536
Just trying to do my best

730
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,935
No big deal. It's my job

731
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,332
I'll leave Hong Kong when it's all over

732
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:19,603
You've changed

733
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,067
Baby

734
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:14,338
You diluted the coke, didn't you?

735
01:24:17,953 --> 01:24:19,003
Got anything to say?

736
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:34,855
Take it all then!

737
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:42,716
Don't go too far, Yan

738
01:24:43,145 --> 01:24:44,895
It'd break the boys' morale

739
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:50,887
Mr. Ngai asked me to be in charge here

740
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:54,661
Don't like it? Drive him to the hospital!

741
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:11,802
No matter what

742
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:13,514
they're elders after all

743
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:16,923
You've got lots to learn from them

744
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:21,721
Uncle John will retire in a few years

745
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:26,077
You know what I mean?

746
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:29,966
I don't need any hiccups now

747
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,909
The Labor Athletic Association has a formal...

748
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,340
.. for us Political Consultative candidates

749
01:25:42,004 --> 01:25:43,524
If everything works out

750
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,970
our family will no longer live in shadows

751
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:15,556
Mr. Cheung

752
01:26:15,871 --> 01:26:16,601
Mr. Ngai

753
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:18,769
How are you? Good. Good

754
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,754
When Solicitor Hung mentioned you

755
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:22,569
I didn't believe him

756
01:26:23,145 --> 01:26:25,775
You're amazingly young, Mr. Ngai

757
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:27,465
What's your Zodiac?

758
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:29,494
Ox

759
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:30,635
The Year of the Ox

760
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:32,829
Ox's good

761
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:36,238
Director Chan likes young people

762
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:38,465
I'll introduce you later. Thanks

763
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:39,654
Really?

764
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:45,790
Director Chan said he hated the triads

765
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:53,977
That's right, SP Leung

766
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,806
Mr. Ngai's been invited to consult the police

767
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:00,577
Really? Congratulations!

768
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:02,513
Where do you golf these days, Chan?

769
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:03,571
Zhong Shan Onsen

770
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:05,789
What's your handicap these days?

771
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,077
How are you? My name's Ngai...

772
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,650
Mr. Ngai Wing-Hau

773
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:24,755
I'm Mr. Ngai's solicitor

774
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,420
Tonight's a celebration for HK's hand-over

775
01:27:27,943 --> 01:27:29,343
All other businesses can wait

776
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:30,728
What if l say no?

777
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:32,509
Got any problem with that?

778
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:36,934
Mr. Ngai

779
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:37,779
You're a suspect

780
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,426
in several murder cases in 1995

781
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,400
You're under arrest

782
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:44,949
This is your arrest warrant

783
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:46,784
Everything you say

784
01:27:47,129 --> 01:27:48,499
will be recorded...

785
01:27:48,964 --> 01:27:50,484
and could be used as evidence against you

786
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:51,962
Do you have any question?

787
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:53,704
No

788
01:28:07,716 --> 01:28:08,916
I looked through their files

789
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:10,647
The murder charges won't stand

790
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,790
But your being a triad boss...

791
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:15,763
That one will stick

792
01:28:17,092 --> 01:28:19,612
The unions and the political parties called

793
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,938
They want to withdraw their invitations

794
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,940
Words from the HK and Macau Affairs Office

795
01:28:27,903 --> 01:28:29,773
They have revoked your candidacy

796
01:28:30,572 --> 01:28:32,532
Call Beijing. Get some friends to help

797
01:28:33,175 --> 01:28:34,025
Let me try

798
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:35,216
Forget it

799
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:37,594
They even found a dead man to testify against you

800
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,720
Everyone knows how loyal Sam was to you

801
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:43,300
Now he's the prosecution's witness It's over

802
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:45,846
Sorry. Can't help you

803
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:48,352
You said there'd be no problem!

804
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,670
Everyone's watching how we will react

805
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:52,382
What're you going to do?

806
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:53,954
What can I do?

807
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:55,136
Threaten the government?

808
01:28:55,597 --> 01:28:56,797
Don't take it the wrong way

809
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:58,898
We're all in the same boat

810
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:00,451
Time for me to get off then

811
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:03,653
I'm just a lawyer. Not one of you

812
01:29:04,606 --> 01:29:06,856
I don't intend to sink with you. Sorry

813
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,370
Yes

814
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:23,149
Sam has a wife and a daughter are in Thailand!

815
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:26,436
It's your call

816
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:34,985
Sis

817
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:38,755
You and the brothers should take mom...

818
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:41,317
... and go to Hawaii for a while

819
01:29:43,612 --> 01:29:46,162
Okay. Haven't been there for a while

820
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,698
Are you going to be all right?

821
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,079
I'll be fine

822
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:02,439
Sorry I can't help the family

823
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:03,771
The key thing now is you turn out okay

824
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:05,369
Don't be silly. We're a family!

825
01:30:06,668 --> 01:30:07,808
Take care of mom!

826
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,400
Don't worry. Leave it to us three

827
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,244
Even with my testimony

828
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,275
Hau will only get a couple years

829
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:32,386
It's true

830
01:30:32,694 --> 01:30:35,274
He'll have to whack you to get life

831
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:45,022
l have to thank you

832
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:47,031
Without you

833
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:49,276
l could never have come back

834
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:54,614
Save it! I'm busy these days

835
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:57,333
Anything you need, ask them

836
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,626
They'll protect you

837
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:17,538
Sam!

838
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,129
Thanks

839
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:26,796
So, how's it going?

840
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:30,392
Good. Been transferred to the CIB

841
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:33,292
Will be Inspector-in-Training next month

842
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:41,314
Did Mary call you...

843
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:43,590
.. before she left...?

844
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:54,673
Don't be too hard on yourself, Sam

845
01:32:01,483 --> 01:32:05,643
Inspector Wong said to find you if 1 needed anything

846
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:10,063
Will you really help me?

847
01:33:24,165 --> 01:33:25,505
I thought you wouldn't come

848
01:33:28,903 --> 01:33:30,073
Why's that?

849
01:33:46,588 --> 01:33:47,197
So here we are

850
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:49,676
It's been two years

851
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:53,696
Because of my father's case

852
01:33:54,162 --> 01:33:55,562
you didn't dare to call me for two years?

853
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:57,391
You couldn't face me?

854
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,411
Right

855
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,269
All you need to nail Hau is in the safe

856
01:34:17,585 --> 01:34:18,985
I've organized the files according to dates

857
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:25,465
Why do you still help me?

858
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:35,479
I'm not helping you

859
01:34:37,906 --> 01:34:39,016
I'm a cop

860
01:34:40,642 --> 01:34:42,662
l want to keep my promises to SP Luk!

861
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,370
And I don't want to be a mole any more

862
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:52,237
Two more years and I'll become the top dog

863
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:56,338
What for? To end up in prison?

864
01:35:04,766 --> 01:35:06,316
Let's bury the past

865
01:35:07,602 --> 01:35:10,732
Just bring me back into the department

866
01:35:12,073 --> 01:35:14,213
Give me a desk

867
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:16,059
Make sure it has a sea view

868
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:19,980
And don't let me see your face again

869
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:24,511
Don't worry

870
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:25,892
You won't see me any more

871
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,418
One more thing

872
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:31,971
[ couldn't spell some of the words

873
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,769
Come find me if you don't understand

874
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:38,108
But don't mess up the order

875
01:35:38,866 --> 01:35:40,356
I'll kill you if you mess that up!

876
01:35:41,869 --> 01:35:44,239
That's great. Put me out of misery!

877
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,309
You wish!

878
01:35:54,549 --> 01:35:55,689
Thank you, officer

879
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:02,330
The trial will start in three days

880
01:37:04,085 --> 01:37:04,985
Mr. Hon

881
01:38:05,613 --> 01:38:06,463
OCTB!

882
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:11,957
Inspector Wong! Sam's gone!

883
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:28,871
He escaped through the kitchen

884
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,704
Who was guarding the kitchen?

885
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:35,545
Sorry, sir

886
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:39,265
Sam'd made a call to Thailand...

887
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:40,827
.. before he escaped

888
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:36,693
Mr. Ngai

889
01:39:37,705 --> 01:39:38,934
What do you want from me?

890
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:42,135
You called me

891
01:39:43,845 --> 01:39:46,625
So tell me how you can help me

892
01:39:47,215 --> 01:39:48,945
Am I right? Sit down

893
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:01,635
Whack me!

894
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:06,639
Kill me and it's all over!

895
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:08,808
Why should I?

896
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,750
Haven't done that kind of stuff for ages

897
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:16,964
Everything can be negotiated

898
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:19,639
Hong Kong's big enough for us both, Sam

899
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:22,507
We can even be partners

900
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:28,050
Let's forget about the past

901
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:46,369
You will kill me

902
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,592
You'll kill me tonight

903
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:03,248
But who's gonna take care of your family?

904
01:41:21,876 --> 01:41:22,726
Just in!

905
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:25,350
Hau has Sam's wife and daughter as hostages

906
01:41:26,614 --> 01:41:28,574
That's his Thai maid!

907
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,842
l managed to stay alive all these years

908
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:43,980
It's all because...

909
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:46,996
... [have some good buddies in Thailand

910
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:55,498
You want to take this call

911
01:41:58,145 --> 01:41:59,345
It's from Hawaii

912
01:42:04,485 --> 01:42:05,714
Your whole family's there

913
01:42:08,189 --> 01:42:09,449
My Thai buddies, too

914
01:42:20,935 --> 01:42:21,985
Hello! Mr Ngai

915
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:23,183
My boss asked me

916
01:42:23,838 --> 01:42:25,447
to take good care of your family

917
01:42:37,685 --> 01:42:39,795
Daddy! Where are you?

918
01:42:45,793 --> 01:42:46,553
Mr. Ngai!

919
01:42:51,232 --> 01:42:52,132
Shut up!

920
01:42:58,305 --> 01:43:00,035
You'll whack me tonight. I told you so

921
01:43:56,163 --> 01:43:58,333
Put it down, Ngai Wing-Hau!

922
01:43:58,866 --> 01:43:59,916
Let him

923
01:44:02,169 --> 01:44:03,479
He tried to kill me once before

924
01:44:04,939 --> 01:44:06,399
Let him do it again!

925
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:15,695
Officers

926
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:19,682
After he shoots me...

927
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:23,462
..it'll be your call to shoot him or not

928
01:44:30,531 --> 01:44:33,571
What goes around comes around!

929
01:46:50,771 --> 01:46:51,880
Two questions

930
01:46:55,476 --> 01:46:57,056
Did you kill his whole family?

931
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:00,570
Of course not!

932
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:06,210
My buddies and I were just scaring him!

933
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:10,818
Did you expect me to kill him for you?

934
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,714
Would you believe me if 1 said no?

935
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:23,879
l expected to die here

936
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,519
It was my only way

937
01:47:34,682 --> 01:47:35,581
Sorry

938
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:40,763
Did you know how hard I worked...

939
01:47:41,689 --> 01:47:43,359
.. to collect tons of evidence...

940
01:47:44,091 --> 01:47:45,701
..to put him away for life?

941
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:11,100
How are you?

942
01:48:11,618 --> 01:48:13,288
The Thai guy, Sam

943
01:48:18,258 --> 01:48:19,367
Paul!

944
01:48:20,728 --> 01:48:21,628
Thank you

945
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:23,132
It's all good

946
01:48:23,897 --> 01:48:25,677
We're now partners

947
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:29,397
Cocaine straight to HK from now on

948
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:33,404
Should ! wrap up the Ngai episode?

949
01:48:34,074 --> 01:48:35,004
Paul...

950
01:48:36,643 --> 01:48:39,683
Maybe we shouldn't go too far

951
01:48:40,748 --> 01:48:42,388
It was pure luck that you bumped into me

952
01:48:44,485 --> 01:48:45,945
Otherwise you would've been killed

953
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:48,400
We were destined to be partners...

954
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:50,701
.. when my gun failed to kill you

955
01:48:51,492 --> 01:48:52,892
You can never go too far. Get it?

956
01:49:22,689 --> 01:49:25,439
The hand-over ceremony of Hong Kong...

957
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:28,810
... commenced earlier at 11:20

958
01:49:30,297 --> 01:49:33,547
Both countries' anthems were played

959
01:49:34,968 --> 01:49:36,458
A British flag

960
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:39,269
rose up in the hall

961
01:49:41,608 --> 01:49:42,948
The ceremony was dignified

962
01:49:43,544 --> 01:49:44,594
Yet it'd had its share of relaxed moments...

963
01:49:44,978 --> 01:49:46,728
before its commencement

964
01:49:47,815 --> 01:49:49,955
When both countries’ marching bands played

965
01:49:50,717 --> 01:49:53,237
some Chinese representatives took pictures

966
01:49:54,221 --> 01:49:55,420
Prince Charles

967
01:49:55,823 --> 01:49:59,303
and Governor Patten were smiling

968
01:50:00,828 --> 01:50:02,908
As the ceremony officially commenced

969
01:50:05,666 --> 01:50:06,656
Three British soldiers

970
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,900
and three Chinese ones...

971
01:50:10,838 --> 01:50:13,447
.. marched slowly onto the podium

972
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:18,110
The Chinese soldiers...

973
01:50:18,712 --> 01:50:21,842
displayed the PRC flag

974
01:50:24,084 --> 01:50:25,374
Following their lead...

975
01:50:25,686 --> 01:50:27,856
Three HK Royal Police officers...

976
01:50:28,589 --> 01:50:30,639
..emerged with

977
01:50:31,191 --> 01:50:33,471
three HK SAR Police officers

978
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:39,150
The three SAR officers displayed...

979
01:50:39,766 --> 01:50:41,816
... the HKSAR flag to the honorable guests

980
01:50:43,504 --> 01:50:44,434
And now

981
01:50:44,705 --> 01:50:47,365
all the guests have risen

982
01:50:49,743 --> 01:50:51,703
It was exactly midnight

983
01:50:52,179 --> 01:50:53,789
The arrival of July 1st, 1997

984
01:50:55,015 --> 01:50:56,005
The PRC flag rose up...

985
01:50:56,517 --> 01:50:59,767
with the HKSAR flag

986
01:51:02,022 --> 01:51:04,862
marking the end of the colonial era

987
01:51:05,692 --> 01:51:07,272
It also signified the beginning...

988
01:51:07,628 --> 01:51:10,237
...of the One Country Two Systems policy

989
01:51:11,298 --> 01:51:12,788
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region...

990
01:51:13,233 --> 01:51:15,843
... of the People's Republic of China
has been established

991
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:45,550
Okay. It's a deal

992
01:52:46,126 --> 01:52:47,416
Come join me

993
01:52:47,861 --> 01:52:49,561
You know what kind of boss is the worst?

994
01:52:49,963 --> 01:52:51,603
The ugly boss

995
01:52:52,032 --> 01:52:54,282
Look's everything! Look how I shine!

996
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:01,505
What's your name, miss?

997
01:53:15,656 --> 01:53:17,436
What's your name, miss?

998
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:27,365
I'm Ma... Mary

999
01:53:28,568 --> 01:53:30,678
MAA...

1000
01:53:31,838 --> 01:53:33,478
M-A-Y...

1001
01:53:34,041 --> 01:53:35,941
M-A-R-Y

1002
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:41,606
M-A-R-Y

1003
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:05,386
Continuous Hell embodies 3 components:

1004
01:54:06,039 --> 01:54:08,228
Uninterrupted Time,
Unlimited Space Boundless Suffering

1005
01:54:08,909 --> 01:54:10,489
Transgressers of the Five Deadly Sins
fall into this hell forever

1006
01:54:11,011 --> 01:54:12,381
condemned to the ultimate incessant suffering
