00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,147
Another village destroyed

4
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,534
Let's go, soon. this will also
be consumed in the Sea of Decay

5
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,705
1,000 years after the collapse
of industrial civilization,

6
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,314
the Sea of Decay, a swamp
exuding toxic vapors,

7
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,854
covered an earth strewn
with rusting ruins,

8
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,509
threatening human survival

16
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,442
An Ohm's tracks

17
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,758
They're still fresh

18
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,176
An Ohm's shell

19
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,460
Amazing

20
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,611
I've never seen a perfect shall

21
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,466
Lovely sound

22
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,756
It chipped my ceramic sword

23
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,875
The villagers will be pleased

24
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,928
They'll have plenty to
make into tools now

25
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,656
What an eye

26
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,405
l wonder if 1 can carry it

27
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,385
It came free

28
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,932
It's incredibly light

29
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,858
Mushigo Palm spores

30
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,512
So beautiful...

31
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,045
Though in this forest of death,
your lungs would rot

32
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,217
in 5 minutes without a mask

33
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,344
Who is that?

34
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,704
What can it be?

35
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,038
My heart's pounding

36
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,548
Those are gunshots

37
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,847
An insect is
attacking someone

38
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,225
Oh, I'm sorry!

39
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,015
Over there!

40
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,631
What a thick spore cloud

41
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,362
An Ohm!

42
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,988
That must have been its shell

43
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,842
Don't run that way

44
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,011
Look this way!

45
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,008
They answered!
They're coming

46
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,298
Who's that?

47
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,011
What a magnificent Ohm

48
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,095
Go upwind!

49
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,359
Thank you!

50
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,650
Return to the forest, Ohm

51
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,411
This is not your world

52
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,555
Be a good boy

53
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,616
It's blinded by rage

54
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,264
I've got to calm him

55
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,169
The flares stunned it

56
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,953
An insect charm

57
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,939
Awaken, Ohm

58
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,642
Return to the forest

59
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,454
It's awake

60
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,060
The Ohm's returning to the forest

61
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,760
She tamed that Ohm with
flares and an insect charm

62
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,306
Lord Yupa!

63
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,230
Nausicaa
l hardly recognized you

64
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,935
It's been a year and half

65
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,276
Father will be glad

66
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,171
I must thank you

67
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,194
You've become a great wind-rider

68
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,165
Oh, no, not according to father

69
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,507
Oh. of course
I'd completely forgotten about him

70
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,871
A fox-squirrel
I've never seen one

71
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,540
When a winged insect snatched him,
l took him for a human child

72
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,694
l had to fire my gun

73
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,770
That's what enraged the Ohm

74
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,402
He'd fainted so was
spared the poison

75
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,122
Better not touch him
Even young, they're savage

76
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,513
Come

77
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,014
Here

78
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,159
Hey...

79
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,376
You're not scared

80
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,369
You're not scared

81
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,347
See... you're not scared

82
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,385
See...

83
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,171
You were just frightened

84
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,485
Lord Yupa, may I have him?

85
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,578
Why certainly...

86
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,057
Thank you

87
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,645
Kai and Kui
Remember me?

88
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,742
A mysterious power

89
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,935
You must be tired
You ran so far

90
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,659
Is everyone well?

91
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,560
What's wrong?

92
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,386
My father...

93
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,478
He can no longer fly

94
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,558
Jihl...

95
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,390
The forest poisons?

96
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,206
Yes

97
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,127
He says it's fate for those
living by the Sea of Decay

98
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,665
l should have come sooner

99
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,502
Oh, no

100
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,704
Thank you for coming

101
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,957
Lord Yupa, there's something
lI want to show you

102
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,264
My secret room

103
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,132
It's a secret
I don’t want to scare them

104
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,368
I'll tell them you're coming

105
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,682
Come soon!

106
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,651
Lord Yupa

107
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,733
Would you carry this?

108
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,093
It's hard to fly with

109
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,400
She certainly reads the wind well

110
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,626
Not far now

111
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,603
Oh...
Lord Yupa

112
00:15:58,858 --> 00:15:59,497
Welcome

113
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,092
Are you in good health?

114
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,885
The waters and winds
are clear and calm

115
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:07,803
Lord Yupa

116
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,024
Hello all, you're well

117
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,617
Lord Yupa

118
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,958
We've missed you

119
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,843
Princess, he has come

120
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,535
Wait

121
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,284
Lord Yupa

122
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,165
Old Mito, you're hard at work

123
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,458
Tonight I'll hear
tales of your travels

124
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,690
OK, start it

125
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,640
Seems to work

126
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:02,938
Yes

127
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,165
This is excellent

128
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,660
Tomorrow, we'll send
people to get the rest

129
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,944
Come, Toato

130
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,861
Lord Yupa
This is Toeto's baby, born this year

131
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,327
Oh, let's have a look

132
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,733
A fine baby

133
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,502
Reminds me of Nausicaa
as a baby

134
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,575
Please be her godfather

135
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,538
Name her that a fair wind
may favor her

136
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,798
1 will indeed

137
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,893
I'll find her a fine name

138
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,739
Thank you

139
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,980
May she grow up
as strong as our Princess

140
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,231
She's as strong as they come

141
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,988
But we won't want her
playing in the Sea of Decay

142
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,844
But that's where
l found the Ohm shell

143
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,283
Put yourself in my shoes
I'm responsible for this castle

144
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,083
She's made me sick with worry

145
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:02,351
Let her play in the Sea of Decay
if she finds us Ohm shells

146
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:06,081
Indeed. her presence
there saved me

147
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,372
Saved by the girl?

148
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,732
This is a fine valley
Being here calms my spirits

149
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,929
How was your journey?

150
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,500
It was terrible

151
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,805
The Sea of Decay consumed
2 more countries to the south

152
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,466
It's spreading all the time

153
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,625
And yet war and hunger
are everywhere

154
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,978
Nothing but bad omens

155
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,375
Why can't they live
as you do in this valley?

156
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:13,358
The ocean winds protect our valley

157
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,633
The Sea of Decay
can't reach us here

158
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,660
What do you say, Yupa?

159
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,024
Isn't it time you
settled in this valley?

160
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,795
Look at my condition

161
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,151
It would please everyone

162
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,587
Don't bother

163
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:34,352
Yupa's a man who is fated
to search forever

164
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,802
Fate, huh...

165
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,541
Obaba. what's
he searching for?

166
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,543
Oh. my, don't you
know, Nausicaa?

167
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,111
Look, see the tapestry on the wall...

168
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,961
I no longer see it

169
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,663
The figure in the left corner

170
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,755
“...clothed in blue robes,

171
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,296
“dascending onto a golden field.

172
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,873
“to join bonds
with the great earth

173
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:12,888
“and guide the people
to the pure land, at last”

174
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:17,443
Lord Yupa. I always thought
that was only a legend

175
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,450
You mustn't tease me, Obaba

176
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,136
It's the same thing

177
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,909
I only wish to solve
the Sea of Decay's mysteries

178
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,551
Are we humans but a tribe
destined to be swallowed

179
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,751
and ruined by the Sea of Decay?

180
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,754
That is what wish to know

181
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,949
If only ! could help Lord Yupa...

182
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,861
Princess, Princess

183
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,005
What is it, Mito?

184
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,386
A strange scent on the wind

185
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,416
It's nearly dawn
I'll be right there

186
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,556
How is it?

187
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,544
It's one fine storm,
but something's amiss

188
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,312
Over there!

189
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,456
Look!

190
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,151
It's a ship

191
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,379
Why would a ship be here?

192
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,659
What is it?

193
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,008
Lord Yupa
It's a ship

194
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:11,143
A ship!

195
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,060
It's coming closer

196
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,290
It's huge!

197
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,457
It's a Tolmekian ship

198
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,769
It's not flying right

199
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:33,995
It's an emergency landing

200
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:35,713
Help me up, Gol

201
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,999
Princess, you mustn't!

202
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,040
I'll guide them to the shore

203
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,559
It's coming about

204
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,320
Off you go!

205
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,213
Teto!

206
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,016
How dare they!

207
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,543
They must have landed before
and killed some insects

208
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,335
Turn away!
You'll crash!

209
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,925
Turn away!

210
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,143
Turn!

211
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,178
It crashed

212
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,214
The Princess

213
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,497
The cliffs

214
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:51,809
Let's go!

215
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,043
Everyone to the rescue

216
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,735
Even the boys!

217
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,139
It's that girl, she's alive

218
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:43,905
Where aml...

219
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,458
The Valley of the Wind
Save your strength

220
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,015
My name is...

221
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,379
Lastel of Pejite

222
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,672
My cargo...
Burn the cargo...

223
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,353
The cargo...

224
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,218
Please, burn it

225
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,244
Your cargo, ! understand

226
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,220
Don't worry
It's all in flames

227
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,247
Thank goodness

228
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,952
Princess!

229
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:35,063
That's...
The Princess of Pejite

230
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,215
An insect!
An Ushiabu’s alive

231
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,598
Oh, no, it's calling its friends

232
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,123
It can't fly

233
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,028
Bring guns!

234
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,412
No, if you shoot it.
it'll call others

235
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,022
lil kill it now

236
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,840
Guns won't kill an Ushiabu

237
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,272
Then what!

238
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,700
Wait

239
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,774
Mito
Bring my glider

240
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,871
Princess!

241
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,076
Return to the forest

242
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,689
You're strong, you can fly

243
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,221
That's a good boy

244
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,178
Princess

245
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,538
Thanks

246
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:08,476
Thank God

247
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:12,537
No telling how we'd suffer for
even a single insect's death

248
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,889
An Ohm...

249
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,412
Found one!
Come!

250
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:14,789
Here!

251
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,033
So those were spores
stuck to that ship

252
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,123
They haven't released
any toxins yet

253
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,270
We're almost done

254
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,581
know
We can’t miss a single one

255
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:38,512
What on earth is this?

256
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,067
The fire didn't destroy it...

257
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,320
Leave this mystery
for later, folks

258
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,830
Go and help burn the spores

259
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,399
Be careful, now

260
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,760
Why'd she bring this
bundle of trouble here

261
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,296
Mito, look here

262
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,287
It's pulsing
Almost like it's alive

263
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:08,441
Lord Yupa, what is this...

264
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:12,051
On my journey
] heard ominous rumors...

265
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,324
That a monster from the
old world that had slept

266
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,214
beneath Peiite,
had been unearthed

267
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,706
A monster from the old world?

268
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,592
Giant Warriors...

269
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:22,613
The Giant Warriors!

270
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,041
They say they were destroyed
in the Seven Days of Fire

271
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:28,762
This...

272
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,730
The Giant Warriors were all
said to have turned to stone

273
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:46,394
But a single one slept in
the earth for 1,000 years

274
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,500
In... Ina way, the thing
looks almost human

275
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:56,007
Tolmekia's a savage military state.
far to our west

276
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:59,562
And remember the Pejite
captive who perished...

277
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,262
Keep up the good work

278
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,288
What's that?

279
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,688
Tolmekian ships!

280
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,137
Everyone to the castle!

281
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,960
To the castle!

282
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,178
Gather in the castle!

283
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:56,627
The castle!

284
00:31:58,784 --> 00:31:59,954
Father!

285
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,966
Obaba, hide yourself

286
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,945
I'll stay right where ! am

287
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,742
Princess!

288
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,990
How dare you!

289
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,772
Nausicaa...

290
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,649
Stay where you are!

291
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,724
Move and this sword.
carved of insect shall

292
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,476
will pierce your ceramic armor

293
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,629
That's Yupa...

294
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,041
l ask you Tolmekian warriors

295
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,600
Last night, these villagers toiled
desperately to save one of your ships

296
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,992
We have just now gently
laid one of your dead to rest

297
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:45,833
Is this how you Tolmekians treat
such a nation, however weak!

298
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,515
If you would make war,
you must have reasons

299
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,958
You should first send a messenger
to declare them

300
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,595
Nausicaa...
Be calm, Nausicaa

301
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,512
If you fight now.
they will slaughter the villagers

302
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,099
We must survive
Wait for our chance

303
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,609
You...

304
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,058
Little wench

305
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,826
Put it down, Kurotowa

306
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,541
But...

307
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,095
Look at this mess
Killed them all

308
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,263
Your rebuke stings

309
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,762
Are you Yupamiralda.
the greatest swordsman of this region?

310
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,696
We have not come for slaughter
We wish to talk

311
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,909
Lay down your sword

312
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,481
The Princess!

313
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,036
Princess!

314
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,388
Listen well!

315
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,263
Her Highness Kushana, Division
Commander of the Tolmekian

316
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,533
Frontier Forces will speak

317
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:30,902
We have come to unify
the frontier nations

318
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,426
and build peace in this region

319
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,667
You live on the brink of extinction
beside the Sea of Decay

320
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,941
Accept our rule
and join our enterprise

321
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:47,132
We shall burn away the Sea of Decay
and resurrect the earth!

322
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,841
Burn away the Sea of Decay

323
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,390
Is that possible?

324
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,916
We have revived the
miraculous skills and power

325
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,408
that once allowed humans
to rule this earth

326
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,609
For those who submit to us,

327
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,674
I promise a life free from fear of
the toxins and insects of that swamp

328
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,066
Wait!

329
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,024
You must not harm the Sea of Decay

330
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,241
What's that, you old hag

331
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,883
Take her away

332
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,638
Let her speak

333
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,176
In the 1,000 years
of the Sea of Decay,

334
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:29,687
countless times have humans
sought to burn it away

335
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,165
Yet... each time herds
of Ohms, blind with rage,

336
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:38,893
have swarmed the earth,
like a tidal wave

337
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,633
Destroying nations,
swallowing cities,

338
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:55,167
the Ohms' rage would not quiet

339
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,549
until they starved to death

340
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,350
In time, the spores

341
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,497
took root in the Ohms’ rotting flesh,

342
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,734
and engulfed our vast
earth in this Sea of Decay

343
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,812
You must not touch
the Sea of Decay

344
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,691
Enough!
No more of your ravings

345
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,774
Ah! What will you do?

346
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,883
Kill me, too?

347
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,545
You!

348
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,406
Kill me if you will!

349
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,778
Easy work to murder
an old blind woman

350
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,092
Just as you murdered Jihl

351
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:30,648
Not Jihl!

352
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,402
How cruel!
He was helpless!

353
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:38,689
Shut them up!

354
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,183
Show no mercy to impudence!

355
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,129
Wait. everyone!

356
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,883
Please listen to me

357
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,606
1 don’t want anymore sacrifices

358
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,926
Please

359
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:55,506
Princess...

360
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,569
You, too, Obaba

361
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,994
We must submit to these people

362
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,422
Step on it

363
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,341
Hurry up

364
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,445
It really is a lovely valley

365
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,774
I'm against it

366
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,739
We have orders to send the
Giant Warrior back at once

367
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,470
An order we can't possibly fulfill

368
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,336
Even our biggest ship
collapsed from its weight

369
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,770
But you can't be serious
about building a nation here...

370
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,453
And what if 1 am?

371
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,152
You expect me to hand over that
monster as a toy for those fools?

372
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,223
You have a point...

373
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,419
! am but a simple soldier

374
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,587
Such a decision is beyond my position

375
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,136
You're a sly fox

376
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:18,623
While I'm in Pejite. your priority
is to revive that Giant Warrior

377
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,770
Yes

378
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,067
Can this gun ship fly?

379
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,230
Yes, we found it here

380
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,360
Get this straight
I'm not asking you

381
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,671
But take the Princess to Pejite....

382
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,214
5 hostages, the gun ship and food...

383
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,509
You pick the hostages

384
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,739
Prepare everything
for the morning

385
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,723
Thanks for going as a hostage

386
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,742
We're fine, but look

387
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,114
They're taking everything in sight

388
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:02,604
I will slip away, return in secret
and await my chance

389
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,827
We must prevent that
monster's resurrection

390
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:06,824
Yes

391
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,582
Nausicaa

392
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,664
Teto, where is she?

393
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,836
Nausicaa! What on earth is this?

394
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,529
These plants are from
the Sea of Decay

395
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,119
I've grown them
from spores I collected

396
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,536
Don't worry, they're not toxic

397
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,298
Not toxic...

398
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,324
The air here is pure indeed, but...

399
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,238
Why... with this deadly poisonous
plant blooming

400
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,856
The castle windmill draws

401
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,385
water from deep within the earth

402
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:57,069
The sand, too, comes from
the very bottom of the well

403
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,862
With pure water and soil,

404
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,844
the plants from the Sea of Decay
are not poisonous

405
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,598
The pollution lies in the earth itself

406
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,147
Even the earth of our valley

407
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:09,853
Why...

408
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,342
Who made such a
terrible mess of the world?

409
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,236
Did you do this all yourself?

410
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,469
Yes

411
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,284
To cure my father's illness
and that of others

412
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,109
But...

413
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,257
I'm closing it down

414
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:32,957
I just shut off the water and
they'll soon wither and die

415
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,091
Nausicaa

416
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,769
l frighten myself

417
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,697
[don't know what my rage
will make me do

418
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,127
I don't want to kill anyone

419
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:32,587
Princess

420
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,125
We gathered these for you

421
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,139
Chiko nuts

422
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,867
They're for you

423
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,157
All of you...

424
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,930
So many

425
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:45,862
You've worked so hard

426
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,232
Thank you

427
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,926
They're very precious

428
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,215
It's not fair, Princess

429
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,167
All aboard!
We're taking off

430
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,232
There, now

431
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:58,341
You mustn't cry

432
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,593
Don't worry
I'll be home in no time

433
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:03,736
Really?

434
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,075
Why, have I ever lied to you?

435
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:08,502
No

436
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,077
Right?

437
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,013
Yeah

438
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:12,509
Promise?

439
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,107
Yes

440
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:15,729
Go along, it's dangerous

441
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,127
OK

442
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,280
You promised!

443
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,722
Take care of the Princess!

444
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,362
Aren't we in Pejite yet?

445
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,695
My back is killing me

446
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:37,701
Boy oh boy. did the Princess
ever pick a bunch of losers

447
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,220
Hey, isn't this strange?

448
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,590
Why do they fly so close together?

449
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,143
Like they're afraid of an attack

450
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,404
Toxins swirl below the clouds

451
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:17,561
Don't move

452
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:22,062
A gun ship!

453
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,819
Enemy fire!
They've hit ship #2!

454
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,563
I told you so

455
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,504
Wow, terrifying!

456
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:51,458
Defense formation!

457
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:52,606
That's a Pejite gun ship

458
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:53,564
Pejite!

459
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,140
Damn! They got #3

460
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:10,106
What's the Korvet doing?

461
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,665
Their ships just crumble

462
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,529
Oh no, he's hit our tail

463
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:29,996
The Barge tether snapped

464
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:37,577
Hurry, Teto

465
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,017
Oh, no, we're going down

466
00:47:59,009 --> 00:47:59,529
Princess!

467
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,596
Stop! No more killing!

468
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,271
No more!

469
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:39,959
Princess

470
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:49,649
Hurry, Mito!

471
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,408
Princess, we're doomed

472
00:48:58,502 --> 00:48:59,262
Maybe I can fly it

473
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,399
Are you crazy!

474
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:03,272
Hurry, Mito!

475
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,204
What? Right!

476
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,994
Start the engine!
Blast open the door!

477
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:18,605
Come!

478
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,673
Hurry

479
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,694
Get inside
Mito, ready?

480
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:26,766
Ready or not!

481
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,963
Full throttle when we take off!

482
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:31,822
Roger!

483
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,129
Ready

484
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,127
Go!

485
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:46,813
Put on the toxin mask

486
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,194
Drop below the clouds
to find the Barge

487
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,511
You're still warm
Don't give up, Teto

488
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,950
What is this place!

489
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:20,212
I've never seen
such dense toxins

490
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:23,195
Keep an eye on the right tail

491
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:24,347
It's nearby

492
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,889
It's still aloft

493
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,765
Hey! You're right!

494
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,377
There it is!

495
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,025
It's the Princess!
Princess!

496
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,790
Don't give up, everyone

497
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:49,895
I'll throw you a rope

498
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,238
Our hook's broken

499
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,280
You can't hook us in mid-air

500
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,609
I don't want to crash and
become insect food!

501
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,785
We'll leap to our deaths!

502
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,144
Don't panic!
Ditch your cargo

503
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,444
Good bye
Farewell!

504
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,196
Listen to me!
Toss your cargo!

505
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,169
Kill the rear engine

506
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,257
What?

507
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,018
The engine noise is too loud
Hurry!

508
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:14,067
Yes!

509
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:15,982
What?

510
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,581
Princess...
What are you...

511
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,611
Your mask, Princess!

512
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,027
You'll dia!

513
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,575
Put your mask on!

514
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,313
l promise you'll be safe

515
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,292
Trust me and dump that cargo

516
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:34,884
We'll do whatever you say

517
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,679
Please! Put your mask back on!

518
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,551
The Princess is smiling

519
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:46,859
We're going to be OK

520
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,654
Hurry! Lose the cargo

521
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,159
Princess, we're in a nose-dive!

522
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,927
Re-start engines!

523
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:55,214
I inhaled

524
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,565
Hurry, hurry

525
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:15,024
Princess!

526
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,602
Everyone safe?

527
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:17,907
Don't move!

528
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,672
You!

529
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,194
Thanks for saving me

530
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:28,063
Why'd you save her, Princess?

531
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,109
You're a fool

532
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,544
You thought I'd grovel
in gratitude?

533
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,084
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay

534
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:40,609
It isn't like the human world

535
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:44,324
There's no knowing what
a single gunshot will bring

536
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:48,185
That battle hurled
ships into this forest

537
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,965
The insects are furious

538
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,660
Look up

539
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,109
The Yamma are sentries

540
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,580
They'll quickly bring other insects

541
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,524
We must escape now
Throw me your extra rope

542
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,707
Mito, fix the hook

543
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,818
Don't move
l give the orders

544
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,351
What are you so afraid of?

545
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,270
You're just like
a lost fox-squirrel

546
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,229
How dare you!

547
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:24,731
Don't be afraid

548
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:28,152
We just want you to go back
to your own country

549
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,631
You...

550
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:42,158
They're here!

551
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:58,003
Quiet! Don't anger them

552
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,877
This is an Ohm's nest!

553
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:04,016
We're surrounded

554
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,339
They're examining us

555
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,269
Forgive us, Ohm,

556
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,782
for disturbing your nest

557
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:37,674
Please understand,
we're not your enemies

558
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,876
Princess!

559
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:11,627
He's still alive

560
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,739
Wait, Ohm!

561
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,025
What's happening?

562
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,029
Their eyes have turned blood-red

563
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,419
What will you do with the glider?

564
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,890
When the waters quiet,
take off and wait for me above

565
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,943
If I'm not back in 1 hour,
return to the valley

566
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:50,706
But...

567
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:52,731
Princess!

568
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,738
She's gone

569
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,122
Hand it over

570
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,887
All right, everyone

571
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:21,776
We'll do as the Princess said

572
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,335
Princess...

573
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:52,163
Damn!

574
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:28,864
Who are you?

575
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,359
You think only of killing

576
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,647
My flares and charms
won't help now

577
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:36,098
It's quicksand!

578
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,841
Damn!

579
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,581
It's been 2 hours already

580
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,600
More and more insects

581
01:01:11,935 --> 01:01:13,605
Princess!

582
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,892
Princess!

583
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,465
Nausicaa

584
01:01:31,588 --> 01:01:33,458
Nausicaa

585
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:37,598
Come here

586
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:41,940
Come here

587
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,207
Father

588
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,332
Mother's here, too

589
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:09,389
No, I don't want to go

590
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,718
Stay away!

591
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:18,607
There's nothing here

592
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,572
Il said, there's nothing!

593
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,589
Stay inside

594
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:30,202
It's a baby Ohm

595
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,009
She's being used by the insects

596
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,089
Give it to me, Nausicaa

597
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,886
No! It's not doing anything bad

598
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,862
Insects and humans can't
live in the same world

599
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,620
Please, don't kill it!

600
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:00,315
Please!

601
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:19,821
Teto...

602
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,141
What a strange place

603
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:28,521
Hey!

604
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:30,909
I finally found it

605
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,001
How are you feeling?

606
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,392
Where are we?

607
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,119
First, let me thank you

608
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,781
I'm Asbel of Pejite

609
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,013
Thank you for saving me

610
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,200
I'm Nausicaa of
the Valley of the Wind

611
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:48,564
Where are we?

612
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,620
No wonder you're surprised

613
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:54,326
We're beneath the Sea of Decay

614
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,284
Beneath the Sea of Decay?

615
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,309
Look, we fell from up there,

616
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:00,409
along with the sand

617
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,853
We're not wearing masks

618
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,508
That's right
The air here is pure

619
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,745
Couldn't believe it myself,

620
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,534
finding this place
under the Sea of Decay

621
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,810
What is it?

622
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,709
Nausicaa, don't wander too far

623
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,053
What a wonderful tree

624
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,174
Even though it's dead.
water still flows through it

625
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,377
Just like the sand
at the bottom of our well

626
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:06,404
Grains of petrified wood
sifting down from above

627
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,161
Nausicaa

628
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:32,638
Are you crying?

629
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,432
Yes
I'm so happy

630
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,561
Lastel was my twin sister

631
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:03,044
l should have been with her

632
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:06,087
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner

633
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:07,852
Oh, no...

634
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:09,845
I'm sorry

635
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:13,399
I nearly killed the person
who eased my sister's pain

636
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:18,645
I see...
So it's in the Valley of the Wind

637
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:28,343
This nut tastes really weird

638
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:31,665
It's a chiko nut
It's really good for you

639
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,846
It doesn't taste great.
but I could eat a whole boot-full!

640
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,429
Why the Sea of Decay was born...

641
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:04,241
You think the strangest thoughts

642
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:08,600
The trees of the Sea of Decay
grew to cleanse

643
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,457
a world polluted by humans

644
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:14,871
They absorb toxins from the earth,

645
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:18,591
generate pure crystals.
die and turn to sand

646
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:22,666
That's what created
these underground caverns

647
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,073
The insects protect this forest

648
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,920
In that case, we're doomed

649
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:33,044
We can't possibly survive,

650
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:36,058
living in terror of toxins and insects
for thousands of years

651
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:41,466
At least we can find a way
to keep it from spreading

652
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,068
You sound just like Kushana

653
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:49,122
No! We don't plan to use
the Giant Warriors!

654
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,206
You'll see when you
meet my friands tomorrow

655
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,590
Let's go to sleep

656
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:56,760
We have far to go tomorrow

657
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:22,087
All's well

658
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:26,641
On schedule?

659
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,969
The torso is solidifying well

660
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:56,532
You're one cute monster

661
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,383
Makes a poor soldier think

662
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:02,212
of dusting off old ambitions

663
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,299
It's grinning

664
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:12,034
You should've slept beneath
the earth 'til the end of time

665
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:13,795
Counselor !

666
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:17,541
Her Highness' planes were
attacked by Pejite survivors

667
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,669
All crashed, except the Korvet

668
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:21,716
What about Her Highness?

669
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,785
Her ship exploded in flight

670
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,847
Counselor

671
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:32,816
- The villagers don't know yet?
- No

672
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,369
OK, we'll head out

673
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,644
You stay here and keep working

674
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:48,250
Either fortune's finally smiling
on this lowly soldier...

675
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:51,304
Or it's a trap set to destroy me...

676
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,866
Mito and the others have returned,

677
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,921
waiting at Acid Lake, Lord Yupa

678
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:27,918
In shame we return without her

679
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,334
No, no, I'm pleased you're safe

680
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,377
Releasing me?

681
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,056
Drown the Giant Warrior
deep in Acid Lake,

682
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:41,888
and return to your country...

683
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,435
Few of your soldiers remain here

684
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:48,693
We could easily start a fight.
but why sacrifice more people?

685
01:12:49,332 --> 01:12:51,522
Fire and water are powerless against it,

686
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:54,564
and it's only a matter of time
before it starts to walk

687
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:58,097
Don't you see?
It's far too late to turn back

688
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:01,702
My orders to invade Pejite
were motivated by fear

689
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,224
that another country had
harnessed its strength

690
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:07,408
Once its presence here is known,

691
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:10,623
the great powers will
send their armies

692
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,168
You have but one choice left

693
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:19,195
Revive the Giant Warrior.
defy both great powers

694
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,869
and learn to live with that thing

695
01:13:22,265 --> 01:13:23,375
Look

696
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:29,401
An insect did that...?

697
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:33,816
Whoever becomes my husband
will see worse than that

698
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:36,514
Burn the Sea of Decay.
kill the insects,

699
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:39,019
and restore the human world
Why do you hesitate!

700
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:44,360
Steal it from us, just as
we stole it from Pejite

701
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:50,477
We shall not give
the Giant Warrior life

702
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:53,572
Emergency!

703
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,133
What's the password?

704
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,420
I'm in a hurry!

705
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:57,366
Wind

706
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:58,465
Valley!

707
01:13:58,701 --> 01:13:59,221
OK

708
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:00,572
Some spores survived!

709
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,100
What!

710
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:05,327
They're spreading toxins
and the valley's going crazy!

711
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,073
Hand 'em over

712
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:17,552
Hurry up!

713
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,657
Hurry, or the valley's doomed

714
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:22,482
We need our tools back

715
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,406
The tools that burn spores
can also be used as weapons

716
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:30,370
We have no choice
Release everything but their guns

717
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,593
The Korvet's taking off

718
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:34,012
Get through this time

719
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,780
Summon all our troops
from Pejite to this valley

720
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,875
Good grief, now
this is a real mess

721
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,276
Hurry

722
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:45,623
Hurry

723
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:49,674
Find the Princess

724
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,006
Look after the valley

725
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:53,183
Be careful until we return

726
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,764
We're going to the valley

727
01:15:15,745 --> 01:15:18,025
It's no use, the spores
are already here

728
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,188
And on this side, too

729
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,004
Move!

730
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:24,509
What are you doing!

731
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,625
Oh, no, here, too

732
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,748
Obaba

733
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,611
We've no choice but to burn it

734
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:35,633
This forest is doomed

735
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:40,352
If we hesitate, the Sea of Decay
will consume our valley

736
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:43,957
Isn't there anything to be done?

737
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,300
This forest guarded
the reservoir for 3 centuries

738
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,500
Damn! If only they'd never come

739
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,807
This is getting out of hand

740
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,513
Let's go help them

741
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:17,972
You think so?

742
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,429
I think it looks the same as ever

743
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:24,014
The insects have gone

744
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:30,323
I wonder why my heart's
pounding so hard

745
01:16:31,454 --> 01:16:32,384
We're almost there

746
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,201
My friends are just
over that mountain

747
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:56,951
Pejite looks strange

748
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:58,503
What is that haze?

749
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,632
Asbel, your mask

750
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,007
Insects! All dead

751
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:11,906
Head for Pejite

752
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:14,911
Be careful. the Tolmekian
army must be there

753
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,776
Even an Ohm...

754
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,421
It attacked the Great Dome

755
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,338
Pejite's finished

756
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:27,187
They wiped out the Tolmekians,
but this is...

757
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:30,416
They wiped out?
What do you mean, Asbel?

758
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,160
It's a Brig

759
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,897
My friends’ ship!
They're landing, let's go!

760
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,029
Asbel!

761
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,250
You're alive!

762
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,357
What have you done?

763
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,740
We can't rebuild it

764
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,838
You've seen the city

765
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:00,563
Don't worry. if the Sea of Decay
swallows it, we'll burn it away

766
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,530
But the Giant Warrior isn't here

767
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,866
I know, it's in the Valley of the Wind

768
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:06,822
How did...

769
01:19:08,644 --> 01:19:10,374
We haven't exactly been idle

770
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:12,442
We've launched our 2nd phase

771
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,635
We'll wipe out the Tolmekians
in the valley tonight

772
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,045
What!

773
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:19,736
What are you going to do?

774
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:21,492
Who's this, Asbel?

775
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,402
Nausicaa from
the Valley of the Wind

776
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:26,794
l owe her my life

777
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:28,763
Valley of the Wind...

778
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,731
Tall me, what will happen?

779
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,680
You must know, Asbel!
Tell me

780
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:40,868
They'll provoke an insect attack

781
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,525
So you made them
attack Pejite, too!

782
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:51,258
You're... horrible...

783
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:57,621
We simply have to recover the
Giant Warrior before they revive it

784
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,870
We're doing it to save the world

785
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,780
And so you'll murder
everyone in the Valley!

786
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,080
Stop it! Call it off! Please!

787
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,793
It's too late

788
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:11,291
Once they've started,
no one can stop them

789
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:17,873
We've lost most of our
people to the Tolmekians

790
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,954
This is the only way

791
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,520
Let go! Let me fly!

792
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:38,494
It's horrible now, but the Giant
Warrior will purge the Sea of Decay

793
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:40,584
and rebuild the human world

794
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,460
Liar! You're just like the Tolmekians

795
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,982
No, they want to use it for destruction

796
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,636
You drink water from the wells, too

797
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:52,739
Do you know what purifies that water?

798
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:56,235
The trees in the Sea of Decay
cleanse all the lakes

799
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:58,742
and rivers that humans polluted!

800
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,538
And you want to destroy that!

801
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,760
Why did you dig up
that Giant Warrior!

802
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,303
What choice do we have?

803
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:08,468
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?

804
01:21:08,831 --> 01:21:09,971
Never, never!

805
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,042
Tell them, Asbel. how
the Sea of Decay came to be

806
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,085
How the insects protect this world!

807
01:21:16,672 --> 01:21:18,661
Please, Asbel!

808
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,015
What are you doing!

809
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:23,706
Don't move!
Release her

810
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,126
Calm down, Asbel

811
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:27,715
I'm serious

812
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,527
Release her

813
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:31,625
Nausicaa, go and warn them!

814
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,489
Asbel

815
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:39,367
Let me go!

816
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:13,664
Fools

817
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:19,496
No stopping fighting once it starts

818
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:21,768
But he warned us to be careful...

819
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:25,260
Quit dawdling and use the tanks
to rescue our men

820
01:22:25,741 --> 01:22:27,761
Counselor! They got the last man!

821
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:29,630
Coming our way?

822
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:30,865
I don't know

823
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:32,843
The whole village is gathering

824
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:36,555
Why do they go berserk
over a little forest or two?

825
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,379
Just as it was with Pejite

826
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:50,527
They got our tank!

827
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:53,621
Hurry, get it moving

828
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:54,949
Don't panic

829
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:57,831
Incoming fire!

830
01:22:58,607 --> 01:22:59,947
Forward!

831
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:02,953
Hurry up!

832
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:04,825
Maybe this is it?

833
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:07,915
It's moving!

834
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:09,916
Which way?

835
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,845
Forward, move forward

836
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,450
I know that

837
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,055
Damn! Mobilize all the tanks

838
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,941
She survived...

839
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,090
So much for my dreams...

840
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:41,916
Your Highness!

841
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:48,279
We'll hold 'em off here

842
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:51,017
Lead everyone to safety
by Acid Lake

843
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,770
All right

844
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:57,603
It's just until the Princess
returns with the gun ship

845
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:03,916
Hurry everyone!

846
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,463
Stop gawking and help me

847
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:07,884
My aching back

848
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:11,818
The tanks are coming!

849
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:16,347
Hurry!

850
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:18,105
I know that

851
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:35,306
Are you sure?

852
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:36,297
It's a Pejite Brig

853
01:24:36,939 --> 01:24:38,339
l saw it peeking through the clouds

854
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,160
OK!

855
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,929
Watch out, she's a wild one

856
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:04,554
Quickly

857
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:09,291
Nausicaa, you may go free

858
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:10,741
Go warn your Valley

859
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,590
Your glider may get you
there in time

860
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:16,163
It's waiting

861
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:19,526
Asbel told me everything

862
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:22,315
I'll take your place
Put this on

863
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:23,301
You're...

864
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:25,713
Lastel’s mother

865
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,494
Thank you

866
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:32,726
I'm so very sorry

867
01:25:33,395 --> 01:25:35,615
Everything we've done is wrong

868
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:36,551
Hurry!

869
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,250
What about her?

870
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,429
She'll be all right, don't worry

871
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:54,498
Be careful

872
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,890
We've treated you so badly

873
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:58,575
Over here, Nausicaa

874
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:00,964
Hurry

875
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:04,154
Thank you, everyone!

876
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:08,565
Sorry it took so long

877
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:11,909
Can you launch from here?

878
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,187
I'll try

879
01:26:21,443 --> 01:26:22,173
A Korvet!

880
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:27,902
Take cover in the clouds!

881
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:34,300
Stop firing!

882
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:42,384
Idiots! Nothing but wind
and lightning in there

883
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:50,446
It's useless! I've lost control!

884
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:00,568
The ship is breaking apart

885
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,876
We have to leave
the clouds and fight

886
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:11,699
They were expecting us

887
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:21,978
What are they up to?

888
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,967
Forcing us into the clouds
so they can board us

889
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:43,606
Here they come
This is your last chance

890
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:45,254
No, I'll stay with you

891
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:47,287
l can't abandon all those people

892
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:49,112
and the girl who took my place

893
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,635
Only you can save your people

894
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:55,064
Please, go, for our sakes!

895
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:07,772
The ship is ours

896
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:10,005
Take no prisoners
Destroy them

897
01:28:15,357 --> 01:28:16,697
Go, Nausicaa!

898
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:19,289
Asbel!

899
01:29:17,152 --> 01:29:19,052
Princess!

900
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:20,738
Mito!

901
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:37,841
Mito! Lord Yupa!

902
01:29:38,173 --> 01:29:39,043
Princess

903
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:41,853
Hurry, everyone's in...!

904
01:29:42,644 --> 01:29:44,664
I'll engage the hook now

905
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,916
Lord Yupa, that red lever!

906
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:55,561
This is their last stronghold

907
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,932
The door won't hold

908
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:07,001
Any time
Show them some Pejite pride

909
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:10,364
What is that?

910
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:12,376
A bird?

911
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:15,044
A ship, a gun ship from the Valley

912
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:15,930
What!

913
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:26,526
You...

914
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:36,822
It's Lord Yupa, here's
a chance for glory!

915
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,896
Surrender. your Korvet
won't be back

916
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:49,366
This guy's tough

917
01:30:54,349 --> 01:30:57,129
Princess, you're crazy
The engine'll blow

918
01:30:57,986 --> 01:31:00,206
Just make it to the Valley
Speed up!

919
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:05,214
Dear God, God of the Wind

920
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,300
Please protect my people

921
01:31:27,082 --> 01:31:29,482
They won't budge

922
01:31:29,918 --> 01:31:31,438
They're waiting for her return

923
01:31:31,753 --> 01:31:32,452
Return?

924
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:35,894
They believe that girl will
return with their gun ship

925
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:39,611
That gun ship's a pain
It's our chance to attack

926
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:42,972
Do you know what that ship is?

927
01:31:43,398 --> 01:31:45,858
It's from before
the Seven Days of Fire

928
01:31:46,301 --> 01:31:49,171
The one they say
went as far as the stars...

929
01:31:50,205 --> 01:31:52,195
It's too strong for our guns,

930
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:54,214
but bury it in a hole...

931
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,322
I, too, wish to wait

932
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,732
lf she really does return from
deep in the Sea of Decay...

933
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:05,180
I'd like a chance
to really talk to her

934
01:32:08,957 --> 01:32:11,127
Made up your minds?

935
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,190
If you'll aid our attack.
I'll let you go

936
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,129
You want to end up like Pejite?

937
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,970
You're a Princess, too

938
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,029
You're nothing like our Princess

939
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:25,906
Look at my hand

940
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:28,838
That's what King Jihl had

941
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:32,657
In 6 more months
it will be stone

942
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,294
But our Princess said,

943
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:38,343
she liked these hands

944
01:32:39,421 --> 01:32:42,671
They were the beautiful hands
of a hard worker

945
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,498
You want to live
with the Sea of Decay

946
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,849
even as its toxins ravage you?

947
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:53,299
You use fire
We use it a bit, too

948
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:56,657
Too much fire
and nothing will grow

949
01:32:57,305 --> 01:32:59,935
Fire can turn the forest
into ashes in a single day

950
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,795
Water and wind sustain
a forest for 100 years

951
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:06,775
We like the water and the wind

952
01:33:07,215 --> 01:33:10,695
The sight of our forest
will grieve the Princess

953
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,174
Counselor, we await your orders

954
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,380
Shut up

955
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:17,441
Yes sir

956
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:24,670
Who knows what happened,
but she sure looks cute

957
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:27,773
Let them go, Kurotowa!

958
01:33:28,503 --> 01:33:30,313
Huh? You want to wait?

959
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:32,375
Feed the soldiers

960
01:33:32,674 --> 01:33:34,724
We attack in 1 hour

961
01:33:37,312 --> 01:33:40,622
Food, huh?
Finally, a real meal

962
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:42,869
Someone's coming!

963
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:45,946
It's Gol and the others

964
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,871
What is it?

965
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:53,323
There's no wind

966
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:55,322
No wind?

967
01:33:57,198 --> 01:33:59,188
You're right, the wind's stopped

968
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:02,042
Obaba, what is it?

969
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,323
Obaba

970
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:07,931
Someone...
Someone take me outside...

971
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:16,786
The wind's never stopped before

972
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:34,116
Obaba, my ears hurt

973
01:34:34,736 --> 01:34:38,456
The air...
The very air is thick with rage

974
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:55,325
We're close!

975
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:58,303
We're clear of the Sea of Decay!
3 minutes to Acid Lake!

976
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:01,343
Idle the engines
Drop beneath the clouds

977
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:12,445
What's this glow!

978
01:35:14,676 --> 01:35:15,546
Ohms!

979
01:35:33,761 --> 01:35:36,781
The Sea of Decay is spreading
They're headed for the Valley

980
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,052
How did they stampede the Ohms...

981
01:35:46,274 --> 01:35:47,974
Someone's baiting them

982
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:50,833
Mito! Turn towards Sirius

983
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:52,792
Yes!

984
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:20,911
It's there

985
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:22,402
Mito, a flare!

986
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:24,654
Ready

987
01:36:26,014 --> 01:36:26,884
Fire!

988
01:36:32,587 --> 01:36:33,457
What is that?

989
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:47,163
How cruel...

990
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:49,898
They're baiting them
with a baby

991
01:36:50,338 --> 01:36:51,827
I'll shoot 'em down!

992
01:36:52,407 --> 01:36:53,427
No, Mito!

993
01:36:55,276 --> 01:36:57,446
Don't shoot!

994
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:04,183
Why not! Why shouldn't 1?

995
01:37:04,519 --> 01:37:06,769
Kill the baby,
and the stampede will never end!

996
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:10,328
What can we do!
They'll destroy the Valley

997
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:12,119
Calm down, Mito

998
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,670
Return the baby to them
Let's try

999
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:24,233
What are you doing, Princess!

1000
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:26,382
You go ahead and warn them

1001
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:28,795
Princess!

1002
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,032
You're not even armed

1003
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,380
That's not one of our flares

1004
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:45,212
How far?

1005
01:37:45,393 --> 01:37:47,763
20 leagues
The other side of the lake

1006
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:49,925
Is it a gun ship?

1007
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,368
Probably

1008
01:37:59,273 --> 01:38:00,763
That's a distress signal

1009
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:02,885
It's definitely the gun ship

1010
01:38:03,311 --> 01:38:05,040
It's been an hour, let's go

1011
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:06,430
Why not wait?

1012
01:38:06,681 --> 01:38:08,431
The bloodshed is inevitable

1013
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:17,425
Infantry advance

1014
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:23,703
Your Highness, get inside

1015
01:38:23,965 --> 01:38:24,985
I'm fine hare

1016
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,866
The gun ship!

1017
01:38:36,778 --> 01:38:38,118
Fire!

1018
01:38:47,822 --> 01:38:48,692
Hold your fire!

1019
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,652
Stop it! Stop!

1020
01:38:54,896 --> 01:38:55,656
Princess!

1021
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:58,664
Stand-by
Don't fire

1022
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,620
Your Highness

1023
01:39:04,672 --> 01:39:05,491
Where's the girl!

1024
01:39:05,706 --> 01:39:06,636
The Princess!

1025
01:39:06,874 --> 01:39:08,273
She's not here

1026
01:39:08,576 --> 01:39:10,596
The Ohm, a stampede
It's coming this way

1027
01:39:10,978 --> 01:39:11,938
What!

1028
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:12,790
The Ohm!

1029
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:16,138
The Princess stayed behind
to stop them

1030
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,761
This is no time for battle

1031
01:39:19,587 --> 01:39:22,427
Everyone run, find the
highest place you can! Now!

1032
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:28,519
Obaba, ! sea a red glow

1033
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,232
It's spreading

1034
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:34,763
It's coming this way

1035
01:39:35,036 --> 01:39:38,166
You hold on tight

1036
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:41,986
There's no stopping them now

1037
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:44,567
Don't panic

1038
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:47,667
There's still time

1039
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:52,079
lf [have to die,
l want to die in the Valley

1040
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:55,933
No, you mustn't give up,
not while the Princess has faith

1041
01:39:56,958 --> 01:39:59,098
Listen, hold them off
as long as you can

1042
01:39:59,494 --> 01:40:00,723
I'll return soon

1043
01:40:01,262 --> 01:40:02,902
Your Highness, not that...

1044
01:40:03,231 --> 01:40:03,991
It's not ready yet!

1045
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:06,862
If not now, when!

1046
01:40:07,235 --> 01:40:08,344
Go!

1047
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:15,554
Don't shoot! Listen to me!

1048
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,494
Damn! She flies like a bird

1049
01:40:31,826 --> 01:40:34,636
She's not an enemy
She wants to say something

1050
01:40:35,129 --> 01:40:37,239
Anyone who interferes is an enemy

1051
01:40:37,932 --> 01:40:41,092
We'd better drop the bait in
the Valley soon, or die ourselves

1052
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:47,228
Here she comes!
Let her come in close, then fire

1053
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:01,908
Now! Fire!

1054
01:41:02,156 --> 01:41:02,796
No!

1055
01:41:03,758 --> 01:41:04,628
That's Lastel!

1056
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:05,379
Move!

1057
01:41:53,074 --> 01:41:54,244
Ohm...

1058
01:42:21,535 --> 01:42:23,934
Don't be angry
Don't be frightened

1059
01:42:24,372 --> 01:42:25,682
I'm not your foe

1060
01:42:28,409 --> 01:42:29,579
I'm sorry

1061
01:42:30,211 --> 01:42:33,051
I'm sorry
I can't ask your forgiveness

1062
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:36,148
It's too cruel

1063
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,670
Don't move!
You'll bleed to death

1064
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,640
Be good, little one, keep still

1065
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:02,876
They've found us

1066
01:43:03,144 --> 01:43:04,434
They're coming

1067
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:08,624
Stop! Not with those wounds!

1068
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:10,929
The lake is poison...

1069
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,420
You...

1070
01:44:15,516 --> 01:44:16,885
Good baby

1071
01:44:17,184 --> 01:44:20,844
I'm fine
They're coming for you

1072
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:29,608
They're turning away

1073
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:34,438
Ohm! Don't!
The Valley's that way

1074
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:40,581
They've forgotten us in their rage

1075
01:44:40,975 --> 01:44:42,615
If 1 don't calm them, the Valley...

1076
01:44:56,791 --> 01:44:59,311
Fools! Drawing them
with their own fire

1077
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:00,660
We're safe

1078
01:45:00,895 --> 01:45:03,065
We'd better get away
Check the engine

1079
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:05,865
No, no!

1080
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:09,108
We can discuss this

1081
01:45:09,436 --> 01:45:10,986
Take us to them

1082
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:12,855
I must give them the baby

1083
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,391
What's the point, it's too late

1084
01:45:15,743 --> 01:45:17,323
They'll never stop

1085
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:22,760
Drop us in front of them, then

1086
01:45:23,217 --> 01:45:23,977
Take us

1087
01:45:24,852 --> 01:45:26,372
But you'll die, too

1088
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:37,519
Obaba, will we all die?

1089
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:41,686
If that's our fate.
we must accept it

1090
01:45:42,436 --> 01:45:43,896
They don't even waver

1091
01:45:44,205 --> 01:45:44,725
Let's retreat

1092
01:45:44,905 --> 01:45:47,715
Idiot! There's nowhere to go

1093
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,490
Don't retreat!

1094
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:57,056
Hold your ground
for Her Highness

1095
01:45:57,718 --> 01:45:58,538
Highness...

1096
01:45:58,752 --> 01:45:59,862
Your Highness!

1097
01:46:30,184 --> 01:46:32,324
Get them!

1098
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,420
The Giant Warrior...
Giant Warrior

1099
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:49,237
It's rotting
It's too soon

1100
01:46:57,444 --> 01:46:58,734
Burn them!

1101
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:00,660
What's wrong

1102
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:04,045
Are you not descended from
Earth's most evil tribe!

1103
01:47:20,567 --> 01:47:23,817
Incredible...
No wonder the world caught fire

1104
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:26,541
Your Highness Kushana, hurray!

1105
01:47:38,519 --> 01:47:39,829
Destroy them!

1106
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:42,853
What's wrong with you?
Hurry up and fire!

1107
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:17,843
We're done for

1108
01:48:21,762 --> 01:48:23,432
The Giant Warrior is dead

1109
01:48:23,764 --> 01:48:25,664
It's for the best

1110
01:48:26,033 --> 01:48:28,693
The Ohm's rage is
the fury of the Earth itself

1111
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:33,580
There's no reason to live
if our lives depend on a monster

1112
01:48:37,911 --> 01:48:38,611
Princess!

1113
01:48:38,812 --> 01:48:40,072
The Princess!

1114
01:48:50,224 --> 01:48:51,714
Not there

1115
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:52,606
It's madness

1116
01:48:52,793 --> 01:48:53,402
Princess!

1117
01:50:04,865 --> 01:50:07,355
The Ohms are changing color

1118
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:31,683
Their rage has vanished

1119
01:50:33,494 --> 01:50:35,664
They stopped
The Ohms stopped

1120
01:50:53,814 --> 01:50:55,104
Princess!

1121
01:51:03,023 --> 01:51:05,453
The Princess is dead

1122
01:51:06,593 --> 01:51:10,572
She calmed them
with her own life

1123
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:14,041
She saved our Valley

1124
01:52:14,428 --> 01:52:15,388
Look...

1125
01:52:21,134 --> 01:52:23,184
What is that light?

1126
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:51,080
Teto...

1127
01:53:07,147 --> 01:53:08,227

1128
01:53:09,216 --> 01:53:10,996
Thank you, Ohm

1129
01:53:11,818 --> 01:53:13,108
Thank you

1130
01:53:32,272 --> 01:53:34,022
It's a miracle
A miracle

1131
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:39,105
Such friendship and sympathy

1132
01:53:39,713 --> 01:53:42,523
The Ohms have opened their hearts

1133
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:46,157
Children, watch well and tell me

1134
01:53:46,653 --> 01:53:48,673
what I cannot see

1135
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:51,896
The Princess is wearing
strange blue clothes

1136
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,540
It's like she's walking
through golden fields

1137
01:54:06,006 --> 01:54:08,846
“...clothed in blue robes,

1138
01:54:09,343 --> 01:54:12,383
“descending onto a golden field...”

1139
01:54:14,748 --> 01:54:16,178
Obaba...

1140
01:54:16,483 --> 01:54:19,643
The ancient legend was true

1141
01:54:21,121 --> 01:54:22,461
Look!

1142
01:54:23,824 --> 01:54:24,994
The glider

1143
01:54:25,392 --> 01:54:27,642
