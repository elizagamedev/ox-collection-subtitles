1
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,016
Did you see it? I think I got it,

2
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,988
That little piggy was fast,

3
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:05,504
Hey, everybody, this is all of our kill,
We all take credit,

4
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,970
-I got a side ache,
-You hit Enmebaragesi,

5
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,753
I'm pretty sure he had that
when he left the village,

6
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,154
That's not my spear,

7
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,295
What're you talking about,my spear has
feathers...,Okay, that one's got a feather,

8
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,045
Okay, that is my spear,
I'm sorry, man,

9
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,929
Great, Two spears,
Twice the killing power,

10
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,849
Thanks a lot,
Next time don't block my shot,

11
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,717
What? I didn't say--
Come on, not my fault,

12
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,123
Who stands in front of a boar
ona hunt?

13
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:37,994
Come on, gay

14
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,032
Hey, there you are,

15
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,953
I don't think you wanna be gathered,
You wanna be eaten,

16
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,012
Hi, Marlak,

17
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,897
Well, there won't be any berries
in the fruit salad now, so we all lose,

18
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:01,941
Hey, Oh, How's it going?

19
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,062
Hunters think they're so cool,
You know, they--

20
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,043
They don't think this is challenging?
Gathering? It's extremely challenging,

21
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,124
You have to find all the fruit with
the least amount of bird shit on it...

22
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,085
..and put it in the basket,

23
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,193
What's it,they're picking on you?

24
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,665
If they're picking on you,
I will straighten them out,

25
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,784
-All right, Yeah, would you?
-You're right,

26
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,127
Let it slide this time,

27
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,930
Next time, though, they will feel the tip
of my short spear,

28
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,698
-What happened to your spear?
-l modified it, Made it a snub nose,

29
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,749
It's lighter, It's a better killing tool,
Anyway...,

30
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,626
Oh, there's Maya,
I'm gonna go talk to her,

31
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,610
I'll be right back,
Unless something goes horribly right,

32
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,779
-Hello, Maya,
-Hey, Zed,

33
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,382
What do I gotta do
to make you my woman?

34
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:53,538
Look, you're a special guy,
You've got a lot of personality,

35
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,108
When my parents
were killed by that pack of wild dogs...

36
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,891
..you really helped me
see the funny side,

37
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,225
"No, no! He's got my ankle!"

38
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,862
"Get off," That's your mom,

39
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:13,005
So, yeah, you make me laugh,
but that's not enough,

40
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,287
I'm an old-fashioned kind of girl,

41
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,992
I need a man who can protect me
and take care of me,

42
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,998
What do you mean?
Like Marlak?

43
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,659
Well, l mean, he is the best hunter
in the village,

44
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,940
-Debatable,
-People voted,

45
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,005
Ok,maybe I'm not the greatest hunter,

46
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,102
-Or gatherer,
-Yes, Or gatherer,

47
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,273
Zed, those are the only two jobs
that we have here,

48
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,986
I can take care of you,
Does it look like I'm starving?

49
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,772
Come on,
Tell me you can say no to this,

50
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,733
Give it a second, Let it work on you,

51
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,835
Oh, yeah,
Absolutely can say no to that,

52
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:49,272
Maya, Can I see you later?

53
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,994
I think I have to wash my hair,

54
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,991
You washed your hair last year,

55
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,806
Tonight, we feast,

56
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,865
Maya, For you,

57
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,442
Thanks, Marlak,
Another severed boar's head,

58
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,928
-It's a different color,
-Yeah, this one is--

59
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,270
-Left the tongue in,
-Yeah, this is really nice, Marlak,

60
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,894
Look at Marlak flirting with Maya,
He doesn't know her at all,

61
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,491
Head's not even the best part
of the boar,

62
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,827
It's the back fat, stupid,
Muscleheaded idiot,

63
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,398
Hi, Eema, Hi, Eema, Hi, Eema,

64
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,921
Yeah, She doesn't even know I exist,

65
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,797
There's like 60 people
in the village, I mean...

66
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,866
.. you have to go out of your way
to not know that somebody exists,

67
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,971
Hey, hey-- Squanto,
Give me a break, would you?

68
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,661
You got the whole forest,

69
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,143
Why does everybody always have
to take a crap right behind my hut?

70
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,869
I could be wrong, I think what it is
is that all the poop in the area...

71
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,931
..fertilizes the ground and it gives
the leaves a softer feel for wiping,

72
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:10,369
It's not that nobody respects you,
I haven't heard that from everyone,

73
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,890
I haven't heard that,let's go

74
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,498
Where are we going?
We're not supposed to go this far,

75
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,821
I'm sick of the whole village
treating me like a joke,

76
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,521
-You know what I'm gonna do?
-Change villages,

77
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,087
No, I'm gonna change my head,

78
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,319
I don't think that's possible,
Your head is attached to your body,

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,250
Not the whole head,
I mean, my mind,

80
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,220
Mind--

81
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,761
Don't tell me you're thinking
about eating forbidden fruit,

82
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,657
That's exactly what I'm thinking,

83
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,674
Zed, that's the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil,

84
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,350
You don't eat from that one,
It's forbidden,

85
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,829
But why is it forbidden?

86
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,920
What is it they don't want us
to have?

87
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,789
It's not the fruit, It's about the rule,
It's about doing what you're told,

88
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,669
We've been doing what we were told
our entire lives,

89
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,809
-How's that worked out?
- like doing what I'm told,

90
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,092
It gives my day
some much-needed structure, Wait,

91
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,351
Zed, Stop,
It's just a piece of fruit,

92
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,842
Eating a fruit
is not gonna change your life,

93
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,177
But what if it's magic fruit?

94
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,943
What if this makes me the smartest
man the village has ever known?

95
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,824
That's a pretty low bar,

96
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,869
Then all the hunters
would have to bow down to me,

97
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,299
Maya would lay with me like that,

98
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,640
That's what this is about?
Laying with Maya?

99
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,458
I tell you, have a great destiny,
I'm about to find out what it is,

100
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,217
Can you put the fruit down,
What if somebody sees us?

101
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,373
They'll peel our skin off
and tie us to an anthill,

102
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,008
Now you've done it,

103
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,929
It's got sort of a knowledge-y taste,

104
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,421
Does it have a sort of forbidden taste?
That's what it is,

105
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,707
-Oh, I definitely feel something,
-What?

106
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,667
Less hungry, for one,
but also more intelligenter,

107
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,072
It's like
I feel like maybe I know everything,

108
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,973
Ask me something, Anything, Go,
Test me, Go,

109
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,313
All right, where does the sun go
at night?

110
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,257
Pass, Next question,

111
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,578
-Okay, where do babies come from?
-Pass, Next question,

112
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,523
-There's a snake on my foot,
-In the form of a question,

113
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,282
There's a snake on my foot?

114
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,321
-Correct,
-What do I do?

115
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,892
I got a lot of ideas, I'm bursting
with ideas on the subject,

116
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,329
-It's constricting me,
-You could stick your finger in its hole,

117
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,169
You know what, you could eat it
before it eats you, Try that,

118
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,719
Eat the snake first,
That's what my new brain tells me,

119
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,909
-It's preparing to eat me,
-Go for the eyes,

120
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,122
It's big,

121
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,253
Zed, please help me,

122
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,380
I'm dying a virgin,

123
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,221
Wait right here,
I'm gonna go eat more fruit,

124
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,752
-This was a bit of a rough day for me,
-Yeah, There's gotta be more to life,

125
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:57,031
This is a lot, I don't think I can handle
too much more than this,

126
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,220
No way, Look at these people,

127
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,409
They're like animals,
We're way too good for this,

128
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,780
Now that I'm smarter
I'm going straight to the top,

129
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm bringing you,
You're gonna be my right hand,

130
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,221
I've seen what you do
with your right hand, No,thank you

131
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,099
Don't you wonder what's on
the other side of the mountains?

132
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,069
There's nothing on the other side
of the mountains, okay?

133
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,619
The world ends, Everybody
knows that, You'd fall right off of it,

134
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,527
But what if it doesn't?

135
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,048
It makes my stomach go:

136
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,499
I've been thinking a lot
ever since I ate that fruit,

137
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,430
Why is there fruit? What is fruit?

138
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,080
It's a thing that you eat,
Why do we eat?

139
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,843
What are we? What are we?
Why do I have these?

140
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,140
Everything is weird,

141
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,812
When you really stop and look at it,
everything gets very, very strange--

142
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,309
Why am I talking? What is this?

143
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,801
My lips make a movement
and then a sound...

144
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,083
..and you know what I mean,

145
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,059
Blows my mind,

146
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,871
That just sounds like crazy fruit talk,
I don't wanna hear it right now,

147
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,312
Boy, she looks nice tonight,

148
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:02,401
Do it, man, Dance for her,

149
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,470
I don't know,
They're doing the jackal dance,

150
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,111
It's not my strongest,

151
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,641
What, are you kidding me?
You have an amazing jackal dance,

152
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,222
Go, Jackal dance,

153
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,259
Get into it,

154
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,271
Over the head,

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,959
I'm gonna go and eat,
I'm gonna come back,

156
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:10,752
Your father was a great hunter,
But you, you're like a little girl,

157
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,209
Good one, Marlak,

158
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,172
Enmebaragesi says
he saw you in the garden,

159
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,787
Really? Well, what if I told you
that Enmebaragesi was a liar?

160
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,182
I saw him eat the forbidden fruit,

161
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,247
Oh, that,

162
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,102
-Hey, what's going on here?
-[ will kill you where you stand,

163
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,108
Oh, a shooting star, That's the best,

164
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,980
-You really ate the fruit?
-One bite, What's the big deal?

165
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,940
You don't eat the fruit,

166
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,481
It's the number one rule
since the beginning of time,

167
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,521
Since the Great Turtle climbed out
of the sea with Earth on its back,

168
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,930
I know, but I'm a little fuzzy
on the exact details,

169
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,492
Forbidden, Forbidden fruit,

170
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:10,895
You ate-- You did the one thing
you're not supposed to do, Forbidden,

171
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:15,001
But the word "forbidden" implies
there's a little wiggle room,

172
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,721
There's no wiggle room
with forbidden, You're cursed, man,

173
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,909
If you stay here, we'll all be cursed,
You have to leave,

174
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,283
-Where am I supposed to go?
-I didn't eat the fruit,

175
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,773
My hands are tied,

176
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,350
I know I'm being a dick right now, man,
but I'm just trying to help you,

177
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,631
Do I detect a little bit of jealousy
because I now have...

178
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,920
..the knowledge of good and evil
and you don't?

179
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:39,716
You think it's easy being the shaman
of the village?

180
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,486
You think I like putting on
a boar's head every morning?

181
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,223
Putting a bone through my face?

182
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,742
I know we've known each other for
a long time, We throw the rock around,

183
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,959
We have fun together, man,
but I can't be...,

184
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,130
You know what I mean?

185
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,848
Plus, wanna know something?
lam high as shit right now, dude,

186
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,492
I just licked like three toads,

187
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,972
I've been up for like 27 suns up
and suns downs,

188
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,132
-Okay,
-I just wanna get a meal...

189
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,970
-... wanna take a fucking nap,
This is bullshit,

190
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,823
You really..., You fucked the pooch
on this one,

191
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,820
-Hard,
-I say what I did...

192
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,560
-..,Was a good thing,
-Oh, yeah?

193
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,521
Yeah, Really, really very good thing,

194
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,024
And I should know because I have
the knowledge of good and evil,

195
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,501
-Oh, okay,
-So I ought to know...

196
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,811
.. when I know what I'm saying
is what I know what I'm saying,

197
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,179
-Good,
-And I'm not leaving,

198
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,049
You better get out of here,

199
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,190
Okay, but before I go,
I just wanna say one thing,

200
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,039
I know I'm not the greatest hunter,

201
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,852
-Or gatherer,
-Or gatherer, Thank you,

202
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,109
But there's gotta be more to life
than this,

203
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,948
I'm going, but because I choose to,

204
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,080
And anyone who wants to join me
is welcome,

205
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,190
I don't know where we're going,
but I will lead us,

206
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,881
Yeah, light up the darkness,

207
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,091
So who's with me?

208
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,332
Anyone?

209
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,101
Anyone named Oh?

210
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,112
Okay, Looks like
I'm gonna be going it alone,

211
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,189
Which is fine with me,

212
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,680
Better, in fact...

213
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,252
.. because having a partner
would just probably slow me down,

214
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,931
I'm gonna start a new tribe,
10 times better,

215
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,170
There's gonna be 10 times
more dancing and fun,

216
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:31,739
It's gonna be called Muscle Tribe
of Danger and Excellence,

217
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,048
And you're not invited, I don't even like
any of you guys, I never did,

218
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,819
Unless anyone changes their mind,
Does anyone wanna come better?

219
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,461
-We're good,
-Fine, Good, Bye-bye,

220
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,031
Don't-- Nobody panic,

221
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,820
No! That's-- That's--
Oh, it's not my house,

222
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,231
I see you,

223
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,292
Go away, Marlak,

224
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,022
-Really, animal noises?
-Badger,

225
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,051
This is just insulting,
It's time I killed you,

226
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,934
Fine, But then, tell me this:
Who's that behind you?

227
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,410
You think I'm gonna turn around?
I'm gonna gut you like a pig,

228
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,330
Nice whack on the head,
You should try hitting Eema that hard,

229
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,921
We can discuss that later,
We should run away,

230
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,880
Yes, yes, of course,

231
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,507
So you decided to come after all,
Was it the speech?

232
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,878
-It was the fire, I lost everything,
-Yeah,

233
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,108
I wish we didn't have to leave,

234
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,479
Probably never gonna see
Eema again,

235
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,031
That's not true, We'll go back,

236
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,391
Those hunters are idiots,

237
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,100
They're gonna forget the whole thing
in an hour,

238
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,792
Will you get real, man?
There's no going back, okay?

239
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,218
There's nothing to go back to,
It's just ashes,

240
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,021
Like it's hard to build
one of those huts,

241
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,940
It's just a pile of sticks and dung,

242
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,228
Well, you're a pile of sticks
and dung,

243
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,300
-I'm sorry, I--
-It's okay,

244
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,201
-I don't mean that, obviously,
-l know you're mad...

245
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,557
...but this is a great
opportunity for us,

246
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,090
They didn't appreciate you
back there,

247
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,098
You're the genius who thought up
drinking water from a gourd,

248
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,791
They were all drinking from their
hands,

249
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,648
Well, it just seems practical,
I mean, I don't know,

250
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,180
We have an incredible destiny,

251
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,137
You don't even know where we are,
We're lost,

252
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,300
Of course I know where we are,

253
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,920
It's a cougar,
Don't move a muscle,

254
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,200
-What do we do?
-Don't move your lips,

255
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,962
Rule number one: Show no fear,

256
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,089
You're showing fear,

257
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,939
Much better, Very good,

258
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,022
-Now what?
-There's two opinions on this one,

259
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,958
Some say run,
others say stay perfectly still,

260
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,209
-Which one are you gonna do?
-I'm going to run!

261
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,733
You should put some maggots
on those scratches,

262
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,319
They look pretty deep,

263
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,860
They are very deep,
That's why they appear that way,

264
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,420
-You're still mad at me, aren't you?
-l wish hadn't come,

265
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,651
Maybe you shouldn't have come...

266
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,882
..if you're gonna keep whining
about every little cougar...

267
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,468
..that attacks you,

268
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,922
Oh, what does this look like?

269
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,331
You making your own fire?

270
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,992
No, I'm making arrows,
We're gonna need them,

271
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,362
-You still coming?
-Yeah,

272
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,972
Yeah!

273
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,163
Yeah, You're my buddy, Yeah,

274
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,747
You're saying we're gonna walk...

275
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:43,406
..and eventually we're gonna get
to a spot where the world ends...

276
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,908
and it's like..., What is it?
What are we looking at?

277
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,575
First of all, why are you talking to me
in that tone like I'm an idiot?

278
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,976
This is general knowledge,

279
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,127
-I knew it!
This is incredible,

280
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,860
You still think the world just ends?

281
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,793
Come on, admit it, The fruit man
has the knowledge,

282
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,091
Whoa, whoa, be careful,

283
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,598
Did you learn a lot when you ate
the fruit?

284
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,674
Yeah, I can see, like, 10 minutes
into the future now,

285
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,966
-So what am I doing in ten minutes?
-You're having sex with a zebra,

286
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,070
-That's not funny,
-I'm not joking,

287
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,142
Hope you're ready to bone some zeeb,

288
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,989
People, More than one,

289
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,332
Walking that way,

290
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,369
You think? There's about
a thousand footprints there,

291
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,669
-[ mean, it's kind of obvious,
-Oh, yes,

292
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,749
-They stopped here to poop, Look,
-No, I don't want to,

293
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,798
Two men, maybe three, A child,
Or a small woman, maybe,

294
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,153
What are you doing?
You don't know where that's been,

295
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,628
-l know where it's been,
-Don't touch it,

296
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,961
You don't know if a squirrel
has peed on it someting

297
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,259
Still warm,
Almost hot in the center,

298
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,872
Looks like they had some nuts,
Apples, maybe,

299
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,183
What are you doing?

300
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,911
-Yep, apples,
-What difference does it make?

301
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,071
That doesn't help us to know that,

302
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,871
You can tell if they ate some shit,
There's a lot of shit in that shit,

303
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,282
My mistake, this is bear poop,

304
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,562
What's that, though?

305
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,277
This one's mine,

306
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,142
Tonight, we feast,

307
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,772
We're gonna need
some arrowheads,

308
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,791
This is where you die!

309
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,100
Easy, easy,

310
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,172
He won't get far,

311
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,912
-Did you shoot my cow?
-Oh, no,

312
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,879
Yes, Well, we're hunters,

313
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,743
Well, he's a hunter, I'm a maker,

314
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,668
-A maker?
-[ made this loincloth, l make arrows,

315
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,460
I've made a shelf unit for my hut,

316
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,882
I welcome us to you,

317
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,807
-What do you do?
-What does it look like?

318
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,370
-We're farmers,
-Well, he's a farmer, I'm a herdsman,

319
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,433
You're a suck is what you are,

320
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,594
-My brother Cain, I'm called Abel,
-You are called "suck,"

321
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,638
There you go with that "suck,"
What does that mean?

322
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,502
Suck, short for "suckle,"
Short for "suckle up,"

323
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,872
You're suckling up to God,
You're a suckle-up,

324
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,016
Somebody's upset because God
looked on my sacrifice with favor,

325
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,960
"God looked upon my sacrifice
with favor," 1 mean--

326
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,720
-Is he a total suck or what?
-Hard to say, We just met,

327
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,359
Why are you bringing these guys
init?

328
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,221
-They live ina tree,
-Oh, see?

329
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,859
I mean, come on, You just gotta be
so superior to everyone else,

330
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,500
No, but superior to-- Than you,

331
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,489
Superior-- Let's see how superior
you are when I kick your ass,

332
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,729
-Oh, yeah?
-You want some of that?

333
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,498
-Yes, do,
-Guys,

334
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,719
-I'm right here, I'm right here,
-No, come on,

335
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,908
No, This smug asshole insulted you,
and I want him to take it back,

336
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,250
-We're not that insulted,
-Why don't you make me?

337
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,151
No, no, Boys, boys,
You are brothers, Let's just relax...

338
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,479
..and let's all just get
some perspective

339
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,969
Yeah, Yeah, That's how we do it,
That's how we do it, That's--

340
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,319
-There are rules that we abide by,
-Yeah, right,

341
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,231
-Should we do something?
-Just let them settle it,

342
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,091
I tripped,

343
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,212
Well, I guess that settles it,

344
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,058
-What?
-Nothing,

345
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,943
It's-- He's all right,
He's just-- He's resting,

346
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,932
Well, he's tuckered out
from the fight,

347
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,099
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
He's-- You know what?

348
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,817
Let's cover him up with a little dirt
and some straw...

349
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,250
..to keep him warm
until he wakes up and...,

350
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,349
Hey, Abel, what are you doing
with my foot? Playing possum?

351
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,827
Hey, Oh, hey, stop it,
He's choking me,

352
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:23,019
Stop it, Abel, Are you trying
to choke me to death, Abel?

353
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,929
"Yes, Cain, lam,"
Come on, stop it!

354
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,818
Self-defense, Clearly, Self-defense,

355
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,288
What have I done?
What have I done?

356
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,101
What have I done again?
What have I done some more?

357
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,219
What have I continued to do?

358
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,952
Oh, guys,
Guys, we're in some real trouble here,

359
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,952
What do you mean, "we''?

360
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,420
I don't wanna play the blame game
but you hit him,

361
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,050
No, no, no, There's two of you
and there's one of me,

362
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:13,418
-You could have stopped me,
-Didn't know you were gonna kill him,

363
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,579
-Are you calling me a murderer?
-Did I say that?

364
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,799
It was an accident, Right?

365
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,168
Yeah, you were holding a rock...

366
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,801
..and he ran into it
with his face repeatedly...

367
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,899
..until he just couldn't pull through,

368
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,500
-It was horseplay,
-It was horseplay,

369
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,231
It was two horses playing,

370
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:34,087
One murders the other one...,

371
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,108
Yeah, It's probably best if we
didn't mention this accident to anyone,

372
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,448
Because, you know,
people don't understand, and--

373
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,449
Who am I gonna tell?

374
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,200
I can't think of one
who'd be interested,

375
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,948
I'd only tell him
and he's a witness as well,

376
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,389
-Why even bring it up?
-Okay,

377
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,000
-It's like he killed himself,
-Cry for help, if anything,

378
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,300
All right, Good,

379
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,996
I like you guys, I do,
I like you guys a lot, I do,

380
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,178
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

381
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,910
-We already have dinner plans,
-Damn,

382
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:11,224
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

383
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,417
We'll come over to your place
for supper,

384
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,166
I mean, how many times
do we see you?

385
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,655
-Just don't kill me,
-No horseplay,

386
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,078
-What?
-Nothing,

387
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,968
What are these big,
round things for?

388
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,494
They're wheels, numbskull,
They make the cart roll,

389
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,449
feel like a bird,

390
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,150
Bring it forth,

391
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,190
Hello,

392
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,367
I'm gonna yak,

393
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,371
Hey, What's wrong with you?

394
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,336
-Let me get your hair,
-That was too fast,

395
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,418
Cain, I ask you again,
where is thy brother Abel?

396
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,252
I don't know,
I haven't really seen him at all,

397
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,529
Have you-- You guys...,
You guys haven't seen him, have you?

398
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,070
-Don't know who that is,
-I don't-- Never--

399
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,989
-Don't know who you're talking about,
-What's his name?

400
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:49,282
-Sure he's out there somewhere...
-l haven't seen anybody anywhere,

401
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,185
Never had the pleasure,
Sure he's in the prime of his life,

402
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,159
This is good soup, Really good,

403
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,882
Lilith said she saw you
in the field with him,

404
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,261
Oh, man, this bread is good,

405
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:06,367
Oh, really? That-- Oh, yeah,
No, that was yesterday, right,

406
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,432
No, this day,
She said you both made offerings,

407
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,122
-Oh, that was Boaz, Yeah,
-No,

408
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,741
-Japheth, It was Japheth,
-No,

409
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,333
-Enoch,
-No,

410
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,147
-I'm sure it was Gilgamesh,
-No,

411
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,049
-Ishmael,
-No,

412
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,238
-Ezidia?
-No,

413
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,369
-Jennifer?
-No,

414
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,970
Now I'm remembering correctly,
It was Tishbaven,

415
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,243
It was you, She said
it looked like you were arguing,

416
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:31,648
Yeah, well, let's be honest,
Lilith is a lying bitch,

417
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,107
Look, I mean, we're brothers,
We're gonna argue, it's human nature,

418
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,711
-Show me the perfect family,
-His flock goes untended in the field,

419
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,201
Okay, look, Enough,
Am I his keeper?

420
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,157
I mean, just get off my back, Father,

421
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:48,786
I wish you were dead too,
Even though Abel's not dead at all,

422
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:52,868
I fear the worst for Abel,
I'm sorely vexed,

423
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,103
You're welcome to spend this night
with us,

424
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,171
You may lay with my daughter Lilith,

425
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,120
She is without a husband...

426
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,930
..and as the Lord said,
"Be fruitful and multiply,"

427
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:06,434
What about me?

428
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,519
You may share the bed
of my son Seth,

429
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,040
-Thanks, Papa,
-Yeah, there you go,

430
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,428
Your brother Seth
is an interesting guy,

431
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,368
Did you know he can put
his own penis in his mouth?

432
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,306
I did not know that,

433
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,379
Whole thing, Right in there,

434
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,194
It's been a great sleepover...

435
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:29,051
..and thank you
for the gruel and the garb,

436
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:30,568
Cain,

437
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,262
-Where's everybody going?
-To look for thy brother Abel,

438
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,429
-Good luck,
-What?

439
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,374
I said, good luck, Father,
I'm really worried about him,

440
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,384
You're not coming?

441
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,246
I'm just gonna stay here
and finish toiling...

442
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,115
-..and then we'll be right behind you,
-Good,

443
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:53,206
Hey, I'm heading to the coast,
You guys should come with me,

444
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,322
They're gonna try to blame this
whole Abel-killing business on you,

445
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,168
-Why blame it on us?
-When they find him...

446
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:03,198
..and see his head, they're gonna
start pointing fingers, You're drifters,

447
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:04,929
They're gonna put two
and two together,

448
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,110
Now stop asking so many questions
and let's go, Go, go, go,

449
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,299
Cain, After him,

450
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:30,196
-They're gaining on us,
-They're getting away,

451
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:34,096
-Eat my dust, Father,
-This is really too fast,

452
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,270
-Oh, no, no,
-Hold tight, Hold tight,

453
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,376
Cain! My justice will be swift,

454
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:46,078
No, No! Damn you, Cain,

455
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,457
Who's in God's favor now, Father?

456
00:29:55,761 --> 00:30:00,011
What are the odds of that?
Hey, am I lucky or what?

457
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:01,552
Your head's smoking,

458
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,441
Hey, it didn't leave a mark, did it?

459
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:08,343
Just a pink, red hole,

460
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:12,113
-Your bangs are gonna cover it,
-All right, Whatever,

461
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,497
This is the biggest place
I've ever seen,

462
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,237
It's called a town, Just act normal,

463
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,330
-Hi,
-Hello, Greetings, seafarer,

464
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,332
-That's not normal,
-Hello,

465
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,495
Would you stop saying
hi to everybody? It's annoying,

466
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,244
All right, this is a market,
Over there is a Build-A-Bear,

467
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:36,924
That's a really good container store,
Oh, this place has killer hemp,

468
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,043
-Yes, please,
-Next up is an unusual item,

469
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,139
-He's big, He's strong,
-It's Marlak,

470
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,299
Oh, do not worry, He is not fighting,
he is having fun,

471
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,178
Okay, maybe he's
little bit depressed,

472
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,518
Maya and Eema,

473
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,275
-Zed,
-Eema,

474
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,491
-Hi,
-Hi, Hi, Gosh,

475
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,310
What happened?
How did you get here?

476
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,289
After the fire that you started,
the hill tribes raided the village,

477
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:11,726
They held us captive...

478
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,102
..and traded us to the boat people,
who brought us here,

479
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:18,264
So it's such a coincidence
to run into you guys like this here,

480
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,170
-You think it's a coincidence?
-What do you think?

481
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,860
I'm not sure, but I'm beginning to think
that everything happens for a reason,

482
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,499
God wanted me to have
knowledge of good and evil,

483
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:32,812
-Why would he want that?
-Why are we assuming God's a he?

484
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,214
I don't know what to say to that,

485
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,584
You kidding?

486
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,223
Anyway, don't you guys see
what I'm saying?

487
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,396
Why would he choose you?

488
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,476
Why wouldn't he choose
someone stronger?

489
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,322
Chosen doesn't have to be strong,
I'm big like this,

490
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,111
-You have a fat face,
-My brain, It's enormous,

491
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,328
I'm smarter than you are,
I don't talk as much,

492
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:56,877
I'm the smartest guy in the village,

493
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,352
I'm the smartest guy
that was in the village,

494
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,234
Excuse me,
you are interested in some slaves?

495
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,452
Yes,

496
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:08,053
-This one looks pretty good,
-And her little friend, Very good,

497
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,020
-Just how I like them,
“Hey,

498
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,465
Feisty,

499
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,410
So how do we do this
if we want them?

500
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,431
You have money?

501
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,302
That depends
on what you mean by money,

502
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,294
Excuse me,
Perhaps I could be of some help here,

503
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:26,141
You guys, let me deal with this guy,
see if I can work out a deal,

504
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,395
What happened to your forehead?

505
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,113
I didn't murder my brother, I didn't,

506
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,261
All right, I'm just gonna--

507
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,333
We're gonna get you out of this,
You trust me?

508
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:41,089
-[ want to trust you,
-Fair enough,

509
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,139
Next up is a twofer,
It is two for price of one,

510
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,190
Have a great vacation,

511
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,560
Never trusted that guy,

512
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,241
Because he murdered his brother
with a rock?

513
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,300
Is that why you didn't trust him?
You got great instincts,

514
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,488
Sorry, do you think you could move
your hands, please?

515
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,543
Yeah,

516
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,327
-Sorry,
-Thank you,

517
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:21,698
Enmebaragesi, can you move that way
a little bit? We're crowded back here,

518
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,427
Oh, yeah, no problem,
How's that?

519
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,714
Look, want you to know...

520
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,497
.. 1 blame myself for everything
that's happened,

521
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,520
-Yeah, So does everybody else,
-Stay away from my woman,

522
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:39,175
Not gonna be possible, Marlak,

523
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,014
She's not your woman,
You can't own people,

524
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:46,185
Except for the guy who bought
all of us, Apparently, he can,

525
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,521
That's it,
-What?

526
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,422
-I'm gonna kill you!
-"I'm gonna kill you,"

527
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,308
You always say, "I'm gonna kill you"
and you never do,

528
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,370
Be still, Don't make me come in there,

529
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,160
I'd like to see you try,

530
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,451
Take the slaves!

531
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,303
Go!

532
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,082
Eema, run like a cougar
is chasing you,

533
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,188
-Zed!
-Eema,

534
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,442
Come here, you two,

535
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,285
Go, g0, g0, go,

536
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,351
Sir, shall we pursue the slaves?

537
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:56,154
Let the desert have them,
They won't get far,

538
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,615
Yes, sir,

539
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,176
-Orders, sir?
-Tend to the slaves,

540
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,359
-We leave for Sodom before daybreak,
-Yes, sir,

541
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,578
I wonder who they are,

542
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,433
Their hats are really great,
aren't they?

543
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,299
Their hats?

544
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,337
When that guy
cut the other guy's head off...

545
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,406
.. 1 wasn't thinking about
what a great hat,

546
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:30,171
It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd
be lying if I said it wasn't up there,

547
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,185
I'm just saying, if l can snag one,
I'm going to,

548
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,245
Now I just have to figure out a way
to rescue Maya and Eema,

549
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,355
How are we gonna rescue them?
These guys are killers,

550
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,359
Even killers have to sleep sometime,

551
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,393
That was refreshing,

552
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,328
Shit!

553
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,369
They're gone,

554
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,334
Now where do we go?

555
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:08,106
They said they were going to Sodom,
We're going to Sodom,

556
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:13,248
I think I have sand in my ass,
but there's no way of knowing for sure,

557
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,402
I'll take a look in it
when we get to Sodom,

558
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,274
We making a burnt offering
or something?

559
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,299
Yes, Isaac,
As God has commanded me,

560
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,419
But I don't see the sheep anywhere,

561
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:30,998
The Lord, The Lord shall provide
the sheep, my son,

562
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,433
What is this?
Is this some sort of magic trick?

563
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,388
In a way, In a way,

564
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,217
If this is because I didn't clean up
my tent, I'm sorry,

565
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,363
I'll do it right when I get home,

566
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,278
Oh, Dad, why are you doing this?

567
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,140
The Lord has spoken unto me, Isaac,
and I must obey him,

568
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,364
If the Lord told you to jump off a cliff,
would you do it?

569
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,281
-Forgive me, Isaac,
-My God,

570
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,890
Stop! What are you doing
with that kid?

571
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,572
-Nothing,
-Nothing?

572
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,336
This is my son, sir,
We were playing a game,

573
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,266
All right?
It's called Burny Burny Cut Cut,

574
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,327
You weren't,
You were gonna kill him,

575
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,058
I was not going to kill him,
I was going to sacrifice him,

576
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,757
-There is a tremendous difference,
-Not to him,

577
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:22,995
By what right dost thou interfere?
Art thou sent by the Lord?

578
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,353
Yes, As a matter of fact, lam,

579
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,959
-Aye, Aye, verily, thou art,
-Verily, Yea,

580
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:35,056
Thou were sent by the Eternal One
to stay my hand,

581
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,259
-All of that,
This is Isaac,

582
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,156
And Iam Abraham, the son of Terah
of the House of Nahor,

583
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:47,975
We were two doors down from Nahor,
We were Nahor's neighbors,

584
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,299
And Il am Zed, son of Zero,

585
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:54,142
And this is Oh, son of Ooh
from the House of Sticks and Dung,

586
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,166
The tents of my kinsmen
lie just beyond,

587
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,064
Come, Come, my friends,

588
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,542
We are the Hebrews,

589
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:05,176
A righteous people,
but not very good at sports,

590
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,737
This way, friends, Come,

591
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,240
Brothers, brothers,

592
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,168
Let us give thanks
unto the Lord thy God...

593
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:18,236
.. for staying my hand on the mountain
this very day,

594
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,043
Praise be to God,
hallowed be his name,

595
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,527
And let us also praise him...

596
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:27,015
.. for the bounty
which he hath bestowed unto us,

597
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,529
He hath increased our wealth...

598
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,350
..and blessed us with--

599
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,301
Thanks, Thank you,
A lot of loving things,

600
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,290
-Kind loving kindness,
-Yeah,

601
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,630
Friends, whence comest thou?

602
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,661
-He wants to know where you're from,
-Thou comest not from...

603
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,366
..the Cities of the Plain,
from Sodom and Gomorrah,

604
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:47,185
-Heard of them, never been there,
-Are they nice?

605
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:48,522
“Are they nice?"

606
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,273
They have been cursed for all time
by the Lord thy God...

607
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,153
-..for their abominations,
-I did not know that,

608
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:58,072
They worship idols
and they bow down before false gods,

609
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,526
-Abdominal,
-It's the worst,

610
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,301
The men of that city
are weak and soft...

611
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,017
..fat with rich food,
intoxicated by strong drink,

612
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,324
I'm not hearing the bad part,

613
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,951
The women are whores,

614
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,352
Their shameless lust
knows no bounds,

615
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,174
They flaunt their flesh...

616
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,236
..and any man may have knowledge
of them whenever he so chooseth,

617
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,359
Which one of the two cities
has the most whores?

618
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:26,027
Just so we know to stay away
from that one especially,

619
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,254
Walk you not the path of Sodom,

620
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,161
For the Lord thy God
has said unto me...

621
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,180
..that he shall send a holy fire
to destroy that city...

622
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,183
..and all who dwell within
for their iniquity,

623
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:41,223
He shall smite them,

624
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:45,073
Them, and all of their seed,

625
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,194
So when do you think
this smiting's gonna go down?

626
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,281
-Because we have some friends there,
-Their fate is sealed,

627
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,270
But for my faith and devotion...

628
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,213
..that self-same God...

629
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,355
..has promised unto me
the whole of this land,

630
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:05,076
From the Heights of Golan in the north
to the Sinai in the south,

631
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,267
From the river of Jordan
to the great sea,

632
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,866
-This is all your land?
-For all of eternity,

633
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,313
But apparently God
forgot to tell anyone else,

634
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,342
We're at war with someone
every other day,

635
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,278
Excuse me, I and my kinsmen
have vanquished our enemies...

636
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,267
..by the mighty hand
of God, blessed be he

637
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,061
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

638
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,160
Going to Sodom,
We have to save Maya and Eema,

639
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,426
He said that God
was gonna smite Sodom with holy fire,

640
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,188
God also told him to chop off
the tip of his dick,

641
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:38,074
Dad, no! No! No!

642
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:43,071
So listen, I've been thinking,
what constitutes the tip of the penis?

643
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,154
Because his definition
might not be the same as mine,

644
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,357
-What if the tip is your favorite part?
-The tip is your only part,

645
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,417
Come out here,

646
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:59,116
Hey, you caught me, Guilty,

647
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,524
What are you doing here?

648
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:03,185
-I'm gonna come,
-You don't know where we're going,

649
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,611
-You're going to Sodom, right?
-No,

650
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,426
How stupid you think I am?
You've had a boner for Sodom...

651
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,785
..since my dad mentioned it,
If l take you, get me some wine,

652
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,459
Aren't you a bit young?

653
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,280
Do you like hanging out
with this little girl?

654
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,187
My dad just trimmed my dick skin

655
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,198
That's Sodom right there,
The Unholy Land,

656
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:27,124
The devil's playground,
where the sinners are winners,

657
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,970
Me and my boys sneak in here
on the weekends sometimes,

658
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:34,146
Pick up on the babes,
drink some wine, smoke some herb,

659
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,429
-Shouldn't be smoking either,
-Thanks a lot, Grandpa,

660
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,341
I've been smoking for four harvests
now, so I think I'm good,

661
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,272
These doors are enormous,

662
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,993
-It looks like they're not open, so--
-You just gotta knock,

663
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,219
-They let me in all the time,
-Yeah, knock,

664
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,831
-Why don't you knock?
-You knock,

665
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,603
-What if we're waking somebody?
-Eema and Maya might be in there,

666
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,692
I gave them our word
we'd rescue them,

667
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:59,328
I want to get my dicky sticky,

668
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,299
-Halt, Halt,
-Get help, Tell your father,

669
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,302
Like I'm gonna tell my father
I came with you guys to Sodom,

670
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,242
So long, suckers,

671
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,367
I kind of get why his dad
wanted to kill him,

672
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,515
Get in,

673
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:20,192
-What's this, then?
-They were banging on the gate,

674
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:24,085
-Hebrews from the look of them,
-Well, we're not really Hebrews,

675
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,453
We are Hebrews?

676
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,252
I get it, No talking,

677
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,298
-Should we wake the commander?
-Oh, no,

678
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:36,187
Don't want to wake the commander,
He gets mean when you wake him,

679
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,471
Meaner than this?

680
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,440
Let go of his titty,

681
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,240
Yeah, Okay, All right, good one,

682
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:52,076
What the bloody hell
is going on out there?

683
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,232
Who screamed?
Sounded like a woman,

684
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:04,078
But you don't look like a woman,
You wanna kiss me?

685
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,362
Like in a romantic way?

686
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,419
By tomorrow morning,
you'll wish you hadn't been born,

687
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,091
-l already feel that way right now,
-Yeah,

688
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,231
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

689
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:19,125
Because that I would pay to see,
You versus a guy your size,

690
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,490
Give me my stick,

691
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:30,152
Bumpy, You got a smoother one?

692
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,291
Yeah,

693
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,413
Turn around
and put your hands on the table,

694
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,316
Now!

695
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,148
I'll take that kiss now,

696
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:44,216
-We'll start with the fat one,
-Relatively fat, l mean...,

697
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,022
-Welcome to Sodom,
-Hey, I want a piece of that,

698
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:52,033
-Cain?
-You know them?

699
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,341
Brothers,

700
00:43:56,534 --> 00:44:01,894
I missed you so much, Oh, you guys,
Promise you'll never leave me again,

701
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,291
-This is amazing,
-And this is a Monday,

702
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,979
You should see this place
ona Thursday,

703
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,250
-Because Thursday's the new Friday,
-Well, thanks for saving us,

704
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:17,698
-What are you gonna do to us now?
-Excuse me? Do I detect a tone here?

705
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:19,532
You did sell us into slavery,

706
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:23,067
Hold a grudge much?
That was, like, a fortnight ago,

707
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,341
It was less than a fortnight,
Half a fortnight,

708
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,323
-It was a sevennight,
-Oh, give me a break,

709
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,433
I was dealing with the death...

710
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:34,041
..0f a close, personal family member
and I needed some space,

711
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:38,082
But hey, now I realize that you guys
are like my real brothers,

712
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:42,889
And it's so rare to have a brother
that you love and don't wanna kill,

713
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:45,268
Yeah, Yeah, yeah,

714
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,540
Hey, who's hungry?

715
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,297
-I'm hungry,
-Don't kill me,

716
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:49,603
Yeah? Okay,

717
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:53,115
Excuse me, I was...,

718
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,004
Yeah, that's two for flinching,
Hey, let's go,

719
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,127
Here, Now we're even,

720
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,180
Check out the woman across the way,
She's looking at us,

721
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:10,197
She's totally eye-knowing us
with her eyes right now,

722
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:15,146
If you guys are gonna stay here,
you should join the guard, ()

723
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,403
-Hey!
-Hey, hey what, hey? Huh? Yeah,

724
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:22,194
I mean, the pay's not great
but the perks, tons of them,

725
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,190
I'm telling you, it's the only way to go,
Come on, let's go talk to the sergeant,

726
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,485
-Let's go,
-Hurry now,

727
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:38,284
This is great, How do I look?

728
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:42,036
I can't see, This is too big on me,
I wonder if I can get a smaller size,

729
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,083
Yeah, someone's gotta be
the hat person around here,

730
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:48,314
-Find a...,
-Excuse me,

731
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:51,272
Hey, my helmet is way too big
for me, It looks really silly,

732
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:54,296
-Think I can get a smaller one?
-Line up!

733
00:45:56,654 --> 00:46:00,964
-What are you doing? In the line,
-Wait, he's not...,

734
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:04,156
In the line, Face forward in the line,

735
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:06,342
-Guys, Guys?
- don't know where to...,

736
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:08,364
-Guys,
-You too!

737
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,280
-Guys,
-Find a hole, you stupid bastards,

738
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,453
-It's kind of obvious, isn't it?
-Not to me,

739
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,232
Soldiers, Present arms,

740
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:24,406
I never got a sword,
l only got the holder,

741
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,260
I didn't know
that that's what it was for,

742
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:32,033
-So this is it? We just walk around?
-Yeah, pretty much,

743
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:33,507
Just look for troublemakers,

744
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:37,168
If you see a thief or a pickpocket,
we'll slap them around a little bit,

745
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,268
Maybe cut off a finger, you know,
or tip of the nose sometimes,

746
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,160
Lower lip, Just anything you can grab
and slice in one fluid motion,

747
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:48,254
It seems kind of harsh,

748
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:52,229
Hey, just remember it's the palace
that pays us, not the people, Come on,

749
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,346
Feed us!

750
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:02,748
Six sacrifices in the last 10 days
and still no rain,

751
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:07,127
Majesty, there's talk of revolution
in the streets,

752
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:10,182
Oil and grain are scarce,
prices are high,

753
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:14,254
Starving peasants are pouring
into the city in search of food,

754
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,029
We could actually have a riot
on our hands,

755
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:21,226
Poverty has a bitter taste,
but it is a flavor they are born to,

756
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:25,209
It is the will of the gods,
What do the entrails predict?

757
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:32,815
Well, the liver is streaked with gray,
which is not a good sign...

758
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,303
..but his poor rectum
is absolutely pulverized...

759
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:39,384
..Which is not unusual
for a sheep in this region,

760
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:41,768
The genitals are enormous,

761
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,306
That's of no significance,
I'm just commenting,

762
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,328
If you do look at this intestine...

763
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,940
. his large intestine
is arranged in an arc...

764
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,780
..then the two massive balls
of the sheep are like eyes,

765
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,348
To me, I see a happy face,
That makes me happy,

766
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:56,466
What does it mean?

767
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,000
Well, could mean a surprise visit
from a former friend or sweetheart,

768
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,015
Or that you're going
ona long sea voyage,

769
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:05,682
Could l come?
I've never been on a boat,

770
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,354
How did you become high priest?

771
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:10,607
I'm your brother-in-law,

772
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,345
Perhaps it's time
for a new high priest,

773
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:22,982
Perhaps it's not time
for a new high priest,

774
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,327
Let that be a warning to you,

775
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:39,926
Next time, I shall hurl a lightning bolt
right in your face,

776
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,283
Or a fireball,

777
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,370
And you know what's the best part
about Sodom? The sodomy,

778
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:48,254
You guys are in for a treat,

779
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:08,528
Down,

780
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,492
Did you see that girl?

781
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:12,571
That was Princess Inanna,

782
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,303
She's totally hot,
Don't even think about it,

783
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,956
Why not?

784
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,231
Why? Because she's royalty
and you're a caveman,

785
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:21,518
Where's everybody going?

786
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,742
To the temple,
You guys have to see this,

787
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:26,278
-Will she be there?
-Yeah, everyone'll be there,

788
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,375
There she is,

789
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,508
The princess isn't eating,

790
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:54,209
I find it hard to eat
when so many are hungry,

791
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:57,285
-You can't keep starving yourself,
-Why not?

792
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,828
Everybody else is starving,
Present company excluded,

793
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:02,475
Careful, princess,

794
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,040
You may be my stepdaughter,
but these are dangerous times...

795
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,320
-..and those are dangerous words,
-Whatever,

796
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:11,628
Hi,

797
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,527
Yeah,

798
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:27,205
-What's happening?
-They're picking a virgin,

799
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:35,098
Oh, please, If you're a virgin,
then I'm a fuzzy little gerbil,

800
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:38,352
Back to the whorehouse with you,
Quick as a bunny, There you go,

801
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,636
What do they need a virgin for?

802
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,768
-To throw her in the fire, Are you new?
-What? Why?

803
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,249
An offering to the gods,

804
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,634
-Are you serious?
-There's a famine going on...

805
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:52,304
..50 if we make
a good enough sacrifice...

806
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:56,023
..then the gods give us rain,
You get rain, you get harvest...

807
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,454
..you get harvest, you get food,
You know what food is?

808
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,359
Yeah, you know food,

809
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:04,882
So they're gonna throw a virgin
into the fire so that it rains?

810
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:08,866
Where do you think rain
comes from? Clouds?

811
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,500
My 6-year-old knows,

812
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:14,292
-Hey, how do you get rain?
-Burn a virgin,

813
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,429
I didn't think
it was anything related to--

814
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,463
Yeah, yeah, "I didn't think,
I didn't think,"

815
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:23,357
It's the gods and it comes
from virgins being burned,

816
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:25,565
Did I do something to offend you?

817
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:29,123
I come here, I get a great seat
at the sacrifice, and you're ruining it,

818
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:34,239
Seems like a waste
of a perfectly good virgin to me,

819
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,935
Hey, guys? I'm trying to enjoy
the sacrifice with my family,

820
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,259
Do you mind? Do you mind?

821
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,493
For the love of the gods...

822
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,884
..we commit this fair maiden...

823
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,192
..to Moloch's holy fire,

824
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,447
These virgins, it's always a girl?

825
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,089
I'm really happy for her,
She was always the runner-up,

826
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,453
True success story,

827
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,685
My lord,
the princess wishes to see you,

828
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,857
Me? What about my friend?

829
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,490
Can the two of us come?
We're a pair,

830
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
The three of us are like a pair,

831
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:14,094
No, not you,
The two of you, follow me,

832
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,268
Great,

833
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:19,344
-I'll try to put a good word in for you,
-Yeah, do,

834
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,200
If we never, ever see you again,
it's not because we're avoiding you,

835
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,258
Don't forget about me,

836
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,265
This is Zaftig, the eunuch,
You, go with him,

837
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:34,537
Oh, can't I go with him?

838
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:39,028
-Why? Is he your lover?
-No, we're just friends,

839
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,357
That would be weird,
We're both guys,

840
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:46,144
-Come with me,
-What do you do?

841
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,430
I've been a palace eunuch
since I was 9 years old,

842
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:51,316
-How would I become a eunuch?
-They cut off your testicles,

843
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,405
Why all the genital mutilation?

844
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:57,274
Well, you get to keep them,
l always keep mine close at hand,

845
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,622
Would you like to see?

846
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:01,267
No,

847
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,099
Can I ask your opinion?

848
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:10,074
What do you think?
Ponytail or no ponytail?

849
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:14,027
-I don't know and I really don't care,
-Okay, I just wanted to know...

850
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,958
..What the ladies of Sodom
were into nowadays, but...,

851
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,986
This party is insane,

852
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:25,893
It's more of a hair-down
kind of scene, I'd say,

853
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,268
Hi,

854
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:40,065
Be sure to try the fruit,

855
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,083
Maya, What are you doing here?

856
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,979
Okay, I'm still alive,
thank you for asking...

857
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:49,408
..and I'm still a slave,

858
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:53,017
I was coming to rescue you, Really,
That's why we were here,

859
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,419
-We were gonna find you,
-Yeah?

860
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,218
You seemed worried
about your ponytail just a second ago,

861
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,119
I was just--

862
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,240
-You were just chosen again,
-l was,

863
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:05,089
I would love to join you at this orgy,
but I can't...

864
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:09,786
.. because I have to go be a slave,
and I don't get any breaks,

865
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,129
And the princess has crabs,

866
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,939
Oh, yes, it's steamy,

867
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,073
God, that's realistic,

868
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:27,109
Watch it, jerk,

869
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,415
Areal woman, that's...,

870
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,050
Oh, excuse me, Miss...,

871
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:35,995
Ter, Mister, Awkward,

872
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,249
Good concentration,

873
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,249
You're good, You're real good,

874
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:51,952
-Oh? Is that you?
-I'm not supposed to talk, I'm a statue,

875
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:56,876
-Yeah, you look so gold,
-It's all the gold paint,

876
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:59,278
-How's it going?
-It's going great,

877
00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:03,283
I just had my entire body
painted by a fat guy with no balls,

878
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,957
-Oh, how did that go?
-He was extremely thorough,

879
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,234
-How's it going with you?
-Not bad,

880
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,320
Just had a little rub and scrub,
Now I'm up for some grub,

881
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,280
-Sounds luxurious,
“Hey,

882
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,911
You remember that woman
who brought us in with the face dress?

883
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,817
That was Maya, She's working here
now and she looks great,

884
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,662
-Kind of mad at me, though,
-And there's Eema,

885
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:26,349
Come here, wench,

886
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:28,256
Let me have a look
what's up that skirt,

887
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,941
-I'm sorry, it was an accident,
-It was no accident,

888
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:38,754
Hey, You, Slave girl,
I told you to fetch me more wine,

889
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,836
-Apologize to this officer now,
-I'm sorry,

890
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,850
Good, Now go fetch,
Wait over there by the skinny statue,

891
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,987
I'll deal with you later, Go!

892
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,149
Slaves, What are you gonna do?

893
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,156
Wait a minute,

894
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:00,232
Don't I know you?

895
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,060
-What are you, crazy?
-I will not serve these people,

896
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,960
-I'd rather die,
-Keep it up, You will,

897
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:20,272
Have you joined them?

898
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,287
[haven't joined anything,
I'm not having fun,

899
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:25,183
I'm just checking it out,
A lot to learn here,

900
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:28,992
-What, human sacrifice?
-No, No human sacrifices,

901
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,982
I've been chosen
to do something great,

902
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,286
Yeah, here we go,

903
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:37,737
I'm pretty sure it's not hunting pigs
and weaving baskets,

904
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:40,158
-Oh?
-Hello, Maya,

905
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,080
She wants to see you, Now,

906
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,143
Don't think
I'm interested in her,

907
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,595
-Whyever would I think that?
-It's part of my plan,

908
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:52,808
I'm gonna get us out of here
soon as I can,

909
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,970
-The princess awaits you,
-And I await her,

910
00:56:56,513 --> 00:57:00,703
You two, await me,
Stay out of trouble, Stay gold,

911
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,101
He has no idea what he's doing,
does he?

912
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:06,897
-It's nice to see you like this,
-It's nice to see you too,

913
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:09,267
We should do something,
When do you get off?

914
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:13,779
-Never, I'm a slave,
-Oh, yeah, of course,

915
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,301
Slave girl, bring me a towel,

916
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,244
Yeah, I should go be a slave,

917
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:22,058
I'm gonna strike a specific pose,
I guess,

918
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,049
-Okay,
-I love you,

919
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:35,926
You there, Golden boy,
Come here,

920
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:46,224
Rub me with oil,

921
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,307
I'd rather not, if you don't mind,
That's not--

922
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,110
I'm not one of the oil rubbers,
I'm just a guard,

923
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:54,136
Rub me with oil or die,

924
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,040
-Is that enough?
-Much more, Baste me like a chicken,

925
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:11,952
Oh, yes, Pour it all over me,
you little bronze bitchlet,

926
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:15,167
Yeah, okay, You got the whole thing
on you now,

927
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,102
Marvelous, I love it,

928
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:20,111
All right, well, have a good evening,
I'm glad I could help you out,

929
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:22,964
Now rub it in,

930
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,081
With my hand?

931
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,116
No, With your nutsack,
Of course, with your hand,

932
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:35,947
Oh, yes,

933
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,686
Oh, yes, the oily oiliness,

934
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:40,977
The musky, precious,
smoky, oily oiliness,

935
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,111
Yes, that's right,
Oh, God, paint a picture on my body,

936
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,221
-Tell a story on my nipples,
-Yeah,

937
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,073
That's right, take me down
the smoky Euphrates,

938
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,649
Do something
you'll be ashamed of later...

939
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:54,182
..you naughty little goat,
All right, charm the snake,

940
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,958
-Eema, Hey...,
-Oh, just like that, Now slap me,

941
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,997
This isn't what it looks like,
-My tummy, Go ahead, slap me,

942
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:03,124
-Slap me, Slap the tummy,
-No, it's fine, ! mean, I understand,

943
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,880
Go on, I love it, I love it,
Oh, you're very gifted,

944
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,067
No, no, no, I'm just rubbing oil
on this man's chest, Eema,

945
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:13,824
Agift, I don't know,
you've got some sort of gift,

946
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:23,863
-Good luck,
-Look, Maya, Maya,

947
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:27,139
Come to me,

948
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:32,368
Beautiful, isn't it?

949
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:35,026
You can see Gomorrah
just over the hill,

950
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,035
Yep, Twin cities,

951
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,964
People think that the gods
are gonna wipe them out...

952
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:44,068
-.. because they're so evil,
-And what do you think? Am I evil?

953
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:47,994
Well, I don't really know you,
but you don't look evil,

954
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50,218
Do you find me attractive?

955
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,252
Yeah,

956
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,714
Let me ask you one thing,

957
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,153
What would a girl like you
want with a guy like me?

958
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:03,722
I don't know,
I just find you interesting,

959
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,234
They say it's the will of the gods...

960
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,026
..that some men should suffer
while others rule,

961
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,928
That we're all just victims
of our own fate,

962
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,802
I believed that until this morning...

963
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:17,427
.. when I saw you standing up alone
in the square and I said to myself:

964
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:21,948
"Yes! Finally, here's one man
who refuses to bow down to anything,

965
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:25,132
A man with the courage
to question the order of things,

966
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:30,654
A man chosen by the gods
to do something great,"

967
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:33,124
That's exactly
what I've been thinking,

968
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,206
You would not believe the stuff
happening to me,

969
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:38,052
-I just didn't know why,
-l know why,

970
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:42,884
To bring you here, To this place,
To me,

971
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:46,183
I could not agree more,

972
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:50,064
I'm trying to agree more, but I can't,
because that's how much I agree,

973
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:53,087
Come,

974
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:57,722
This must be difficult
for you to understand...

975
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,391
..but my life is devoted
to the service of the gods...

976
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:03,911
..and the good of the people,
I keep nothing for myself,

977
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,884
-That's very unselfish of you,
-It is unselfish of me, isn't it?

978
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,703
You're so perceptive
for one so young,

979
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:15,808
-Yeah, What are those doors there?
-Behind these doors...

980
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:19,853
..is the Holy of Holies,
earthly domain of the gods,

981
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,190
A place so ineffably sacred,
so powerful...

982
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,322
..that to enter is instant death,

983
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,212
-Who cleans it?
-Needs no cleaning,

984
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,038
Kind of makes you think
about the people that built it,

985
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,120
Like, did they die instantly...

986
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:35,120
..or were they given
a courtesy second...

987
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,125
..to get out of there by the gods?

988
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,977
They were allowed to finish,
given four and a half seconds...

989
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:42,127
..then the gods descended,

990
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:46,016
-What if a bug goes in there?
-Instant death for the bug,

991
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,046
Are there dead bugs all over?
Because nobody cleans it,

992
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,189
They're vaporized immediately...

993
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:55,634
..by a holy beam
of vapory fire vapor,

994
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,935
-Can we goin?
-I just told you,

995
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:02,415
To enter is instant death,
you gorgeous little dunce,

996
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,280
Can't even poke our heads in?

997
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,237
You're so young and curious,
aren't you?

998
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:09,863
You want to know it all
and taste it all, explore it all, be it all...

999
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,003
..dance with it all, suck it all,
don't you?

1000
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,377
I've got a riddle for you,

1001
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,265
What has two thumbs...

1002
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:19,964
..and is desperate
for another hot-oil rub?

1003
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,997
-What?
-This person,

1004
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:25,183
Come on, Let's go,

1005
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,090
-Come, Come quick,
-That will not be a problem,

1006
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,100
What are we doing here?

1007
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,149
I want you to enter
the Holy of Holies,

1008
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:40,185
Oh, that is quite a coincidence...

1009
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:43,087
... because I want you to sit
on the Poley of Poleys,

1010
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,768
-Oh, no, That's the Holy of Holies,
-[ thought you were talking about--

1011
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:52,009
You have to go in there
and speak to the gods,

1012
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,305
-The gods are in there?
-So they say,

1013
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,178
The only one who goes in there
is the high priest,

1014
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:00,057
They say it's instant death
for anyone else to enter,

1015
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:04,047
-Then why am I going in?
-Because you've been chosen,

1016
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,302
If the gods wanted you dead,
they would've killed you already,

1017
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,928
-Right,
-This is what you've been chosen for,

1018
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:13,191
To speak to the gods,
divine their purpose...

1019
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:16,830
..and plead with them
to end this terrible famine,

1020
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:19,197
Then come back out
and tell me what it's like inside,

1021
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:20,396
-Okay,
-Okay,

1022
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,143
Right,

1023
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,088
I'm pretty sure I'm chosen,
but I'm not "sure" sure,

1024
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:33,154
You're chosen,

1025
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:36,163
Okay, I'm gonna go in,
but you gotta do something for me,

1026
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,910
-You gotta let my friends go,
-Anything,

1027
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:55,623
Don't kill me, don't kill me,
don't kill me--

1028
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,009
Get up, You look ridiculous,

1029
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:04,881
-Oh? What are you doing here?
-I'm hiding from the high priest,

1030
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:07,252
I spent the last two hours
rubbing oil on him,

1031
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:10,218
Is that chest hair?

1032
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,323
Not all of it, Just don't ask, okay?

1033
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:16,013
I've lost my sense
of right and wrong,

1034
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:18,166
How did you get in here
without getting fried?

1035
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:20,627
-I don't know, How did you?
-Because I'm a chosen,

1036
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:24,127
Probably why God didn't kill you:
He knew you were my follower,

1037
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:27,518
-I'm not your follower,
-Why are you always following me?

1038
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:31,028
I'm not following you, I walk
behind you at the same pace as you,

1039
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,871
Not following,
I could be leading from the rear,

1040
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:36,997
Come on, I'm the leader,
l always have been,

1041
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,217
Some leader,
Told us you were gonna get us out,

1042
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:42,409
-Just been messing around at orgies,
-Messing around at orgies?

1043
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:44,216
No, no, I'm not like you,

1044
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,997
I don't get to prance around
in gold paint and have fun,

1045
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:50,077
-l have no downtime,
-Please, Your whole life is downtime,

1046
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:52,537
That's what you think?
That's what everybody thinks,

1047
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,949
I'm about to show you something,
Observe,

1048
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:05,001
Almighty God, or gods,
whatever the case may be...

1049
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,072
..[ need to ask a favor of you,

1050
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,105
I know
I've really messed things up...

1051
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:14,127
..but I really need to come through
on this one...

1052
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,848
..and I wanna ask you to please give
me the strength to free my friends,

1053
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:22,826
-And that's it, that's the favor,
-Oh, shit,

1054
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:26,859
Hello?

1055
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,516
Hasn't it occurred to you
that it might be silent...

1056
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:33,328
.. because God is not in here?
Look around, There's nothing in here,

1057
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,823
That doesn't prove anything,
Maybe he stepped away,

1058
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,469
-For what?
-God stuff,

1059
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:40,672
If he needs something,
he can create it from nothing,

1060
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:43,587
What's the point of being God
if you keep running for things?

1061
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:48,163
Let me just put something out there,
Maybe God doesn't exist,

1062
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,948
What? So everything is just random?

1063
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,679
Then nothing would mean anything,

1064
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,731
-What would be the point?
-That is the point,

1065
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,750
That there's no point? That's stupid,

1066
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:00,578
-You're stupid,
-No,

1067
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:03,514
-There's something bigger than me,
-There's nothing bigger than you,

1068
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:05,707
-Don't touch my belly to make a point,
-Fine,

1069
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:09,429
-Okay, I'm sorry, l have a man's body,
-I'm maturing at my own pace,

1070
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:13,313
-You are so jealous of me,
-Jealous? That you're a bullshit artist?

1071
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,462
That every time you speak,
it's bullshit coming out of your mouth?

1072
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:19,563
You would believe in God
if you've ever been with a woman,

1073
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,469
-I'm a virgin by choice,
-Not your choice,

1074
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,859
-Take that back,
-l won't,

1075
01:06:25,248 --> 01:06:26,738
-Take back what you said,
-Take back what you said,

1076
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,593
Everything you've ever said,

1077
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:30,662
Don't stand close,
Get your belly off of my belly,

1078
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:31,777
Don't touch my belly,

1079
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,541
I don't want to touch bellies with you,
ever,

1080
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,628
Take everything
you've ever said back,

1081
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:38,676
-You're out of control,
-You're a freak,

1082
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:42,332
-Stop screaming, stop screaming,
-You're a freak! Get off me,

1083
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:49,937
I can pull this thing together,
The princess is right out there,

1084
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,807
And if I play this right...

1085
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:54,498
..['m gonna get us all out of here,
Maya and Eema too,

1086
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:56,691
Just trust in me, Have a little faith,

1087
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,442
Fine, but not for you, For Eema,
And I'm too tired to argue right now,

1088
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,319
[had a long hot bath with the
high priest, and I'm lightheaded,

1089
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,728
I'm sorry for squeezing you so hard,

1090
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,767
Let's go, Freak,

1091
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:17,238
God, if you do exist,
if you make Eema love me...

1092
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,629
.. would be very grateful, Okay?

1093
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:22,881
If you do exist,

1094
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:28,767
You guys waiting to go in there?

1095
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,758
Because I gotta say:
Not that big a deal,

1096
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:33,778
If you see a broken penis,
it was like that when we went in,

1097
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:34,920
Seize him,

1098
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,556
I'm seized,

1099
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:47,642
I wish I was upside down,

1100
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,612
Looks kind of fun,

1101
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:54,619
Is it fun?

1102
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,756
So you're not talking to me?

1103
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,977
We're not friends anymore,
after all I've done for you?

1104
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:04,588
-What have you done for me?
-I brought you out of your shell,

1105
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:08,351
Yeah? I liked my shell,
liked the village,

1106
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:11,601
Because of you, I'm in this horrible
place where brothers kill brothers...

1107
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,601
..and they burn women
and they make people slaves,

1108
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:16,758
People cut off
the ends of their penises...

1109
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,960
..and their testicles and I'm
never gonna see Eema again...

1110
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:21,763
..and it's because of you,

1111
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:25,397
Please forgive me,
I mean, you are my best friend,

1112
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:27,712
I hate the world! I hate you!

1113
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:32,006
And now I'm hanging upside down
and I really have to pee,

1114
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:33,648
I know I'm not perfect,

1115
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:37,479
And maybe I made a few wrong turns,
but you gotta understand I'm chosen,

1116
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:40,596
That's a lot of responsibility,
You can't even imagine,

1117
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:44,885
The only one that thinks that you're
chosen is you, So shut up already!

1118
01:08:44,886 --> 01:08:48,456
I'm gonna get us out of this thing
if it's the last thing I do,

1119
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,689
That was just my first idea,

1120
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,768
I'm also accepting ideas,

1121
01:09:06,975 --> 01:09:10,455
Guard!
The upside down prisoner has to pee!

1122
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,718
Oh, I'm peeing,

1123
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:17,856
Oh, no,

1124
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:19,697
Try to keep your mouth closed,

1125
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:25,697
Oh, no, In the nose,

1126
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:34,259
Hey, I'm peeing on my face too,
on the inside,

1127
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,607
I hate you,

1128
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,869
Observe, my dear...

1129
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,711
.Since it was you
who lured him to his death,

1130
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:55,572
"For the crimes of blasphemy...

1131
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,676
. heresy...

1132
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,996
..conspiracy...,"

1133
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:03,487
-What you thinking about?
-"Treachery...

1134
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,830
. leprosy..."

1135
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,581
Trying to make conversation,

1136
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:07,889
“Puppetry...

1137
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:12,007
-.. hyperbole..."
-Your hair looks really good today,

1138
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:14,697
-I peed all over it,
-Then that's the secret, I guess,

1139
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:16,832
"Sodomy...,"

1140
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:22,327
-Oh, it's "refusal of sodomy,"
-Yeah!

1141
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:24,836
Can you just forgive me?

1142
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:26,748
I think I hate you too much,

1143
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:29,612
"Lechery
and the murder of my brother, Abel,"

1144
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:31,696
-Oh, come on!
-Shut it!

1145
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:35,797
For these, and other crimes...

1146
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,487
..the prisoners shall be stoned...

1147
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,891
..to death!

1148
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:45,517
-Wait! Can I make a suggestion?
-What?

1149
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:49,878
Just have one person throw stones
at us,

1150
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:54,329
In fact, I think it would be fair if you
let us choose who gets to stone us,

1151
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,357
No, That doesn't make any--

1152
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:00,839
-We want that guy,
-That guy,

1153
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:02,807
-Me?
-That's our stoner,

1154
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:06,423
What, just because I'm a eunuch
you don't think I can throw?

1155
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:08,897
I'll show you throwing,

1156
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:11,588
No, no, No, no, no! Gross,

1157
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:16,228
Did he just hurl his own ball at him?
How spectacular,

1158
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:19,272
No! That doesn't count,
That was a testicle,

1159
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:20,672
I think it counts,

1160
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:22,717
-Pick somebody else,
-What is that idiot doing?

1161
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,621
-I pick that guy!
-Nice,

1162
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,688
-This guy?
-No, no, the shorter man,

1163
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:29,717
Right in front of him,

1164
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,659
It's a kid, This is a kid,

1165
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:34,441
So? You got something against kids?
This guy hates kids,

1166
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:37,407
-Let me smite him!
-Kid hater!

1167
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:40,536
-One shot!
-No, they're our future!

1168
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,457
All right, Hey, go ahead and--

1169
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:45,727
Okay, I'm hit,

1170
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,737
Holy shit, that kid's got an arm,

1171
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:51,756
God, There's two of us,

1172
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:53,659
Are you guys happy now?

1173
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:59,143
Okay! Everybody on this side,
on the count of three! One, two--

1174
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:02,558
Wait! I have a question for the king,

1175
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,617
Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies?

1176
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:15,192
Yes! I entered the Holy of Holies
and, lo, I did not die,

1177
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:21,128
Why? Because I was chosen
by the gods!

1178
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:26,472
Spare the chosen one!
Spare the chosen one!

1179
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:31,847
Spare the chosen one!
Spare the chosen one!

1180
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,458
-Spare the chosen one!
-And his friend!

1181
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,510
-And his young friend,
-Don't kill either of them,

1182
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:40,477
Everyone knows
the chosen gets a plus one,

1183
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,607
Is it possible? Is he truly chosen?

1184
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:46,027
Well, of course it's possible,
Highly doubtful,

1185
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,578
Majesty, with respect...

1186
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:52,338
.. Whether he is chosen or not
is no longer the issue,

1187
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,478
If you were to kill him now,
given the public mood...

1188
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,907
..it could inflame the situation
$0 as...

1189
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:03,388
..to cause a radical regime change,

1190
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:07,561
If you take my meaning,

1191
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,632
Yes, that will do,

1192
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:22,216
It is the judgment of our merciful king
that the prisoners be enslaved...

1193
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:28,172
..to toil at hard labor until they die
of starvation or exhaustion!

1194
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:29,808
Yes!

1195
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,751
And how is that better?

1196
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,629
You seem to enjoy your work,
How long have you been a slave?

1197
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:48,452
Oh, I'm not a slave, I'm a volunteer,

1198
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:54,437
Marlak, Enmebaragesi,
Long time no see,

1199
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,199
I deserve that,

1200
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,464
Take these bricks up top,
The masons are waiting,

1201
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:05,907
I would but I did something to my
neck, I think I slept on it funny,

1202
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:09,068
I should probably take it easy,
or I'll be no good for work tomorrow,

1203
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:10,405
Move!

1204
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,651
You know,
the mud's really good for your skin,

1205
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,597
-Yeah,
-Ask me why my skin's so good,

1206
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:18,847
-Why's your skin--?
-The mud,

1207
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,661
I knew you were gonna say that,

1208
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,638
You gotta love being outside,

1209
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,759
Move it!

1210
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:32,647
Faster!

1211
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:39,526
-Want some water?
-You're from the village, aren't you?

1212
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,750
I'll bet you wish you were back there
right now,

1213
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,513
-Yeah,
-Don't give up,

1214
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:46,868
You'll get home someday,

1215
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,719
Who's gonna take him there?
The chosen one?

1216
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:09,425
You two, up! Get on line, Now,

1217
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,679
-Where are we going?
-To watch the sacrifice,

1218
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,528
-The king demands it,
-ls it compulsory?

1219
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,450
There was some work that I wanted to
finish doing, get a jump on tomorrow,

1220
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,462
I'd like to see how big you are
without that whip,

1221
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:24,943
Same basic size,

1222
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,659
Allis in readiness, Your Majesty,

1223
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:31,327
What now?
More virgins to sacrifice?

1224
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:36,244
Yes, two, Your own handmaiden
and another slave,

1225
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:40,934
Followers of the chosen one,
Discovered by this loyal soldier,

1226
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:44,335
Oh, I was just doing my job,
It's what I do,

1227
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:50,067
And one more to demonstrate
our own faith and charity,

1228
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:55,205
For the love of the people,
and the heavenly gift of rain...

1229
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:59,221
..We offer a humble sacrifice:

1230
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,472
our own stepdaughter...

1231
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:05,373
..the Princess Inanna,

1232
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:11,397
-You're insane,
-For the good of the people, darling,

1233
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,630
-You wouldn't dare,
-Wouldn't I?

1234
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,243
If you like,
I can arrange for you to join her,

1235
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,561
Mother,

1236
01:16:20,843 --> 01:16:23,623
How long did you think
I would tolerate your insolence?

1237
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,716
Burn her,

1238
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:34,666
Drink it, You won't feel a thing,

1239
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,626
Are they booing me?
How dare they,

1240
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,436
They love you,
They're wooing you,

1241
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:55,616
That's fine, You know?

1242
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:11,330
It's Maya! And Eema!
Wait, Maya's a virgin?

1243
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:12,797
No, don't kill them!

1244
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,897
-Far enough, slave,
-No, kill me! I'm a male virgin,

1245
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:17,798
Marlak, we can't let them
do this! Eema!

1246
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,757
Eema, Eema!

1247
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:25,548
-I gotta get down there,
-Over my dead body,

1248
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:29,487
-No problem,
-No, Hey! Hey! Hey!

1249
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,621
-Thanks, Marlak,
-Now what?

1250
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:40,325
We implore the great gods
to show us a sign...

1251
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:42,700
..0 that we may honor
your divine will,

1252
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,668
Take this end, Lower me down,

1253
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,800
Oh, dear,

1254
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:07,688
Oh, no,

1255
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:43,657
-What is it?
-It's a sign,

1256
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:48,259
The chosen one comes! It's a sign!
He's going to end our suffering!

1257
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,620
Fight the power! Yes, we can!

1258
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:58,549
All together!

1259
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:04,547
Let's cut some foreskins!

1260
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:09,401
I knew
I could depend upon your loyalty,

1261
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:13,576
Assholes,

1262
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:22,477
Burn them, Burn them now,
Burn them all!

1263
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:25,026
Don't struggle,
it's the will of the gods,

1264
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:26,577
I don't think so,

1265
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:28,795
Zed!

1266
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:29,876
Guards!

1267
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,750
-Sorry!
-Stupid,

1268
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:37,329
Ma'am? Okay? All right?
Get the message?

1269
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,587
Okay, we should be safe in here,

1270
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,646
Thank you,

1271
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:54,628
So, Eema, this might be a bad time
to say this...

1272
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:58,026
..but that stuff
that you saw the other night...

1273
01:19:58,027 --> 01:20:00,457
..With the high priest, that--

1274
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:03,553
He's a friend,
That was totally not a gay thing,

1275
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,461
l always thought
that you and I had a connection,

1276
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:16,898
So I just wanted to mention it now,

1277
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,596
l always thought that we had
one and maybe...

1278
01:20:19,882 --> 01:20:21,661
.. thought you might've
felt the same,

1279
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,639
I just wanted to maybe bring it up
and see what you would say,

1280
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:39,585
But I always thought-- I always
have felt a certain way about you,

1281
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,036
I don't know if you know or not
but you--

1282
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:45,467
All those dead birds
that were always outside of your hut...

1283
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,678
..those were from me,

1284
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:49,755
-Just kiss me,
-From me like a gift for you,

1285
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,505
I don't know,
I thought you'd like those,

1286
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:02,438
l always thought that you could
maybe use the dead birds...

1287
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:03,758
..in a soup or something,

1288
01:21:03,926 --> 01:21:06,416
Or, I don't know,
I thought they were practical,

1289
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:14,697
Should I take off my undercloth?

1290
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:21,601
Oh, tough guy, huh?
You want a piece of me?

1291
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,597
I'm gonna bash your head in,

1292
01:21:28,851 --> 01:21:30,721
That was a nice shot,

1293
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,637
Hey,

1294
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:37,829
Hey,

1295
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,738
Zed!

1296
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:51,751
Get up and die like a man,

1297
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:54,738
Nobody harm this woman,
She's not a virgin anymore,

1298
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:58,417
-He's not either,
-I saved her life with my lovemaking,

1299
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:02,598
Sit tight, Mama, Daddy's gotta fight,

1300
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:11,567
Okay, No, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, don't kill him!

1301
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:13,818
What?

1302
01:22:13,996 --> 01:22:15,836
I just had sex with my new girlfriend,

1303
01:22:16,799 --> 01:22:18,549
-So?
-I had to tell somebody, It was great,

1304
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:22,036
I loved it, I'm hoping
I'm gonna get another opportunity,

1305
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:25,437
-What's going on behind you?
-I'm not falling for that,

1306
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:30,465
Sodomize this!

1307
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:46,818
Hey, Zed!

1308
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:48,896
-Stop! No!
-Get back!

1309
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:50,668
-Let her go!
-No!

1310
01:22:50,866 --> 01:22:52,646
The gods demand a sacrifice,
You're ruining it!

1311
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,778
-How about a little more oil?
-Yes, darling?

1312
01:23:03,946 --> 01:23:05,786
l always knew you'd break my heart,

1313
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:08,678
A little hot!

1314
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,690
That was ironic,

1315
01:23:26,969 --> 01:23:28,779
So...

1316
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:31,906
..on behalf of the whole city...

1317
01:23:31,907 --> 01:23:34,517
.al'd like to thank the high priest
for his sacrifice,

1318
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:36,780
That was really something,
wasn't it?

1319
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,686
Come on, Put your hands together,
it makes a sound,

1320
01:23:56,899 --> 01:24:01,409
The chosen one! The chosen one!
The chosen one! The chosen one!

1321
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,472
Okay, that was a little confusing,
wasn't it?

1322
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:13,778
Was that a sign from the gods?

1323
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:16,587
Everybody wants to know,

1324
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,406
Well, l should know,
because I'm the chosen one, right?

1325
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:22,602
Yeah!

1326
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:24,925
You respect me,

1327
01:24:24,927 --> 01:24:26,567
Yeah!

1328
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:28,795
You love me,

1329
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:29,847
Yeah!

1330
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:31,852
You fear me,

1331
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,835
Yeah!

1332
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,536
You would worship me,

1333
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:37,855
Yeah!

1334
01:24:39,942 --> 01:24:41,642
Yeah!

1335
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:51,686
Well, don't,

1336
01:24:51,887 --> 01:24:53,786
-Yeah!
-No,

1337
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:57,825
And I'm not saying, "Don't" like,
"I'm the chosen one, so don't,"

1338
01:24:57,826 --> 01:25:00,516
I'm saying, "Don't"
because I'm not the chosen one,

1339
01:25:01,997 --> 01:25:06,277
I thought I was, but I'm not, sorry,

1340
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:08,632
Turns out I'm just a guy
from the woods...

1341
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:13,297
.. who was lucky enough to have these
great friends to watch my back,

1342
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,724
I'm telling you, you don't need me,

1343
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:22,477
You know what? Maybe we can all
make our own destiny,

1344
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:25,719
Yeah, Maybe we could all
be chosen,

1345
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:27,955
Yeah,

1346
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:31,466
-You! You could be chosen!
-Yeah!

1347
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:35,457
-And you! And you!
-Yeah!

1348
01:25:35,998 --> 01:25:38,607
Way over in the back! You, little guy!

1349
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:42,545
Yeah!

1350
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,458
-So you're queen,
-Couldn't have done it without you,

1351
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:13,738
Yeah, you could've,

1352
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:15,682
No, really, I tried for years and...,

1353
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:20,191
All right, maybe you couldn't have,
I was pretty amazing with the old--

1354
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:24,844
Sorry about almost luring you
to your death,

1355
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,745
Oh, please,

1356
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,766
All right,

1357
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:33,748
Okay,

1358
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,560
See you later,

1359
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:39,887
Come on, people,

1360
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:42,541
-Pick up that bag of camel dung,
-Yes, sir,

1361
01:26:42,898 --> 01:26:43,828
Hang on to it all day,

1362
01:26:43,999 --> 01:26:46,429
Hustle up,
These donkeys don't pack themselves,

1363
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,705
-[ will kill you where you stand,
-Relax,

1364
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:52,437
They cut a little off the end but there's
plenty more where that came from,

1365
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:55,461
This is my woman,
Stay away from her, or I'll kill you,

1366
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:57,607
-Okay, okay, I'm sorry,
-Just go,

1367
01:26:57,946 --> 01:26:59,556
Get out of here or I'll kill you,

1368
01:26:59,848 --> 01:27:00,868
Cranky today,

1369
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,440
So are you still thinking
about going to Egypt?

1370
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,496
Supposed to be a real happening
place, You coming with or not?

1371
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:11,526
Well, l mean, I was kind of
planning on going anyway, so...,

1372
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,637
Let me show you this new style,
Everyone's doing it,

1373
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:20,656
You open your mouth really wide,
It makes it way sexier,

1374
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:28,375
I'm thinking about introducing the
tongue, but I haven't perfected it yet,

1375
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,490
-You know, we'll work on that,
-All right,

1376
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:37,530
Look at us, Two men,

1377
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,608
One going to lead a village and
the other going to explore the world,

1378
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,425
You sure you don't wanna come back,
help me?

1379
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:47,195
You don't need me, Everybody knows
you're the smartest guy in the village,

1380
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:50,489
Gonna know you're the most
incredible warrior anyone's ever seen,

1381
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:53,589
The way you punched that lady? Man!

1382
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:54,905
I mean, you know...,

1383
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:58,557
She left me no choice, so I had to,
you know, punch her in the face,

1384
01:28:00,976 --> 01:28:03,436
Well, we'll tell stories about you
around the fire,

1385
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:06,639
Strangers shake hands,
Get that thing out of here,

1386
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:14,537
-I'm gonna miss you, little guy,
-I'm gonna miss you more,

1387
01:28:15,056 --> 01:28:18,425
Just trying to sniff you,
l wanna remember your scent,

1388
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,790
That's probably the urine in my hair,

1389
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:27,666
I can't let them see me cry,
They respect me too much,

1390
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:32,249
Me too, On three,
One, two, three, break,

1391
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,045
Well, may the gods smile on you,
See you around,

1392
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:39,776
Whatever, Later,

1393
01:28:40,749 --> 01:28:41,799
-Oh?
-What?

1394
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:46,656
I want you to have babies
with my sister,

1395
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:51,925
-Try and stop me,
-All right, man,

1396
01:28:51,927 --> 01:28:55,437
-Zed, may the gods smile on you,
-You said that,

1397
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,727
-May they, Yeah,
-Thank you, though,

1398
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:02,641
All right come on, folks, We're heading
out now because I say so, all right?

1399
01:29:03,772 --> 01:29:06,552
What's the deal? Come on, Lindsey,
Come on, everyone's looking,

1400
01:29:06,975 --> 01:29:10,285
Please, Go, Good,

1401
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,592
To the north!

1402
01:29:14,816 --> 01:29:15,866
You know that that's west,

1403
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:17,921
I was just checking to see
if you knew,

1404
01:29:18,787 --> 01:29:20,517
To the west!

1405
01:29:20,956 --> 01:29:22,796
I'm already glad you're here,

1406
01:29:43,812 --> 01:29:46,422
One, two, three, foreskin!

1407
01:29:46,915 --> 01:29:49,545
Invoke your blessing
and do your will,

1408
01:29:50,018 --> 01:29:52,448
What's the fucking line? What is it?

1409
01:29:52,821 --> 01:29:54,550
It was a game,
It was a game of chance...

1410
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,666
..and he hit his head
and he killed himself,

1411
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,622
If anything, it was a suicide,
Okay,

1412
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,541
I let one go,

1413
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:09,135
In honor of the chosen one,
as my first official act as your queen...

1414
01:30:09,938 --> 01:30:12,005
..l'm going to go back
and say the line again,

1415
01:30:12,007 --> 01:30:15,876
-Let's go back, Do you wanna try it?
-Yeah,

1416
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:16,837
You just want it all,

1417
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:19,592
You want to taste it all
and know it all and feel it all,

1418
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:23,017
And suck it all in and blow it all out
your backside, don't you?

1419
01:30:23,018 --> 01:30:24,688
Sorry,

1420
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:31,925
It's like the Great Turtle coming out
of the sea, you know?

1421
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:35,357
It's like with the earth on its back,
you understand?

1422
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:37,707
I'm an oilman,

1423
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,370
You're cursed, Zed, and if you don't
leave here we're all gonna be cursed,

1424
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,658
And it drank up the ocean,
then pooped out the mountains...

1425
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:48,708
..and the first man
fell from the stars,

1426
01:30:49,077 --> 01:30:52,387
This is-- l don't-- This doesn't make
a lot of sense, guys,

1427
01:30:52,881 --> 01:30:54,661
Can I talk to Harold?
Is that--?

1428
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:13,587
What's that?

1429
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:17,345
What's that?
A strange Gorgon from another time!

1430
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:21,306
I weep for the suffering
of my people,

1431
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:23,647
We're getting boned...

1432
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:25,685
.. by the planes, the trains,
and the what, huh?

1433
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:26,851
Zed?

1434
01:31:27,048 --> 01:31:29,657
-Oh, that's great,
-Zed? It's constricting me,

1435
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:33,394
Can I show you this new kiss
I been thinking about?

1436
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:36,512
-Yeah,
-It's called a tongue kiss,

1437
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:43,656
-It's strange, Yeah, Okay,
-Still perfecting it, yeah,

1438
01:31:44,766 --> 01:31:46,635
-It's fine,
-All right,

1439
01:31:46,935 --> 01:31:48,605
What?
