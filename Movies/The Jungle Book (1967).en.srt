1
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:45,150
Many strange legends
are told of these jungles of India,

2
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:50,022
but none so strange as the story
of a small boy named Mowgli.

3
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,799
It all began when the silence
of the jungle was broken

4
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,533
by an unfamiliar sound.

5
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,609
It was a sound like
one never heard before

6
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,692
in this part of the jungle.

7
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,250
lt was amancub!

8
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,187
Had I known how deeply
! was to be involved,

9
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,179
! would've obeyed
my first impulse and walked away.

10
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,787
This man cub would have
to have nourishment, and soon.

11
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,740
lt was many days’ travel
to the nearest man-village,

12
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,643
and without a mother's care,
he would soon perish.

13
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,246
Then it occurred to me.

14
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,610
A family of wolves I knew

15
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,299
had been blessed
with a litter of cubs.

16
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,737
! knew there'd be no problem
with the mother,

17
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,706
thanks to the maternal instinct,

18
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,721
but l wasn't so sure
about Rama, the father.

19
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,790
Ten times, the rains
had come and gone,

20
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,717
and I often stopped by to see how
Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.

21
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,934
He was a favorite with all
the young wolf cubs of the pack.

22
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,704
No man cub was ever happier.

23
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,402
And yet, I knew that someday

24
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,683
he would have to go back
to his own kind.

25
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:18,075
Then one night, the wolf pack
elders met at Council Rock

26
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,238
because Shere Khan, the tiger,

27
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,428
had returned
to their part of the jungle.

28
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,695
This meeting was to change
the man cub's entire future.

29
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:33,359
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him.

30
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:38,274
Now, are we all in agreement
as to what must be done?

31
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,506
Now it is my unpleasant duty
to tell the boy's father.

32
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,616
Rama. Come over here, please.

33
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,970
Yes, Akela?

34
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,179
The council
has reached its decision.

35
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,501
The man cub can no longer
stay with the pack.

36
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,291
He must leave at once.

37
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,039
"Leave"?

38
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,511
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.

39
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,508
But the man cub is...

40
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,565
Well, he's like my own son.

41
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,440
Surely he's entitled
to the protection of the pack.

42
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,033
But, Rama, even the strength
of the pack

43
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,209
is no match for the tiger.

44
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,634
But the boy cannot
survive alone in the jungle.

45
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,568
Akela, perhaps
I can be of help.

46
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,218
You, Bagheera? How?

47
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,514
I know of a man-village
where he'll be safe.

48
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,201
Mowgli and I have taken many walks
into the jungle together.

49
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,498
I'm sure he'll go with me.

50
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,430
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.

51
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,044
Good luck.

52
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,712
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.

53
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,736
Shouldn't we start back home?

54
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,443
Mowgli, this time
we're not going back.

55
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,443
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?

56
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,873
Because Shere Khan has returned
to this part of the jungle...

57
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,642
..and he has sworn to kill you.

58
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,177
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?

59
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,027
He hates man.

60
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,846
Shere Khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man,

61
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,043
just another hunter with a gun.

62
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,938
We'll just explain to him
that I'd never do a thing like that.

63
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,818
Nonsense. No one explains
anything to Shere Khan.

64
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,216
Well, maybe so,
but I'm not afraid.

65
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,373
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.

66
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:41,128
We'll spend the night here.

67
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,288
Things will look better
in the morning.

68
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,877
Man Cub?

69
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,457
Man Cub!

70
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,649
Now, come on. Up this tree.
It's safer up there.

71
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,733
I don't wanna go back
to the man-village.

72
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,853
Go on. Up you go.

73
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,610
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.

74
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,996
Is that all the better you can climb?

75
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,226
It's too big around.

76
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,395
And besides, I don't have any claws.

77
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,229
Now get some sleep.

78
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,302
We've got a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow.

79
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,735
l wanna stay in the jungle.

80
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,071
Huh? You wouldn't last one day.

81
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,969
I'm not afraid.

82
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,064
I can look out for myself.

83
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
$-S-S-Say, now.

84
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,252
What have we here?

85
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,508
It's a man cub.

86
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,026
A delic-i-ous man cub.

87
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,416
Oh, go away and leave me alone.

88
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,178
Oh, that's just what
I should do, but I'm not.

89
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,933
Oh, now, please
go to sleep, Man Cub.

90
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,282
Yes-s-s-s, Man Cub.

91
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,651
Pleas-s-se go to sleep

92
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,762
Please go to sleep

93
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,071
S-S-Sleep, little man cub

94
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,968
Rest in peace

95
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,839
Sleep.

96
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,871
$-S-S-Sleep.

97
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,277
Bagheera...

98
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:59,351
Oh, now... now, look,
there's no use arguing anymore.

99
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,437
Now, no more talk till morning.

100
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,599
He won't be here in the morning.

101
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,965
Huh? Oh, yes, he will. I...

102
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,395
Kaa! Hold it, Kaa!

103
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,425
My sinus-s-s-s-s.

104
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,863
You have just made
a s-s-s-serious mistake, my friend,

105
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,329
a very s-s-s-stupid...

106
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,246
Now, Kaa, I was...

107
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,420
..mistake.

108
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,977
Look me in the eye
when I'm speaking to you.

109
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,789
No, please, Kaa...

110
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,311
Both eyes, if you please.

111
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,539
You have just

112
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:45,094
s-S-s-sealed your doom.

113
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,294
Look, Bagheera.

114
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,270
Look. Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.

115
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,517
Wha...?

116
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,803
Just you wait
till l get you in my coils.

117
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,866
Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!

118
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,853
"He's got a knot in his tail."

119
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:21,041
This is going to slow down

120
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,651
my s-s-s-slithering.

121
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,547
So, you can look out
for yourself, can you?

122
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,015
So, you want to stay
in the jungle, do you?

123
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:37,074
Yes, I wanna stay in the jungle.

124
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,983
Now, now, for the last time,
go to sleep.

125
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,314
Man cub.

126
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,911
Man cub.

127
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,789
Hup, two, three, four

128
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,441
Keep it up
Two, three, four

129
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,643
Hup, two, three, four

130
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,900
Keep it up two, three, four

131
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,989
Hup, two, three, four

132
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,082
A parade!

133
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,801
Oh, no.

134
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,337
The dawn patrol again.

135
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,920
Company... sound off!

136
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,223
Oh, the aim of our patrol

137
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,868
ls a question rather droll

138
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,252
For to march and drill
over field and hill

139
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,467
Is a military goal

140
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,149
Is a military goal

141
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,562
Hup, two, three, four

142
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,864
Dress it up, two, three, four

143
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,170
By the ranks or single file

144
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,821
Over every jungle mile

145
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,525
Oh, we stamp and crush
through the underbrush

146
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,920
In the military style

147
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,530
In the military style

148
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,292
Hello. What are you doing?

149
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,431
Drilling.

150
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,983
- Can I do it too?
- Sure. Just do what I do.

151
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,340
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.

152
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,112
To the rear... march!

153
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,967
The other way. Turn around.

154
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,414
Hup, two, three, four

155
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,273
Keep it up, two, three, four

156
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,589
To the rear...

157
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,654
.-ho!

158
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,076
Company... halt!

159
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,657
That means "stop."

160
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,689
Company... left face!

161
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,330
March, march, march.

162
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,643
My feet are killing me.

163
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,259
I'm puttin’ in for a transfer
to another herd.

164
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,108
Silence in the ranks!

165
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,926
Dress up that line.

166
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,917
Pull it in, Winifred.

167
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,891
Inspection...

168
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,363
.-arms!

169
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,776
Stick your nose out.

170
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,159
- Like this?
- That's right.

171
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,471
A dusty muzzle.

172
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:51,454
Soldier, remember: in battle,
that trunk can save your life.

173
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,798
Take good care of it, my man.

174
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,520
- Yes, sir.
- Very good. Carry on.

175
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,435
Let's have a little more spit and polish
on those bayonets.

176
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:06,922
Yes, sir.

177
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,153
Esprit de corps.

178
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,117
That's the way I earned my commission

179
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,626
in the Maharajah's
Fifth Pachyderm Brigade.

180
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,363
Back in '88, it was...
Or was it?

181
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,269
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.

182
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,773
It was then I received
the Victoria Cross,

183
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,500
for bravery above and beyond
the call of duty.

184
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,895
Those were the days.

185
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,740
Discipline! Discipline was the thing.

186
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,589
Builds character and that
sort of thing, you know.

187
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,776
Oh.

188
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,186
Where was I?

189
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,584
Oh, yes. Inspection.

190
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,577
Well, very good.

191
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,488
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.

192
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:57,104
Eyes front.

193
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,741
Lieutenant, that haircut
is not regulation.

194
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,300
Rather on the gaudy side,
don't you think?

195
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,297
There. That's better.

196
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,241
And as for you...

197
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,433
Oh, there you are.

198
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,791
Let's keep those heels
together, shall we, son?

199
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,877
OK, Pop.

200
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,482
- Sir.
- Yes, now that's better.

201
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,395
Well, a new recruit, eh?

202
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,077
- l say, what happened to your trunk?
- Hey!

203
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,322
Stop that!

204
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,402
A man cub! Ohh, this is treason!
Sabotage!

205
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,009
I'll have no man cub
in my jungle!

206
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,398
- It's not your jungle!
- Hold it! Hold it!

207
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,645
Il can explain, Hathi.

208
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,543
Colonel Hathi, if you please, sir.

209
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,307
Oh, yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.

210
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:54,893
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.

211
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,531
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.

212
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,685
Good.

213
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:04,286
And remember,
an elephant never forgets.

214
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,726
I don't know what the army's
coming to these days.

215
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,212
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are?

216
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,973
Let's get on with it!

217
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,002
Right face!

218
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,227
Forward... march!

219
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,420
Dear, haven't you
forgotten something?

220
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,724
Nonsense, Winifred, old girl.

221
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,036
An elephant never forgets.

222
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,842
Well, you just forgot our son.

223
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,816
Our... Son? Son!

224
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,242
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Quite right.

225
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,581
To the rear... march!

226
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,631
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a colonel just like my...

227
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,237
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...

228
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,432
Pop! Look out!

229
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,800
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say “halt.”

230
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,712
He said an elephant never forgets.

231
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,351
It's not funny.

232
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,174
Let's get out of here quick
before anything else happens.

233
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,202
Bagheera! Where are we goin'?

234
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,539
You're going back
to the man-village right now.

235
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,889
I'm not going.

236
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,378
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm staying right here.

237
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,349
You're going, if l have to
drag you every step of the way.

238
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:57,053
Let go, you...

239
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,493
You let go of me!

240
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,321
Oh, that does it.

241
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,737
I've had it, Man Cub.

242
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,980
From now on,
you're on your own...

243
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,807
.-alone!

244
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,376
Don't worry about me.

245
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,731
Foolish man cub.

246
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,693
Doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee-dee-doo

247
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,958
Well, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo

248
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,068
Yes, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo

249
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,970
! mean, a-doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee, doo-bee

250
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,093
Doo-bee-dee-doo

251
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,035
And with...

252
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,884
Well, now.

253
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,008
What have we here?

254
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,229
Hey!

255
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,332
What a funny little bit of a...

256
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,508
- Ooh!
- Go away!

257
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,534
Oh, boy, I've seen
everything in these woods.

258
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,491
Ooh, what have I run on?

259
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,709
- What a pretty thing this is.
- Leave me alone.

260
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,410
Well, now, that's pretty
big talk, little britches.

261
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,731
I'm big enough.

262
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,231
Pitiful.

263
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,693
Hey, kid, you need help

264
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,134
and ol' Baloo's gonna learn you
to fight like a bear.

265
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,597
Come on. I'm gonna show ya.

266
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,759
Yeah!

267
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,749
All right, now, kid, loosen up.

268
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,981
Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now, move.

269
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,854
That's it. Now give me
a big bear growl.

270
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,567
Scare me.

271
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,975
Oh, boy.

272
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:48,291
I'm talkin’ about like a big bear.

273
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,948
He's in trouble.

274
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,694
I shouldn't have left him alone.

275
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,506
- Abig one, right from your toes.
- How's that?

276
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,893
You're gettin’ it, kid.

277
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,296
Oh, no! It's Baloo!

278
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,546
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.

279
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,490
Weave about now.
Look for an opening.

280
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,543
Keep movin’. Keep...

281
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:29,588
You're gettin’ it, kid.
Come on! That's it!

282
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,135
He's a dandy!

283
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:39,014
Fine teacher you are, Ol' Iron Paws.

284
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,582
Thanks, Bagheera.

285
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,351
Tell me, tell me, after you
knock your pupil senseless,

286
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,501
how do you expect him
to remember the lesson, hmm?

287
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,858
Well, I...

288
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:54,476
Well, I didn't mean
to lay it on him so hard.

289
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm not hurt. I'm all right.

290
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,960
I'm a lot tougher
than some people think.

291
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,822
You better believe it.

292
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,397
Now, let's go once more.

293
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,682
l want you to keep circlin’, or
I'm gonna knock your roof in again.

294
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,819
You'd better keep movin’...

295
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,454
Hey! Right on the button.

296
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,125
No. No, no. No, no. Now you're ticklin’.

297
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,176
No. No, no. No, no. Now you're ticklin’.

298
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,041
No. No, now, we don't do that
here in the jun... No!

299
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,178
No, you're ticklin’.
I can't stand that ticklin’.

300
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,444
Help! Bagheera!

301
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:38,338
Oh, boy. That's all he needs,
more confidence.

302
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:41,174
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya!

303
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,830
I give...

304
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,466
Hey!

305
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,312
You know somethin'?
You're all right, kid.

306
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:50,802
What do they call you?

307
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:54,183
Mowgli, and he's going back
to the man-village right now.

308
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:58,593
Man-village? They'll ruin ‘im!
They'll make a man out of him.

309
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,751
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.

310
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,424
Certainly, you do.

311
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:07,709
Oh? And just how do you think
he will survive?

312
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,379
"How do you think..."
What do you mean, how do you think he...

313
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,081
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all l know.

314
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:20,018
Oh? That shouldn't take too long.

315
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,559
Look, now, it's like this,
little britches.

316
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,807
All you gotta do is...

317
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,127
Look for the bare necessities

318
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,237
The simple bare necessities

319
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,932
Forget about your worries
and your strife

320
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,189
1 mean, the bare necessities

321
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,279
Are Mother Nature's recipes

322
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:46,294
That bring
the bare necessities of life

323
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,958
Wherever I wander

324
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,214
Wherever I roam

325
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,600
! couldn't be fonder

326
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,592
Of my big home

327
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,288
The bees are buzzin' in the tree

328
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,154
To make some honey just for me

329
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,577
When you look under
the rocks and plants

330
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,739
And take a glance at the fancy ants

331
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,795
Then maybe try a few

332
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,360
You eat ants?

333
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,271
Ha ha! You better believe it.

334
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,909
And you're gonna love
the way they tickle.

335
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,116
Mowgli, look out!

336
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,386
The bare necessities of life
will come to you

337
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,016
But when?

338
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,977
They'll come to you

339
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,743
Look for the bare necessities

340
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,262
The simple bare necessities

341
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,021
Forget about your worries
and your strife

342
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,109
1 mean, the bare necessities

343
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,488
That's why a bear can rest at ease

344
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,640
With just the bare necessities of life

345
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,778
Now, when you pick a pawpaw

346
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,274
Or a prickly pear

347
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,359
And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time beware

348
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,313
Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw

349
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,963
When you pick a pear
try to use the claw

350
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,629
But you don't need
to use the claw

351
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,131
When you pick a pear
of the big pawpaw

352
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,293
Have I given you a clue?

353
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,023
Golly, thanks, Baloo.

354
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,451
"Pawpaw." Of all the silly gibberish.

355
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,026
Come on, Baggy, get with the beat.

356
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,325
The bare necessities of life
will come to you

357
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,732
- They'll come to me!
- They'll come to you

358
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:23,635
How ‘bout scratchin' that left shoulder
while you're up there, Mowgli?

359
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,750
No. Just a hair lower.

360
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,138
There. Right there. That's it.

361
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,898
This is beautiful. That's good.

362
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,517
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratchin’.

363
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,192
You're lots of fun, Baloo.

364
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,432
Right on it.

365
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:43,998
Yeah!

366
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,164
That's delicious.

367
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,025
Just a little bit...

368
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,692
Yeah!

369
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,606
Yeah!

370
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,129
Oh, man. This is really livin’.

371
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:26,017
So just try and relax. Yeah.

372
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:28,485
Cool it.

373
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,197
Fall apart in my backyard.

374
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,270
‘Cause let me tell you
somethin’, little britches...

375
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,673
If you act like that bee...

376
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,370
You're workin’ too hard.

377
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,091
And don't spend your time...

378
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,468
.-lookin' around...

379
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,911
..for something you want...

380
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,303
. that can't be found.

381
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,653
When you find out
you can live without it

382
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,749
And go along not thinkin’ about it

383
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,348
lil tell you somethin’ true

384
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,230
The bare necessities of life
will come to you

385
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,641
I give up.

386
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,781
Well, l hope his luck holds out.

387
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,419
Mowgli, how about you singin'?

388
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:13,426
Look for the bare necessities

389
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,812
The simple bare necessities

390
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,374
Forget about your worries
and your strife

391
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,477
- Yeah, man!
- ! mean, the bare necessities

392
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,231
That's why a bear
can rest at ease

393
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,087
With just the bare necessities of life

394
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,900
Yeah!

395
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,858
With just the bare necessities of life

396
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,615
Yeah, man

397
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:39,701
Beautiful. That's real jungle harmony.

398
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,979

399
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,620
That's my boy.

400
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,187
You're gonna make one swell bear.

401
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,601
Why, you even sing like one.

402
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,197
Yeah.

403
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,095
Doo-bee-doo

404
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,033

Aye-bee doogie-woogie doo

Hey, Mowgli, how about you

407
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,040
off of your papa bear's nose?

408
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,278
Boy, when you flick a fly, you really...

409
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,230
Why, you flat-nosed,
little-eyed, flaky creep!

410
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,341
Hey! Let go of me!

411
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,308
Take your flea-pickin’ hands

412
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,508
Come on and get 'im, champ!

413
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,173
- He ain't no champ! He's a chump!
- Baloo!

414
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,269
Yeah! A big hothead!

415
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,150
OK, you guys asked for it. I'll...

00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,597
That'll cool 'im off!

417

Here he is! Come and get ‘im!

419
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,853
That's how a bear can rest at ease!

Here's some bare necessities!

421
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,866
Now, just try that again, you...

422
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,359
- What's that you hit him with, son?
- That was a bare necessity!

423
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,416
You turn him loose,
or I'll jerk a knot in your tail!

424
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,066
We give up!

425
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:13,764
Here he comes!

426
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,500

00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,559
Arolling bear gathers no hair!

430
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,083
Baloo, help me!

431
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,794
Baloo! They're carrying me away!

432
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,645
Bagheera!

433
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,833
Bagheera!

434
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,806
Well, it's happened.

435
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,121
Took a little longer than I thought,
but it's happened.

436
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,112
Bagheera!

437
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,938
Bagheera!

438
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,748
Oh, you heard me, huh?

439
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,739
Mowgli. Mowgli!

440
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,343
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?

441
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,949
They ambushed me.

442
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,593
Thousands of 'em.

443
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,579
I jabbed with my left,
then I swung with a right...

444
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:15,129
Oh, for the last time,
what happened to Mowgli?

445
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,867
Like I told ya, them mangy monkeys
carried him off!

446
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,181
The ancient ruins.

447
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,906
Ohh, I hate to think what will happen
when he meets that king of theirs.

448
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,367

Well, then,

I'll tear ‘im limb from limb.

Well, man, what a beat.

508
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,456
Will you stop that silly
beat business and listen?

509
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,123
This will take brains, not brawn.

510
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,609
You better believe it,
and I'm loaded with both.

511
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,742
- Will you listen?
- Oh! Yeah, yeah.

512
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,792
Now, while you create a disturbance,

00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,908

00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,702
! wanna walk like you

528
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,607
Talk like you do-ooh-ooh

529
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:31,187
- You see it's true-ue-ue
- Shoo-be-dee-doo

530
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,009
- Someone like me
- Scooby-dooby-dooby

531
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,078
Can learn to be like someone like me

532
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:38,782
Take me home, daddy

533
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,243
Can learn to be like someone like you

534
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,161
- One more time
- Yeah!

535
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:48,269
Can learn to be like someone like me

536
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,071
- It's Baloo, the bear!
- Yeah, that's him!

537
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,903
How'd that square get in there?

538
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:01,755
Baloo! It's you!

539
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,839
Man, that's what I call
a swingin’ party!

540
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,136
And furthermore, Baloo,

541
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,047
Mowgli seems to have man's ability
to get into trouble,

542
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,537
and your influence
hasn't been exactly...

543
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,430
Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.

544
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,334
Well, he's had a big day.

545
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,570
It was a real sockeroo.

546
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,479
You know, it ain't easy
learnin' to be like me.

547
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,332
A disgraceful performance.

548
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,048
Associating with those
undesirable, scatterbrained apes?

549
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,475
l hope Mowgli learned
something from that experience.

550
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,436
Scooby-dooby-dooby
Dooby-doo

551
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,090
That's my boy.

552
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,426
Oh, nonsense.

553
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,901
Baloo.

554
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,054
Over here. I'd like
to have a word with you.

555
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,547
"A word"?
You gonna talk some more?

556
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,262
All right, what's up, Bagheera?

557
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,174
Baloo,

558
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:02,299
the man cub must go back
to the man-village.

559
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,290
The jungle is not the place for him.

560
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,171
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.

561
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,982
Yes, just look at yourself.

562
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:14,921
Look at that eye.

563
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,174
Yeah.

564
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,106
It's beautiful, ain't it?

565
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,665
Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.

566
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,737
Well, you don't look exactly
like a basket of fruit yourself.

567
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,749
Baloo,

568
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:36,962
you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.

569
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,567
Why not?

570
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,974
How can I put it?

571
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,062
Baloo,

572
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,428
birds of a feather
should flock together.

573
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,870
You wouldn't marry a panther,
would you?

574
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:52,439
I don't know.

575
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:56,547
Come to think of it,
no panther ever asked me.

576
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,949
Oh, Baloo, you've got to be
serious about this.

577
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,942
Oh, stop worryin', Baggy.
Stop worryin’.

578
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,845
I'll take care of him.

579
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,814
Yes, like you did when
the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?

580
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,130
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.

581
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,744
And another thing,

582
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,603
sooner or later
Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.

583
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:23,018
The tiger? What's he got
against the kid?

584
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,634
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.

585
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:29,775
Because he fears man's gun
and man's fire.

586
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,734
But little Mowgli
don't have those things.

587
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:35,761
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.

588
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:39,467
He'll get Mowgli while
he's young and helpless.

589
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,541
Just one swipe and...

590
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,741
Well, what are we gonna do?

591
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,894
We'll do what's best for the boy.

592
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,539
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.

593
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,154
Good. Then make Mowgli
go to the man-village.

594
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:55,812
Are you out of your mind?

595
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,590
I promised him he could stay here
in the jungle with me.

596
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,623
That's just the point.

597
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,568
As long as he remains with you,
he's in danger.

598
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,295
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?

599
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,084
Because he won't listen to me.

600
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,750
I love that kid.

601
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,857
I love him like he was my own cub.

602
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,179
Then think of what's best
for Mowgli and not yourself.

603
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:20,623
Well, can't...

604
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,545
Can't I wait until morning?

605
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,354
It's morning now.

606
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:28,605
Go on, Baloo.

607
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,791
Oh, boy.

608
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,819
Mowgli. Mowgli.

609
00:43:57,702 --> 00:43:59,842
It's time to get up.

610
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,304
Oh. Hi, Baloo.

611
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,208
Hi.

612
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,986
Hey, rub that ol’ sleep
outta your eyes.

613
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:12,417
You and me, we got
a long walk ahead of us.

614
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:15,814
Swell. We'll have
lots of fun together.

615
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,941
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

616
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:23,378
All right, let's hit the trail, kid.

617
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,683
See ya around, uh, Bagheera.

618
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,999
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.

619
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,703
Me and Baloo,
we've got things to do.

620
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,774
Goodbye, Man Cub...

621
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,197
..and good luck.

622
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,870
Come on, Baloo.

623
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,813
All we gotta do is...

624
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:44,102
Look for the bare necessities

625
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:46,602
Some good ol' bare necessities

626
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:50,111
Forget about your worries
and your strife

627
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,611
1 mean, the bare necessities

628
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:55,537
That's why a bear can rest at ease

629
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,650
With just the bare necessities of life

630
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,120
Yeah!

631
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:03,317
I'll live here in the jungle
all my life

632
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,641
Yeah, man! I like being a bear.

633
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:10,667
Where we goin’, Baloo?

634
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,778
Well, it's...

635
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,234
Well, it's sorta new and...

636
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:19,191
Oh, I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.

637
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:25,161
Mowgli... look, buddy,
there's somethin’ I gotta tell ya.

638
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,022
Tell me what, Baloo?

639
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,218
Oh, gee whiz.

640
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:34,292
Now, how did ol’ Baggy put it?
It's...

641
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,045
Mowgli...

642
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,739
You wouldn't marry
a panther, would ya?

643
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,095
Gee, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

644
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,770
Mowgli, don't you realize
that you're a human?

645
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,966
I'm not anymore, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.

646
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,286
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo!

647
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,413
Mowgli, stop it now. Hold still.

648
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,999
l wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.

649
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,694
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?

650
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,285
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin’
all morning to tell ya,

651
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,787
I've got to take you back
to the man-village.

652
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,049
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.

653
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,665
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...

654
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:21,165
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!

655
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,256
That's goin’ too far!

656
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,330
Hey, Mowgli! Where you goin'?

657
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,089
Wait a minute! Stop!

658
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,730
Wait!

659
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,154
Wait! Listen to ol’ Baloo!

660
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,701
Mowgli!

661
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:40,784
Mowgli!

662
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:42,729
Mowgli!

663
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,234
Mowgli. Mowgli!

664
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:50,906
Now what's happened?

665
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,511
Well, you're not gonna
believe me, Bagheera,

666
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,721
but look, now, I used the same words
you did, and he ran out on me!

667
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,099
Well, don't just stand there.

668
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,404
Let's separate. We've got to find him!

669
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:08,198
Oh, if anything happens to that
little guy, I'll never forgive myself.

670
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:10,149
I gotta find him.

671
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,703
Mowgli!

672
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:14,681
Mowgli!

673
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,509
Hup, two, three, four

674
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:07,019
Hup, two, three, four

675
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,965
Keep it up, two, three, four

676
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,923
What beastly luck.

677
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,212
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi.

678
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:16,992
Company... sound off!

679
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,295
Oh, we march from here to there

680
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,940
And it doesn't matter where

681
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,823
You can hear us push
through the deepest bush

682
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,846
Hup, two, three, four

683
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:29,448
With a military air

684
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,210
With a military air

685
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,025
The jungle patrol!

686
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,836
We're a crackerjack brigade

687
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,303
On a pachyderm parade

688
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,175
But we'd rather strolf
to a water hole

689
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,580
Hup, two, three, four

690
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,097
For a furlough in the shade

691
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:54,467
Stop!

692
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,246
Wait a minute. Halt!

693
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:03,447
Who said "halt"?
I give the commands around here.

694
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,024
Well, speak up. Who was it?

695
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:08,017
Oh, it was me, Colonel.

696
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:12,261
What do you mean, sir, taking over
my command? Highly irregular, you know.

697
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,602
Oh, Colonel, I'm sorry,
but I need your help.

698
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,013
Oh, absolutely impossible.

699
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,905
We're on a cross-country march.

700
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,301
But it's an emergency, Colonel.

701
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,589
- The man cub must be found.
- Man cub? What man cub?

702
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,583
How interesting.

703
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:30,645
The one I was taking
to the man-village.

704
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,321
Good. That's where he belongs.

705
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:37,014
Now, sir, if you don't mind,
we'd like to get on with the march.

706
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,641
No, no, you don't understand, Hathi.

707
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:44,425
He is lost. He ran away.

708
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:46,729
How delightful.

709
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:50,040
Well, it serves
the young whippersnapper right.

710
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:53,101
But Shere Khan, the tiger,

711
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,984
is sure to pick up the man cub's trail.

712
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,438
Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.

713
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,321
Shere Khan isn't
within miles of here.

714
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:10,607
Oh, sorry, Bagheera. Fortunes of war
and all that sort of thing, you know.

715
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,818
This has gone far enough.

716
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,085
Far enough!

717
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,753
Now, just a minute,
you pompous old windbag!

718
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:23,094
Winifred! What are you doing
out of ranks?

719
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:24,984
Never mind.

720
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,930
How would you like to have our boy
lost and alone in the jungle?

721
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,747
Our son... alone?

722
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,790
But, Winifred, old girl,
that's an entirely different matter.

723
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,915
Different, entirely.

724
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,107
That little boy is
no different than our own son.

725
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:47,174
Now you help find him
or I'm taking over command.

726
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:50,145
What? A female leading my herd?

727
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,187
Utterly preposterous.

728
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:55,203
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.

729
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:58,022
He'll get hurt if we don't find him.

730
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,855
Please, Pop, sir? Please?

731
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,714
Now, don't you worry, son.

732
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:08,515
Your father had a plan
in mind all the time.

733
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:12,584
Sure you did.

734
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,258
Troopers!

735
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,390
Company... left face!

736
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,719
Volunteers for a special mission

737
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,721
will step one pace forward.

738
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,482
That's what I like to see.

739
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,504
Devotion to duty.

740
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:47,551
Now, you volunteers
will find the lost man cub.

741
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:50,832
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.

742
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,885
Yes. Yes.

743
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:56,137
Bugler, when the man cub is sighted,

744
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,604
you will sound your trumpet three times.

745
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,107
Yes, sir.

746
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:05,598
Not now, soldier.

747
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,349
Sorry, sir.

748
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:11,768
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be
the element of surprise.

749
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:16,719
You will take one squad
and cover the right flank.

750
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:18,511
Yes, sir.

751
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:22,836
And I shall meet the other squad
on the left flank.

752
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,391
Very well.

753
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,129
Compary...

754
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,380
.. forward... march!

755
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,062
Element of surprise?

756
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:46,535
Oh, I say.

757
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:51,395
And now for my rendezvous

758
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:53,612
with the little lost man cub.

759
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,175
Kaa! It's you!

760
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,104
Yes-s-s, Man Cub.

761
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,043
So nice to see you again.

762
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,248
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.

763
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,839
Let me look at you.

764
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,493
You don't want me to look at you?

765
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,534
Then you look at me.

766
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,403
No, sir. l know
what you're trying to do, Kaa.

767
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:50,813
You do?

768
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:54,151
I mean, you don't trust me.

769
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:58,607
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.

770
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:01,133
You want to help me?

771
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,711
Certainly.

772
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:05,411
I can see to it...

773
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,739
. that you never have
to leave this jungle.

774
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:11,344
How could you do that?

775
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,125
Hmm?

776
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,690
Oh, I have my own...

777
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,029
..$-S-subtle little ways.

778
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,185
But first, you must trust me.

779
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:24,967
But first, you must trust me.

780
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,166
I don't trust anyone anymore.

781
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,570
I don't blame you.

782
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:34,466
I'm not like those so-called

783
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,638
fair-weather friends of yours.

784
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,941
You can believe in me.

785
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,660
Trust in me

786
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:50,944
Just in me

787
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,599
Shut your eyes

788
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,687
And trust in me

789
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,694
Hold still, please.

790
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:05,163
You can sleep

791
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,379
Safe and sound

792
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,195
Knowing!

793
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,229
Am around

794
00:56:22,246 --> 00:56:25,526
Slip into silent slumber

795
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:30,227
Sail on a silver mist

796
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,834
Slowly and surely

797
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,730
Your senses will cease to resist

798
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,231
You're snoring.

799
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,777
Sorry.

800
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:49,954
Trust in me

801
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:54,127
And just in me

802
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,986
Shut your eyes

803
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,584
And trust in me

804
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,875
Huh?

805
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,068
Oh, now what?

806
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,677
I'll be right down.

807
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:20,898
Yes? Yes? Who is it?

808
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:23,545
It's me, Shere Khan.

809
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,157
I'd like a word with you,
if you don't mind.

810
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:30,993
Shere Khan.
What a s-s-surprise.

811
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:35,582
Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.

812
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,176
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.

813
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:40,302
Oh, no, no. Nothing at all.

814
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:44,223
I thought perhaps you were entertaining
someone up there in your coils.

815
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,965
Coils? Someone? Oh, no.

816
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:50,701
l was just curling up for my siesta.

817
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,904
But you were singing to someone.

818
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:56,683
- Who is it, Kaa?
- Who?

819
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,910
Oh, no.

820
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:03,962
- was just singing to myself.
- Indeed.

821
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:09,188
Yes. Yes, you see,
l have trouble with my s-s-sinuses.

822
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:13,346
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.

823
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,819
It's simply terrible. I can't eat.

824
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:22,013
I can't s-s-sleep,
sol sing myself to sleep.

825
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:26,073
You know, self-hypnosis?

826
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:29,643
Let me show you how it works.

827
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:33,688
Trust in me

828
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,810
I can't be bothered with that.

829
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,921
l have no time
for that sort of nonsense.

830
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,850
- Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.

831
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:46,941
But at the moment
lam searching for a man cub.

832
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,346
"Man cub"? What man cub?

833
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,913
The one who's lost.

834
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,255
Now, where do you suppose he could be?

835
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:56,587
Search me.

836
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,153
That's an excellent idea.

837
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:02,439
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?

838
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,183
Certainly not.

839
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:08,957
Nothing here,

840
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,559
and nothing in here.

841
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,326
My sinuses.

842
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,496
Indeed.

843
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,909
And now, how about the middle?

844
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,698
The middle?

845
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,934
Oh, the middle.

846
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,718
Absolutely nothing in the middle.

847
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,170
Really?

848
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,346
Well, if you do just happen
to see the man cub,

849
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,070
you will inform me first.

850
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:56,966
- Understand?
- [get the point.

851
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,664
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.

852
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:05,414
And I must continue my search
for the helpless little lad.

853
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:10,782
Who does he think he's fooling?

854
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:12,784
"Helpless little lad."

855
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,326
Ooh, he gives me the s-s-shivers.

856
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,502
Picking on that poor little
helpless boy.

857
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:26,818
Oh, yes.

858
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,904
The poor little helpless boy.

859
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:42,009
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.

860
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,842
It's like you said.

861
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:48,672
You can't trust anyone.

862
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:58,334
If l never see that
skinny little shrimp again,

863
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,625
it will be too soon.

864
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:06,839
Ooh, my s-s-sacroiliac.

865
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:28,368
Hey, Flaps. What we gonna do?

866
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:31,433
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

867
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:35,442
I've got it! Let's flap over
to the east side of the jungle.

868
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,732
They've always got a bit of action,
a bit of a swingin’ scene.

869
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,625
Aw, come off it!
Things are right dead all over.

870
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,312
You mean you wish they were.

871
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:48,567
Very funny.

872
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,890
OK, so what we gonna do?

873
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:56,615
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

874
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,543
Look, Flaps, first l say,
"What we gonna do?"

875
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,126
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do?"

876
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,182
"What we gonna do?"
"What you wanna do?"

877
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,327
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!

878
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,936
OK. What do you want to do?

879
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:11,286
Oh, blimey. There you go again.

880
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:13,208
The same notes again.

881
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,956
I've got it!
This time, I've really got it.

882
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,020
So you've got it.
So what we gonna do?

883
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:24,156
Hold it, lads.
Look. Look what's coming our way.

884
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,761
Hey, what in the world is that?

885
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,399
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.

886
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,468
Yeah, and they're all
walking about by themselves.

887
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:42,891
- So what we gonna do?
- [don't know.

888
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,156
Hey, now, don't start that again.

889
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:46,755
Come on, lads. Come on.

890
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:50,127
Let's have some fun with this
little fella, this little bloke, eh?

891
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:05,332
Blimey! He's got legs
like a stork, he has.

892
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:08,595
Like a stork. Ha ha!
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.

893
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:16,029
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.

894
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,382
What's wrong with him?

895
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:25,978
I think we overdid it.

896
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:28,665
We were just having
a bit of fun, that's all.

897
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:32,552
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.

898
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:36,067
You know, he must be
down on his luck.

899
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:39,313
Yeah, or he wouldn't be
in our neighborhood.

900
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,370
Hey, new kid! Wait a minute! Hey!

901
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,393
Just leave me alone.

902
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:47,649
Oh, come on. What's wrong?

903
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,621
You look like you haven't got
a friend in the world.

904
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:54,311
- [haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?

905
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,761
No. Nobody wants me around.

906
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,680
Yeah. We know how you feel.

907
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,125
Nobody wants us around either.

908
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:05,899
Oh, we may look a bit shabby,
but we've got hearts.

909
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:07,843
And feelings too.

910
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:09,891
And just to prove it to you,

911
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,703
we're going to let you
join our little group.

912
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:16,366
Kid, we'd like to make you
an honorary vulture.

913
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:20,046
Thanks, but I...
I'd rather be on my own alone.

914
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:21,897
Oh, now, look, kid.

915
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,028
Everybody's got to have friends.

916
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,845
Hey, fellas, are we his friends?

917
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,099
We're your friends

918
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,984
We're your friends

919
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:37,504
We're your friends to the bitter end

920
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:41,697
The bitter end

921
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,678
When you're alone

922
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,251
When you're alone

923
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,867
Who comes around

924
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,563
Who comes around

925
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:54,946
To pluck you up

926
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,991
- Give us a smile.
- To pluck you up

927
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,023
When you are down

928
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:03,402
When you are down

929
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,400
And when you're outside looking in

930
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:11,417
Who's there to open the door?

931
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:14,025
- Come on, kid. We need a tenor.
- That's

932
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:15,337
What

933
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:20,525
Friends are for

934
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:25,482
Who's always eager to extend

935
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:29,843
A friendly claw

936
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:35,105
That's what friends are for

937
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:37,532
And when you're lost

938
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,158
In dire need

939
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,747
Who's at your side

940
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:44,175
At lightning speed

941
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,851
We're friends with every creature
comin' down the pike

942
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:52,278
In fact, we've never met
an animal we didn't like

943
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,222
You take it, kid.

944
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:58,114
Didn't like

945
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:03,013
- So, you can see we're friends
- Friends in need

946
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,482
We're friends in need
and friends indeed

947
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:06,909
Friends indeed

948
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,290
Oh, friends indeed

949
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,900
- Easy, lads. Steady. Watch it!
- We'll keep you safe in the jungle

950
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:18,274
Forevermore

951
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:24,935
That's what friends

952
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:30,538
Are for

953
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,133
Bravo. Bravo.

954
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,363
An extraordinary performance.

955
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:41,715
And thank you
for detaining my victim.

956
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,778
Uh, don't mention it, Your Highness.

957
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,524
Boo!

958
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:52,026
- Let's get out of here.
- Gimme room! Gangway!

959
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,837
Run, friend! Run!

960
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,834
"Run"? Why should I run?

961
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:00,031
Why should you run?

962
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,836
Could it be possible
that you don't know who I am?

963
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:05,533
I know you, all right.

964
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:08,032
- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.

965
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:12,671
Then you should also know
that everyone runs from Shere Khan.

966
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,664
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.

967
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:21,914
Ah! You have spirit for one so small,

968
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:26,425
and such spirit is deserving
of a sporting chance.

969
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,203
Now, I'm going to close
my eyes and count to ten.

970
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,433
It makes the chase
more interesting... for me.

971
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:36,798
One...

972
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,920
... two, three...

973
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,979
. four...

974
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,551
You're trying my patience.

975
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,349
. five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

976
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:54,613
Run, Mowgli, run!

977
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,658
Let go, you big oaf!

978
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,478
Take it easy. Take it easy.

979
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:02,677
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Whoa!

980
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,812
Whoa, slow! Easy, now!

981
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:08,553
Whoa! Easy!

982
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:10,484
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has.

983
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:12,276
And he better hang on too.

984
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:18,876
Take that, you big bully.

985
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:23,122
Let him have it again, kid!
Hit him again, kid! Go on!

986
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,624
Baloo! Help me!

987
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:42,807
Somebody do something with that kid!

988
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:44,792
Come on, lads!

989
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:52,774
He's safe now! Ha ha ha!
You can let go, Baloo.

990
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:56,523
Are you kiddin’?
There's teeth in the other end.

991
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,290
I'll kill you for this.

992
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,717
Let go! Baloo needs help!

993
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:17,264
Fire! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.

994
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:19,767
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.

995
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:27,919
Charge!

996
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:31,917
- Punch and blow!
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools!

997
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,782
Yeah, yeah. Missed me a mile, he did!

998
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,546
Yeah, pull his blinkin' whiskers!

999
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,742
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is!

1000
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:44,035
Look behind you, chum.

1001
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:04,561
Well, that's the last of him.

1002
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,013
Old Stripes took off
like a flaming comet, he did.

1003
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,775
Well, come on. Let's go
congratulate our friend.

1004
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,541
Hold it, fellas.

1005
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:17,710
Now is not the time for it. Look.

1006
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:25,916
Baloo?

1007
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:35,747
Baloo, get up.

1008
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,463
Oh, please, get up.

1009
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,609
Mowgli, try to understand.

1010
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,929
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?

1011
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:59,279
You've got to be brave,
like Baloo was.

1012
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,959
You... You don't mean...

1013
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,701
Oh, no. Baloo.

1014
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:15,138
Now, now. I know how you feel.

1015
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:19,754
But you must remember, Mowgli,

1016
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,503
"Greater love hath no one

1017
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:27,223
than he who lays down his life
for his friend."

1018
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,391
When great deeds

1019
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,263
are remembered in this jungle,

1020
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:36,339
one name will stand above all others:

1021
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:41,123
Our friend, Baloo the bear.

1022
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:44,537
He's crackin’ me up.

1023
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:48,021
The memory of Baloo's
sacrifice and bravery

1024
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:52,224
will forever be engraved
on our saddened hearts.

1025
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,539
Beautiful.

1026
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:58,444
This spot where Baloo fell
will always be

1027
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,827
a hallowed place in the jungle,

1028
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:06,261
for there lies one of nature's
noblest creatures.

1029
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,452
I wish my mother
could have heard this.

1030
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,972
It's best we leave now.

1031
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,219
Come along, Man Cub.

1032
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:21,378
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin’ great!

1033
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,418
There's more. Lots more!

1034
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,361
Why, you big fraud!

1035
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:29,557
You four-flusher!

1036
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:31,839
I'm fed up!

1037
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,370
Baloo, you're all right!

1038
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:38,545
Who, me? Sure lam.

1039
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:41,098
Never felt... better.

1040
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:49,617
- You sure had us worried.
- l was just takin' five.

1041
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:52,816
You know, playin’ it cool.

1042
01:12:53,236 --> 01:12:56,425
- But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.

1043
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:00,219
It's going to be a bit dull
without the little bloke, isn't it?

1044
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:03,086
Yeah. So what we gonna do?

1045
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:06,406
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!

1046
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,496
Hey, Baggy.
Too bad you missed the action.

1047
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,996
You should have seen
how I made a sucker

1048
01:13:13,356 --> 01:13:15,696
out of Old Stripes
with that left up in his face.

1049
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,081
"Boom, boom," I was givin’ him. "Wham!"

1050
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,857
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.

1051
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:24,364
- You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.

1052
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:28,647
Nothing or nobody is ever
gonna come between us again.

1053
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:33,383
My own home

1054
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:37,529
My own home

1055
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:41,273
My own home

1056
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,744
My own home

1057
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,898
Look! What's that?

1058
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:52,918
- Oh, it's the man-village.
- No, no. l mean that.

1059
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:58,591
Forget about those.
They ain't nothing but trouble.

1060
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:02,327
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.

1061
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:05,385
So you've seen one. So let's go.

1062
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,828
I'll be right back.
l want a better look.

1063
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:12,062
- Mowgli, wait a minute!
- Oh, Baloo.

1064
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:14,065
Let him have a better look.

1065
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,905
Father's hunting in the forest

1066
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:29,499
Mother's cooking in the home

1067
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:33,459
! must go to fetch the water

1068
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:36,843
Till the day that l am grown

1069
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,150
Till 'm grown

1070
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:44,837
Till 'm grown

1071
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:48,888
! must go to fetch the water

1072
01:14:49,452 --> 01:14:53,402
Till the day that l am grown

1073
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:15,027
Then I will have a handsome husband

1074
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,334
And a daughter of my own

1075
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:22,291
And I'll send her to fetch the water

1076
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,662
I'l be cooking in the home

1077
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:37,803
Then I'lf send her to fetch the water

1078
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:41,271
I'l be cooking in my home

1079
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:51,994
- She did that on purpose!
- Obviously.

1080
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:30,705
Mowgli, come back. Come back.

1081
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:33,367
Go on. Go on.

1082
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:00,183
He's hooked.

1083
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,603
It was inevitable, Baloo.

1084
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,732
The boy couldn't help himself.

1085
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:06,864
It was bound to happen.

1086
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:09,239
Mowgli is where he belongs now.

1087
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,320
Yeah.

1088
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,728
I guess you're right.

1089
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:19,865
But I still think
he'd have made one swell bear.

1090
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:23,897
Well, come on, Baggy, buddy.

1091
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,200
Let's get back to where we belong.

1092
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:28,852
And get with the beat.

1093
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:31,795
Look for the bare necessities

1094
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:34,084
The simple bare necessities

1095
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:37,226
Forget about your worries
and your strife

1096
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:41,130
1 mean the bare necessities

1097
01:17:41,557 --> 01:17:43,487
Are Mother Nature's recipes

1098
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:46,726
That bring the bare necessities of life
