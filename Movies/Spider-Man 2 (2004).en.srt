1
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,844
She looks at me every day.

2
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,796
Mary Jane Watson.

3
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,691
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.

4
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,932
But she can never know.

5
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,251
! made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

6
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,955
A life she can never be a part of.

7
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,474
Who am I?

8
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,105
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

9
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,198
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a fob.

10
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,135
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,470
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,463
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,693
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,113
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,008
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,678
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,842
In eight minutes, ! am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

18
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,938
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

19
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,831
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

20
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,231
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

21
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,081
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

22
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,535
This is your last chance.

23
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,117
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 12 minutes or your ass is fired.

24
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,087
Go!

25
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,004
Hey, what, are you stupid?

26
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,915
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

27
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,366
I'm gonna get it!

28
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,217
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

29
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,863
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

30
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,788
See you.

31
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,217
Way to go, Spidey!

32
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,958
Pizza time.

33
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,285
You're late.

34
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm not paying for those.

35
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,240
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
. .
IS a promise, man.

36
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,957
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

37
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,389
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

38
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,014
-You're fired. Go.
-Please, I need this job.

39
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,803
-You're fired.
-Look, give me another chance.

40
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,382
You're fired.

41
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,109
-Parker, hello. You're fired.
-Why?

42
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,810
-Parker, hello. You're fired.
-Why?

43
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,409
Dogs catching Frisbees?

44
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,794
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

45
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,270
-Boss.
-Not now.

46
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,014
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.

47
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,097
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

48
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,659
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
Il pay you-- Still not now!

49
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,417
l pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

50
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,049
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.

51
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,970
A fact I'm very proud of.

52
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,676
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

53
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,173
-It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
-Thanks for the good news.

54
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,763
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

55
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,121
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

56
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,003
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

57
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,751
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

58
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,891
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

59
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,275
-Some food got poisoned?
-I'm a little nauseous.

60
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,362
All right, Mr. Jameson.

61
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,199
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

62
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,121
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

63
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,837
I told you, he's not a menace.

64
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,602
-l told you--
-I'll take care of it.

65
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,394
-I'll give you 150.
-Three hundred.

66
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,152
That's outrageous.

67
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,170
Done. Give this to the girl.

68
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,626
Thank you. Bye-bye.

69
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,537
Hi.

70
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:34,279
Hey, Pete.

71
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,787
I don't think this covers the advance
Il gave you a couple weeks ago.

72
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,284
-Right.
-Sorry.

73
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,891
Hey.

74
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,893
Chin up, okay?

75
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,441
Watch it, jerk!

76
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,988
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

77
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,815
Where were you headed, Parker?

78
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,272
To your class.

79
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,198
My class is over.

80
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,459
See me standing here?

81
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,249
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
l wanna be here.

82
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,143
Then be here.

83
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,972
Look at you, Peter.

84
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,504
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

85
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,758
You always appear exhausted.

86
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,290
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

87
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,372
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

88
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,839
Planning is not a major
at this university.

89
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,242
Octavius is a friend of mine.

90
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,544
Better do your research, Parker.

91
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,980
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

92
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,711
Surprise!

93
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,854
Well, say something.

94
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,306
What's the occasion?

95
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,904
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

96
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,153
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

97
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,840
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

98
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,100
-Hi, MJ.
-Hi.

99
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,029
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

100
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,394
Long time, no see.

101
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,196
So how's the play?
l read a great review.

102
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,266
It's going fine. It's going good.

103
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:49,815
She's brilliant in it.

104
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,486
Harry sent me roses.

105
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,155
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

106
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,542
I've been busy.

107
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,097
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

108
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,411
The less you see of that man,
the better.

109
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,896
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

110
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,550
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

111
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,875
So how are things going at Oscorp?

112
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,820
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

113
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,147
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

114
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,239
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

115
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,127
Thank you.

116
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,895
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

117
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,736
-I'm writing a paper on him.
-You want to meet him?

118
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,271
You'd introduce me?

119
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,370
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

120
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,839
..in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

121
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,929
M.J., could you give me a hand?

122
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,960
She's waiting for you, pal.

123
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,935
What do you mean?

124
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,347
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

125
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,380
However you want to look at it.

126
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,912
I don't have time for girls right now.

127
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,421
Why, are you dead?

128
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,115
I've been kind of busy.

129
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,004
Taking pictures of your friend?

130
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,983
Could we get off that subject?

131
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,229
l want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

132
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,215
Then be honest with me.

133
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,040
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

134
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,247
May.

135
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,015
Oh, what, Ben?

136
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,218
Wait.

137
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,934
-Aunt May.
-Oh, my.

138
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:44,031
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
l thought I was years ago.

139
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,583
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

140
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,825
Did they have a good time?

141
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,551
I'm sure they did.

142
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,944
-You okay?
-Of course. But you go home.

143
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:03,588
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

144
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,900
I'm worried about you.

145
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,832
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

146
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,874
Oh, my. You did?

147
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,887
Oh, well.

148
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,395
So?

149
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,537
I'm a little behind.

150
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,287
Everybody is.

151
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,879
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

152
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,715
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

153
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,061
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

154
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,207
You need it more than I do.

155
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,799
-No, I can't take that from you.
-Yes, you can!

156
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,035
You can take this money from me.

157
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,883
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

158
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,467
And don't you dare leave it here.

159
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,793
Oh, I'm sorry.

160
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,216
It's just that l miss
your uncle Ben so much.

161
00:13:55,702 --> 00:14:00,062
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

162
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,009
I think to myself at times...

163
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,136
.. were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd....

164
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,464
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

165
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,786
Now...

166
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,193
.. you better take
the rest of your cake home.

167
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,577
Hey.

168
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,922
Hey. You're still here.

169
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,592
l saw your billboard on Bleecker.

170
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,964
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

171
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,091
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

172
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,351
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

173
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,431
Oh, boy, yeah.

174
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,918
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

175
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,202
Nothing.

176
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,348
Do you want to say something?

177
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,052


178
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,280
. Was...

179
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,276
.. wondering if you're still
in the Village.

180
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,560
You're such a mystery.

181
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,770
Peter.

182
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,620
What?

183
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,319
Happy birthday.

184
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,150
I'm seeing somebody now.

185
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,132
You mean, like a boyfriend?

186
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,922
Well, like I like him.

187
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,568
What?

188
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,024
Nothing.

189
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,939
That's good, you know?
Companionship....

190
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,438
May be more than that.

191
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,133
More?

192
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,339
I don't know.

193
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,855
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

194
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,761
-You're coming?
-I'll be there.

195
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,485
Don't disappoint me.

196
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,561
I won't.

197
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,364
Rent.

198
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,809
-Hi.
-Hi. What's "hi"?

199
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,539
Can I spend it?

200
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:30,184
l have a paycheck due this week
and--

201
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,570
-You're a month late again. Again.
-l promise as soon as--

202
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,153
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

203
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,093
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All l got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.

204
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,622
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

205
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:49,441
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

206
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,154
-Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
-Hi, Pete.

207
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,780
Hello?

208
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,849
Rent?

209
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,189
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

210
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:03,065
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

211
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,266
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

212
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,221
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

213
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,843
Who do we have here?

214
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,548
This is my good friend
I called you about.

215
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,389
He got me through
high-school science.

216
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,361
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for--

217
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,255
I know what you're doing here...

218
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,516
.. but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

219
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,400
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

220
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,902
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

221
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,261
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

222
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:32,900
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

223
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,472
Interesting fellow, your friend.

224
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,834
l won't take much of your time.

225
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,962
Now I remember you. You're Connors’
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

226
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,127
He also tells me you're lazy.

227
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,441
I'm trying to do better.

228
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,975
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

229
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,593
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

230
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,003
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

231
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,628
You want to try it back there?

232
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,097
So is that it?

233
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:07,245
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

234
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,857
l understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

235
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,483
Sympathetic frequencies.

236
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,558
Harmonic reinforcement?

237
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,801
Go on.

238
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,643
An exponential increase
in energy output.

239
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,592
A huge amount of energy.

240
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:26,752
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

241
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,203
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

242
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,750
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

243
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,374
This is my life's work.

244
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,812
l certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

245
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,269
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

246
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,748
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

247
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,955
You can sleep soundly tonight.

248
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,834
Otto's done his homework.

249
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,906
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

250
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,735
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

251
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,024
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

252
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,831
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

253
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,132
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

254
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,399
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

255
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,208
Rosie, I love this boy.

256
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,007
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

257
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,970
Well...

258
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,413
I don't really know.

259
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,434
Well, shouldn't you know?
Il mean, who would know?

260
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,761
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

261
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,951
Love should never be a secret.

262
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,158
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

263
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,813
..gonna make you sick.

264
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,166
I finally got lucky in love.

265
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,818
We both did.

266
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,259
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

267
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,163
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

268
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,727
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

269
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:51,024
That's right. 1 was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

270
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,827
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

271
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,084
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

272
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,499
-Yes, you do.
-I'm serious.

273
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,944
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

274
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,515
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

275
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,408
Poetry.

276
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,145
Never fails.

277
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,348
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie

278
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,058
Brightest green were all her garments

279
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,493
And her hair was like the sunshine

280
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,676
Day by day he gazed upon her

281
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,513
Rent!

282
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,160
Where is my money?!

283
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,060
You seem jittery tonight.

284
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,082
You never know who's coming.

285
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,196
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

286
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,000
How'd you do that?

287
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,138
Work out, plenty of rest.

288
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,283
You know, eat your green vegetables.

289
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:47,573
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

290
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:51,979
Come on. Go.

291
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,297
Keep it steady.

292
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,281
It's a web.

293
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,040
Go, Spidey, go!

294
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,406
We got trouble!

295
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,980
Get me down!

296
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,306
lam more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

297
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,809
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

298
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,198
Then you think we should
forgive them?

299
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,884
Yes.

300
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,902
I mean, no.

301
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:17,062
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

302
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,419
Whatever.

303
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,571
Shoelace.

304
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,810
You might want to....

305
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,959
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, I've come to see the show.

306
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,001
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

307
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,780
It helps maintain the illusion.

308
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,333
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

309
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,274
But not to come late.

310
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,914
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the--

311
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,877
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man

312
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,997
A-does whatever a spider can

313
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,147
A-spins a web, any size

314
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,843
Catches thieves a-just like flies

315
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:27,086
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

316
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,498
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

317
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,271
Yeah, I'm sure.

318
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:49,266
-Okay. Call me.
-I will.

319
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,185
-You were great tonight.
-Thanks.

320
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,145
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

321
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,003
What are you doing here?

322
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,309
You hungry?

323
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:16,644
Starved.

324
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,196
What was that?

325
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,365
Okay.

326
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,503
Cool Spidey outfit.

327
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,613
Thanks.

328
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:02,997
Where'd you get it?

329
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,545
I made it.

330
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,171
Looks uncomfortable.

331
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,514
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

332
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,773
And it rides up in the crotch
a little bit too.

333
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,937
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

334
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,224
Hi, M.J.

335
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,589
This is Peter.

336
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,038
l was on my way to your show and....

337
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,752
Well, was on my bike...

338
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,448
Are you there?

339
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,876
really was planning on it all day.

340
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,893
And...

341
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,423
.. 1 know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

342
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,479
Bingo.

343
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,225
It's amazing, isn't it?

344
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,894
How complicated a simple thing...

345
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,982
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.

346
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,799
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

347
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,741
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

348
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,521
Your time has expired.

349
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,686
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

350
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,770
l wanna tell you the truth.

351
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,381
Here it is.

352
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,010
I'm Spider-Man.

353
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:35,526
Weird, huh?

354
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,698
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

355
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:45,106
If my enemies found out about you...

356
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,342
. if you got hurt,
l could never forgive myself.

357
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,272
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

358
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,303
Ladies and gentlemen...

359
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,992
..my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

360
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,086
But first, before we start...

361
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:23,244
..has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

362
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,532
Because we found the rubber band.

363
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,642
It's a terrible joke.

364
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,540
But thank you for coming.

365
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,229
Today...

366
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,524
.. you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

367
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,892
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

368
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,781
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

369
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,332
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

370
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,999
..for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

371
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,856
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

372
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:55,942
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

373
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,752
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

374
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,831
.. allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

375
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,989
..in an environment
no human hand could enter.

376
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,692
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

377
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,601
.. 1S as advanced as you suggest...

378
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,890
.. couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

379
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,359
How right you are.

380
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,427
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

381
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,003
...to protect
my higher brain function.

382
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:24,428
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

383
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,297
And now on to the main event.

384
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,359
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

385
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,650
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

386
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,001
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

387
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:00,748
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

388
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,069
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

389
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,438
Ladies and gentlemen...

390
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,889
.. fasten your seat belts.

391
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,076
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

392
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,109
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

393
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:53,843
Thank you.

394
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,845
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

395
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,261
The power of the sun...

396
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:08,031
..in the palm of my hand.

397
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,151
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

398
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,223
It'll soon stabilize!

399
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

400
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,009
We have a containment breach!

401
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,761
Otto, please get back!

402
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,410
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

403
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,400
It will stabilize! It's under control!

404
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,535
I'm in charge here!

405
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,417
It's my money! I'm in con--

406
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,171
This doesn't change anything.

407
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,879
-What are you doing?
-Pulling the plug.

408
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,580
No!

409
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,113
Rosie!

410
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,065
Watch it.

411
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,400
That was too close.

412
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,255
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

413
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,431
I'm ruined.

414
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,441
l have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

415
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,403
He saved your life, sir.

416
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,185
He humiliated me by touching me.

417
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,945
The press will be here soon.
l suggest we move on.

418
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,107
What was he doing here anyway?

419
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,882
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

420
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,198
..and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

421
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,907
.. including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

422
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,237
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

423
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:07,279
l suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

424
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,942
..and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

425
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,218
.. With posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

426
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,092
We're ready, doctor.

427
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,123
Anybody here take shop class?

428
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,151
Help me! Help me!

429
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:19,631
No!

430
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:13,976
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

431
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,362
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

432
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,250
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

433
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,360
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

434
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:27,431
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

435
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,222
Hoffman!

436
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,579
What are we gonna call this guy?

437
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,007
-"Dr. Octopus."
-That's crap.

438
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,816
-"Science Squid"?
-Crap!

439
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,037
-"Dr. Strange."
-That's pretty good.

440
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:43,743
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

441
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,459
-I like it.
-Of course you do.

442
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,131
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

443
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,478
-Genius.
-What, are you looking for a raise?

444
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,400
Get out.

445
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,416
Chief, found Parker.

446
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:58,751
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

447
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,163
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

448
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,832
l heard Spider-Man was there.

449
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,332
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

450
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,037
Chief, the planetarium party.

451
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,836
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

452
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,504
What do you know
about high society?

453
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,973
-Oh. Well, I--
-Don't answer that.

454
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,345
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

455
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,665
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

456
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,589
Could you pay me in advance?

457
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,086
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

458
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:36,909
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

459
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,870
My Rosie's dead.

460
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:57,807
My dream is dead.

461
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,832
And these...

462
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,026
.. monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

463
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:12,479
.. along with me.

464
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:23,046
Something...

465
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,055
..in my head.

466
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,284
Something talking.

467
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,839
The inhibitor chip!

468
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,801
Gone.

469
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:47,907
Rebuild.

470
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,904
No.

471
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:55,484
Peter was right.

472
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,412
I miscalculated.

473
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,044
l couldn't have miscalculated.

474
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,130
It was working, wasn't it?

475
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,444
Yes.

476
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:21,306
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

477
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,892
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

478
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,542
But we need money.

479
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:29,846
Steal it?

480
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,794
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

481
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:35,635
That's right.

482
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,688
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

483
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,125
We'll do it here.

484
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,973
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

485
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,888
Nothing will stand in our way.

486
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:54,454
Nothing!

487
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,307
-That's the social security.
-Yes, l see.

488
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:04,424
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

489
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,839
Yes, but I'm afraid...

490
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,981
. it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

491
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:13,758
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

492
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:15,444
You are?

493
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:23,665
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

494
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,411
..a new supersaver account
with us today.

495
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,094
But the fact is...

496
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:32,131
.. you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

497
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,781
Well...

498
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,259
At least we get the toaster.

499
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:42,162
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

500
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,819
Oh, yes, I see.

501
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,856
Okay.

502
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:54,947
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

503
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,596
Peter?

504
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,306
Don't leave me.

505
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,476
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

506
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,384
Hold it!

507
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,737
Put your arms up! All of them!

508
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,406
Here's your change!

509
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:01,968
Oh, no. Come on!

510
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,353
-You're getting on my nerves.
-l have a knack for that.

511
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,218
Not anymore.

512
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:50,833
-Freeze! Don't move!
-Freeze!

513
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,482
-Hold your fire!
-Don't follow me.

514
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:02,211
Wait a second.

515
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,144
-Hand her over.
-Of course.

516
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,270
Easy, now.

517
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,560
Butterfingers.

518
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,254
Look out!

519
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,307
Help me!

520
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,921
-Help me!
-I'm coming!

521
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,152
Hang on!

522
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,379
Help!

523
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,917
Thank you.

524
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,471
Aunt May.

525
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,396
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

526
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,730
Now you'll have this woman's death
.
on your conscience.

527
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,038
Come on.

528
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,060
Shame on you.

529
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,174
There you go.

530
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,223
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

531
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:41,991
We sure showed him.

532
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,906
What do you mean, "we"?

533
00:52:48,232 --> 00:52:50,252
-Take me with you, Spider-Man.
-Take me.

534
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:20,312
-May I?
-Sure. Go ahead.

535
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,302
Penny! Over here!

536
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,299
Leave it.

537
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,731
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

538
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,324
Why? It's a party.

539
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,225
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

540
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,739
..who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

541
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,009
Not to mention your friend the bug.

542
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,890
Not tonight, Harry.

543
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:52,183
Every night!
Until l find him, it's 24-7.

544
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,363
Parker!

545
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,315
Parker!

546
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,757
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

547
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,970
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

548
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,156
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

549
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,942
Beautiful tie.

550
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,203
Get a shot of us with the DA.

551
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,152
Beautiful dress.

552
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,178
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

553
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,245
Wife.

554
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,415
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

555
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,681
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

556
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,124
.. 18 pleased to present
our guest of honor.

557
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,870
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

558
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:34,151
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

559
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:36,345
. Captain John Jameson.

560
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:22,545
Hi.

561
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,055
-You.
-Listen, I'm sorry.

562
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,465
But there was a disturbance.

563
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,204
I don't know you.

564
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,811
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

565
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:40,573
I've been reading poetry lately.

566
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,241
Whatever that means.

567
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,966
Day by day he gazed upon her

568
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:49,263
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day--

569
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,390
Don't start.

570
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,523
Can I get you a drink?

571
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,545
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

572
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,977
John.

573
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:02,783
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

574
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:06,003
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

575
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,776
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

576
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:10,283
Even my father.

577
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:14,035
He came backstage to borrow cash.

578
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:19,883
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

579
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,413
..can't make an 8:00 curtain.

580
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,841
After all these years...

581
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:29,474
.. he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

582
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,281
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

583
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:01,822
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

584
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,102
-Take it easy.
-Don't push me.

585
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:06,158
Don't act like you're my friend.

586
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,920
You stole M.J. from me.

587
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,189
You stole my father's love.

588
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:16,522
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

589
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,268
Huh? Isn't that right?

590
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,314
Huh, brother?

591
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,913
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

592
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,890
.. that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

593
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,234
What a surprise.

594
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:56,116
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

595
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,493
Oh, no. No!

596
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,850
Why is this happening to me?

597
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:08,133
You seem very okay to me.

598
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,279
My diagnosis?

599
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,241
It's up here.

600
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:18,688
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

601
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,747
There is one dream where...

602
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,823
..in my dream...

603
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:27,296
.l'm Spider-Man.

604
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,771
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

605
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,442
So you're Spider-Man.

606
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:38,966
In my dream.

607
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:43,049
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

608
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,319
Somebody else's dream.

609
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:54,982
What about this friend?

610
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:58,221
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

611
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,682
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

612
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:07,033
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

613
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,244
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

614
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,590
Listen...

615
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:16,512
.. Maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

616
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:18,987
That's why you keep falling.

617
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:23,308
You always have a choice, Peter.

618
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,235
Il have a choice.

619
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,190
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...

620
01:01:40,664 --> 01:01:41,974
..make me sad.

621
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,299
Can't you understand?

622
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:48,296
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

623
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:52,096
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

624
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:55,393
.. fairness, justice...

625
01:01:56,479 --> 01:02:00,669
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

626
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,851
..to take those dreams
out into the world.

627
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:08,732
I can't live your dreams anymore.

628
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,833
l want a life of my own.

629
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,035
You've been given a gift, Peter.

630
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:18,254
With great power
comes great responsibility.

631
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,960
Take my hand, son.

632
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:39,875
No, Uncle Ben.

633
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,087
I'm just Peter Parker.

634
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,591
I'm Spider-Man...

635
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:50,095
..Mo more.

636
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,604
No more.

637
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:02,374
No more.

638
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,404
-You punk!
-Sorry.

639
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:36,074
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

640
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,850
Hurry up!

641
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:57,871
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

642
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:00,045
Someone, please?

643
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,395
.23 electron volts.

644
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:12,442
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

645
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:23,584
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

646
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,075
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

647
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:29,076
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

648
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:31,289
.. in a very inexcusable manner.

649
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,531
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

650
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,910
.. pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

651
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,014
That would be hypocrisy.

652
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,320
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

653
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:49,845
"Lam glad."

654
01:05:50,747 --> 01:05:52,477
"Lam glad."

655
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:54,578
"Lam glad."

656
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,493
Are you glad to hear it?

657
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,113
lam glad...

658
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:04,895
..to hear it.

659
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:06,598
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

660
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,230
.. [ have been very bad
in my own small way.

661
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:15,212
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

662
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:17,488
You could've told me
.
you were coming.

663
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,064
l was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

664
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,450
You look different.

665
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:30,776
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

666
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:33,191
I do my homework now.

667
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:37,165
You wanna get some chow mein?

668
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:38,837
Peter...

669
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,825
.. I'm getting married.

670
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,402
l always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

671
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,512
And who's the groom?

672
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,544
You hadn't decided yet.

673
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:57,087
You think just because
you saw my play...

674
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,670
.. you can talk me out
of getting married?

675
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,996
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

676
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,650
There was something I thought
l had to do. I don't have to.

677
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,919
You're too late.

678
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:11,366
Will you think about it?

679
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:12,951
Think about what?

680
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,013
Picking up where we left off.

681
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,511
Where was that?

682
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,110
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

683
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:20,846
I don't think it's that simple.

684
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:23,134
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

685
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,033
You don't understand.

686
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:27,895
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

687
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:29,968
I'm different.

688
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:32,397
Punch me, I bleed.

689
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,286
Il have to go.

690
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,461
I'm getting married in a church.

691
01:07:58,508 --> 01:07:59,908
You are different.

692
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:17,741
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

693
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:21,135
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

694
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,258
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

695
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,666
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

696
01:08:28,203 --> 01:08:31,243
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

697
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,050
Where the hell did you get that?

698
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,816
In the garbage.

699
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,346
In the garbage?

700
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,096
He must've given up.

701
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:47,776
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

702
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,035
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

703
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:56,812
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

704
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:00,223
-Give you 50 bucks.
-l could get more than that on eBay.

705
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:03,397
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

706
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,323
Your wife is still on that line.

707
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,507
Flowers? How much?

708
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:13,162
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

709
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:14,883
Get plastic.

710
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,492
Gotta go, big story.

711
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:31,755
Spider-Man
Spider-Man

712
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,931
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

713
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:38,368
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

714
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,302
Come on, man. Get the money.

715
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,926
Come on, come on.

716
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:55,857
Help!

717
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,046
Come on!

718
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:09,717
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

719
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,009
He was a peaceful man.

720
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,240
And it was all my doing.

721
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:52,308
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

722
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,795
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

723
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:58,130
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

724
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:00,524
..and he wanted to drive you.

725
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,397
If only [ had stopped him.

726
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,010
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

727
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,442
I'm responsible.

728
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:29,601
For what?

729
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,807
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

730
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:35,216
But you were at the library.

731
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,355
You were doing your homework.

732
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,597
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

733
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:43,187
What do you mean?

734
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,540
l went someplace else.

735
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,665
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

736
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:52,666
.. to buy a car, because I wanted...

737
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,883
.. to impress Mary Jane.

738
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,997
It happened so fast.

739
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:04,784
Il won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

740
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,029
The thief...

741
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:10,955
..Was running towards me.

742
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:15,184
l could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

743
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,592
..fevenge.

744
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:21,169
Il let him go.

745
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:25,885
Il let him get away.

746
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,541
He wanted a car.

747
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,013
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

748
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,330
Uncle Ben said no...

749
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:44,191
..and then he shot him.

750
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:51,230
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

751
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,058
.. for being the only one
who did the right thing.

752
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:00,839
And l....

753
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:06,097
I held his hand...

754
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,359
..when he died.

755
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,805
I've tried to tell you so many times.

756
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,791
Just one more little chore.

757
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:26,804
Where are you?

758
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:32,565
-I'm leaving for the night, sir.
-Fine.

759
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,482
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

760
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:37,415
Good night, Bernard.

761
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,143
Hello, Harry.

762
01:15:32,428 --> 01:15:34,358
Otto. What do you want?

763
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:36,587
That precious tritium.

764
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,190
But I need more of it this time.

765
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:44,683
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

766
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,840
Hey! Hey!

767
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,873
Stop! Stop! All right!

768
01:15:54,617 --> 01:15:57,957
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

769
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:11,170
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

770
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:15,865
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

771
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:17,552
How do I find him?

772
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,445
-Peter Parker.
-Parker?

773
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,946
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

774
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:24,579
Make him tell you where he is.

775
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:31,813
Have it ready.

776
01:16:35,658 --> 01:16:37,088
Don't hurt Peter!

777
01:16:50,506 --> 01:16:52,726
Somebody, help!

778
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:55,269
Fire!

779
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,228
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

780
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,294
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

781
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:13,387
-Help!
-ls anybody in that building?

782
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:16,166
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

783
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:18,188
Hey, where you going?!

784
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:40,865
I'm coming!

785
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:07,971
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

786
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,730
Come on. Come on.

787
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,997
Mama.

788
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,551
You got some guts, kid.

789
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:30,979
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

790
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,137
Oh, man.

791
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:39,228
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

792
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,205
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

793
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:52,027
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

794
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:54,621
What I need?

795
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:59,339
What am I supposed to do?

796
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:07,628
I shouldn't have without...

797
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:09,554
.. knocking.

798
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:15,836
Come in.

799
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,191
-Hi.
-Hi.

800
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,410
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

801
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:30,955
Okay.

802
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:34,178
And a glass of milk?

803
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:38,926
That would be nice.

804
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,910
Okay.

805
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,965
Thank you.

806
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,288
You got a message.

807
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,004
It's your aunt.

808
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:15,916
Thanks.

809
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:33,297
What's going on?

810
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:36,992
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

811
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:40,843
I'm moving on.
l found a small apartment.

812
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:42,807
Why didn't you tell me?

813
01:21:43,165 --> 01:21:46,005
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

814
01:21:46,535 --> 01:21:49,605
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

815
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,434
..and I'm giving him $5.

816
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,200
That's Henry Jackson?

817
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:55,953
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

818
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:59,548
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

819
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:04,300
Listen, about my last visit...

820
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,110
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

821
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:11,593
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

822
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:18,934
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

823
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,271
And I'm proud of you.

824
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:24,727
And I thank you, and I....

825
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,295
I love you, Peter.

826
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:32,025
So very, very much.

827
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,363
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

828
01:22:55,037 --> 01:22:57,647
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

829
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,819
-I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
-Thank you, Henry.

830
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:05,606
-Hi, Peter.
-Hey, Henry.

831
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,228
You're getting tall.

832
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:11,119
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

833
01:23:11,787 --> 01:23:14,627
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

834
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,021
l used to.

835
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,376
Where is he?

836
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:22,580
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

837
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:26,293
He...

838
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,849
-...quit.
-Why?

839
01:23:32,074 --> 01:23:33,594
Wanted to try other things.

840
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,399
He'll be back, right?

841
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,062
I don't know.

842
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:42,211
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

843
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:44,545
Spider-Man.

844
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:48,333
-Why?
-He knows a hero when he sees one.

845
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:52,284
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

846
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,808
.. saving old girls like me.

847
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:58,567
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

848
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:01,721
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

849
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:04,224
.. setting examples for all of us.

850
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:07,063
Everybody loves a hero.

851
01:24:07,643 --> 01:24:10,713
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

852
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,910
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

853
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:17,104
.. Just to get a glimpse of the one...

854
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,582
..who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

855
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:25,101
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

856
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:27,938
.. that keeps us honest...

857
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,160
.. gives us strength...

858
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,402
.. makes us noble...

859
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:36,892
..and finally allows us to die
with pride.

860
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:42,073
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

861
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:45,174
..and give up the thing
we want the most.

862
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:49,016
Even our dreams.

863
01:24:51,153 --> 01:24:53,433
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

864
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,169
..and he wonders where he's gone.

865
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,202
He needs him.

866
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:08,039
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

867
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:11,036
But don't strain yourself.

868
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,929
Okay.

869
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:33,807
Strong focus on what ! want.

870
01:26:04,126 --> 01:26:05,416
I'm back!

871
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:07,037
I'm back!

872
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:26,023
My back.

873
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:28,289
My back.

874
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:56,507
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

875
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:58,559
Peter Parker?

876
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,066
Positive.

877
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:03,437
Thought he was your pal.

878
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,041
-Peter Parker?
-Yeah.

879
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:09,445
He's just a great big jerk.

880
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:11,795
The world's full of great big jerks.

881
01:27:13,462 --> 01:27:15,042
You're adorable.

882
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:17,057
It's just the uniform.

883
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:22,345
Lean your head back for me.

884
01:27:23,038 --> 01:27:25,088
-Put my head back?
-Yeah, just do it.

885
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:28,929
Just put my head back?

886
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,175
Okay.

887
01:27:50,499 --> 01:27:51,869
Wow.

888
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:54,281
I'm back on the moon.

889
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:00,471
You up there with me?

890
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,333
-Hiya.
-Surprised?

891
01:28:23,732 --> 01:28:25,102
Very.

892
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:26,897
Thanks for coming.

893
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:29,098
Everything okay?

894
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:31,888
You might say so.

895
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:36,718
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

896
01:28:39,548 --> 01:28:41,888
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

897
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:46,044
-Tell me about it.
-Well, mine did a real number on me.

898
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:51,320
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

899
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:55,080
.. that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

900
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,181
l was afraid to trust you.

901
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,798
But I've been thinking about it--

902
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,588
Listen, there's more for me to say.

903
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:14,242
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought--

904
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,272
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

905
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,963
I'm saying...

906
01:29:26,328 --> 01:29:28,958
l thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

907
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:31,138
.. but I can't.

908
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:37,663
My mind was playing tricks too.

909
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:44,987
Do you love me, or not?

910
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:53,844


911
01:29:57,259 --> 01:29:58,309
.. don't.

912
01:30:03,365 --> 01:30:05,094
You don't.

913
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:15,976
Kiss me.

914
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,509
Kiss you?

915
01:30:20,015 --> 01:30:21,505
I need to know something.

916
01:30:24,386 --> 01:30:25,846
Just one kiss.

917
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:15,034
What's happening?

918
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,969
Peter Parker...

919
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:29,423
..and the girlfriend.

920
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:31,791
What do you want?

921
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,769
l want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

922
01:31:37,192 --> 01:31:39,412
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

923
01:31:40,028 --> 01:31:41,898
I don't know where he is.

924
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:45,001
Find him.

925
01:31:47,469 --> 01:31:49,989
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

926
01:31:50,472 --> 01:31:52,251
If you lay one finger on her...

927
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,900
You'll do what?

928
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:10,992
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

929
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:13,049
Sorry, Jonah.

930
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:15,582
It's all my fault.

931
01:33:17,559 --> 01:33:19,699
I drove Spider-Man away.

932
01:33:20,228 --> 01:33:22,978
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

933
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:25,999
Yes.

934
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:30,655
Spider-Man was a hero.

935
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,990
I just couldn't see it.

936
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:37,033
He was a--

937
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:39,748
A thief! A criminal!

938
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:43,692
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

939
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:46,779
l want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

940
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,128
I want him strung up by his web!

941
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:53,212
I want Spider-Man!

942
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:23,230
Where is she?

943
01:34:23,525 --> 01:34:25,894
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

944
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:18,428
What the hell?

945
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:25,381
You have a train to catch.

946
01:37:28,242 --> 01:37:29,822
Help!

947
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:33,991
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

948
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:55,508
-It's Spider-Man.
-Oh, my God, this is it!

949
01:37:56,104 --> 01:37:57,364
Tell everyone to hang on!

950
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,255
Brace yourselves!

951
01:38:20,628 --> 01:38:22,768
Any more bright ideas?

952
01:38:23,364 --> 01:38:25,384
I got a few, yeah!

953
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:48,551
Whoa, watch out!

954
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:20,534
We're slowing down.

955
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:26,915
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

956
01:40:28,155 --> 01:40:29,415
Slower. Gently.

957
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:36,055
Is he alive?

958
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:41,084
He's...

959
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:42,829
Just a kid.

960
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:45,815
No older than my son.

961
01:41:05,326 --> 01:41:06,936
It's all right.

962
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:13,142
We found something.

963
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:24,460
We won't tell nobody.

964
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:40,739
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

965
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:02,538
He's mine!

966
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:06,014
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

967
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:07,911
And me.

968
01:42:08,589 --> 01:42:09,879
Me too.

969
01:42:14,996 --> 01:42:16,286
Very well.

970
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:47,223
Where do you want him?

971
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:56,531
And the tritium?

972
01:43:11,285 --> 01:43:12,514
Yes.

973
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:45,376
If only could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

974
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:50,835
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

975
01:43:51,292 --> 01:43:53,372
I can look into your eyes as you die.

976
01:43:56,497 --> 01:43:57,897
Pete.

977
01:43:58,399 --> 01:43:59,949
No.

978
01:44:00,668 --> 01:44:01,978
It can't be.

979
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:09,871
Harry.

980
01:44:11,479 --> 01:44:14,579
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

981
01:44:16,283 --> 01:44:19,793
-He's got M.J.
-No. All he wanted was the tritium.

982
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:22,138
Tritium?

983
01:44:24,291 --> 01:44:26,041
He's making the machine again.

984
01:44:27,161 --> 01:44:30,851
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

985
01:44:31,532 --> 01:44:33,992
-Now, where is he?
-Peter...

986
01:44:35,469 --> 01:44:37,109
.. you killed my father.

987
01:44:42,476 --> 01:44:46,045
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

988
01:44:47,314 --> 01:44:49,774
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

989
01:45:00,661 --> 01:45:02,181
Hey!

990
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:04,954
Hey!

991
01:45:06,534 --> 01:45:08,114
I'm talking to you!

992
01:45:08,602 --> 01:45:11,732
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

993
01:45:12,339 --> 01:45:13,979
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

994
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:16,655
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

995
01:45:17,778 --> 01:45:19,118
He's not dead.

996
01:45:19,547 --> 01:45:21,887
-I don't believe you.
-Believe it.

997
01:45:40,034 --> 01:45:41,174
Surprise.

998
01:45:45,706 --> 01:45:47,166
As soon as you get free--

999
01:45:49,543 --> 01:45:53,003
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1000
01:45:53,614 --> 01:45:56,273
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1001
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:59,007
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1002
01:46:00,421 --> 01:46:02,061
Well, I'm not.

1003
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:35,925
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1004
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:53,122
Run!

1005
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:19,871
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1006
01:47:44,058 --> 01:47:45,988
Now what?

1007
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:18,163
Dr. Octavius.

1008
01:48:21,628 --> 01:48:22,648
We have to shut it down.

1009
01:48:23,664 --> 01:48:25,094
Please tell me how.

1010
01:48:25,466 --> 01:48:26,806
Peter Parker?

1011
01:48:30,471 --> 01:48:32,250
"Brilliant but lazy."

1012
01:48:32,773 --> 01:48:34,083
Look at what's happening.

1013
01:48:35,275 --> 01:48:36,915
We must destroy it.

1014
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:44,143
Il can't destroy it.

1015
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:50,850
I won't.

1016
01:48:56,497 --> 01:48:58,397
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1017
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:03,877
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1018
01:49:06,073 --> 01:49:07,243
A privilege.

1019
01:49:08,142 --> 01:49:10,802
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1020
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:13,852
Don't listen to them.

1021
01:49:19,987 --> 01:49:21,277
It was my dream.

1022
01:49:21,622 --> 01:49:25,632
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1023
01:49:26,326 --> 01:49:28,466
..and give up the thing
we want the most.

1024
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:31,120
Even our dreams.

1025
01:49:37,371 --> 01:49:38,831
You're right.

1026
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:48,020
He's right.

1027
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:51,360
Listen.

1028
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,800
Listen to me now.

1029
01:49:59,026 --> 01:50:01,016
Listen to me now.

1030
01:50:05,065 --> 01:50:07,674
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1031
01:50:09,136 --> 01:50:10,476
It can't be stopped.

1032
01:50:12,206 --> 01:50:13,956
It's self-sustaining now.

1033
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:16,218
-Think!
-Unless....

1034
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:19,508
The river.

1035
01:50:21,181 --> 01:50:22,491
Drown it.

1036
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:25,911
I'll do it.

1037
01:51:11,365 --> 01:51:13,825
No!

1038
01:51:26,146 --> 01:51:27,456
Hi.

1039
01:51:28,382 --> 01:51:29,842
Hi.

1040
01:51:30,751 --> 01:51:32,091
This is really heavy.

1041
01:51:56,777 --> 01:51:58,477
M.J.

1042
01:52:01,582 --> 01:52:03,012
You do love me.

1043
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:04,887
Ido.

1044
01:52:06,053 --> 01:52:07,863
Even though you said you didn't.

1045
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:13,168
I will not die a monster.

1046
01:53:18,659 --> 01:53:20,438
I think I always knew...

1047
01:53:21,762 --> 01:53:23,251
.all this time...

1048
01:53:24,598 --> 01:53:26,208
..who you really were.

1049
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:29,270
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1050
01:53:30,737 --> 01:53:33,287
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1051
01:53:35,575 --> 01:53:37,974
I can't let you take that risk.

1052
01:53:43,083 --> 01:53:44,223
I will...

1053
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:48,049
.. always be Spider-Man.

1054
01:53:51,124 --> 01:53:53,174
You and I can never be.

1055
01:54:41,775 --> 01:54:43,525
Mary Jane!

1056
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,380
Hello?

1057
01:56:04,591 --> 01:56:05,851
Who's that?

1058
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:07,888
Son.

1059
01:56:09,196 --> 01:56:10,336
I'm here.

1060
01:56:11,765 --> 01:56:13,255
Dad?

1061
01:56:14,534 --> 01:56:16,404
-l thought you were--
-No.

1062
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:19,080
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1063
01:56:19,506 --> 01:56:20,556
Now it's your turn.

1064
01:56:22,342 --> 01:56:24,682
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1065
01:56:25,345 --> 01:56:26,835
Now make him pay.

1066
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:28,971
But Pete's my best friend.

1067
01:56:29,382 --> 01:56:30,611
And I'm your father.

1068
01:56:31,785 --> 01:56:33,125
You're weak.

1069
01:56:34,321 --> 01:56:38,101
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1070
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:42,179
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1071
01:56:43,497 --> 01:56:44,867
Be strong, Harry.

1072
01:56:46,099 --> 01:56:47,269
Avenge me.

1073
01:56:50,303 --> 01:56:52,083
-Avenge me!
-No!

1074
01:59:17,017 --> 01:59:18,187
Call Deborah.

1075
01:59:18,485 --> 01:59:20,125
The caterer?

1076
01:59:21,354 --> 01:59:23,164
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1077
02:00:04,764 --> 02:00:06,784
Had to do what I had to do.

1078
02:00:08,635 --> 02:00:09,895
Mary Jane.

1079
02:00:11,204 --> 02:00:12,284
Peter.

1080
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:15,860
l can't survive without you.

1081
02:00:26,152 --> 02:00:27,792
You shouldn't be here.

1082
02:00:29,122 --> 02:00:31,782
I know you think we can't be together.

1083
02:00:33,259 --> 02:00:36,359
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1084
02:00:38,198 --> 02:00:39,838
I know there'll be risks.

1085
02:00:40,767 --> 02:00:43,077
But I want to face them with you.

1086
02:00:44,537 --> 02:00:47,607
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1087
02:00:48,174 --> 02:00:49,604
.. half of ourselves.

1088
02:00:52,345 --> 02:00:53,805
Il love you.

1089
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:58,858
So here lam,
standing in your doorway.

1090
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:03,707
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1091
02:01:11,131 --> 02:01:14,151
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1092
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:22,150
Well, say something.

1093
02:01:24,778 --> 02:01:27,028
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1094
02:01:43,530 --> 02:01:45,110
Go get them, tiger.
