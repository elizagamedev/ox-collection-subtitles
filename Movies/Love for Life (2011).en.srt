1
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,340
Once there was a village called Goddess Temple

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,960
high up in the mountains,

3
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Once there was a fever that the world called AIDS.

4
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,190
ft snuck into our village softly,

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,879
and everyone who got it died like falling leaves.

6
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,430
and everyone who got it died like falling leaves.

7
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,509
Look, that's me right there.

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,170
My name was Xin,

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,250
and {was 12,

10
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,878
Look, there's my dad.

11
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,669
Who did

12
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,440
And my uncle.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,750
Who did

14
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,470
ft was weird, seeing myself like that.

15
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,080
And seeing grandpa,

16
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,510
They said it was dad's fault people got sick,

17
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,510
and that Uncle had it coming.

18
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
if fm going to tell our story,t guess it starts from here.

19
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,880
Start?

20
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,840
Start?

21
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,030
Do you want me to start?

22
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
There's a new cure...

23
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,890
to celebrate!

24
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,159
So forgive the singer if his song is poor—

25
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,579
So forgive the singer if his song is poor—

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,650
he wishes you joy and health, longevity!

27
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,460
{hitched a ride upon a cloud

28
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,390
Saw things no mortal sees

29
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,750
leaped from cloud to cloud

30
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,579
At immortal speed

31
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,920
The clouds,they parted

32
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,000
The world appeared before my eyes

33
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,580
To the east,the boundless sea

34
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,740
To the south,the sacred peaks

35
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,199
To the west,the temples fair

36
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,010
To the north,the fragrant springs

37
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,719
And the heavens above...

38
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,559
Yes

39
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,559

Go ahead, ask Old Zhu.

43
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,740
He has

Ask me what?

45

There's a cure for the fever, right?

46
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,639
There's a cure for the fever, right?

47
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,650

48
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,900
You told me yourself,

49
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,479
Sure.

50
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,159
There is!

51
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,000
No there isn't!

52
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,490
Oiquan told me

53
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,560
He's standing right there.

54
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,250
Dad

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,370

56
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,640
They!ll find out, eventually

57
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,620
Knee! down and apologize

58
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,600
{t's the least you can do

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,820
If there's no cure, fet them hear it from you!

60
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,159
Down on your knees!

61
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,820
Down on your knees!

62
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,700
Bow your head.

63
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,270
Bow your head.

64
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,900
Do it!

65
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,890
Grandpa...

66
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,880
My son, the blood merchant...

67
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,720
My son, the blood merchant...

68
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,600
Got blood? Qiquan's your man,

69
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,480
Anytime, anyplace, at a price that's fair!

70
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,470
Grandpa ... we go home

71
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,270
Don't you start, too!

72
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,830
We're going home!

73
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,340
Please forgive me...

74
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,410
for having a son like that.

75
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,630
I raised him,

76
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,630
but I couldn't teach him.

77
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,600
Please remember...

78
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,000
my younger son has the fever, too,

79
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,530
And my grandson was only 12...

80
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,850
Even if it was Qiquan's fault you got infected,

81
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,310
! beg you not to hold it against our family.

82
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,780
Since all the teachers ran off,

83
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,610
and the kids go to school in town,

84
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,500
the school is empty.

85
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,399
If you're afraid of infecting your families,

86
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,870
come five in the school,

87
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,930

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,830
! fied about the medicine.

90
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,800
They say the fever's a new plague,

91
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,070
and nothing in the world

92
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,630
can cure it,

93
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Gee!! Another victim!

94
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
Run run runil!

95
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,170
And that was the last concert

96
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,700
the old musician ever gave.

97
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,300
the old musician ever gave.

98
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
That's our village school

99
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,120
where grandpa was a caretaker.

100
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,280
When the weather got cold,

101
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,390
the sick villagers started moving in.

102
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,360
After ! die,

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,800

104
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,570
and get remarried.

105

Leave this god-awful place,

106
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,840
Dont worry, ff be fine.

107
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,969
Go on home,

108
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,250
But don't forget to visit every day!

109
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,999
Here in the school,

110
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,399
aff meals will be communal.

111
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,430
Who volunteers to cook?

112
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,880
{fF you men are too macho for the kitchen,

113
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,700

114
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,520
But no disrespect.

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,860
We'd respect you more in the bedroom!

116
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,030
Now, now, in this school,

117
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,930
everyone gets treated with respect.

118
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,350

Treat then with the same respect

121
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,800
you'd show your own wife.

122
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Or better yet, someone else's wife!

123
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,120
We'll poo! our food stores,

124
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,310

No one's dying.

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,120

141
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,020
You've had your fill.

Don't be so greedy,

143
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,420
Dad, can you drop in

144
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,390
and check on Haoyan?

145

She trusts you,

146
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,860

not remarrying when I die.

149
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,430
Then {can rest in peace,

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,480
Dont think dark thoughts.

151
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
What's so funny?

152

Hell, look at the artist!

You counting the days?

154
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,650
Every day counts,

155
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,189
if you make every day count.

156
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,199
{t's worth remembering.

157
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,300
Assembly! Assembly in the schoolyard!

158
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,210

Whoever took it,

171
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,810
leave it in the schoolyard tonight.

172
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,349
No questions asked!

You asleep?

175
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,920
Haoyan went back to her mom's.

176
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,640
She hasn't visited in ages.

177
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,180
Ive been counting the days.

178
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,050

You?

194
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,380
Everyone was selling blood,

195
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,770
My brother wouldn't let me,

196
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,070
$0 f sold mine in another village.

197
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,490
I heard he was a cheat.

198
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,710
Took more blood than he paid for.

199
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,100
They stole your jacket.

200
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,750
Why not steal from them?

201
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,500
No, aff a person has is face,

202
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,230
To hell with face.

203
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,590
Did you husband give you any?

204
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,659
When he heard you were sick,

00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,629
he beat you.

206
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,360
Everyone knows.

207
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,879
That's how little he cared,

208
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,000
That's how little he cared,

209
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,230
just enough to hit you,

210
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,919

212
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,320
and never said a word.

213
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,680
Did you infect your wife?

214
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,430
Truth is,

215
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,800
she hasnt touched me in over a year,

216
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,490
not since I was diagnosed.

217
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,530
Think about it...

218
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,780
fm not even 30.

219
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,360
Yeah, same here.

220
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,519
My husband said

221
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,039
! was too filthy to be buried next to him.

222
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,020
! was too filthy to be buried next to him.

223
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,750

231
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,370
Now's not the time.

232

What better time is there?

233
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,279

Don't be scared, Mf help you fix him,

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,030
Is there no justice in this world?

242

Is there no justice in this world?

243
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,330
Is there no justice in this world?

244
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,360
There's no justice.

245
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,149

No.

272
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,030
You searched my bed?

273
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,310
How could you?

How could you be so cruel?

You're heartless!

285
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,100
If your family needed rice that badly,

286
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,399
you should have asked me.

287
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,629

Look!

You took the jacket?

291
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,250
What about my diary?

292
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,340
Have you seen it?

293
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,570
ft has sentimental value.

294
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,270
{t's a red notebook.

295
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,719
{t's a red notebook.

296
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,510
You'd think it was made of gold.

297
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,480
ft's not worth anything, { swear!

298
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,610
Qingin, about your jacket...

299
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,760
Qingin?

300
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,599
Where's my notebook?

301
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,899
Where's my notebook?

302
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,860
Where can it be?

303
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,639
Where can it be?

304
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,670
Where can it be?

305
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,700
Where can it be?

306
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,370
Time to eat!

307
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,320
Still missing your notebook?

308
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,360
Silun!

309
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,270
Aren't you hungry?

310
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,340
Hey, you found it.

311
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,370
Hows Silun?

312
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,630
He's not feeling well.

313
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,310
Not hungry.

314
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,639
Silun was always impatient,

315
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,010
even more so after he lost his diary.

316
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,340
Everyone knows we all die sooner or later.

317
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,570
What was his hurry?

318
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,830
No one would sleep in the school again.

319
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,669
And the next world was even emptier than this one.

320
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,310
Dad!

321
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,550

Im taking Little Jun to visit my mom.

323
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,479
What's the point of having a wife

324
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,810
if you're never even here?

325
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,399

Get your tofu!

331
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,750

00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,100
Hey, you dropped your cigarette.

333
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,020
You dropped your cigarette!

334
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,850
We're better off in the school.

335
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,370
Go tell your dad.

336
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,640
He'll listen to you.

337
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,780
She's right.

338
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,990
Only if Qingin goes with me.

339
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,450
Go ahead, Qingin.

340
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,840

We're alone.

342

Did you miss me?

343
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,110
Didn't you miss me?

344
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,280
! mostly thought about being sick.

345
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,340
There's nothing to live for.

346
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,969
Nothing to live for?

347
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,070

348
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,860

Students reporting for class!

376
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,740
When everyone moved back into the school,

377
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,299
their food attracted the usual scavengers,

378
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,319
Table scraps not good enough for you?

379
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,750

Hey, what's my dad doing here?

383
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,158

Qingin's husband finally kicked her out for good.

523
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,540

Shush!

540
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,500
Wow, real leather!

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,880

544
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,170

Ive been thinking it over.and { wanted to return this.

552
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,150
Someone else might need it.

553
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,240
The truth is,

554
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,720

555
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,430

to borrow Qingin's red silk jacket.

561
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,569
Geda saw his wife wearing it just once before he died.

562
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,799
Dont take anything that isn't yours.

563
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,520

564
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,620
When the time comes,

No one can see us.

569
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,590
