1
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,930
Hello.

2
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,170
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,600
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,200
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,109
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,059
You never know what you're gonna get.

7
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,459
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,010
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

9
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,670
I wish I had shoes like that.

10
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,940
My feet hurt.

11
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,720
Mama always said there's an awful lot

12
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,700
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

13
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,650
where they're going,
where they've been.

14
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,680
I've worn lots of shoes.

15
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,960
I bet if l think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

16
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,530
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

17
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,810
She said they was my magic shoes.

18
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,870
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

19
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,310
Let's take a little walk around.

20
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,630
How do those feel?

21
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,500
His legs are strong, Mrs Gump,

22
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,940
as strong as I've ever seen,

23
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,159
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

24
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,360
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

25
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,780
Forrest!

26
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,370
Now, when I was a baby,

27
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,990
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,

28
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,429
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

29
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,660
She said we was related to him
-
in some way.

30
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,160
And what he did was,

31
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,979
he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.

32
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,370
They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets

33
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,489
and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.

34
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,340
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

35
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,440
And anyway, that's how I got my name,

36
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,070
Forrest Gump.

37
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,790
Mama Said that the Forrest” part

38
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,060
was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,

39
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,910
well, just don’t make no sense.

40
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,630
Okay... Get it, get it...

41
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,610
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

42
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,099
All right...

43
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,239
What are you all staring at?

44
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,280
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

45
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,400
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

46
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,090
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

47
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,270
he'd of given us all braces on our legs.

48
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,830
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

49
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,590
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

50
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,640
about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

51
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
That's in the county of Greenbow.

52
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,520
Our house had been in Mama’s family
since her grandpa’s grandpa’s grandpa

53
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,730
had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,

54
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,650
something like that.

55
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,239
Since it was just me and Mama
and we had ail these empty rooms,

56
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,960
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

57
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,010
mostly to people passing through,

58
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,650
like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

59
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,479
That's how me and Mama got money.

60
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,200
Mama was a real smart lady.

61
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,430
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

62
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

63
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,670
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

64
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,400
Your boy's different, Mrs Gump.

65
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,860
Now, his IQ is 75.

66
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,510
Well, we're all different, Mr Hancock.

67
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,040
She wanted me to have
the finest education,

68
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,660
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

69
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,090
! met the principal and all.

70
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,260
I want to show you something,
Mrs Gump.

71
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,500
Now, this is normal.

72
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,050
Forrest is right here.

73
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,910
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs Gump.

74
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,460
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

75
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,670
Now, he'll be just fine.

76
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,430
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

77
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,599
He might be a bit on the slow side,

78
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,550
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

79
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,979
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

80
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,550
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tyres.

81
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,750
We're talking about
five little points here.

82
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,969
There must be something can be done.

83
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,870
We're a progressive school system.

84
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,419
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

85
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,510
Is there a Mr Gump, Mrs Gump?

86
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,620
He's on vacation.

87
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,790
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

88
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,590
You don't say much, do you?

89
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,569
“Finally, he had to try.

90
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,530
"It looked easy, but,

91
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,880
“oh, what happened.

92
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,770
-"First, there..."
-Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

93
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,810
-Vacation?
-Where Daddy went.

94
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,920
Vacation's when you go somewhere

95
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,480
and you don't ever come back.

96
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,110
Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.

97
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,770
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

98
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,449
There was always folks
coming and going.

99
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,750
Supper.

100
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,840
-It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
-My, my. That sure looks special.

101
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,460
Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us

102
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,090
that every room
was filled with travellers.

103
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,530
You know, folks living out
of their suitcases

104
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,530
and hat cases and sample cases.

105
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,840
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime!
Forrest...

106
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,460
One time, a young man
was staying with us,

107
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,890
and he had him a guitar case.

108
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,090
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

109
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,760
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

110
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,390
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

111
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,290
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

112
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,210
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

113
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,220
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

114
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,300
Slow it down some.

115
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,170
liked that guitar.

116
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,510
It sounded good.

117
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,950
1 started moving around to the music,

118
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,060
swinging my hips.

119
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,900
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,

120
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,810
and we walked right by
Benson’s furniture and appliance store,

121
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,570
and guess what?

122
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,990
This is not for children's eyes.

123
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,270
Some years later,
that handsome young man

124
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,699
who they called "The King,”

125
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,040
well, he’d sung too many songs,

126
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,030
had himself a heart attack,
or something.

127
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,260
Must be hard being a king.

128
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,130
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

129
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,340
-You do your very best now, Forrest.
-I sure will, Mama.

130
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,300
1 remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.

131
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,680
Are you coming along?

132
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,910
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

133
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,220
This is the bus to school.

134
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,210
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

135
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,770
-I'm Dorothy Harris.
-Well, now we ain't strangers any more.

136
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,230
This seat's taken.

137
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,060
It's taken!

138
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,380
You can't sit here.

139
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,560
You know, it’s funny what
a young man recollects,

140
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,900
‘cause I don’t remember being born.

141
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,700
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

142
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,640
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

143
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,050
But I do remember the first time I heard

144
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,069
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

145
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
You can sit here if you want.

146
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,220
! had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

147
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,110
She was like an angel.

148
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,930
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

149
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,510
What's wrong with your legs?

150
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,380
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

151
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,580
just sat next to her on that bus

152
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,670
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

153
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,280
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

154
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,660
These are going to make me...

155
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,880
And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.

156
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,610
Are you stupid or something?

157
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,449
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does.”

158
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,450
-I'm Jenny.
-I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

159
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,060
From that day on,
we was always together.

160
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,750
Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.

161
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,890
She taught me how to climb.

162
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,439
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

163
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,050
! showed her how to dangle.

164
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,160
"...a good little monkey and...”

165
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,620
She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how fo swing.

166
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,600
Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.

167
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,260
-Mama's gonna worry about me.
-Just stay a little longer.

168
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,199
For some reason,
Jenny didn’t never want to go home.

169
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,470
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

170
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,840
She was my most special friend.

171
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,840
My only friend.

172
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,870
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

173
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Some people don't think so, but they do.

174
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,930
Hey, dummy!

175
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,790
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

176
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,070
-"Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.”
-Just run away, Forrest.

177
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,360
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

178
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,540
-Get the bikes!
-Hurry up! Let's get him!

179
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,140
-Come on!
-Look out, dummy, here we come!

180
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,060
We're gonna get you!

181
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,360
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

182
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,050
Come back here, you!

183
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,430
Run, Forrest!

184
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,959
Run!

185
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,569
Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,

186
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,020
but I can run like the wind blows.

187
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,040
From that day on,
if l was going somewhere,

188
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,280
I was running!

189
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
He's getting away! Stop him!

190
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,450
That boy sure is a running fool.

191
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,000
Now, remember how I told you that

192
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,730
Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

193
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,760
Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

194
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,020
Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,

195
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,169
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

196
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,189
Jenny?

197
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,220
He was a very loving man.

198
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,500
He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.

199
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,400
And then this one time,
Jenny wasn’t on the bus to go to school.

200
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,460
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

201
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,600
Daddy's taking a nap.

202
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,360
-Jenny!
-Come on!

203
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,100
Jenny, where'd you run to?

204
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,930
You'd better get back here, girl!

205
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,040
Where you at?

206
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,250
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

207
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,640
Jenny!

208
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,370
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

209
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,780
Jenny!

210
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,700
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

211
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,630
far, far away from here.

212
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,010
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

213
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,460
far, far away from here.

214
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,280
Mama always said
that God is mysterious.

215
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,700
Jenny!

216
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,880
He didn’t turn Jenny into a bird that day.

217
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,150
You'd better get back here!

218
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,620
instead,

219
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,310
he had the police say Jenny didn’t
have to stay in that house no more.

220
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,399
She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

221
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,590
which made me happy,
‘cause she was so close.

222
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,730
Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,

223
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,030
just ‘cause she said she was scared.

224
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,550
Scared of what, I don’t know,

225
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,660
but I think it was her grandma’s dog.

226
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,629
He was a mean dog.

227
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,840
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

228
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,500
all the way up through high school.

229
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,080
-Hey, stupid!
-Quit it!

230
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,330
-Run, Forrest, run!
-Hey,

231
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,510
did you hear me, stupid?

232
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,770
-Run, Forrest!
-Come on, get in the truck!

233
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,790
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

234
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,439
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

235
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,659
Run, Forrest! Run!

236
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,980
-You better be running, stupid!
-Come on, dummy!

237
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,220
-Haul ass, dummy!
-Yeah, you better get running!

238
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,920
Jack rabbit!

239
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,210
Yeah!

240
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,020
Go! Go! Go!

241
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,290
Run, Forrest!

242
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,379
Now, it used to be,
Il ran to get where I was going,

243
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,419
I never thought it would
take me anywhere.

244
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,040
-Who in the hell is that?
-That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

245
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,020
Just a local idiot.

246
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,860
And can you believe it?
! got to go to college, too.

247
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,810
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

248
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,570
-Okay!
-Run!

249
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,820
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

250
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,220
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

251
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,240
No! Turn! Go!

252
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,370
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

253
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,460
but he sure is fast!

254
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,780
Now, maybe it’s just me,
but college was very confusing times.

255
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,290
Federal troops enforcing a court order

256
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,129
integrated the University
of Alabama today.

257
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,570
Two negroes were admitted,

258
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,570
but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat

259
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,340
to stand in the school house door.

260
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,530
Governor Wallace,
] take it from that statement, that...

261
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,880
Earl, what's going on?

262
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,970
-Coons are trying to get into school.
-Coons?

263
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,880
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

264
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,670
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

265
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,750
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

266
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,520
With us? They do?

267
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,780
Shortly after Governor Wallace
had carried out his promise

268
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,170
to block the doorway,

269
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,050
President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defence

270
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,040
then to use military force.

271
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,639
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,

272
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,810
commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.

273
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,399
... because these National Guardsmen
are here today

274
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,060
as federal soldiers for Alabamans.

275
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,740
They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.

276
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,310
We are winning in this fight,

277
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,210
because we are awakening
the American people

278
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,450
to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,

279
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,220
just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.

280
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,350
And so, at day’s end,
the University of Alabama

281
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,650
in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated

282
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,530
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

283
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,560
had been signed up
for summer classes.

284
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,750
Ma’am, you dropped your book.
Ma’‘am...

285
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,290
Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.

286
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,580
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...

287
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,870
Say, wasn't that Gump?

288
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,610
-Nah, that couldn't be.
-It sure as hell was.

289
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,220
A few years lIater, that angry little man

290
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,620
at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea

291
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,820
and ran for president.

292
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,360
But somebody thought that it wasn't.

293
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,960
But he didn't die.

294
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,960
My bus is here.

295
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,510
-ls it the number nine?
-No, it's the number four.

296
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,620
It was nice talking to you.

297
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,160
l remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

298
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,710
I was in college.

299
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,970
Did you go to a girls’ college,

300
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,740
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

301
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,909
It was co-ed.

302
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,399
‘Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

303
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,760
It was a college just for girls.

304
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,790
But I'd go and visit her
every chance ! got.

305
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,830
That hurts.

306
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,379
Forrest! Forrest!

307
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,250
-Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
-Jesus!

308
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,620
What are you doing?

309
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,240
-He was hurting you.
-What the hell is going on here?

310
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,639
-No, he's not! Get over there!
-Who is that? Who is that?

311
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,070
-Billy, I'm sorry.
-What the hell?

312
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,450
-Just get away from me!
-Don't...

313
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,330
-Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
-Get away from me.

314
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,620
He doesn't know any better!

315
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,810
Forrest, why did you do that?

316
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,420
I brought you some chocolate.

317
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,600
I'm sorry.

318
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,650
-I'll go back to my college now.
-Forrest...

319
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,899
Look at you.

320
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,870
Come on. Come on.

321
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,899
Is this your room?

322
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,290
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

323
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,230
about who you're gonna be?

324
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,150
-Who I'm gonna be?
-Yeah.

325
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,020
Aren't I going to be me?

326
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,370
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

327
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,460
You know? I want to be famous.

328
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,830
l want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

329
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,950
I just want to be on an empty stage

330
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,330
with my guitar, my voice.

331
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,550
Just me.

332
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,010
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

333
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,730
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

334
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,780
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

335
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,710
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

336
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,990
-I'm... Sorry.
-It's okay.

337
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,920
It's all right.

338
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,659
-It's okay.
-Oh, I'm dizzy.

339
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,520
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

340
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,460
No.

341
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,230
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

342
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,400
I don't care. I don't like her, anyway.

343
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,230
Run! Run! Run!

344
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,800
-Run! Run! Run!
-Run! Run! Run!

345
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,510
College ran by real fast,
‘cause I played so much football.

346
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,780
They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,

347
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,470
where you get to meet
the President of the United States.

348
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,330
President Kennedy met
with the Collegiate

349
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,580
All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.

350
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,280
Now, the really good thing
about meeting

351
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,790
the President of the United States
is the food.

352
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,600
They put you in this little room
with just about anything

353
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,070
you’d want to eat or drink.

354
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,790
And since, number one,
! wasn't hungry, but thirsty,

355
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,530
and number two, they was free,

356
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,520
1 must have drank me about
15 Dr Peppers.

357
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,510
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

358
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,310
it's an honour, sir.

359
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,350
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

360
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,050
Very good, sir.

361
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,070
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

362
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,910
Very good, sir.

363
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,250
-Congratulations. How do you feel?
-I! gotta pee.

364
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,250
! believe he said he had to "go pee.”

365
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,580
Sometime tater,
for no particular reason,

366
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,030
somebody shot that
nice young President,

367
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,430
when he was riding in his car.

368
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,800
And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,

369
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,149
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

370
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,830
It must be hard being brothers.

371
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,189
I wouldn't know.

372
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,960
Forrest Gump.

373
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,280
Now can you believe it?

374
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,820
After only five years of playing football,
! got a college degree.

375
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,040
Congratulations, son.

376
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,750
Mama was so proud.

377
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,500
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

378
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,830
Congratulations, son.

379
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,690
Have you given any thought
to your future?

380
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,919
Thought?

381
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,060
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

382
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,889
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

383
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,570
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

384
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,260
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

385
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,550
This seat's taken.

386
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,750
Taken.

387
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,070
At first, it seemed like ! made a mistake,

388
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,200
seeing how it was only
my induction day

389
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,840
and I was already getting yelled at.

390
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,010
You can sit down if you want to.

391
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,620
! didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.

392
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,370
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

393
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,180
No, but I been on a real big boat.

394
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,750
I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.

395
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,260
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

396
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,990
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

397
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,150
when I was about maybe nine.

398
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,960
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

399
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,350
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

400
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,649
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

401
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,250
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

402
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,629
So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

403
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,610
and his mama cooked shrimp,

404
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,420
and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,

405
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,370
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

406
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,810
Bubba's family knew everything

407
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,250
there was to know
about the shrimping business.

408
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,200
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

409
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,170
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

410
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,560
after I get out the Army.

411
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,270
Okay.

412
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,080
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

413
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,780
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

414
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,000
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

415
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

416
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,189
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

417
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,090
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

418
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,010
Listen up, people!

419
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,870
Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army
like one of them round pegs.

420
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,490
It’s not really hard.

421
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,770
You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,

422
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,649
and always answer every question
with, “Yes, Drill Sergeant!”

423
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,430
Is that clear?

424
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,260
-Yes, Drill Sergeant!
-Yes, Drill Sergeant!

425
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,970
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

426
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,600
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

427
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,000
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

428
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,760
less what you spend on gas, you can...

429
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,480
-Done, Drill Sergeant!
-Gump!

430
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,439
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

431
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,240
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

432
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,430
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

433
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,020
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

434
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,330
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

435
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,260
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

436
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,120
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

437
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,710
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

438
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,240
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

439
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,410
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

440
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,110
..-Shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

441
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,980
There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

442
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,370
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

443
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,060
...Shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

444
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,399
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

445
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
That's... That's about it.

446
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,500
Night time in the Army is a lonely time.

447
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,770
We’d lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.

448
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,860
And I'd miss Jenny.

449
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,180
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

450
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,190
Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over

451
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,449
some photos of her
in her college sweater,

452
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,090
and she was thrown out of school.

453
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,660
But that wasn't a bad thing,

454
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,020
because a man who owns
a theatre in Memphis, Tennessee,

455
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,770
saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

456
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,659
The first chance I got,

457
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,080
! took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.

458
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,830
That was Amber, Amber Fiame.

459
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,180
Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.

460
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,880
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

461
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,510
direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,

462
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,130
let’s give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.

463
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,890
-All right!
-Bobbi!

464
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,590
Her dream had come true.

465
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,680
She was a folk singer.

466
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,730
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

467
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,200
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

468
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,830
Hey, honey, this ain't Captain Kangaroo.

469
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,330
Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.

470
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,799
-God damn it!
-Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

471
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,390
I'm singing a song here.

472
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,950
Polly, get out here!

473
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,720
-Shut up, there!
-Don't be so shy, honey.

474
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,330
Oh, shut up!

475
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,400
Forrest, what are you doing here?

476
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,240
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

477
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,680
-Come on.
-What are you doing?

478
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,600
Forrest, let me down!

479
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,050
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

480
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,150
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

481
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,920
-They was trying to grab you.
-A lot of people try to grab me.

482
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,910
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

483
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,260
I can't help it. I love you.

484
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,470
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

485
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,410
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

486
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,390
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

487
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,960
Yes, I do.

488
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,310
You think I could fly off this bridge?

489
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,830
What do you mean, Jenny?

490
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,100
Nothing.

491
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,839
I gotta get out of here.

492
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,180
Wait, Jenny...

493
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,160
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

494
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,840
Can I have a ride?

495
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,380
-Where you going?
-I don't care.

496
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,799
Get in the truck.

497
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,580
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

498
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,160
They sending me to Vietnam.

499
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,110
It's this whole other country.

500
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,450
Just hang on a minute.

501
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,640
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

502
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,890
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

503
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,730
Just run away.

504
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,240
Okay.

505
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,200
Jenny.

506
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,089
I'll write you all the time.

507
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,609
And just like that, she was gone.

508
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,250
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

509
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,490
Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different

510
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,460
from the United States of America.

511
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,130
And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.

512
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,040
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

513
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,150
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

514
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,580
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

515
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,090
we can get American shrimpers

516
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,760
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

517
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,370
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

518
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,339
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

519
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,970
You must be my FNGs.

520
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,290
-Morning, sir!
-Morning, sir!

521
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,770
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

522
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,950
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

523
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,670
who would love to grease an officer.

524
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,029
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

525
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,310
What's wrong with your lip?

526
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,680
I was born with big gums, sir.

527
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,009
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

528
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,839
Where you boys from in the world?

529
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,080
-Alabama, sir!
-Alabama, sir!

530
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,300
You twins?

531
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,510
No, we are not relations, sir.

532
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,410
Look, it's pretty basic here.

533
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,590
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

534
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,210
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

535
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,210
There is one item of GI gear

536
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,030
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

537
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,510
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

538
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,040
Try and keep your feet dry.

539
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,510
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

540
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,830
to change your socks
whenever we stop.

541
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,689
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

542
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,049
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

543
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,630
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

544
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,490
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

545
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

546
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,940
Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.
! felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.

547
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,149
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

548
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,360
Somebocdy in his family
had fought and died

549
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,259
in every single American war.

550
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,319
-God damn it, kick some ass!
-I'm on it, Lieutenant.

551
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,580
Get on it!

552
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,640
I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.

553
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,750
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

554
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,260
Little Rock's a fine town.

555
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,170
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

556
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,750
draw what you need for the field.

557
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,450
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

558
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,420
Two standing orders in this platoon:

559
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,090
one, take good care of your feet,

560
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,760
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

561
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,310
I sure hope I don't let him down.

562
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,720
It wasn't always fun.

563
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,700
Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,

564
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,560
or a trail, or the road,
so he'd fell us to get down, shut up...

565
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,919
Get down! Shut up!

566
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,230
...SO we did.

567
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,140
Now, I[ don’t know much about anything,

568
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,710
but I think some of America’s
best young men served in this war.

569
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,520
There was Dallas, from Phoenix,

570
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,830
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.

571
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,270
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

572
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,500
Man, what the hell's going on?

573
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,490
And Tex was... Well, 1 don’t remember
where Tex come from.

574
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,380
Nothing.

575
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,620
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

576
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,120
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

577
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,109
Come on, move out.

578
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,350
Step it up. Look alive out there.

579
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,370
The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.

580
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,150
Fire in the hole!

581
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
Gump, check out that hole.

582
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,490
And there was always something to do.

583
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,550
-Mount them up.
-Spread out! Cover his back.

584
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,510
One day, it started raining,
and it didn’t quit for four months.

585
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,580
We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:

586
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,170
little bitty stinging rain,

587
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,410
and big old fat rain,

588
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,440
rain that flew in sideways.

589
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,250
And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.

590
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Shoot, it even rained at night.

591
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,790
-Hey, Forrest.
-Hey, Bubba.

592
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,970
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

593
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,670
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

594
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,950
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

595
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,540
‘Cause we be watching out
for one another,

596
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,530
like brothers and stuff.

597
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,730
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

598
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,770
I got a very important question
to ask you.

599
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,009
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

600
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,960
Okay.

601
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,149
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

602
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,990
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

603
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,210
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

604
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,569
We ain't got to pay no rent.

605
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,710
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

606
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,620
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

607
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,180
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

608
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,630
That's a fine idea.

609
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,670
Bubba did have a fine idea.

610
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,160
leven wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.

611
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,980
! sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.

612
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,650
! told her what ! was doing
and asked her what she was doing,

613
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,600
and told her
how I thought about her always,

614
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,730
and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her

615
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,259
just as soon as she had the time.

616
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,460
I'd always let her know that Il was okay.

617
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,420
Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump.”

618
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,359
This one day, we was out walking,
like always,

619
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,370
and then, just like that,

620
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,440
somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.

621
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,259
Ambush!

622
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,150
Take cover!

623
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,920
Get down!

624
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,590
Quickly!

625
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,190
Get that thing up here, God damn it!

626
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,310
Forrest, you okay?

627
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,850
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

628
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,710
Medic, we got a man down!

629
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,540
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

630
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,410
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

631
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,860
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

632
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,390
Misfire! Misfire!

633
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,570
God damn it! Mac!

634
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,629
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

635
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,930
Jesus!

636
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,049
My unit is down hard and hurting!

637
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,380
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

638
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,240
Pull back! Pull back!

639
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,310
Run! Run, Forrest!

640
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,640
-Pull back!
-Forrest, Forrest!

641
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,210
Run, man! Run!

642
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,069
Pull back! Run!

643
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,930
Run, God damn it, run!

644
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,380
Medic! Can I get a medic?

645
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,130
! ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to.

646
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,310
Tran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

647
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,490
which was a bad thing.

648
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,569
Bubba!

649
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,950
Bubba was my best good friend.
! had to make sure that he was okay.

650
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,710
Any friendlies out there?

651
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,700
Yeah, I've got three over here.

652
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,200
Where the hell are you?

653
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,160
Bubba?

654
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,640
And on my way back to find Bubba,

655
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,430
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

656
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,850
Tex!

657
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,830
Okay.

658
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,370
! couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,

659
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,220
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.

660
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,230
And every time ! went back
looking for Bubba,

661
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,549
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me.”

662
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,940
Can't hear... Can't hear...

663
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,440
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

664
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,779
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

665
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,560
! started to get scared
that! might never find Bubba.

666
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,050
...OVer.

667
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,050
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

668
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,060
We got Charlie all over this area.

669
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,320
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

670
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,520
-Six, Strongarm, we want...
-Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

671
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,010
I know he's dead!

672
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,660
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

673
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,240
-Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.
-God damn it!

674
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,760
-Copy this transmission. Over.
-What are you doing?

675
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,970
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

676
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,400
Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.

677
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,970
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

678
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,030
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised

679
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,160
your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.

680
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,320
Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

681
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,000
Something bit me!

682
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,550
You chink son of a bitch!

683
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,919
I can't leave the platoon.

684
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,419
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

685
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,870
Did you hear what I said?

686
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,450
God damn it, put me down!

687
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,110
Get your ass out of here!

688
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,690
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

689
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,200
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

690
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,380
To get Bubba.

691
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,860
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

692
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,430
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

693
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,870
I gotta find Bubba!

694
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,670
Forrest.

695
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,570
-Bubba.
-I'm okay, Forrest.

696
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,040
I'm okay.

697
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,259
Oh, Bubba, no...

698
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,490
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

699
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,810
Come on. Come on. Come on.

700
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,190
I'm okay, Forrest.

701
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,029
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

702
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,520
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

703
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,710
If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,

704
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,280
I'd of thought of something better to say.

705
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,900
Hey, Bubba.

706
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,279
Hey, Forrest.

707
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,419
Forrest, why'd this happen?

708
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,590
You got shot.

709
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,950
Then Bubba said something
! won't ever forget.

710
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,600
I wanna go home.

711
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,430
Bubba was my best good friend.

712
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,430
And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

713
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,670
Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,

714
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,420
but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.

715
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,940
That's all l have to say about that.

716
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,660
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

717
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,410
-A bullet?
-That jumped up and bit you.

718
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,790
Oh, yes, sir.

719
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,750
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

720
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,660
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

721
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,590
‘cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

722
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,820
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

723
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,790
is the ice cream.

724
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,290
They gave me all the ice cream
! could eat.

725
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,799
And guess what?

726
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,640
A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.

727
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,720
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

728
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,190
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

729
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,609
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

730
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,200
Harper!

731
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,510
Cooper, Larson,

732
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,040
Webster,

733
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,470
-Gump. Gump.
-I'm Forrest Gump.

734
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,060
Kyle, Nichols,

735
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:14,549
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

736
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,750
Holiday...

737
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,210
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

738
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,750
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

739
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,450
-From the DMZ to the Delta...
-Turn it off!

740
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,490
...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.

741
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,920
This is Channel 6, Saigon.

742
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,240
Good catch, Gump.

743
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,100
You know how to play this?

744
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,350
Come on, let me show you. Here.

745
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,560
Now, the secret to this game is,

746
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,840
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

747
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,080
All right.

748
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,530
For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

749
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,770
See? Any idiot can play.

750
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,880
So, ! started playing it all the time.

751
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,480
! played Ping-Pong

752
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,459
even when ! didn’t have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

753
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,529
The hospital’s people said
it made me look like a duck in water,

754
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,700
whatever that means.

755
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,130
Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.

756
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,060
! played Ping-Pong so much,
! even played it in my sleep.

757
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,280
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

758
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,520
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

759
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,240
I should have died out there
with my men,

760
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,009
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

761
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,580
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

762
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,670
Do you see that?

763
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,040
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

764
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,049
Yes, sir, I do.

765
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,480
Did you hear what I said?

766
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,110
You cheated me.

767
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,310
Il had a destiny.

768
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,540
l was supposed to die in the field,
with honour!

769
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,000
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

770
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,250
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

771
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,200
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

772
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,560
Il had a destiny.

773
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,279
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

774
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,680
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

775
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,500
Look at me.

776
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,610
What am I gonna do now?

777
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,080
What am I gonna do now?

778
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,510
PFC Gump?

779
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,319
Yes, sir!

780
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,390
As you were.

781
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,310
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

782
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,810
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

783
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,879
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

784
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,710
They sent him home.

785
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,000
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

786
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,300
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President

787
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,640
regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.

788
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,910
President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor

789
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,640
to men
from each of the Armed Services.

790
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,380
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

791
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,830
1 understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?

792
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,030
-In the buttocks, sir.
-That must be a sight.

793
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,049
I'd kind of like to see that.

794
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,140
God damn, son.

795
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,550
After that,
Mama went to a hotel to lay down,

796
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,029
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation’s capital.

797
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,150
Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,
what do you want me to do with them?

798
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,069
What are you doing here so late?

799
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,770
It's a good thing Mama was resting,
‘cause the streets was awful crowded

800
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,990
with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,

801
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,650
and some of them people were loud
and pushy.

802
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,529
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

803
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,169
Everywhere ! went,
! had to stand in line.

804
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,940
Follow me, let's go!

805
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,210
Come on. Let's go.

806
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,529
Stand here.

807
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,750
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

808
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,230
Okay.

809
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,040
There was this man giving a little talk.

810
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,470
And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.

811
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,190
Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...

812
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,790
And he liked to say the "F” word.

813
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,040
A lot. °F" this and "F" that.

814
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,480
And every time he said the "F” word,

815
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,160
people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.

816
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,160
...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!

817
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,480
Yeah! Yeah!

818
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,420
Come on, man, come up here, man.

819
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,930
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

820
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,160
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

821
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,980
Tell us a little bit about the war, man.

822
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,750
Well...

823
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,910
There was only one thing
! could say about the war in Vietnam.

824
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,470
...there’s only one thing
! can say about the war in Vietnam.

825
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,830
In Vietnam, your...

826
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,549
Hey, what the hell are you...

827
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,110
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

828
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,620
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

829
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,640
We can't hear you!

830
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,160
We can't hear anything!

831
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,180
-This one! This one! Give me that!
-Turn it up!

832
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,790
Speak up!

833
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,910
That's it!

834
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,509
...and that’s all 1 have to say about that.

835
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,330
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

836
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,259
What's your name, man?

837
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,810
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

838
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,290
Forrest Gump!

839
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,460
-Gump!
-Gump!

840
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,440
Forrest! Forrest!

841
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,790
-Jenny!
-Forrest!

842
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,370
Hey! Hey!

843
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,080
It was the happiest moment of my life.

844
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,560
Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.

845
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,529
She showed me around,

846
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,970
and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.

847
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,520
Shut that blind, man.

848
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,620
And get your white ass
away from that window.

849
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,750
Don't you know we in a war here?

850
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,950
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

851
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,810
-Let me tell you about us.
-Where the hell have you been?

852
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,910
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

853
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,709
from the racial onslaught of the pig

854
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,750
who wishes to brutalise
our black leaders,

855
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,890
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

856
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,690
Who's the baby killer?

857
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,280
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

858
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,149
Forrest, this is Wesley.

859
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,520
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

860
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,970
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

861
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,590
Let me tell you something else.

862
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,420
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

863
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,980
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

864
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,570
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

865
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,690
to die for a country that hates them.

866
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,670
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

867
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,750
and come to be brutalised and killed
in their own communities

868
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,529
as they sleep in their beds at night.

869
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,740
You are a fucking asshole!

870
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,800
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

871
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,819
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

872
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,160
Forrest!

873
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,350
Stop it! Stop it!

874
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,070
Oh, God...

875
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,040
I shouldn't have brought you here.

876
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,380
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

877
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,210
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

878
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,720
Come on, Forrest.

879
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,770
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

880
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,960
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

881
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,280
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

882
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,250
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

883
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,530
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

884
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,910
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

885
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,220
You look handsome in it. You do.

886
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,130
-You know what?
-What?

887
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,890
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

888
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,350
Me, too, Forrest.

889
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,569
We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.

890
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,750
She told me about
all the travelling she'd done.

891
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,100
And how she’d discovered ways
to expand her mind

892
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,279
and learn how to live in harmony,

893
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,680
which must be out west somewhere,

894
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,000
‘cause she made it
all the way to California.

895
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,250
Try to love one another right now

896
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,610
Hey!

897
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,779
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

898
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,740
I'll go.
-Far out.

899
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,030
It was a very special night
for the two of us.

900
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,680
! didn't want it fo end.

901
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,189
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

902
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,470
I have to, Forrest.

903
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,690
Jenny?

904
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,130
Things got a little out of hand.

905
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,850
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

906
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,120
I would never hurt you, you know that.

907
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,120
You know what I think?

908
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:58,260
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

909
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,210
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

910
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,540
I want you to have this.

911
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,219
Forrest, I can't keep this.

912
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,620
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

913
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,899
Why are you so good to me?

914
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,930
You're my girl.

915
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,790
I'll always be your girl.

916
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,910
And just like that, she was gone,
out of my life again.

917
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,319
Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.

918
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,370
And because he didn't have no legs,

919
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,350
he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.

920
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,549
Take a right. Take a right.

921
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,500
Hey! Come on, already!

922
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,230
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

923
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,780
I'm living off the government tit.

924
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,800
Sucking it dry!

925
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,760
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

926
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,519
-I'm walking here!
-Get out of the way!

927
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,970
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

928
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,120
! stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.

929
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,680
You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.

930
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,310
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

931
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,250
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

932
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,840
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

933
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,349
that's all they ever talk about.

934
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,250
Jesus this and Jesus that.

935
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,930
Have I found Jesus?

936
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,330
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

937
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,450
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

938
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,250
How if accept Jesus into my heart,

939
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,669
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

940
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,019
Did you hear what I said?

941
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,650
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

942
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,690
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

943
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,960
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

944
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,090
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

945
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,110
Oh?

946
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,040
Well,

947
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,880
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

948
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,460
-and get us another bottle of Ripple.
-Yes, sir.

949
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,160
We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

950
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,380
This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.

951
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,540
What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?

952
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,840
-Shrimping boats.
-Shrimping boats?

953
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,230
Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

954
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,830
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

955
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,380
soon as I have some money.

956
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,030
I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnam

957
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,719
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

958
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,000
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

959
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,389
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

960
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,160
-A shrimp boat captain.
-Yes, sir.

961
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,880
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

962
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,710
Now hear this!

963
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,950
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

964
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,309
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

965
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,630
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

966
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,980
-I will come and be your first mate.
-Okay.

967
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,129
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

968
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,250
Danny, what are
you complaining about?

969
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,850
-What are you doing, hon?
-Mr Hot Wheels.

970
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,290
-Who's your friend?
-My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

971
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,070
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

972
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,300
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

973
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,990
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

974
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,360
‘cause Tommy bought a round
on the house

975
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,860
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

976
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,680
Well, well, l had company.

977
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,970
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

978
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,480
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

979
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,810
-Hey, Lenore...
-Everybody gets a second chance.

980
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,420
It’s funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

981
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,730
! began to think about Jenny,

982
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,640
wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.

983
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,790
...@ight, seven, six, five,

984
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,230
four, three, two, one!

985
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,010
Happy New Year!

986
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,400
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

987
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,650
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

988
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,910
What's his problem?

989
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,050
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

990
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,120
What, is your friend stupid
or something?

991
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,349
What did you say?

992
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,750
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

993
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,820
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

994
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,809
-Hey, don't you push her!
-You shut up!

995
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,840
-Don't you ever call him stupid!
-What's the matter, baby?

996
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,599
-Why are you so upset?
-Just get the hell out of here.

997
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,790
-Stupid damn...
-Get your goddamn clothes...

998
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,260
You belong in Ripley's Believe It Or Not!

999
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,100
-Get the hell out of here!
-You should be in a sideshow!

1000
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,269
Go on! Get out of here!

1001
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,559
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

1002
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,960
Get out of here!

1003
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,820
-You retard.
-Loser. You freak.

1004
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,259
No, no.

1005
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,890
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1006
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,850
She tasted like cigarettes.

1007
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,430
1 guess Lieutenant Dan figured there’s
some things you just can't change.

1008
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,360
He didn’t want to be called crippled,
just like I didn’t want to be called stupid.

1009
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,820
Happy New Year, Gump.

1010
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,800
The US Ping-Pong team

1011
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,970
met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...

1012
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,639
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1013
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,370
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1014
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,810
So, I went, again.

1015
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,790
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

1016
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,410
Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.

1017
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,680
So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

1018
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,690
-Yes, sir.
-Well, where are you staying?

1019
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,330
-It’s called the Hotel Ebbott.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

1020
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,350
1 know of a much nicer hotel.
It’s brand-new, very modern.

1021
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,480
I'll have my people
take care of it for you.

1022
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,259
Security, Frank Wills.

1023
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,500
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1024
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,250
over to that office across the way.

1025
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,060
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1026
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,759
‘cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1027
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,530
Okay, sir. I'll check it out.

1028
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,240
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1029
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,130
-Good night.
-Good night.

1030
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,370
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

1031
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,800
Vice President Ford

1032
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,910
will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.

1033
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,800
As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...

1034
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,700
Sergeant Gump.

1035
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,219
-Yes, sir!
-As you were.

1036
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,190
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1037
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,160
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1038
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,210
For the Army it does.

1039
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:20,070
And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

1040
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,230
So, ! went home.

1041
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,910
-I'm home, Mama.
-I know, I know.

1042
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,190
! didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,

1043
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,530
and I always try to keep my promise.

1044
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,140
So, ! went on down to Bayou La Batre

1045
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,589
to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.

1046
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,210
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

1047
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,210
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs Blue.

1048
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,720
I guess.

1049
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,820
And, of course,
! paid my respect to Bubba himself.

1050
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,340
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1051
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,050
l remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1052
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:36,309
I'm taking the $24,560
and 47 cents that I got...

1053
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,780
Or, that’s left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,

1054
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,929
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

1055
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,980
and ! bought a bus ticket
and three Dr Peppers.

1056
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,390
Tell me something.

1057
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,390
Are you stupid or something?

1058
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,440
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1059
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,250
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1060
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,269
“When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

1061
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,830
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,”

1062
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,410
which everybody knows isn't true,

1063
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,760
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1064
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,860
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1065
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:14,469
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1066
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,320
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1067
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,099
Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

1068
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,520
but you know what I found out?

1069
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,320
Shrimping is tough.

1070
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,300
I only caught five.

1071
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,410
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1072
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,470
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1073
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,040
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1074
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,710
I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,

1075
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,099
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

1076
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,030
Now, I hadn’t heard from Jenny
in a long while,

1077
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,580
but f thought about her a lot,

1078
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,840
and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.

1079
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,370
! thought about Jenny ail the time.

1080
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,259
Hey!

1081
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:18,210
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1082
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,180
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1083
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,880
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1084
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,290
Yes, I know that.

1085
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,640
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1086
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,820
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
l had to see this for myself.

1087
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:42,720
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1088
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,810
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here 1 am.

1089
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,830
-lam a man of my word.
-Okay.

1090
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,650
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1091
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,320
No, sir.

1092
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,890
That's my boat.

1093
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:12,280
Il have a feeling if we head due east,
we'll find some shrimp,

1094
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,370
so take a left.

1095
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,370
-Take a left!
-Which way?

1096
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,050
Over there! They're over there!

1097
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,190
-Get on the wheel and take a left!
-Okay.

1098
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,280
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1099
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,100
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1100
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,160
That's where we'll find them.

1101
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,200
-Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
-Okay, so I was wrong.

1102
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,099
How are we going to find them?

1103
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,700
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1104
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,570
So, ! went to church every Sunday.

1105
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,800
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1106
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,680
though I think
he left the praying up to me.

1107
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:35,560
-No shrimp.
-Where the hell's this God of yours?

1108
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:41,690
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
‘cause right then, God showed up.

1109
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:02,590
-You'll never sink this boat!
-Now, me, ! was scared,

1110
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,840
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1111
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,400
Come on!

1112
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,950
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1113
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,320
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1114
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,220
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1115
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,660
You'll never sink this boat!

1116
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,900
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

1117
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,410
destroying nearly everything in its path.

1118
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,940
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1119
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,360
Bayou La Batre’s
entire shrimping industry

1120
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,980
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.

1121
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,230
Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,

1122
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,560
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.

1123
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,530
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1124
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,240
After that, shrimping was easy.

1125
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,550
Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails

1126
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,440
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

1127
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,850
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

1128
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:18,179
We got a whole bunch of boats,
12 Jenny's,

1129
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,710
a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1130
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:25,210
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

1131
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,280
Hold on there, boy.

1132
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:31,420
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1133
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,610
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1134
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:39,889
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1135
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,320
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1136
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,900
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1137
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,780
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1138
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,210
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1139
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,900
Well, yes, I would.

1140
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,720
That's him right there.

1141
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,940
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1142
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,190
Forrest,

1143
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,030
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1144
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:55,590
He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.

1145
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,570
For the second time in 17 days,

1146
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,830
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

1147
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,440
Base to Jenny 1.

1148
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,560
-Base to Jenny 1.
-Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1149
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,410
Forrest has a phone call.

1150
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,710
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1151
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,920
-He is indisposed at the moment.
-His mama's sick.

1152
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,200
-Where's Mama?
-She's upstairs.

1153
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,809
Hi, Forrest.

1154
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,130
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

1155
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,470
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1156
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,060
-What's the matter, Mama?
-I'm dying, Forrest.

1157
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,750
Come on in, sit down over here.

1158
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,710
-Why are you dying, Mama?
-It's my time.

1159
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,700
It's just my time.

1160
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,929
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1161
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,050
Death is just a part of life,

1162
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,290
something we're all destined to do.

1163
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,049
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1164
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,480
-I did the best I could.
-You did good, Mama.

1165
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,950
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1166
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,700
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1167
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,590
What's my destiny, Mama?

1168
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,900
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1169
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,769
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1170
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,019
You never know
what you're going to get.

1171
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,120
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

1172
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,790
I will miss you, Forrest.

1173
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,960
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.

1174
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,690
! bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.

1175
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,740
And that's all 1 have to say about that.

1176
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,650
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1177
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,350
There'll be another one along shortly.

1178
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,370
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1179
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,480
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1180
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,059
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1181
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,120
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1182
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:27,050
So, ! never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,

1183
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,880
though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

1184
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:34,179
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1185
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,920
And so then, ! got a call from him saying

1186
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,440
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1187
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,730
“That's good. One less thing.”

1188
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,900
Now, Mama said there’s only
so much fortune a man really needs,

1189
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,740
and the rest is just for showing off.

1190
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:55,420
So, ! gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,

1191
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:01,519
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

1192
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,860
And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said ! was nuts,

1193
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,690
1 gave Bubba’s mama Bubba's share.

1194
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,510
You know what?

1195
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,440
She didn’t have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1196
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:23,180
That smells wonderful.

1197
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,540
And ‘cause ! was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

1198
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,010
! cut that grass for free.

1199
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,340
But at night time
when there was nothing to do

1200
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,760
and the house was ail empty,

1201
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I'd always think of Jenny.

1202
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,030
And then, she was there.

1203
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,710
-Hello, Forrest.
-Hello, Jenny.

1204
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,370
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1205
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,330
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1206
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,000
or maybe it was because she was
so tired, ‘cause she went to bed

1207
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,850
and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.

1208
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,490
It was wonderful having her home.

1209
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,350
Every day we’d take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1210
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,140
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,

1211
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,170
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
! did all the talking.

1212
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,780
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1213
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,349
How could you do this?

1214
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:26,770
Sometimes !I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

1215
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:33,070
! never really knew why she came back,
but I didn’t care.

1216
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:37,380
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.

1217
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,530
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,

1218
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,540
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.

1219
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,430
-New shoes.
-They make them just for running.

1220
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,290
And she even showed me
how to dance.

1221
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,100
And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.

1222
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,620
And it was the happiest time in my life.

1223
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,310
...and this Fourth is witnessing
one of the

1224
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,130
largest fireworks displays
in the nation’s...

1225
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,050
-You done watching it?
-...here in New York Harbor...

1226
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,990
-I'm going to bed.
-...with a spectacular display

1227
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:49,050
of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...

1228
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:57,990
Will you marry me?

1229
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,620
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1230
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,720
You would, Forrest.

1231
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,720
But you won't marry me.

1232
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,019
You don't want to marry me.

1233
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,820
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1234
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,630
I'm not a smart man,

1235
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,560
but I know what love is.

1236
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,410
Jenny.

1237
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,500
Forrest, I do love you.

1238
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,890
-Where are you running off to?
-I'm not running.

1239
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:42,650
That day, for no particular reason,
! decided to go for a little run.

1240
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:48,089
So, ran to the end of the road,
and when ! got there,

1241
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,150
1 thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.

1242
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,179
President Carter, suffering from heat
exhaustion, fell into the arms of...

1243
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,040
And when ! got there,

1244
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,830
! thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

1245
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,429
And I figured since I'd run this far,

1246
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,570
maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

1247
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,230
And that’s what I did.

1248
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,260
l ran clear across Alabama.

1249
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,150
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1250
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,130
Il ran clear to the ocean.

1251
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,700
And when ! got there,
! figured since I'd gone this far,

1252
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,910
might as well turn around
and just keep on going.

1253
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,740
And when I got to another ocean,
! figured since I'd gone this far,

1254
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,120
! might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.

1255
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:45,710
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, ! ate.

1256
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:48,920
When I had to go, you know...

1257
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:51,850
I went.

1258
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,570
And so, you just ran.

1259
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,510
Yeah.

1260
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:35,900
I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1261
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,470
But most of all, 1 thought about Jenny.

1262
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,700
! thought about her a lot.

1263
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:47,310
For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,

1264
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,600
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,

1265
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:52,900
has been running across America.

1266
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,849
Charles Cooper brings us this report.

1267
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:58,080
For the fourth time
on his journey across America,

1268
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:00,860
Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,

1269
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,740
is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.

1270
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,360
-I'll be damned. Forrest?
-Sir, why are you running?

1271
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:07,590
Why are you running?

1272
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,130
Are you doing this for world peace?

1273
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,519
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1274
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:13,290
-Are you running for women's rights?
-Or for the environment?

1275
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,590
Or for animals?

1276
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,220
They just couldn't believe that
somebody would do ail that running

1277
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:18,800
for no particular reason.

1278
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,720
Why are you doing this?

1279
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,140
I just felt like running.

1280
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,550
I just felt like running.

1281
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,620
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1282
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,120
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1283
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,670
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1284
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,580
I said,
“Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1285
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,560
“Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

1286
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,320
“Here's somebody who has the answer.”
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr Gump.

1287
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,420
So, ! got company.

1288
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:53,320
And after that, ! got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.

1289
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:59,059
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1290
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:04,000
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1291
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,330
but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.

1292
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:10,580
Hey, man, hey, listen, ! was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1293
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,510
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

1294
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,270
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

1295
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,190
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

1296
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,250
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

1297
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:22,610
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1298
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,800
-It happens.
-What, shit?

1299
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,170
Sometimes.

1300
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:34,450
And some years lIater,
! heard that that fellow

1301
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,240
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,

1302
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:38,240
and he made a lot of money off of it.

1303
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,850
Another time, [ was running along,

1304
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,970
somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,

1305
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,129
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1306
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,009
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn’t have a camera.

1307
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:54,389
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that colour anyway.

1308
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,839
Have a nice day.

1309
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,500
Well, some years later,

1310
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:07,020
! found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1311
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,490
He made a lot of money off of it.

1312
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:16,250
Anyway, like was saying,
! had a lot of company.

1313
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:18,940
My mama always said,

1314
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:22,920
"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on.”

1315
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,810
And I think that’s what
my running was all about.

1316
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:32,410
! had run for three years, two months,

1317
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,040
14 days and 16 hours.

1318
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:52,320
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1319
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:05,030
I'm pretty tired.

1320
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:09,680
Think I'll go home now.

1321
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,790
Now what are we supposed to do?

1322
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,580
And just like that,
my running days was over.

1323
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,540
So, ! went home to Alabama.

1324
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,910
Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...

1325
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:48,590
...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.

1326
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:51,560
The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...

1327
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,530
I picked up the mail.

1328
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:57,780
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1329
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,900
wondering if ! could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1330
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,620
and that's what I'm doing here.

1331
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,210
She saw me on TV, running.

1332
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:11,150
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1333
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:17,550
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1334
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,559
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1335
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:25,910
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1336
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,170
-Down that way?
-Down that way.

1337
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,940
It was nice talking to you.

1338
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,370
I hope everything works out for you!

1339
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:47,530
Hey!

1340
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:49,519
Forrest!

1341
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,700
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1342
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:54,170
I got your letter.

1343
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,790
I was wondering about that.

1344
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,940
Is this your house?

1345
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:02,800
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1346
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,719
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1347
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,120
-Thank you.
-l ate some.

1348
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:22,640
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1349
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,730
There you are.

1350
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:27,790
And this, I got you running.

1351
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,000
I ran a long way,

1352
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,740
for a long time.

1353
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,340
And there...

1354
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,640
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1355
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:54,129
I just l want to apologise
for anything that I ever did to you,

1356
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:59,180
‘cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1357
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:03,809
-Hey.
-Hi.

1358
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:05,070
Hey, you.

1359
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,809
-This is an old friend from Alabama.
-How do you do?

1360
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:11,840
Listen, next week my schedule changes,
so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1361
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:13,929
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

1362
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:15,889
-Okay. Thanks.
-Bye.

1363
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,759
This is my very good friend, Mr Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

1364
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:24,760
-Hello, Mr Gump.
-Hello.

1365
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:27,730
-Can I go watch TV now?
-Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1366
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:33,600
-You're a mama, Jenny.
-I'm a mama.

1367
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,300
His name's Forrest.

1368
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:40,720
Like me.

1369
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,400
I named him after his daddy.

1370
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,790
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1371
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,100
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1372
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,810
Hey.

1373
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:09,540
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.

1374
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:16,150
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1375
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,130
Okay?

1376
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,889
Isn't he beautiful?

1377
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,710
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1378
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:32,460
But...

1379
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:38,540
Is he smart, or...

1380
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:42,470
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1381
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,790
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1382
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,430
-What are you watching?
-Bert and Ernie.

1383
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,470
Forrest,

1384
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,370
I'm sick.

1385
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:38,170
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1386
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,680
I have some kind of virus,

1387
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,320
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1388
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:46,390
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1389
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:52,770
You could come home with me.

1390
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:59,380
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1391
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:06,559
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1392
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:11,090
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1393
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:17,450
Okay.

1394
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,010
Please take your seats.

1395
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,850
Forrest? It's time to start.

1396
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:46,060
Hi.

1397
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:48,340
Your tie.

1398
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:01,970
Lieutenant Dan.

1399
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,490
Lieutenant Dan.

1400
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:20,920
Hello, Forrest.

1401
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,010
You got new legs. New legs!

1402
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:28,669
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1403
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:33,170
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1404
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,589
Magic legs.

1405
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:44,410
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1406
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:50,440
-Lieutenant Dan.
-Hi, Forrest.

1407
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:55,500
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1408
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:58,809
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1409
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:12,350
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1410
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:18,230
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1411
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,840
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1412
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:54,450
-Hey.
-Hey.

1413
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:10,120
Hey, Forrest.

1414
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:16,110
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1415
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,880
Yes. Well, I...

1416
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,910
I don't know.

1417
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:27,940
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.

1418
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,240
And then it was nice.

1419
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:40,060
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1420
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:45,020
There was always
a million sparkles on the water.

1421
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:50,530
Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,

1422
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:55,080
it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.

1423
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,520
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1424
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:06,710
! couldn't tell where heaven stopped

1425
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,760
and the earth began.

1426
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:12,780
lt was so beautiful.

1427
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:20,120
I wish I could've been there with you.

1428
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:24,639
You were.

1429
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:36,309
I love you.

1430
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:43,490
You died on a Saturday morning.

1431
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:49,070
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1432
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:57,870
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1433
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,799
Mama

1434
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:09,290
always said that dying was a part of life.

1435
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:15,080
I sure wish it wasn't.

1436
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,110
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1437
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:23,710
But...

1438
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:26,370
About to start school again soon,

1439
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:31,599
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1440
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:39,220
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1441
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,090
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1442
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:47,510
Okay.

1443
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:48,850
He’s really good.

1444
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:50,870
Forrest, you go.

1445
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,460
We fish a lot.

1446
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:03,130
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1447
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,380
You'd be so proud of him.

1448
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:11,509
lam.

1449
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:15,420
He wrote you a letter.

1450
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,030
And he says I can't read it.

1451
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:22,480
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1452
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:39,320
Jenny,

1453
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:47,740
I don't know if Mama was right,

1454
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:50,660
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1455
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:53,130
I don't know

1456
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:57,280
if we each have a destiny,

1457
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:04,080
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1458
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,030
But I think

1459
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:14,110
maybe it's both.

1460
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:20,900
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1461
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:28,769
But I miss you, Jenny.

1462
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:38,849
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1463
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:15,730
Here's your bus. Okay.

1464
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:20,490
Hey. I know this.

1465
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,420
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1466
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:26,120
Grandma used to read it to you.

1467
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,310
My favourite book.

1468
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:33,020
Here we are.

1469
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:34,549
Okay.

1470
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:37,620
Here you go.

1471
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,620
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1472
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:51,360
-I wanted to tell you, I love you.
-I love you, too, Daddy.

1473
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:56,040
I'll be right here when you get back.

1474
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:03,500
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1475
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:06,940
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
