1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:05,737
A Studio Ghibli Film

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,673
Tokuma Shoten,
Nippon Television Network,

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,001
Hakuhodo & Studio Ghibli
present

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,005
Raccoon, Raccoon,
Come on out and play.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,569
lean't right now, I'm eating.

6
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,736
What is it you're eating?

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,965
Pickled plums and radish.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,990
How about some for me?

9
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,044
Hey. don't be so greedy.

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:35,059
POM POKO

11
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,623
We used to live near a farmhouse.

12
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,111
But not so we could steal their food.

13
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,194
Where there are farms and fields,

14
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:56,119
there are always frogs.
grasshoppers, mice, moles,

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,563
persimmons and mulberry seeds.

16
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,156
Much more food than
in the mountains.

17
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:07,704
Then suddenly last spring
the house became vacant.

18
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,592
Nobody moved in so we
decided to take it over.

19
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:27,344
It was truly a wonderful year.

20
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,325
A house with a garden.
it was like a dream!

21
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,095
But then...

22
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,994
Usually we don't have strict
rules about territory.

23
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,295
But this was different.

24
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,577
Wherever we went for food, we'd
always come up against others.

25
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,964
There were fights.
our nest was invaded,

26
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,413
And finally...

27
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,006
Pom Poko year 31, Autumn.

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,630
In the clear-cut Forest of Taka
near Suzu,

29
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,763
the Raccoons of the Tama Hills
faced their final battle.

30
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,851
The Red Army was commanded by
Gonta the Brave of Taka.

31
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,706
The Blue Army was commanded by
the Ancient Seizaemon of Suzu.

32
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:02,196
Not many people know this,
but when humans aren't looking,

33
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,030
raccoons stand on two feet.

34
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,806
The battle was fierce and intense
but it didn't last long.

35
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:10,158
Go, go! Taka!
Go, go! Suzu!

36
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,821
Red win! Blue win!
Let them both lose.

37
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,601
Let the loser be killed.

38
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:22,219
If Taka dies today,
Suzu will die tomorrow.

39
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,586
Too many raccoons
with no place to live.

40
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,522
Where will they all go?

41
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,599
No place to go.
They'll all die.

42
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,882
Red win! Blue win!
Let them both lose.

43
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,545
Let the loser be killed.

44
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,574
Let the loser die
for the sake of all.

45
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,864
If both die, Amen!
All the fewer raccoons.

46
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,900
Survivors behave and
have no more babies.

47
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:55,871
Or there won't be
enough forest to hold then.

48
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,851
Urged on by Granny Oroku,

49
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,166
the raccoons looked down and
were stunned by what they saw.

50
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,366
The mountain had
completely vanished

51
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,865
and the hills were stripped
and flattened.

52
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,768
It now looked so vast and cold.

53
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,924
This is insane!

54
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,806
This is no time for fighting!

55
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,692
At the height of
Japan's economic growth,

56
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,949
there was increasing demand for
new housing around Tokyo.

57
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:38,147
Uncontrolled development began
in the farmlands and mountains.

58
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:43,795
Since 1967, this development was known
as the Tama New Town project.

59
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,058
Total area: 30.000 sq. acres

60
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,790
Planned population:
300.000 people

61
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,027
The mountain was deforested,
stripped and leveled flat.

62
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,341
Farms were bulldozed.
Old houses were demolished and

63
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:02,514
the Tama Hills became a
residential development.

64
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,013
Shrubs and trees were added to create
a sprawling suburban community.

65
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,704
It was the largest urban
development ever.

66
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,304
Wow, humans are really amazing.

67
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,870
l always thought all animals
were the same.

68
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:28,111
But now I think humans must be as
powerful as Buddha and the gods.

69
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,270
At this state of emergency,

70
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:39,255
All the raccoons in Tama

71
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,966
gathered secretly at midnight
in the ruined temple Manpukuji.

72
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:51,188
The chairman was the 105 year old
priest, Reverend Tsurukame.

73
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,502
Given the dire situation,

74
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,981
we must give up our
nocturnal habits

75
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,663
and start taking action
during the daytime as needed.

76
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,391
They decided their course of action
would be to stop the development.

77
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,793
We are unanimous!

78
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,957
Realizing the danger they were in.
they broke up the meeting at once.

79
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,680
All future decisions would be
made by the council of chiefs.

80
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,008
The chiefs decided
on a 5-year plan

81
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,450
to bring back the ancient
art of metamorphosis

82
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,267
and to study human beings.

83
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,683
They decided to summon the
famous masters of “Morphing”

84
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,005
from Shikoku and Sado. to teach
the art of transformation.

85
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:45,849
But nobody would volunteer to be
the messenger on the long journey.

86
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,323
They all pretended to be asleep.

87
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,263
Our only hope

88
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,404
is to wait for the young raccoons
to grow up, and send them.

89
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,270
Agreed!

90
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,856
Getting down to business,

91
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:06,312
they proceeded to research
McDonald's hamburgers

92
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,767
and then ended the meeting.

93
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,385
No Dumping

94
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:30,063
In order to gather thorough
data on humans,

95
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,650
they set up a TV at headquarters for
up-to-the-minute information.

96
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,376
Good evening.

97
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,734
Good evening.

98
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,452
The TV aroused great interest.

99
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,588
Raccoons came to headquarters
without official business

100
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,513
just to watch the TV all day.

101
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,870
Metamorphosis is the most
extreme concentration

102
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,494
of mind and spirit.

103
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,238
To transform the body's cells
in a split second

104
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,233
is the world's greatest miracle.

105
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:19,618
Lower animals like chameleons
use mimicry.

106
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,370
But true transformation can only be
done by raccoons, foxes, and some cats.

107
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,233
Gonta!

108
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,500
See how you did that?

109
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:37,039
You're already learning the first steps
of transformation.

110
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,127
Once you get the hang of it,

111
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,093
anyone can do it...

112
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,060
...at least in theory.

113
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,640
I'll give you a demonstration.

114
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,431
Aren't you supposed to put
a leaf on your head?

115
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,843
That's only for beginners.

116
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,537
It's been awhile.

117
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,592
With Granny Oroku
as their teacher

118
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,698
the revival of metamorphosis
was under way.

119
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:21,168
All the youngsters were eager to
learn and practice their new skill.

120
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,293
Excellent, Shokichi!

121
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,930
I've always been
interested in humans.

122
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,297
We're not supposed to get
too close to them...

123
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,971
but my dear departed father
never stopped me.

124
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,999
A good knowledge of humans

125
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,541
is the key to the
art of transformation.

126
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,533
Dad knew it would be
useful in the future.

127
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,935
Of course, not all the
students were brilliant.

128
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,790
In fact, many were just awful.

129
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,605
The key to transformation is
extreme discipline of mind and body.

130
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,486
This is easy for a fox,

131
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,281
but raccoons are
naturally easygoing.

132
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,854
As expected, there were
some dropouts.

133
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:43,555
Hey!

134
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,607
Hey, Ponkichi!

135
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,971
Ready, set,
let's all morph...

136
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,233
I was so into morphing that I
couldn't believe my friend Ponkichi

137
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,864
just wanted to live an
ordinary raccoon’s life.

138
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,054
On a mountain pass at dusk

139
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,284
the moon comes out from
behind the mountain.

140
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,717
A branch from a single cedar tree
obstructs the view of the moon.

141
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,929
“Funny, there was no branch
there before.”

142
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:29,151
Then the branch disappears and
comes out on the other side.

143
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,363
The person who notices this says,

144
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,343
“No, there were
branches on both sides!”

145
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,949
Then a branch comes out
on the other side too.

146
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,423
Just then, KABOOM, they fall down.

147
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,964
Do you know what fell?

148
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,319
A raccoon!

149
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,034
That's right.
And why did it fall? Gonta?

150
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,094
‘Cause he was stupid.
There's no way ! would fall.

151
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,607
Good. That's the spirit.

152
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,906
Sasuke, why did he fall?

153
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,970
He made both arms into branches
and let go his hold on the tree.

154
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:07,723
Very good. And what is the lesson
to be learned here? Shokichi?

155
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,328
That you shouldn't take literally
everything humans say.

156
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,163
Right.

157
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,099
We raccoons are too easygoing.
We get caught up and give too much.

158
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,162
This is the source of our mistakes.
Does everyone understand?

159
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,930
Yes, Reverend Tsurukame.

160
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,238
So, for example. if I sing:
Raccoon, raccoon

161
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,032
Come on out and play.

162
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,015
We're in the middle of a lesson.

163
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,891
See? You've already fallen for it.
That's what I was afraid of.

164
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:01,771
While the raccoons were still
hard at work on their lessons,

165
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,897
winter had come and gone.

166
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:04,997
The plum trees were blossoming.

167
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,948
The season for love was here.

168
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,097
Following Granny Oroku's warning,

169
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:14,228
Many of the raccoons
abstained from mating

170
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,707
to keep the population
under control.

171
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,181
Especially the females.

172
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,489
They controlled their maternal
instincts with firm willpower,

173
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,805
rejecting the lovesick
advances of the males.

174
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,048
Meanwhile. work progressed
on the massive development.

175
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,012
More forest disappeared,
more land was cleared for housing.

176
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,003
The raccoons were sad and angry.

177
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,046
They called the site “flat hills”.

178
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,016
Mr, mailman, you dropped something...

179
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,367
The females, who were all raised
as liberated raccoons,

180
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,065
also learned to transform
along with the males.

181
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,423
When males transform into girls,

182
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,800
voices and gestures
might be wrong.

183
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,222
The females helped to solve this.

184
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,919
Some females also
transformed into men.

185
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,450
Can I have just the boys
stay after class for a while?

186
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:28,192
One day the Reverend Tsurukame
gave the boys a special lecture.

187
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:35,405
Boys, there's something hidden
in the mat you're sitting on.

188
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,911
What is it?
It's my testicles!

189
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,683
150 square feet.
Here's your proof.

190
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,099
After completing transformation class.
the students began outside training.

191
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,363
As when learning to drive a car,

192
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,040
one must be accompanied by
an experienced morphist,

193
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:13,172
to prevent accidents.

194
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,237
The art of transformation
requires a great deal of energy.

195
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,271
Especially when transforming
into humans.

196
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:59,329
The dark circles raccoons have around
their eyes are from sheer fatigue.

197
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:07,116
Even an experienced raccoon will
need to take along some extra energy.

198
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,140
Becoming too exhausted. one might
change into a raccoon in an instant.

199
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:21,724
Recently. fast-acting energy drinks
have become very popular.

200
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,506
To graduate from
outside training,

201
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:31,899
each student had to quietly and
single-handedly bring back ¥1000.

202
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,583
Help me!

203
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,485
Several of them transformed
into one workman.

204
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,672
Others posed as begging monks.

205
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,686
Some of the females tried
working in bars.

206
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,831
One even tried his
luck at pachinko.

207
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,729
One sly fellow got his paws into
a temple donation box.

208
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,485
But all he got was small change.

209
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:01,467
Granny Oroku could
detect fake money.

210
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:08,026
I told you never to make
money out of leaves!

211
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:20,202
An urgent report interrupted
Gonta's training at headquarters.

212
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:25,026
He rushed to the Taka Forest
and was shocked by what he saw.

213
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,544
More than half of his forest
had become “flat hills”.

214
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,614
Furious, he hurried
back to headquarters.

215
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,956
He called a meating of the council

216
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,081
and proposed tactics
to drive out the humans.

217
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,105
absolutely oppose this.

218
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,377
Why?

219
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,004
The time is not ripe. It's only
the 1st year of the 5 year plan.

220
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,255
We've all completed our training.
We're already capable of great things.

221
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:59,213
What do you think, Granny?
Can we send them out yet?

222
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,232
They are certainly capable
of basic skills.

223
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:04,946
Are they?

224
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:10,131
But they lack experience. There
is still danger of critical error.

225
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:11,846
l want to ask you Gonta,

226
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:19,021
are you proposing this battle
for your own personal revenge?

227
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:20,879
Isn't that it?

228
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:28,171
No, I swear. It's for the happiness
of all the raccoons in Tama.

229
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,525
Happiness of all?

230
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,276
You forget, Gonta. A year ago you
were fighting against the Suzu raccoons.

231
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,860
You were the leader.

232
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,448
Shut up!
Even if you're all against me,

233
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,629
the raccoons from Taka
are going to fight.

234
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,761
If Gonta's going to fight.
then I'm going too.

235
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,857
You too, Shokichi?

236
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:52,812
Thanks!
Men, there's no turning back now!

237
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,953
Wait!

238
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,869
You can't stop us, Granny.

239
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,482
Just this once,
I'll teach you a secret skill.

240
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:12,505
Even if you mess it up,
this disguise will last five days.

241
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,736
0.K, what is it?

242
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,022
A dead fox.

243
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,302
Year 32 of the Pom Poko era. Summer.

244
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:27,514
Gonta and a group of ten brave volunteers
began to test their skills

245
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,491
in a surprise attack
on the humans.

246
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,564
Finally their counter-attack
had started.

247
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,040
- They've come!
- They're here!

248
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,596
Come on! Come on!

249
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,062
We did it! We did it!

250
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,803
Today at 2:30pm at the
development site of Tama New Town,

251
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,904
Three drivers were killed and
two more were seriously injured

252
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,159
in a landslide and an aecident
involving a trailer.

253
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,554
One building under construction
was completely levelled in this disaster.

254
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,032
Heavy rains and poor visibility
were blamed for the accident.

255
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:19,316
Because so many accidents have
occurred at the development site,

256
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:26,235
nearby residents are questioning the
viability of New Town's construction.

257
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,842
Wait a minute!

258
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:36,261
Those people were
victims of this war.

259
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:41,279
We should express our deepest
condolences to their poor families.

260
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,033
The Reverend is right.

261
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:49,683
Let's have one minute of silent
prayer for the victims’ sacrifices.

262
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,406
Aye!

263
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,187
Silent prayer! Silent prayer!

264
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,166
Silent prayer!

265
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:16,467
- We won! We won!
- Let's celabrate! A big party!

266
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,176
Gonta!

267
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,096
Our heroes have
triumphantly returned.

268
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,096
You did great, Shokichi.

269
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:06,236
Thanks to you, we have hope.

270
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,387
Ah, today was only a test.
The real battle hasn't even begun.

271
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,450
Each of us can take on
a few humans at once.

272
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:21,447
Crush. kill and destroy them.
Kick them out of our land!

273
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,484
Say something, Shokichi.

274
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:30,010
And then we'll plant trees!
Lots of persimmon trees!

275
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,601
Hurry, persimmon seed,
sprout a tree

276
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,794
Hf you don't, I'll chop you up.

277
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:43,835
Out with the humans!
Kill them! Destroy them!

278
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:49,316
Hold on. Aren't we supposed to be
celebrating this joyous day together?

279
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,672
I'm a little worried about something.

280
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,262
What's that?

281
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,031
Are we going to kill all the
humans and drive them all out?

282
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,244
Of course!

283
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,612
Can't we let a few humans stay?
Like it was before?

284
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,845
No! They're our blood enemy!
They're monsters!

285
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,249
They must be vanquished forever!

286
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:14,119
I guess you're right.
Il hate them too.

287
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,850
There are some good ones, but...

288
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,041
But what?

289
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:28,452
But if we drive them all away,
we'll never eat tempura again.

290
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,559
Or sardines...

291
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,685
..,Or corn...

292
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,693
Hamburgers! Donuts! Fried chicken!

293
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,881
Potato chips! Turkey!

294
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,269
Aghhh...1 want them too!

295
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,562
What if we let just
a few humans stay?

296
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,263
l suppose we have no choice.

297
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,100
- Oh, good!
- Hooray for Gonta!

298
00:25:56,155 --> 00:26:03,625
In the garden of Manpukuji temple
The moon shines bright.

299
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:09,953
Everyone come out. Come out.
Hurry, hurry, all our friends.

300
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,893
Reverend Tsurukame, come out!
Everybody look at Granny!

301
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:19,408
You gotta get a look!
Everyone's gotta get a look!

302
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:25,556
Authorities declare the need to
house ten million people

303
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:32,991
is too urgent to consider
delaying the New Town development.

304
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,426
- Hey...
- What did they say?

305
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,408
It was an unfortunate accident.

306
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,650
The hero, Gonta suffered compound
fractures and ruptured organs.

307
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:51,294
He would need at least a year
to recover fully.

308
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,820
The news reports cast a pall
of gloom over the celebrations.

309
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:05,601
But the raccoons were encouraged by the
local people's fears of bad omens.

310
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:11,197
Perhaps it was a mistake
to tear down the Suwa Shrine.

311
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,660
What do you mean?

312
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,685
It must be a curse.
Punishment by the shrine's gods.

313
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,840
Weren't all the statues
of Jizo and the others saved?

314
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:28,797
Of course. We held a proper ceremony
before moving them out, but...

315
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,921
What do you think,
Professor Mizuki?

316
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:37,902
These gods and buddhas are the local
guardians of that land.

317
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,724
To come back one day and
find everything gone.

318
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,091
It would be strange if
they weren't angry.

319
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:51,456
I think there will be a lot
more curses still to come.

320
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,506
Hikage Mountain might not be razed.

321
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,499
Shokichi tried a new strategy.

322
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:15,519
When the owner of the land went
to check the area before cutting trees,

323
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:20,685
he could not remember having seen
so many Jizo statues on Hikage Mountain.

324
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,270
He decided it might be better to wait
and he delayed the contract.

325
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:32,034
At another shrine that was to be moved,

326
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,858
Kumataro changed into the fox who
in local legends was servant to the gods.

327
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,596
He appeared on the roof of the shrine.

328
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:46,087
Overwhelmed by the plaintive wailing

329
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,338
the ceremony was disrupted
and moving the shrine was postponed.

330
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:54,925
Instead, they requested that the
authorities change the road plans.

331
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,725
The raccoons were all
very excited.

332
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,357
Each group was driven
by competition...

333
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,822
to try out what they learned...

334
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,358
and carried out guerrilla attacks.

335
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,974
Come this way.

336
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,995
Go away.

337
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,043
Take it with you.

338
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,456
Let's not leave anything behind.

339
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,744
Leave the food.

340
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,372
What's wrong young lady?

341
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,489
What's the matter?

342
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,012
l have no face.

343
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,062
A GHOST!

344
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,846
Over there... there was...

345
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,043
A murder?

346
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,924
No...

347
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,851
Not a murder?

348
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:53,079
It was a woman.

349
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:54,722
The wide-mouth monster lady?

350
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,616
No, it was...

351
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,899
Was it something like this?

352
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:24,904
Was it...something like this?

353
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:37,445
It was such fun
scaring the humans,

354
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,600
they decided to have a party.

355
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,504
But the hero of the first battles
was disappointed that his injuries

356
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,315
were not healing quickly.

357
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:58,161
His wife. Otama, nursed him well,
but he was still unable to fight.

358
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,947
He wasn't pleased with the way
the others were handling things.

359
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:07,234
Last night's news was great!
Ghosts appear in New Town.

360
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:12,499
That cop was on the show.
Everyone laughed at him.

361
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,011
He turned bright red and got mad.
It was very funny.

362
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:21,221
Idiots! That's nothing!
Will that stop their work?

363
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:28,391
lf you're going to transform,
do it to kill the humans!

364
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,778
Just as Gonta said,
the construction didn't stop.

365
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,842
The river was banked
with concrete.

366
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:44,413
Roads cut through
the flattened hills.

367
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,710
And construction of
housing was under way.

368
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:52,717
However, the mysterious incidents
received so much media coverage

369
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:57,885
that the New Town ghosts
were famous all over the country.

370
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,479
The raccoons’ spirits rose
higher and higher.

371
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,569
32nd year of Pom Poko. Autumn.

372
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,831
There were contests to decide
who would be the messengers

373
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:19,221
to bring back the Great Masters
of Metamorphosis.

374
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,362
Tamasaburo would go to Shikoku.

375
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,259
And Bunta would go to Sado.

376
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,982
At the next full moon,

377
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:40,958
the two youths set off
on their journey.

378
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:03,757
After the messengers left, the others
continued haunting New Town.

379
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,641
Whether or not it helped
to stop the development,

380
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,973
it was their favorite sport.

381
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,972
Out with the devil!

382
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:04,031
Can we really chase the humans
away with cheap tricks?

383
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,687
If we slip up. will they see
through our disguises ?

384
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,636
Should we fight like Gonta says?

385
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,857
No, killing one or two people
won't make any difference.

386
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,509
To be or not to be...
That is the question.

387
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,456
Okiyo...

388
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,351
What are you doing over there?

389
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,207
Is something wrong
with your neck ?

390
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,660
I'm posing. ] thought you
might say I'm pretty.

391
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,525
Oh, sorry.

392
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,375
Now my neck really does hurt.

393
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:01,996
You were pretty.

394
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,164
Too late.

395
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:05,799
But I mean it.

396
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,803
I'm just out of practice.

397
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,086
Everyone likes that song...
I guess I like it too.

398
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,937
Do you like “Where are you from?”

399
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,249
Yeah, but nobody sings it.

400
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,645
That song...

401
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:40,163
A raccoon was on Senba Mountain,
and along came a hunter...

402
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,403
My grandpa was killed by a hunter.

403
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,937
Sorry, I didn't know.

404
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,593
But he wasn't cooked and eaten.

405
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,274
His fur was sold for a lot of money.

406
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,976
Your fur is beautiful, too.

407
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:02,231
I'm happy you said that,
Shokichi.

408
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,851
So what about that song?

409
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:13,823
Oh yeah, my dad used to sing it.
He was a good ball bouncer too.

410
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,319
He must have been a character.

411
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:22,866
And when he finished singing,
he would always start preaching.

412
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,262
What did he say?

413
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,140
Children, you must never forget.

414
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,573
Like the song says,

415
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:34,139
the true nature of humans is cruel.

416
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:38,086
They kill us and eat us.

417
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,200
Hey, let's play ball.

418
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,843
Are you any good?

419
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,647
Sure I am.

420
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,497
0.K, I got one too.

421
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:04,485
Where are you from?
Higo...Where's Higo?

422
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,140
Kumamoto... Where's Kumamoto?

423
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,993
Senba... There are raccoons there.

424
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:18,303
So, when is Operation Twin Star?

425
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,297
Oh, I don't really want to do it.

426
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,923
But it was such a great idea.

427
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,185
Yeah.

428
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,674
Do you want to do it tonight?

429
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,479
With you?

430
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,875
Yeah, we can be partners.
Are you scared?

431
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,180
No, it's not that, but...

432
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,250
0.K, so we'll go. It'll be great.

433
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,878
0.K. let's do it. I'm sure that
with you, it'll be terrific.

434
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,223
Great!

435
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,721
My. what adorable little children.

436
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,029
We just got back from our star
travels and our house is gone.

437
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,454
Star travels?

438
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:12,402
From the red-eyed Scorpion,
we crossed over the Eagle's wings

439
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:17,217
We looped the coiled Snake.
to the top of the Bear cub's brow.

440
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:22,713
And we sprinkled
the dew and frost.

441
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,174
What in the world...are you two?

442
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,387
We're lost and we're cold!

443
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,296
Mister, do you know our house?

444
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,940
We don't know.
Now go away!

445
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,104
Better call the police!

446
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,995
They're not kids. They're gremlins!

447
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:13,017
Forgive us!
Forgive us, little gremlins!

448
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,469
Wait a minute.
We can work this out.

449
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,989
I'll raise your pay.
I'm asking you to stay.

450
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,501
No way. I can't take it any more.
I'm going back home.

451
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,622
This place gives me
the creeps.

452
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,567
Please, don't say that!

453
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:54,404
I knew Tokyo was a scary
place but this is too much.

454
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,749
l think you should drop
this whole development.

455
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,292
Curse or whatever,
something is against this project.

456
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:11,113
The raccoons cheered.

457
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,732
That night's party was
especially grand.

458
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:19,779
The heroes of the day
were Okiyo and Shokichi.

459
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:29,779
The workers had deserted.
It was dead calm.

460
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,995
But the next morning...

461
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,749
there seemed no limit to the number
of replacements they could get.

462
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,246
After all the raccoons’ hard
work at scaring them away,

463
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,790
new people
came the very next day.

464
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:49,853
A local rumor says the ghosts
are only foxes or raccoons.

465
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:57,493
If this were true, all we'd need
to do is kill a few animals.

466
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:00,933
This made the raccoons at
Headquarters very nervous.

467
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:08,316
It's nothing but old folktales.
That's how the rumor got started.

468
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,260
That just proves that it's
only a rumor.

469
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,828
Rumor?
We saw it with our own eyes!

470
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:23,455
Very well. We'll just have to get rid
of these dangerous animals.

471
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:28,629
dust let us know when you catch them

472
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,127
if you prove they did it, that is.

473
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,799
Shokichi wasn't the only one who
thought it wasn’t enough

474
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,716
just to scare the humans.

475
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:44,183
As you know, the Edo era
was the golden age of raccoons.

476
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,202
The art of metamorphosis
was at its peak.

477
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:52,322
It was a theme of all painters
and writers in that period.

478
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:58,184
But we stood out too much.
The humans were offended.

479
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,190
As civilization progressed,
they captured us by the thousands,

480
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,879
for brushes, fur collars
and toothbrushes.

481
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:11,606
Taking their revenge on us.

482
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:16,807
We learned from this
terrible experience.

483
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:20,942
And we have been careful with
our art in the last few decades.

484
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:26,282
For raccoons to live in peace
we must never forget this.

485
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,052
Metamorphosis is a great gift,

486
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,645
but if used carelessly,

487
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:36,203
it will only rekindle
the humans’ desire for revenge.

488
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,027
l urge you all
to use discretion.

489
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,870
The young transforming raccoons
felt a loss of motivation.

490
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,352
But it was autumn,
the time for abundant harvests.

491
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,410
The best season for raccoons.

492
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:55,662
To prepare for winter, they ate
to store up fat,

493
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,080
and grow their
bushy winter coats.

494
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:20,902
They forgot about transforming and
stuck to the job of getting food.

495
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:29,432
One day. a worn out raccoon
arrived at the construction site.

496
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,668
It's O.K, we're raccoons.

497
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,618
Thank you.

498
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:01,675
You look exhausted.
Where did you come from?

499
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,800
From Fujino Mountain.

500
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,621
Is that in Shikoku or Sado?

501
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,346
It's in Kanagawa.
Back over those mountains.

502
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:14,141
Kanagawa? You mean
you're not from Shikoku?

503
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,495
Sorry if 1 disappointed you somehow.

504
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:22,931
It's just that we've been
waiting for somebody.

505
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:27,171
Anyway, did you come
on business?

506
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,369
I finally found it!

507
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,710
I was looking for where
all the dirt came from

508
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,766
that made a mess of our mountain.

509
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,555
According to this raccoon
named Hayashi,

510
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:41,305
tons of dirt and construction
waste had been dumped

511
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,422
in the hills and
valleys of Fujino...

512
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,688
polluting the rivers,
causing frequent landslides,

513
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:51,868
and endangering the survival of
raccoons and other animals.

514
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:56,136
To find the source
of this trouble,

515
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:01,467
Hayashi changed into a human
and sneaked into an empty truck.

516
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:14,748
But his transforming skills were
not perfect. He fell asleep.

517
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:20,013
While the truck carried him
here, he changed back into a raccoon.

518
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,815
It's not just Fujino,
it's other places too.

519
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:27,535
The garbage dumpsites, and the
golf courses they keep building.

520
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,689
They destroy our mountain here.
and cause us trouble.

521
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:36,746
Then they dump the waste on
Fujino, and cause you trouble.

522
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,600
Just how far will they go
with this insanity?

523
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,562
When I arrived here
I couldn't believe it.

524
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:49,319
l thought for sure the waste
was coming from the big city.

525
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,058
But this is a mountain!

526
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,600
They dig up one mountain
and dump it on another.

527
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:58,702
What in the world for?
I don’t understand it one bit.

528
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:06,034
Now if we stop the development. we'll
be doing it for the Fujino raccoons.

529
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:13,092
Il can't express it strongly enough.
l urge you to use your power.

530
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,888
for the sake of my mountain
as well as your own.

531
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:24,383
Well...we'd very much like to
do that, but...

532
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:32,717
Where could our messengers
have gotten to?

533
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:36,384
And why haven't they brought the
Masters of Metamorphosis here?

534
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:46,167
Winter came and the Masters
still had not arrived.

535
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,312
Ouring the raccoons’ winter rest,

536
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:53,545
the humans quickly forgot the
“New Town Ghosts”

537
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,178
and the media's attention
shifted elsewhere.

538
00:47:56,807 --> 00:48:00,317
The media was now busy with
scandals of movie stars

539
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,781
and corruption by politicians.

540
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,011
In the garden of Manpukuji temple.

541
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:14,899
Raining, raining cotton candy,
ice cream, snow cones!

542
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:19,209
All our friends, Pom Poko, Pom!

543
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,871
New Year, 33rd year of Pom Poko

544
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,244
New Year's morning brought a
fresh blanket of snow.

545
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:34,816
Most of the construction workers
had gone home for the holidays,

546
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,459
and were enjoying long-awaited
family reunions.

547
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:59,692
Raccoon's golden bells
swing but there's no wind.

548
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:07,658
Baby raccoon sees them,
and swings his too.

549
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,322
We really saw them.

550
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:13,048
A bunch of raccoons pushed it!

551
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:14,504
It's the truth!

552
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:18,122
On New Year's Day, three workers
at the Tama development

553
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,706
were arrested for a destroying a
construction vehicle.

554
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,431
The disturbance mimics the
infamous “New Town Ghosts”.

555
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:27,761
Investigations are under way,
but the snow has melted...

556
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:30,388
Look what you've done now,
Shokichi.

557
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,968
I don't think we need to worry.

558
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,037
What you did was pointless.

559
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:40,732
He was just trying to raise the morale
of those who can't yet transform.

560
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,329
What do you think, Reverend?

561
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,095
I think it'll be all right.

562
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:49,725
And it was all right.

563
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:53,274
The three workers were released
for insufficient evidence.

564
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:58,391
The raccoons weren't blamed.
The case remained a mystery.

565
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,662
Then spring finally came.

566
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,714
Once again, the season for love.

567
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,460
The raccoons, who had been
chaste for over a year,

568
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,410
had reached the limits
of their endurance.

569
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,630
Love rivalries and
sweet nothings filled the air.

570
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:29,781
Even the sky was rose-colored.

571
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,225
Wait up, Hanako!

572
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,627
Hanako, wait!

573
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:54,386
You can't catch me!

574
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:59,538
Everyone has spring fever.

575
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:05,149
We're just like trees and flowers.
When spring comes, the sun shines.

576
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:07,663
We bud, our flowers blossom,

577
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:11,402
then we bear fruit.

578
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,290
But we must obey Granny's orders.

579
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,596
Until our battle is won,
we will be chaste.

580
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:26,673
Shokichi, you are really wonderful.

581
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,725
I'm...so glad.

582
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,212
Our love is forever.

583
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,644
Shokichi!

584
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:48,923
That was a big mistake.
Their love grew passionate.

585
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:53,633
And sure enough,
the others had done the same.

586
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,681
That spring, Shokichi and Kiyo
had four baby raccoons.

587
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,973
Kincho Daimyo Shrine

588
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:02,618
In late autumn of the year before,
Tamasaburo finally arrived in Awa.

589
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,584
He went to the Kincho Shrine,
home of the wise Masters,

590
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:10,337
to explain the problem in Tokyo
and ask for the Great One's help.

591
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:13,377
That's when Tamasaburo fell ill.

592
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:17,134
But with the care of Koharu,
the Great One's daughter,

593
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,275
he recovered miraculously.

594
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:24,767
That spring the two fell in
love and had three babies.

595
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:35,243
Inside the shrine, all the Masters
of Shikoku were in a serious meeting.

596
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:41,177
They agreed that it was
important for all of Japan

597
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:47,189
to stop the development in Tokyo.
They must act quickly.

598
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,214
But who should be sent?

599
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,644
And who would handle things
here in Shikoku?

600
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:57,690
Hundreds of questions were raised

601
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:01,805
but no conclusions were reached.

602
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,792
Father's in a meeting again today.
Always meetings.

603
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,884
And on such a lovely day.

604
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,830
It's already been six months.
When will they reach a decision?

605
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,868
Il want them to go on forever!

606
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:29,936
I can't stand the thought...

607
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:35,248
of you going back to Tama.

608
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:45,427
Koharu, this kind of happiness
is only a dream.

609
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,484
Why must it be?

610
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:54,398
I'm going to ask Father

611
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:59,032
if he'll let you stay here
and become his successor.

612
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:17,410
While Tamasaburo was absorbed
in the anguish of youth,

613
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,958
Bunta, who had journeyed to Sado.
roamed the fields and mountains

614
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:26,336
searching for a Master called
Danzaburo.

615
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:33,080
However, he found no trace of him.

616
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:44,961
From summer to autumn, the
raccoons faced a serious dilemma.

617
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,863
Not only was their
forest disappearing,

618
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:53,279
but the population multiplied
with a spring baby boom.

619
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:58,277
Bad weather caused
an extreme shortage of food.

620
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:02,932
Persimmons, nuts and other
autumn fruits were scarce.

621
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,540
Transforming raccoons managed to
get food from the humans,

622
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:11,708
but it wasn't enough to feed
all the babies.

623
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,904
Even the non-transforming
raccoons were forced

624
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:32,142
to go to humans’ homes
to find food.

625
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:37,099
Some of the careless ones
were hit by cars or caught in traps.

626
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:41,321
Many lives were lost.

627
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,131
I'm back in shape now!

628
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:24,310
It's time to confront the humans.
Right, Shokichi?

629
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:27,672
Are you sure you're all right,
Gonta?

630
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:31,015
Of course! Watch this!

631
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:43,997
This calls for a celebration!
When's the party?

632
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:48,555
There's no time for a party,
Granny Oroku.

633
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:54,553
[ think we should wait until
the Masters get here.

634
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:58,649
You too, Shokichi?
I'm sick of you wimps.

635
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,556
We mustn't forget the
strength of the humans.

636
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,899
lf we attack like that,
we're sure to lose.

637
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,859
We've already waited too long!

638
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:11,115
Hold on.
Let's hear Shokichi's opinion.

639
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,559
Until the Masters arrive,
l propose three things:

640
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:20,136
First, fair allotment of the food
obtained by transforming raccoons.

641
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,914
In other words,
a rationing system.

642
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,431
Second, enforcement of a
traffic safety program.

643
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:34,276
Third, a rescue squad for
anyone caught in traps.

644
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,279
Shokichi. you sound
just like a human,

645
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,691
No, I'm very much raccoon.

646
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:50,841
0.K. We'll worry about the details
later. For now, let's see who agrees.

647
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,199
All those in favor
raise your hands!

648
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:54,854
Agreed!

649
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,760
What kind of game
are you playing, Gonta?

650
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:00,799
This is not a game!
I'm in charge now!

651
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:06,028
Anyone who opposes me will
be killed by my guards.

652
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,202
Those are dangerous words, Gonta.

653
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:14,155
Call him Sir! Gonta, Sir!

654
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:19,425
Humans are strong, indeed.
But if we are desperate enough,

655
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:22,177
we can win!
We can kill them!

656
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:26,103
The saying goes. “An angry
mouse will bite the cat.”

657
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:29,124
Huh?

658
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,459
He'll bite his tongue.

659
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,258
We're just cornering
ourselves, like mice.

660
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:38,020
Exactly. If a mouse is cornered,
he'll bite the cat. That's the idea.

661
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,992
We're not mice.

662
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,154
Biting a cat won't help us.

663
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:48,304
Mice? Yes. a mouse would
taste good right now.

664
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:50,569
Mouse tempura is the best.

665
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,721
No. fried mouse nuggets
are tops.

666
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,417
l like'am with breading.

667
00:59:58,195 --> 01:00:00,805
l like the crispy fried tails.

668
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,230
What are you all doing?

669
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:11,790
As for me...
My favorite is mouse tempura.

670
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,843
Listen, Gonta.
The best we can do right now...

671
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,684
is wait for the
Masters from Shikoku.

672
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,556
I'm sorry.

673
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,511
And I'm warning you not
to have any more babies.

674
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,791
It's hard enough as it is.

675
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:37,409
No! Instead of fewer raccoons,
we need fewer humans!

676
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:44,435
We used to have more territory...
then along came those humans!

677
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,221
Drive them out!
Kill them!

678
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,806
Drive them out! Kill them!

679
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,183
Just then...

680
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,201
Hey, Taxi!

681
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,167
I'll go tell them we're here.

682
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,201
Tamasaburo!

683
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,582
I've brought back the
Masters from Shikoku.

684
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,105
Well done, Tamasaburo!

685
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:22,030
Friends, on the way here, we saw
your devastated mountains.

686
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,413
You have our deepest
sympathy.

687
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:29,464
We would like to hold
an assembly tonight.

688
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,886
33rd year of Pom Poko. Autumn.

689
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:37,033
On the arrival of the three Masters,
the rally began.

690
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:43,348
There's a good moon out tonight.

691
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:48,641
Everyone, my name is
Hage from Yashima.

692
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:53,913
This year I will be 999 years old.

693
01:02:55,872 --> 01:03:02,022
Why has Shikoku escaped
development compared to here?

694
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:07,616
Because we have protected
our mountains vigilantly.

695
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:16,995
Our humans know what evil will
befall them if they anger us.

696
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:26,745
We three are worshipped at every
temple and shrine in Shikoku.

697
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,194
We are highly respected
by humans.

698
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:37,668
Il haven't introduced myself.
lam the Supreme Leader of Matsuyama.

699
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:41,071
My name is Inugami Gyoubu.

700
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,370
I'm the Kincho Shrine's 6th
generation Daimyojin, Kincho VI.

701
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:53,002
We shall commence to
eliminate the humans

702
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,816
by using your transformation
skills in a Monster Attack.

703
01:03:57,701 --> 01:03:59,841
This battle will require

704
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,940
the concentration of our
highest combined spirits.

705
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:08,457
We three could even lose our lives
in this battle.

706
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:16,629
However, if you complete this
operation without regrets,

707
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:23,354
you will win back the respect
the humans once had for you.

708
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:30,669
We must accept the danger

709
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:35,850
and use all our might
to stop the development.

710
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:40,177
We have a full arsenal of tricks.

711
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:46,980
We have built a great boat.
One that will carry us far.

712
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:51,877
Come confidently aboard.

713
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:14,038
What a beautiful moon.

714
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,705
We like full moons.

715
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:24,125
Let us pray to this moon
for success.

716
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,258
Shall we?

717
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:44,716
The raccoons began intense
training for the Monster Attack.

718
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:06,313
Happy 999th birthday!

719
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:13,355
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

720
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:18,141
Master. can you tell us the
story of Yoichi the archer?

721
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,716
Sure, why not.

722
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,970
The time is ripe.

723
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,696
33rd year of Pom Poko.
Year's end.

724
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:30,146
It was deployment day
for the Great Monster Attack.

725
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,947
Slightly cloudy, no wind.
130, humidity 65%.

726
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,485
A perfect day for scaring humans.

727
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:18,520
It has long been known that
raccoons are highly skilled...

728
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:23,194
at morphing into ghosts.
They're born with this ability.

729
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,953
The Tama raccoons’ task was to bring
out this potential.

730
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:31,340
Just as nature's powers
can be harnessed.

731
01:08:31,975 --> 01:08:36,335
accumulating and amplifying
energy is vital.

732
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:43,726
This was the objective of the special
training by the Three Masters.

733
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,234
Males. females.
the skilled and unskilled alike,

734
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:52,095
they all participated by
contributing their energy.

735
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:58,485
That evening, the raccoons united

736
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:06,472
to use their full strength as
it had never been seen before.

737
01:09:11,913 --> 01:09:13,374
Hey look!

738
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:19,825
What's that?

739
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:40,027
Let the dead trees
all grow flowers!

740
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:06,366
Wow! A big parade of ghosts!

741
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:13,556
l used to say those sorts of things.
Like a parade of foxes...

742
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,094
But you really saw them, right?

743
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:23,260
With lanterns and all.

744
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:28,190
And the lanterns march along...

745
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,360
l wonder whatever happened?

746
01:12:37,954 --> 01:12:40,443
Can foxes really do that?

747
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:49,040
It sure seems so.
But it makes me wonder...

748
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:54,455
It's probably just your nerves.
All this talk about ghosts...

749
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:59,087
All those old stories about
foxes and lanterns...

750
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:03,342
It's all in your head.

751
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:09,361
Make you think you saw them
marching.

752
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,809
That's what nerves will do...

753
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:20,388
Of course.
How foolish to even imagine...

754
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,540
Human nerves.
They're a frightening thing.

755
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:31,304
One would think they're real.
But they can't be real.

756
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:37,244
But they're real ghosts.

757
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,968
It's all nerves, that's all.

758
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,516
Hi, honey.

759
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:52,003
Sachiko!

760
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,188
Abira Unken Sowaka!

761
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,237
Shikisoku Zeku!

762
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:09,714
Master Gyobu!

763
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,918
That was scary.

764
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,317
Aw, is it over already?

765
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:31,692
That was so cool!

766
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,975
Go inside and go to sleep now.

767
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:37,088
All right.

768
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:42,192
And be sure to brush your teeth.

769
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:48,365
I feel like 1 was in a strange dream.

770
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,994
Me too.
What could that have been?

771
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,539
Maybe there are U.F.0.s too?

772
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:58,595
Strange things do happen.

773
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,529
Long ago, when the Matsuyama
Clan was at battle,

774
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:13,077
Gyobu defected to the enemy,
causing the downfall of his clan.

775
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:17,673
He regretted it so deeply.
that he made a solemn vow.

776
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,410
He would devote his life
to fighting for justice.

777
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:26,373
Let his death not be wasted.
Let us carry on his noble ideals.

778
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:30,673
We will fight to the end,
until the day of triumph.

779
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:44,401
Raccoons, raccoons
We drink sake, we transform.

780
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,397
We will win the war!
Vietory! Victory!

781
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:54,561
In the heat of their excitement,
nobody was watching TV.

782
01:17:55,604 --> 01:18:00,234
We're looking for any video
tape of this mysterious parade.

783
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:05,806
No one has come forward yet.
investigators are perplexed.

784
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,871
! shot all that videotape,
but none of it came out.

785
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:13,164
This is really weird.

786
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:18,909
The ghost slipped in through
here and it was terrifying!

787
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:22,052
A human could never do that.

788
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:26,395
Something's very fishy here.

789
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,919
} want to move out if 1 can but...

790
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,969
At 12:20 tonight, we will bring
you a special program...

791
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,822
with in-depth coverage of this
mysterious event.

792
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,670
As the investigation goes on,

793
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:58,697
Witnesses will recognize that
what happened was real.

794
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:07,189
They can't blame it on nerves.
They can't explain it away.

795
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:12,967
The humans will be stupefied
by the mystery of the universe,

796
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:18,896
and realize the insignificance
of their existence.

797
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:24,111
Good fortune awaits us.
but let's not wait for it.

798
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:31,797
Let's wake it up. Let's celebrate!
Drink up! Sing! Dance!

799
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,940
But the next day,

800
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:43,752
the situation took an
unexpected turn.

801
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:49,867
Last night's impromptu
parade in Tama New Town

802
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:54,313
was actually a publicity stunt
for the theme park Wonderland,

803
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:56,003
which is now under construction.

804
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,012
Police have interrogated all
related parties.

805
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:01,432
Impossible!

806
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:07,374
However, local residents claim
it didn't look like a publicity event.

807
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,170
Of course not!

808
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:15,308
The president of Wonderland
confessed to last night's stunt.

809
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:17,298
What?

810
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:25,917
! would like to apologize to the
public for this disturbance.

811
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,283
What is he trying to pull?

812
01:20:28,524 --> 01:20:33,594
We are still working on the
construction of Wonderland.

813
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:39,030
But to let everyone know what
a splendid park we're building,

814
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:45,778
we decided to provide
some free entertainment.

815
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:54,552
As president of the park, !
chose to throw a surprise parade.

816
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:57,558
- Liar!
- What's he talking about!

817
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:06,890
Fortunately, we've received
enormous public support.

818
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:13,660
We are overwhelmed.

819
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:18,146
If they must lock me up for this,

820
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:23,491
!'m prepared to pay the price.

821
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,344
- What the...
- Why...

822
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:30,867
Something is very wrong here!

823
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:34,763
!f they must lock me up for this,
i'm prepared to pay the price.

824
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:36,817
That fool!

825
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:42,425
The news threw the raccoons
into a state of panic.

826
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:47,872
Meanwhile Wonderland's boss searched
for the parade's organizers.

827
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:50,244
l can't do all the work around here!

828
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:54,762
Find whoever was responsible!
Il want no stone left unturned!

829
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,527
We'll lure them in with money!
As much as it takes!

830
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:01,581
It was done by raccoons.

831
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:03,664
What? Raccoons?
Then get me a raccoon!

832
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:08,499
Any raccoon!
Contact the raccoon's manager!

833
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,938
Raccoons? What did you say?

834
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,336
l was only joking.

835
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:20,542
This is no time for jokes.
How did you get in here?

836
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:25,916
Your secretary. I phoned earlier.
My name's Ryutaro.

837
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,767
You seem to be in a tight spot,

838
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:36,505
but I'm the only one who can
talk to the men who pulled off the parade.

839
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,977
I see. I'll give you one million dollars
to close the deal.

840
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:48,120
While this strange
man pursued his scheme,

841
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:54,067
the raccoons were enraged that
their glory had been stolen.

842
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:59,823
They cried with resentment
and sunk into helplessness.

843
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:06,367
Since there was no video tape
of the ghost parade,

844
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:10,592
TV coverage tapered off.

845
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,341
You're a fox, aren't you?

846
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:36,139
Precisely. I'm Ryutaro,
transforming fox of Tama.

847
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:42,324
I've long heard tales of
the Graat Kincho from Awa.

848
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:44,285
I'm honored to be
in your presence,

849
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:50,186
I'm merely the 6th generation Kincho.
So tell ma, why are you here?

850
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,873
l was deeply moved by
your fabulous parade.

851
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,596
So you know it was us.

852
01:23:57,299 --> 01:24:01,639
Indeed. And ! understand your
despair and discouragement.

853
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:08,821
l see, 1 suppose as a fox
you would understand.

854
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,476
l also predicted what would happen
after the parade.

855
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:16,036
What did you say?

856
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:20,062
Ryutaro, the fox, invited Kincho
to join him in Ginza

857
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:24,756
in a private room at a
certain well-known club.

858
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:26,767
Please, be my guest!

859
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,707
Don't worry. all these
ladies are really foxes.

860
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:38,801
Would you prefer them
like this or as foxes?

861
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:42,095
...or shall we have them
change into raccoons?

862
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,753
Let's be frank.

863
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:51,639
Raccoons have no future in Tama.
The foxes there have already died.

864
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,245
They've perished already?
The foxes?

865
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:59,544
Yes. It's a pity. And only
a few transforming ones...

866
01:25:00,362 --> 01:25:03,642
survive by living as humans.

867
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:05,449
As humans?

868
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,797
It's the only way to survive
in a big city like Tokyo.

869
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:14,384
l brought you here to persuade
you raccoons to do likewise.

870
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:16,603
Just a moment!

871
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:20,312
l understand your shock.
But times like these,

872
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,333
call for drastic measures.
More than just living as humans.

873
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:26,499
If you swallow poison, why
not drink the whole bottle?

874
01:25:26,989 --> 01:25:31,938
The best solution is for you
all to get jobs at Wonderland.

875
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:37,061
What? Work for our enemy?

876
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:42,233
Let's think calmly. At this point
raccoons have no choice.

877
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,654
That much is given.

878
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:49,937
it takes big money to live as humans.
And how can you earn a living?

879
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:53,399
You must use what you have.

880
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:57,336
How about getting a job
where they pay the most money?

881
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:01,056
It's too bad your enemy
is Wonderland.

882
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,179
They also pay considerable
benefits.

883
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:06,621
This is the monthly salary,

884
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,608
and these are the benefits.

885
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:14,898
Of course, only I will know
that you're raccoons.

886
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:20,617
Bon appetite.

887
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:28,038
Think about it over dinner. Please
enjoy the food, Kincho Daimyojin.

888
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:32,344
You must be tired of eating
scraps from the Tama garbage.

889
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:33,881
I don't mind so much,

890
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:37,040
l have one question.

891
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:43,219
If we must live as humans, what
about those who can't transform?

892
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:45,906
Some problems ! can't solve.

893
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:50,952
At least the strongest
ones will survive.

894
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:55,383
We foxes too had to abandon
our weaker members.

895
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,117
Then...they were left to die?

896
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:01,434
Yes.
A heart-wrenching choice.

897
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:07,024
How tragic.

898
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:13,777
It might ease your mind
to note that unlike foxes,

899
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:16,816
raccoons can eat anything.
They might make it somehow.

900
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:19,843
In Kincho Daimyojin's absence,

901
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:24,924
the Tama raccoons were
discussing a countermeasure.

902
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:28,081
Only the leaders attended.

903
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,385
“We have all the weapons we need”.
We shouldn't have believed them.

904
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:36,779
It was a mistake to wait
this long in the first place.

905
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:42,383
I say. “Don't sell the pelt
until you've skinned the raccoon.”

906
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:50,315
Not even Buddha could help us.
We must not blame the elders.

907
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:57,416
Humans call a man like the Wonderland
boss, “tricky like a raccoon”.

908
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,339
You talk about humans
too much, Shokichi!

909
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:05,099
I'm just trying to learn
more about humans...

910
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:09,124
Shut up!
We must kill all the humans!

911
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:11,358
Control yourself, Gonta.

912
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:21,043
think we should tell the humans
that we started the whole thing.

913
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:27,510
Have you lost your mind?
That's just what we mustn't do.

914
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:33,600
True. If they knew it was us.
they'd be after us.

915
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:40,960
The parade was a work of art!
Why must we keep it a secret?

916
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,849
I can't bear this.

917
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:49,483
I] want to shout it out!
We are the ones who did it!

918
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:55,893
How would we get them
to believe us?

919
01:28:56,932 --> 01:29:02,791
A public declaration. Call the
TV stations, or send letters.

920
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:08,166
They'll probably think
it's a joke.

921
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,230
Then we'll go on TV and show
them our transformations.

922
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:17,911
They'll say it's just a trick
and we'll be humiliated.

923
01:29:18,954 --> 01:29:20,704
It's a waste of time arguing.

924
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,762
This much was true.

925
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:26,835
The debate went back and forth.
and on into the night.

926
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,687
This argument is a waste of time.

927
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:37,782
But if we provoke humans with violence.
they will kill us all.

928
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:41,742
That's why we shouldn't
reveal our secret!

929
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:44,557
If we reveal ourselves. we
throw away our only weapon.

930
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:52,750
In that case we don't
have much choice.

931
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:55,054
There's only one thing
we can do.

932
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,940
Instead of splitting up,
we must combine our strength.

933
01:29:57,259 --> 01:29:58,959
We must launch Monster Attack Il.

934
01:30:00,262 --> 01:30:04,012
It might end up the same.

935
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:08,299
We'll perfect a new plan
and a fresh attitude.

936
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:16,040
You just don't have the guts
to fight, you stinking girl.

937
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:20,482
Watch what you say!
Girls don't stink.

938
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:24,269
If they did, he'd be one.

939
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:28,129
l intend to start preparations
for Monster Attack Il.

940
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,834
And who will follow you?

941
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,626
Will anyone follow you?

942
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,785
What do mean by that?

943
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:39,263
Cut it out!

944
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:43,731
Everyone listen up!

945
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:48,521
There's only one way for us all
to live in unity,

946
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:54,077
and it requires the use
of your special talents.

947
01:30:56,284 --> 01:31:00,034
Your ability overwhelmed the
humans in the Monster Attack.

948
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:06,042
but unfortunately, they thought it was
done by men with inhuman talents.

949
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:09,505
Given this, what should we do?

950
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:15,579
How do you make
a boiled egg stand up?

951
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:21,009
As you know, Columbus
did it like this.

952
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:27,226
- Wow! That's great!
- Bravo!

953
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,609
Is your plan as great as that?

954
01:31:32,253 --> 01:31:36,563
From now on we will live as
inhuman “humans”.

955
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:40,343
You must be joking.

956
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,459
No, this is no joke.

957
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:45,682
But what about the ones
who can't transform?

958
01:31:46,034 --> 01:31:47,733
Where's the Reverend?

959
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:51,669
Appeal from the world of raccoons

960
01:31:54,943 --> 01:31:57,163
While the Reverand was gone,

961
01:31:57,579 --> 01:32:01,119
Kincho Daimyojin's plan was rejected.

962
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:04,357
The meeting ended in chaos.
The unity was destroyed.

963
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:10,121
There was almost no food left.

964
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:14,982
Hard-line Gonta went around
recruiting troops for his battle.

965
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:19,464
Master Hage gathered the
non-transforming raccoons...

966
01:32:20,068 --> 01:32:23,438
and gave them faith
with a new dancing religion.

967
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:30,310
These are chaotic times.
Our boat has turned to mud.

968
01:32:31,146 --> 01:32:33,835
Save us, merciful Buddha.

969
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:39,754
Look what has become of
venerable Hage.

970
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:42,772
Tokyo is such a frightening place.

971
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:47,948
In Shikoku, that parade would
have instant effect.

972
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:54,463
Offerings at our shrine would
double.,.no, quadruple!

973
01:32:55,837 --> 01:32:59,787
Kincho Daimyojin, } can't wait
any longer. All l wish now is...

974
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:03,372
to go back to Shikoku with you
to continue my training.

975
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,492
Really, Tamasaburo?

976
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:12,114
You've decided to be my successor?

977
01:33:12,554 --> 01:33:14,164
Yas, Kincho Daimyojin.

978
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:19,146
I'm relieved to hear that.
But you do this...

979
01:33:20,028 --> 01:33:26,858
not to abandon your comrades,
but because you love my daughter?

980
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:30,622
Yas, of course. But...

981
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:32,656
But what?

982
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:39,415
No one is following your orders now.
Isn't there anything we can do?

983
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:42,788
Yes, there is something we can do.

984
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:52,971
This is quite a fancy restaurant.

985
01:33:53,428 --> 01:33:58,058
We spared no expense
to please you.

986
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:09,709
Good job.
We'll even beat Disneyland.

987
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:35,349
To get revenge on the president,

988
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:40,454
Kincho Daimyojin led the raccoons
in stealing all his money.

989
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,560
The president ran to the police

990
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:47,508
to report the theft of one million dollars
by raccoons...

991
01:34:48,116 --> 01:34:49,426
but they didn't believe him.

992
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,680
That same day, Gonta's army
began their operations

993
01:34:56,224 --> 01:34:59,594
to stop the razing of
the next mountain.

994
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,595
All of you preservationists.

995
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:24,538
Leave these woods at once.

996
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:28,634
You are charged with theft,

997
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:33,070
possession of dangerous weapons
and illegal trespassing.

998
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:41,000
If you fail to evacuate immediately.
we will use force to remove you.

999
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:59,485
Gonta's troops had the police
and workers pinned to the road.

1000
01:36:00,355 --> 01:36:02,844
They could not budge an inch.

1001
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:06,494
By nightfall, both sides still
held their positions.

1002
01:36:13,868 --> 01:36:18,848
If we can't stop Gonta, we have
no choice but to help him.

1003
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:27,860
The riot police are already there.
You're too late.

1004
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:34,791
I'll just go check it out.

1005
01:36:35,556 --> 01:36:38,776
- Stop! You'll be caught!
- We're going too!

1006
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,282
Everyone ready?

1007
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:58,254
In the spirit of honor,
if we are sacrificed in battle,

1008
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:03,643
our brother raccoons
will continue to fight

1009
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:08,955
with undying determination
until our day of victory.

1010
01:37:10,024 --> 01:37:14,274
We raccoons,
with balls of steel

1011
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:19,032
swaying in the wind.

1012
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:23,481
Amen.

1013
01:37:24,072 --> 01:37:25,302
Special mission! Going through!

1014
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:26,833
- Wait. Gonta!
- Don't do anything hasty!

1015
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:28,428
Let's go!

1016
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:46,963
Gonta!

1017
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:32,336
They used their balls as weapons
in a brave kamikaze attack.

1018
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:36,443
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon.

1019
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:40,902
Just then, in another part
of the forest.

1020
01:38:41,349 --> 01:38:43,839
a TV reporter was sent to get
an interview with a raccoon.

1021
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,836
Won't you please come out?

1022
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:50,352
You can transform if you like
or stay as you are.

1023
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:56,399
We at “World Telereporter”
are on your side!

1024
01:39:00,868 --> 01:39:02,918
They're not coming out yet.

1025
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:10,267
Mr. Raccoon, can we talk?

1026
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:14,165
We have nothing to eat.

1027
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:18,532
They're responding!
The appeal is true!

1028
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:23,987
We would like to know your
reasons, Will you come out?

1029
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:28,330
There they are!
The raccoons!

1030
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:32,227
Did you really put on
the ghost parade?

1031
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,410
Yes, we did.

1032
01:39:36,237 --> 01:39:38,867
Won't you show us your fine
transforming talent

1033
01:39:39,474 --> 01:39:43,864
so our viewers will
believe you.

1034
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:48,456
Some raccoons can't transform.

1035
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:52,675
This is why we need
our forest to live.

1036
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:03,002
Listen, raccoons.

1037
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:07,475
You're making
my show look bad.

1038
01:40:09,437 --> 01:40:12,507
You all have something to say,

1039
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,880
so please show some good faith.

1040
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,031
Reverend!

1041
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:23,114
Please!
Tell the humans our demands.

1042
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:35,105
He came out! A real raccoon
statue is walking this way!

1043
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:48,630
Mr. Raccoon. please let us
hear your comments.

1044
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:53,871
We...
We...

1045
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:55,599
Yes,

1046
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:00,786
Please go on.

1047
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:10,068
We are the ones who did it!

1048
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:14,665
This forest is our home! We won't
have you taking it away from us!

1049
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:18,333
This is the wish
of all living things!

1050
01:42:01,882 --> 01:42:05,392
The people] saw yesterday
are gone today.

1051
01:42:05,987 --> 01:42:09,087
The people ! saw today
will be gone tomorrow.

1052
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:13,768
Nobody knows
about the day after that.

1053
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:16,952
But the day will come
when the people will be sorry.

1054
01:42:17,398 --> 01:42:21,498
The Battle of Yashima.
in the year 1000 AD,

1055
01:42:22,169 --> 01:42:25,099
was seen by the eyes of the
999 year old Hage,

1056
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:27,656
respected Master of raccoons.

1057
01:42:28,042 --> 01:42:31,262
Having seen enough of the world,
he decided to bid farewell.

1058
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:36,429
He took his massive balls,
and stretched them out wide

1059
01:42:37,084 --> 01:42:40,154
to make a treasure boat.

1060
01:42:43,924 --> 01:42:47,874
He filled it with treasures of
lacquer, gold, and jewels.

1061
01:42:48,529 --> 01:42:52,479
Buddha would carry them
from earth to heaven.

1062
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:57,874
Cheerfully singing
at the top of their lungs.

1063
01:42:58,673 --> 01:43:02,773
the raccoons embarked merrily
on their journey to heaven.

1064
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:10,230
The treasure boat sailed
along the Tama River,

1065
01:43:10,885 --> 01:43:14,835
floating with the waves.
rocking and swaying.

1066
01:43:15,489 --> 01:43:20,058
The sail filled with wind.
They waited for the tide.

1067
01:43:21,362 --> 01:43:24,732
Waiting for the moon,
the water rippled.

1068
01:43:25,299 --> 01:43:28,899
The treasure boat sailed,
rocking under the moon.

1069
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:36,123
It was a dreamlike night.
With bells, flutes and drums,

1070
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:42,387
and loaded full of raccoons.
full of gold, silver and coral,

1071
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:47,361
the treasure boat drifted away.

1072
01:43:47,988 --> 01:43:52,818
But before the boat turned to mud.
the other raccoons watched tearfully...

1073
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:59,675
as it entered the mist
like a dream on a night in spring.

1074
01:44:00,367 --> 01:44:06,227
As they looked up at the moon,
Buddha beckoned them to heaven.

1075
01:44:07,141 --> 01:44:11,420
And they crossed over
to the other world.

1076
01:44:12,113 --> 01:44:15,833
All the raccoons died.
On the journey of death.

1077
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:21,080
A journey with no return.
A journey of death.

1078
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:24,252
Poor raccoons.
On the journey of death.

1079
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:32,262
We're no match for the humans.

1080
01:44:53,554 --> 01:44:56,184
Bunta! Is that Bunta?

1081
01:44:59,894 --> 01:45:00,854
Tamasaburo!

1082
01:45:06,066 --> 01:45:08,675
- It's good to see you back!
- Sasuke! Shokichi!

1083
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:13,910
What happened to the elder from
Sado? Master Danzaburo?

1084
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:19,576
Well. after searching all this time.
l found that 45 years ago,

1085
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:24,287
he was shot by a hunter during
the famine after the war.

1086
01:45:25,486 --> 01:45:29,236
I see.
l was hoping to meet him...

1087
01:45:29,857 --> 01:45:32,877
Thank you for your efforts, Bunta.

1088
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:43,022
Tell me what has happened here.
I've been away for three years.

1089
01:45:44,505 --> 01:45:46,495
We've done all sorts of things.

1090
01:45:46,874 --> 01:45:50,214
But everything has changed!
Or am I crazy?

1091
01:45:50,778 --> 01:45:53,028
l understand your reaction.

1092
01:45:53,447 --> 01:45:54,757
Is this the work of the humans?

1093
01:45:55,516 --> 01:45:57,856
Yes, this is what the humans did.

1094
01:45:58,452 --> 01:46:03,432
Impossible! Only raccoons could
be this tricky. Not humans!

1095
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:07,242
Those humans cheated us!

1096
01:46:07,795 --> 01:46:11,365
They robbed us of what we had!

1097
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:16,047
Give us back our mountains!
Give us back our fields!

1098
01:46:16,604 --> 01:46:19,474
Give us back our home!

1099
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:35,620
Shall we give it another try?

1100
01:46:36,891 --> 01:46:40,641
One last effort to change this
place back to the way it was?

1101
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:46,980
Why not...We could hit
the humans with one last illusion.

1102
01:46:47,668 --> 01:46:53,907
Sounds interesting.
l can see the scenery already.

1103
01:46:54,875 --> 01:46:58,065
Perfect. Our last victory!

1104
01:46:58,746 --> 01:47:02,056
But, what would it prove?
To do something like that now?

1105
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:05,497
For our amusement...
our amusement.

1106
01:47:05,953 --> 01:47:11,193
A raccoon's not a raccoon
without a playful spirit.

1107
01:47:12,259 --> 01:47:14,599
Will you help us too, Master?

1108
01:47:15,195 --> 01:47:18,884
Of course. If you don't mind
a little southern flair.

1109
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:20,847
Ponkichi!

1110
01:47:21,035 --> 01:47:24,055
I'm here! Let's go tell
those who are left.

1111
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:26,321
Lend me your energy again?

1112
01:47:26,674 --> 01:47:27,754
You can count on me!

1113
01:49:22,623 --> 01:49:25,112
Wait for me, big brother!

1114
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:41,263
Oh, that looks like Mother.

1115
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,218
It's Yotchan! Yotchan!

1116
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:18,385
That's us there!
It's us when we were little!

1117
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:27,686
Hey! Raccoons!

1118
01:50:28,388 --> 01:50:30,577
Oh, cute!

1119
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:33,919
Look Mom, raccoons!

1120
01:50:34,228 --> 01:50:38,238
They're back again!
Even in a place like this.

1121
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:44,943
Wait. raccoons!

1122
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:51,018
Aww, they left.

1123
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:54,659
l wanted to give them some food.

1124
01:50:55,115 --> 01:50:57,665
Can raccoons really transform?

1125
01:51:02,322 --> 01:51:04,462
That's how we lost our battle.

1126
01:51:05,092 --> 01:51:09,432
And the New Town development
continued with no obstacles.

1127
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:15,036
As the days went by.
the new scene grew familiar.

1128
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:18,979
For humans.
it was a nice place to live.

1129
01:51:20,507 --> 01:51:24,986
Trendy new condominiums were
built where the temple once was.

1130
01:51:26,113 --> 01:51:27,953
It turned out to be
a good decision...

1131
01:51:28,315 --> 01:51:33,674
that we revealed ourselves
to the humans that time.

1132
01:51:34,855 --> 01:51:37,044
The result was a community...

1133
01:51:37,457 --> 01:51:39,887
that made efforts to live in
harmony with the raccoons.

1134
01:51:40,327 --> 01:51:47,507
The humans also left the rest of our
trees alone, and made several parks.

1135
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:54,183
But for us, it was too late.
There wasn't room for us to live.

1136
01:51:55,475 --> 01:52:00,895
Some of us went over the mountain
to live in a town called Machida.

1137
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:04,116
But there were raccoons there too...

1138
01:52:04,551 --> 01:52:06,251
who suffered because of
suburban development.

1139
01:52:06,587 --> 01:52:10,247
Many were killed on the road.
The days got harder and harder.

1140
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:17,810
Then, we made
the fateful decision.

1141
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:36,261
That's right. Those of us who can
transform are living as humans,

1142
01:52:37,017 --> 01:52:39,387
just like the foxes.

1143
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:43,294
I have a desk job and my wife.
Kiyo, works at a bar.

1144
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:49,511
Some got rich in real estate,
selling our forests to developers.

1145
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:55,317
But many of us are exhausted and
want to go back to the forest.

1146
01:52:57,271 --> 01:53:01,581
How can humans endure
living like this?

1147
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:06,632
There are some who drop out
and live in the city streets,

1148
01:53:07,314 --> 01:53:10,624
eating discarded food in the alleys.

1149
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:20,615
How about Ponkichi and the
other ordinary raccoons?

1150
01:53:48,322 --> 01:53:52,572
“Carefree living” is an expression
made for raccoons.

1151
01:53:53,593 --> 01:53:57,693
They overcome all obstacles.
live happily and freely,

1152
01:53:58,365 --> 01:54:02,965
make babies with a
carefree spirit and die.

1153
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:45,940
There's always someone...

1154
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:49,593
By my side...

1155
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,619
Ponkichi!

1156
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:58,790
Shokichi!

1157
01:55:02,062 --> 01:55:04,612
- Welcome back!
- You haven't changed a bit!

1158
01:55:05,732 --> 01:55:08,662
There's always sure to be...

1159
01:55:09,503 --> 01:55:12,343
Someone by my side.

1160
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:19,357
Even if you go far away...
From the place you were born,

1161
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:26,206
You'll never be forgotten...
Whenever you return.

1162
01:55:27,053 --> 01:55:29,603
On TV, they're saying
that foxes and raccoons

1163
01:55:30,056 --> 01:55:33,186
erased themselves from the
development areas.

1164
01:55:33,727 --> 01:55:35,367
Could you stop doing that?

1165
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:40,073
It's probably true that some raccoons and
foxes can make themselves invisible,

1166
01:55:41,268 --> 01:55:44,198
but how about the
rabbits and weasels?

1167
01:55:45,272 --> 01:55:47,412
There are those of us who can't
simply disappear.
