Movietown News presents
Spotlight on Adventure.

2
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,190
What you are now witnessing

3
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,641
is footage never before seen
by civilized humanity,

4
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,547
a lost world in South America.

5
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,789
Lurking in the shadow
of majestic Paradise Falls,

6
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,971
it sports plants and animals
undiscovered by science.

7
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,094
Who would dare set foot
on this inhospitable summit?

8
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,000
Why, our subject today,
Charles Muniz!

9
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,312
The beloved explorer lands
his dirigible, the Spirit of Adventure,

10
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,941
in New Hampshire this week,

11
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,869
completing a yearlong expedition
to the lost world.

12
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,953
This lighter-than-air craft
was designed by Muntz himself

13
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,829
and is longer than 22 prohibition
paddy wagons placed end to end.

14
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,833
And here comes the adventurer now.

15
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,143
Never apart from his faithful dogs,

16
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,478
Muniz conceived the craft
for canine comfort.

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,640
It's a veritable floating palace
in the sky,

18
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:39,015
complete with doggy bath
and mechanical canine walker.

19
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,307
And, Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
consider Muntz the bee's knees.

20
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,007
And how!

21
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,356
Adventure is out there!

22
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,020
But what has Muntz brought back
this time?

23
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,572
Gentlemen, I give you
the monster of Paradise Falls!

24
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,755
And, golly,
what a swell monster this is!

25
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,639
But what's this? Scientists cry foul.

26
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,895
The National Explorer's Society
accuses Muntz

27
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,780
of fabricating the skeleton.

28
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,086
No!

29
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,997
The organization strips Muntz
of his membership.

30
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,696
Humiliated, Muntz vows
a return to Paradise Falls

31
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,659
and promises
to capture the beast alive!

32
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,479
! promise to capture the beast alive,

33
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,522
and I will not come back until I do!

34
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,337
And so, the explorer's off
to clear his name.

35
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,213
Bon voyage, Charles Muniz,

36
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,391
and good luck capturing
the monster of Paradise Falls!

37
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,926
Here's Charles Muntz
piloting his famous dirigible.

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,440
He hurdles Pikes Peak.

39
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,020
He hurdles the Grand Canyon.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,120
He hurdles Mount Everest.

41
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:08,019
He goes around Mount Everest.

42
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,071
He goes around Mount Everest.

43
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,298
ls there nothing he cannot do?

44
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,539
Yes, as Muntz himself says,
"Adventure is..."

45
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,935
Adventure is out there! Look out!

46
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,015
Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!

47
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,885
Must get Spirit of Adventure
over Mount Rushmore!

48
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,978
Hold together, old girl.
How're my dogs doing?

49
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:36,385
All engines, ahead full!
Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.

50
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,567
Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.

51
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,326
It's a beautiful day.
Winds out of the east at 10 knots.

52
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,790
Visibility unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook.

53
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,262
There's something down there.
I will bring it back for science.

54
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,827
It's a puppy! No time!
A storm! Lightning. Hail.

55
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,866
What are you doing?

56
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,765
Don't you know
this is an exclusive club?

57
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,874
Only explorers get in here,

58
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:09,613
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles.

59
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,897
Do you think you've got what it takes?
Well, do you?

60
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,647
All right, you're in. Welcome aboard.

61
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,678
What's wrong? Can't you talk?

62
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,227
Hey, I don't bite.

63
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,015
You and me, we're in a club now.

64
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,733
l saw where your balloon went.
Come on. Let's go get it.

65
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,941
My name's Ellie.

66
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,666
There it is.

67
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,685
Well, go ahead.

68
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,132
Go on.

69
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,179
Hey, kid!

70
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,014
Thought you might need
a little cheering up.

71
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,660
I got something to show you.

72
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,271
I got something to show you.

73
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,840
lam about to let you see something

74
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,633
I have never shown
to another human being.

75
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,199
Ever! In my life!

76
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,342
You'll have to swear
you will not tell anyone.

77
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,849
Cross your heart. Do it!

78
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,462
My Adventure Book.

79
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,186
You know him.

80
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:54,237
You know him.

81
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,738
Charles Muntz, explorer.

82
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,851
When I get big,
I'm going where he's going,

83
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:06,318
South America.
It's like America, but south.

84
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,868
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

85
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,189
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

86
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,680
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

87
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,666
I ripped this right out of a library book.

88
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,138
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there
and park it right next to the falls.

89
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,090
Who knows what lives up there.

90
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,220
And once I get there?

91
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:28,541
And once I get there?

92
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,998
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.

93
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:38,017
Only I just don't know
how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.

94
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,069
That's it!
You can take us there in a blimp!

95
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,149
Swear you'll take us! Cross your heart!

96
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:56,945
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good, you promised. No backing out.

97
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:57,133
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good, you promised. No backing out.

98
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,419
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

99
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,440
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

100
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,878
Adventure is out there!

101
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,765
You know, you don't talk very much.

102
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,105
I like you!

103
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:13,919
Wow.

104
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,845
Stevie, throw me a deuce!

105
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,059
Quite a sight, huh, Ellie?

106
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,931
Mail's here.

107
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,961
Shady Oaks Retirement. Oh, brother.

108
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,470
Hey! Morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
Need any help there?

109
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,651
No. Yes!

110
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,632
Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.

111
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,490
Well, just to let you know,

112
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,018
my boss will be happy to take
this old place off your hands,

113
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,547
and for double his last offer!

114
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,276
What do you say to that?

115
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,550
l take that as a "no," then?

116
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,772
I believe made my position
to your boss quite clear.

117
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,526
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

118
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,698
Yeah, that was good.
Here, let me talk to him.

119
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:56,168
You in the suit.
Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie!

120
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,033
1am not with him!

121
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,529
This is serious!
He's out to get your house.

122
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,659
Tell your boss he can have our house.

123
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,248
-Really?
-When I'm dead!

124
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,150
I'll take that as a maybe.

125
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:17,421
Order now, you get the camera,
you get the printer, 4x optical zoom,

126
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,307
Schneider lens, photo printer, SD card.

127
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,148
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell.

128
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:33,281
"And lam a Wilderness Explorer
in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12.

129
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,699
"Are you in need
of any assistance today, sir?"

130
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:37,986
No.

131
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,983
-l could help you cross the street.
-No.

132
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,983
-l could help you cross your yard.
-No.

133
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,735
-l could help you cross your porch.
-No.

134
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,365
Well, I gotta help you cross something.

135
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,497
No. I'm doing fine.

136
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,410
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell."

137
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,596
-Kid... Kid.
-"And l am a Wilderness Explorer

138
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,032
-"in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."
-l... Slow down. Kid!

139
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,589
-"Are you in need of any assistance..."
-Thank you,

140
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,194
-but I don't need any help!
-"...today, sir?"

141
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:21,783
Proceed.

142
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,025
-"Good afternoon..."
-But skip to the end!

143
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,789
See these? These are
my Wilderness Explorer badges.

144
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,856
You may notice one is missing.
It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.

145
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:39,704
If 1 get it, 1 will become
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

146
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,723
"The wilderness must be explored!"

147
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,692
It's gonna be great!
There's a big ceremony,

148
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,211
and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges.

149
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,445
So, you want to assist an old person?

150
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,740
Yep! Then I'll be
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

151
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,175
-You ever heard of a snipe?
-Snipe?

152
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,372
Bird. Beady eyes.

153
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,200
Every night it sneaks in my yard
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

154
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,825
I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it.
If only someone could help me.

155
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,527
-Me, me! I'll do it!
-I don't know. It's awfully crafty.

156
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,704
You'd have to clap your hands
three times to lure it in.

157
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,690
I'll find him, Mr. Fredricksen!

158
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,089
I think its burrow is two blocks down.
If you go past...

159
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,138
Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe.

160
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,212
Here, snipey, snipey.

161
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,071
Bring it back here when you find it.

162
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,255
Snipe!

163
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,357
Okay, keep her coming. Keep coming.

164
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:40,223
And stop. Stop. Stop!

165
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,018
Why... Hey! Hey, you!

166
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,841
What do you...
What do you think you're doing?

167
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,273
-lam so sorry, sir.
-Don't touch that!

168
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,009
No, no, no.
Let me take care of that for you.

169
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,084
-Get away from our mailbox!
-Hey. Sir, I...

170
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,629
I don't want you to touch it!

171
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,616
Steve, you all right?

172
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,891
Sorry, Mr. Fredricksen.

173
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,981
You don't seem like
a public menace to me. Take this.

174
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,129
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?

175
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,617
What do I do now, Ellie?

176
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,239
Morning, gentlemen.

177
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,350
Morning, gentlemen.

178
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:44,024
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
You ready to go?

179
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,405
Ready as I'll ever be.

180
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,763
Would you do me a favor
and take this?

181
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,168
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute.

182
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:56,301
Il wanna say one last goodbye
to the old place.

183
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,466
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.

184
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,871
That's typical. He's probably
going to the bathroom for the 80th time.

185
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,712
You think he'd take better care
of his house.

186
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,774
So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

187
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,850
We're on our way, Ellie.

188
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,862
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell.

189
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,109
What are you doing out here, kid?

190
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,728
I found the snipe
and I followed it under your porch,

191
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:50,505
but this snipe had a long tail
and looked more like a large mouse.

192
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,389
Please let me in.

193
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,124
No.

194
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,847
Alright, you can come

195
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,297
.
In.

196
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,167
I've never been
in a floating house before.

197
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,588
Goggles. Look at this stuff.
Wow! You're going on a trip?

198
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,479
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

199
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,516
You're going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?

200
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,471
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.

201
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,580
You know, most people take a plane,

202
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,835
but you're smart because you will
have all your TV and clocks and stuff.

203
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,918
Whoa.
Is this how you steer your house?

204
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,835
Does it really work?

205
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,101
Kid, would you stop with the...

206
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:48,723
-This makes it go right.
-Let go of that...

207
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,204
-And that way's left.
-Knock it off!

208
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,390
Hey, look! Buildings.

209
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:57,253
That building's so close
I could almost touch it.

210
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,735
Wow! This is great!

211
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,299
You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen.

212
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,624
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

213
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,354
Hey! I can see your house from here.

214
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,951
Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa!

215
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,018
Well, that's not gonna work.

216
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,190
I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus.

217
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,050
Did you know that
the cumulonimbus

218
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:25,927
forms when warm air
rises over cool air?

219
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,054
Stayed up all night blowing up balloons
for what?

220
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:30,545
..and that's how we get lightning.

221
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,429
-That's nice, kid.
-Mr. Fredricksen?

222
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,098
There's a storm coming.
It's starting to get scary.

223
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,687
We're gonna get blown to bits!
We're in big trouble...

224
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,967
-What are you doing over there?
-Look.

225
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:43,048
-What are you doing over there?
-Look.

226
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,586
See? Cumulonimbus.

227
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:33,818
My pack!

228
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:39,966
Got you!

229
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,929
l thought you were dead.

230
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,124
What happened?

231
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,388
I steered us. I did. I steered the house.

232
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:27,805
Steered us?

233
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,470
After you tied your stuff down,
you took a nap.

234
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,809
So l went ahead
and steered us down here.

235
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,488
Yeah. Sure.

236
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,516
Can't tell where we are.

237
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,578
We're in South America, all right.

238
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,090
It was a cinch
with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.

239
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,004
-GP... What?
-My dad gave it to me.

240
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,013
It shows exactly where we are
on the planet.

241
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,171
With this baby, we'll never be lost!

242
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,904
We'll get you down, find a bus stop,

243
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,917
you just tell the man
you wanna go back to your mother.

244
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,640
Sure, but I don't think
they have buses in Paradise Falls.

245
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,273
There. That ought to do it.

246
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,245
Here, I'll give you
some change for bus fare.

247
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,969
No, I'll just use my city bus pass.

248
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,050
No, I'll just use my city bus pass.

249
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,461
Whoa. That's gonna be
like a billion transfers

250
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,397
to get back to my house.

251
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,666
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

252
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,488
Well, we're up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.

253
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,474
That thing was...
Building or something.

254
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,658
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

255
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,077
We can't be close to the ground yet.

256
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,782
Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't!

257
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,679
Wait, wait. Wait!

258
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,763
-Russell, hang on! Hey!
-Whoa! Whoa!

259
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,623
-Walk back. Walk back.
-Okay.

260
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,511
Come on. Come on.

261
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,802
Where... Where are we?

262
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,438
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.

263
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,569
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

264
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,429
There it is.

265
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,932
Ellie, it's so beautiful.

266
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:03,951
We made it.

267
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:08,446
We made it! Russell! We could float
right over there! Climb up. Climb up!

268
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,327
You mean, assist you?

269
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,225
-Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
-Okay. I'll climb up.

270
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,377
-Watch it!
-Sorry.

271
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,539
Now, when you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up!

272
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,191
Got it?

273
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,060
You on the porch yet?

274
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,422
What? That's it?

275
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:53,637
I came all this way just to get stuck
at the wrong end of this rock pile?

276
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,147
Great.

277
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:05,229
Hey, if l could assist you over there,
would you sign off on my badge?

278
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,538
-What are you talking about?
-We could walk your house to the falls.

279
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,286
-Walk it?
-Yeah! After all, we weigh it down.

280
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,726
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.

281
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,297
Now, we're gonna walk to the falls
quickly and quietly

282
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,114
with no rap music or flashdancing.

283
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,780
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those balloons.

284
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,585
And if we're not at the falls
when that happens...

285
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,031
-Sand.
-...we're not getting to the falls.

286
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,056
l found sand!

287
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,376
Don't you worry, Ellie.
We'll get our house over there.

288
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,531
This is fun already, isn't it?

289
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,357
By the time we get there,
you're gonna feel so assisted.

290
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:59,138
Mr. Fredricksen,
if we happen to get separated,

291
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,477
use the Wilderness Explorer call.

292
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,473
Wait. Why are we going
to Paradise Falls again?

293
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,723
Hey, let's play a game.

294
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,891
It's called
"see who can be quiet the longest."

295
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,875
Cool! My mom loves that game!

296
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,873
Darn thing!

297
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,530
Come on, Russell.
Would you hurry it up?

298
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,575
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.

299
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:29,563
Which knee?

300
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:34,262
My elbow hurts,
and I have to go to the bathroom.

301
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,299
l asked you about that five minutes ago.

302
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,516
Well, I didn't have to go then!

303
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:46,653
I don't wanna walk anymore.
Can we stop?

304
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,195
Russell, if you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

305
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:54,551
There are no tigers in South America.
Zoology.

306
00:35:57,222 --> 00:36:00,002
For the love of Pete! Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

307
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,362
Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.

308
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,976
I've always wanted to try this.

309
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:15,146
Mr. Fredricksen, am I supposed
to dig the hole before or after?

310
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,045
None of my concern!

311
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,945
It's before!

312
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,017
Tracks?

313
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,444
Snipe.

314
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,670
Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe.

315
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,701
Snipe.

316
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:04,083
Gotcha! Don't be afraid, little snipe.

317
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,626
lam a Wilderness Explorer,
so I'm a friend to all of nature.

318
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,288
Want some more?

319
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,655
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.

320
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:24,175
Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

321
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,987
Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice...

322
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,245
Giant snipe.

323
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:39,984
-I found the snipe!
-Did you?

324
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,712
-Are they tall?
-Yes, they're very tall.

325
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,841
-Do they have a lot of colors?
-They do, indeed!

326
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,598
-Do they like chocolate?
-Yes... Chocolate?

327
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,284
-What is that thing?
-It's a snipe!

328
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,453
There's no such thing as a snipe!

329
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,499
-But you said snipes eat your... Whoa!
-Hey!

330
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,410
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!

331
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,493
Careful, Russell!

332
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,158
Hey, look, Mr. Fredricksen.
It likes me. Whoa!

333
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,652
-Russell!
-No, stop! That tickles.

334
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,915
Get out of here! Go on! Get!

335
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:38,789
No, no, no! Kevin!
It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

336
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,311
-Kevin?
-Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.

337
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,535
Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
Hey! That's mine!

338
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,811
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

339
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,890
Go on! Beat it!

340
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,616
Can we keep him? Please?

341
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:07,337
I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.
I'll change his newspapers.

342
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:08,901
No.

343
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,891
"An Explorer is a friend to all,
be it plants or fish or tiny mole."

344
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,859
-That doesn't even rhyme.
-Yeah, it does.

345
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,919
-Hey, look. Kevin.
-What?

346
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,359
Get down! You're not allowed up there!

347
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,060
Get down! You're not allowed up there!

348
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,854
You come down here right now!

349
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,251
Can you believe this, Ellie?

350
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:36,537
Ellie?

351
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,078
Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?

352
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,575
She said for you to let me.

353
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,464
But I told him no. I told you no!

354
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,019
N-O.

355
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,196
Il see you back there.

356
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,712
Go on! Get out of here! Shoo!
Go annoy someone else for a while.

357
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,294
Hey, are you okay over there?

358
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:16,957
Hello?

359
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,006
Hello, sir! Thank goodness.

360
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,533
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

361
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,446
I can smell you.

362
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,051
What? You can smell us?

363
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,626
I can smell you.

364
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,075
Hey.

365
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,450
You were talking to a rock.

366
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,549
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.

367
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,612
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog.

368
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,200
-It is a dog!
-What?

369
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:01,046
We're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.

370
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,841
Hey, I like dogs.

371
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,625
We have your dog!

372
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,048
-Whoa!
-Wonder who he belongs to.

373
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,470
Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained. Shake.

374
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,049
-Speak.
-Hi, there.

375
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,185
Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?

376
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,567
Oh, yes.

377
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:24,726
My name is Dug.
l have just met you, and I love you.

378
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,920
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master,

379
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,460
and he made me this collar
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

380
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:35,991
My master is good and smart.

381
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,420
-It's not possible.
-It is, because my master is smart.

382
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,894
-Cool! What do these do, boy?
-Hey, would you...

383
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,187
l use that collar...

384
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,560
..to talk with.
I would be happy if you stopped.

385
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,928
Russell, don't touch that!
It could be radioactive or something!

386
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,552
lam a great tracker.

387
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,500
My pack sent me on a special mission
all by myself.

388
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,940
Have you seen a bird?

389
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,141
l want to find one,
and I've been on the scent.

390
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,386
lam a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

391
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,357
Hey, that is the bird.

392
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,172
I have never seen one up close,
but this is the bird.

393
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,795
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

394
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,674
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog.

395
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,725
Il can bark.

396
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,614
And here's howling.

397
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,096
Can we keep him?
Please, please, please!

398
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:27,319
-No.
-But it's a talking dog!

399
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:30,852
It's just a weird trick or something.
Let's get to the falls.

400
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,759
Please be my prisoner.

401
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,244
Please, please be my prisoner!

402
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,180
Here it is. l picked up the bird's scent!

403
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,642
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
What is this?

404
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,695
Chocolate. 1 smell chocolate.

405
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:49,897
I'm getting prunes and denture cream!
Who are they?

406
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,667
Man, Master will not be pleased.

407
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,614
We better tell him someone
took the bird. Right, Alpha?

408
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:01,182
No, Soon enough
the bird will be ours yet again.

409
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,643
Find the scent, my compadres,

410
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,528
and you too shall
have much rewardings

411
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,220
from Master for the toil factor
you wage.

412
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,923
Hey, Alpha, I think there's something
wrong with your collar.

413
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,473
You must've bumped it.

414
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,714
Yeah, your voice sounds funny!

415
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:23,404
Beta! Gamma!
Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!

416
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,750
Mayhaps you desire
to challenge the ranking

417
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,356
that l have been assigned
by my strength and cunning.

418
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:34,055
No, no, no. But maybe Dug would.
You might wanna ask him.

419
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:39,823
Yeah. I wonder if he's found the bird
on his very special mission.

420
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:42,328
Do not mention Dug to me at this time.

421
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:47,314
His fool's errand will keep him
most occupied. Most occupied indeed.

422
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,687
Do you not agree with that
which I am saying to you now?

423
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:56,944
Sure, but the second Master finds out
you sent Dug out by himself,

424
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,908
none of us will get a treat.

425
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,020
You are wise, my trusted lieutenant.

426
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,392
This is Alpha calling Dug.
Come in, Dug.

427
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:09,328
Hi, Alpha.
Hey, your voice sounds funny.

428
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,437
! know, I know!
Have you seen the bird?

429
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,317
Why, yes. The bird is my prisoner now.

430
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,013
Yeah, right!

431
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:20,777
Impossible! Where are you?

432
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,292
1 am here with the bird,

433
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,960
and I will bring it back,
and then you will like me.

434
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,536
-Gotta go.
-Hey, Dug, who you talking to?

435
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,571
-No, wait, wait!
-What's Dug doing?

436
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:33,000
-Why's he with that small mailman?
-Where are they?

437
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,607
There he is. Come on!

438
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,850
Oh, please, oh, please,
oh, please be my prisoner.

439
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,513
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

440
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,454
That man there says
l can take the bird,

441
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:51,186
and I love that man there
like he is my master.

442
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:52,522
lam not your master!

443
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:54,097
lam warning you once again, bird.

444
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:56,142
-Hey! Quit it!
-lam jumping on you now, bird.

445
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,484
Russell, at this rate,
we'll never get to the falls.

446
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,033
Here, bird.

447
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,842
lam nobody's master, got it?

448
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,314
I don't want you here,
and I don't want you here!

449
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,820
I'm stuck with you!

450
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,418
And if you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

451
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:19,037
A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy! A ball!

452
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,470
Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy?

453
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:24,668
Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah?

454
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,702
Yes, I do! 1 do ever so want the ball.

455
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,318
-Go get it!
-Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

456
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,203
I will get it and then bring it back!

457
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:31,837
Quick, Russell.
Give me some chocolate.

458
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,909
-Why?
-Just give it to me!

459
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,835
Bird. Bird!

460
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,952
Come on, Russell.

461
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,618
Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

462
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,605
What are we doing?

463
00:45:54,652 --> 00:45:58,492
Hey, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.

464
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,404
I think that did the trick.

465
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,769
Hi, Master.

466
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:11,941
Afternoon.

467
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,401
Well, thanks for keeping us
dry anyway, Ellie.

468
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,508
Which one's the front?

469
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:45,485
Oh, boy.

470
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,955
Is this step three or step five?

471
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,822
There.

472
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,967
All done! That's for you.

473
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,114
Tents are hard.

474
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:13,466
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,
with the GPMs and the badges?

475
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:18,369
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?

476
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,933
-No.
-All right. Here it goes.

477
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,927
I never actually built a tent before.
There, I said it.

478
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,784
You've been camping before,
haven't you?

479
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,286
Well, never outside.

480
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:35,106
Well, why didn't you ask your dad
how to build a tent?

481
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,450
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

482
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,199
Well, why don't you try him sometime.
Maybe he'll surprise you.

483
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,645
Well, he's away a lot.
I don't see him much.

484
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,457
He's gotta be home sometime.

485
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:49,453
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

486
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,087
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

487
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,521
Phyllis isn't my mom.

488
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:58,892
Oh.

489
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,790
But he promised
he'd come to my Explorer ceremony

490
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,817
to pin on
my Assisting the Elderly badge.

491
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:17,042
So, he can show me
about tents then, right?

492
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:26,248
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?

493
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,034
Don't wanna wake up
the traveling flea circus.

494
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:33,853
Mr. Fredricksen?

495
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:36,634
Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner.

496
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,582
We have to protect him.

497
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,832
Can Kevin go with us?

498
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,395
All right, he can come.

499
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,165
Promise you won't leave him?

500
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,770
-Yeah.
-Cross your heart?

501
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:02,949
Cross my heart.

502
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,882
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

503
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:35,925
Morning, sweetheart.

504
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,682
We better get moving.

505
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:43,783
Bird's gone.

506
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:47,147
Maybe Russell won't notice.
All right, everybody up!

507
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:52,352
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

508
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,359
Find the bird, find the bird!
Hi, hi. Point!

509
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,537
Look. There he is!

510
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,221
Point!

511
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,956
Hey! That's my food! Get off my roof!

512
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,144
Yeah, get off of his...

513
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,274
What is it doing?

514
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,622
The bird is calling to her babies.

515
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:19,342
Her babies.

516
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:22,228
Kevin's a girl?

517
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,225
Her house is over there
in those twisty rocks.

518
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:31,849
She has been gathering food for
her babies and must get back to them.

519
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,826
Wait. Kevin's just leaving?

520
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,938
But you promised to protect her.

521
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,207
Her babies need her.
We gotta make sure they're together!

522
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,366
Sorry, Russell.
We've lost enough time already.

523
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,174
Yeah.

524
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,394
This was her favorite chocolate.

525
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,897
Because you sent her away,
there's more for you.

526
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,187
Kevin?

527
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,604
Where's the bird?
You said you had the bird.

528
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:31,104
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

529
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:34,015
Since I have said that,
I can see how you would think that.

530
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,151
-Where is it?
-Tomorrow.

531
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:41,088
Come back tomorrow, and then
I will again have the bird. Yes.

532
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,990
You fost it!
Why do ! not have a surprised feeling?

533
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:49,814
Well, at least you now have led us
to the small mailman

534
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,497
and the one who smells of prunes.

535
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,681
Master will be most pleased
we have found them

536
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,631
and will ask of them many questions.
Come!

537
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:03,183
Wait. We're not going with you!
We're going to the falls!

538
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,613
Get away from me!

539
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,201
Get down!

540
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,680
Stay!

541
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,310
You came here in that?

542
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,209
Yeah.

543
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:24,505
In a house? A floating house?

544
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,970
That is the darnedest thing
I've ever seen.

545
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:39,104
You're not after my bird, are you?

546
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,073
But if you needed to borrow
a cup of sugar,

547
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:44,446
I'd be happy to oblige.

548
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,375
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.

549
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:52,741
My dogs made a mistake.

550
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,677
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

551
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,375
Yeah, well, yes.

552
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,642
THE Charles Muntz?

553
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:02,975
"Adventure is out there!"

554
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:06,377
It's really him! That's Charles Muntz!

555
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:10,073
-It is? Who's Charles Muntz?
-Him!

556
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,191
-Yes! Yes! That's him!
-I'm Carl Fredricksen.

557
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,976
My wife and I,
we were your biggest fans.

558
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,669
Oh, well. You're a man of good taste.

559
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,396
Now, you must be tired. Hungry?

560
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:22,609
Uh-huh!

561
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,165
Now, attention, everyone!

562
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,798
These people are no longer intruders!
They are our guests.

563
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,551
Follow me. I like you temporarily.

564
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,686
You do smell like prunes.

565
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,401
I will not bite you.

566
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,781
The small mailman
smells like chocolate.

567
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:44,216
I'm sorry about the dogs.

568
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,211
-Hope they weren't too rough on you.
-We weren't.

569
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,704
Go ahead and moor your airship
right next to mine.

570
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,894
We're not actually going inside
the Spirit of Adventure itself?

571
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:03,102
Would you like to?

572
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,480
Would I?

573
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,414
Wait up, Mr. Muntz.

574
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,816
Jiminy Cricket.

575
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,125
-Not you.
-What do we do with Dug?

576
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,757
He has lost the bird.
Put him in the Cone of Shame.

577
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:24,239
I do not like the Cone of Shame.

578
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:27,857
Well, most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums,

579
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,878
Well, most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums,

580
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,540
New York, Munich, London.
Of course, I kept the best for myself.

581
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:36,858
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

582
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:39,491
Yes, the Arsinoitherium.

583
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,243
Beast charged
while l was brushing my teeth.

584
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,102
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.

585
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,002
Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me.

586
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:49,421
Only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time

587
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,393
was to have it declared
as dental equipment.

588
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:56,147
Oh, my gosh!
The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!

589
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,176
You recognize it. I'm impressed.

590
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,640
That's an interesting story there.

591
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,819
Excellent choice.

592
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,437
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.

593
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:11,398
He and I fell into a habit
of playing gin rummy in the evenings,

594
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,549
and did he cheat!

595
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,831
He was horrible.

596
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,053
Master, dinner is ready.

597
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,583
Oh, dear. Broken translator.

598
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:25,955
It's that loose wire again.
There you go, big fella.

599
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:27,817
Thank you, Master.

600
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,985
I liked his other voice.

601
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:34,361
Well, dinner is served. Right this way.

602
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:38,676
So, how are things stateside, huh?

603
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,272
Almost tempted to go back a few times,

604
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,913
but I have unfinished work here.

605
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,945
Please. I hope you're hungry,

606
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:52,185
because Epsilon is the finest chef
I've ever had.

607
00:56:58,115 --> 00:57:00,194
Epsilon, you've done it again!

608
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,484
Yes!

609
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,950
Hey! Hey!

610
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:08,306
My Ellie would've loved all this.

611
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,895
You know, it's because of you
she had this dream

612
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:13,605
to come down here
and live by Paradise Falls.

613
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,250
I'm honored. And now you've made it.

614
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,807
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

615
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,742
No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests,
a real treat.

616
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,570
-Treat! Where's the treat!
-Treat!

617
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,471
No, no. Quiet! Calm down, calm down.

618
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,205
-l want a treat! 1 want a treat!
-Hey!

619
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:30,848
I shouldn't have used that word.

620
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,518
Having guests is a delight.

621
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,351
More often I get thieves
come to steal what's rightfully mine.

622
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:38,790
No!

623
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:44,425
They called me a fraud, those...

624
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,993
But once I bring back this creature,
my name will be cleared.

625
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,100
Beautiful, isn't it?

626
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,349
I've spent a lifetime tracking it.

627
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:04,017
Sometimes years go by
between sightings.

628
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,492
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives.

629
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,317
You can't go in after it.

630
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,986
Once in, there's no way out.

631
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:17,596
I've lost so many dogs.

632
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,450
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to take.

633
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:30,122
But they soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.

634
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,320
Hey, that looks like Kevin.

635
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:40,107
-Kevin?
-Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.

636
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,360
I trained it to follow us.

637
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,499
Follow you? It's impossible. How?

638
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,529
-She likes chocolate.
-Chocolate?

639
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:49,725
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

640
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:52,716
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

641
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,900
But it ran off. It's gone now.

642
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:06,686
You know, Carl, these people
who pass through here,

643
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:09,624
they all tell pretty good stories.

644
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,611
A surveyor making a map.

645
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,743
A botanist cataloging plants.

646
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,109
An old man taking his house
to Paradise Falls.

647
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:37,941
I mean, that's the best one yet.
l can't wait to hear how it ends.

648
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:51,278
Well, it's been a wonderful evening,
but we better be going.

649
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:52,962
You're not leaving.

650
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:56,413
We don't want to take advantage
of your hospitality.

651
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,740
-Come on, Russell.
-But we haven't even had dessert yet.

652
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,810
The boy's right.
You haven't had dessert.

653
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,340
Epsilon here makes
a delicious cherries jubilee.

654
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,766
You really must stay. I insist.

655
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:14,863
We have so much more to talk about.

656
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:20,506
Kevin?

657
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:29,595
It's here.

658
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,134
Get them!

659
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,845
-Hurry!
-lam hurrying!

660
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:40,329
They're coming!

661
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,922
Master, over here.

662
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,747
Go toward the light, Master!

663
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:33,125
Russell!

664
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:39,021
Get back!

665
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:45,275
Go on, Master! I will stop the dogs!

666
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,403
Stop, you dogs.

667
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:17,927
Help!

668
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:19,745
Help!

669
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,423
Help!

670
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,899
Give me your hand!

671
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:40,979
Hang on to Kevin!

672
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:13,989
Kevin.

673
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:41,314
Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.

674
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:46,562
She's hurt real bad.
Can't we help her get home?

675
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:00,321
All right, but we gotta hurry.

676
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:08,600
You lost them?

677
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:09,898
No, it was Dug.

678
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:13,046
Yeah. He's with them.
He helped them escape!

679
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,721
Wait.

680
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,802
Wait a minute. Dug.

681
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:26,357
See anything?

682
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:29,616
No. My pack is not following us.
Boy, they are dumb.

683
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,443
This is crazy.

684
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,831
I finally meet my childhood hero,
and he's trying to kill us. What a joke!

685
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:36,542
Hey, I know a joke.

686
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,506
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says,

687
01:04:38,842 --> 01:04:41,622
"l forgot to store acorns for winter
and now Il am dead."

688
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,129
It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.

689
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:50,568
Careful, Russell.

690
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,257
You okay, Kevin?

691
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,520
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?

692
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,386
The wilderness isn't quite
what I expected.

693
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,261
Yeah? How so?

694
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:06,763
It's kind of wild.

695
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:10,933
I mean, it's not how they made it sound
in my book.

696
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:12,647
Get used to that, kid.

697
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,019
My dad made it sound so easy.

698
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,221
He's really good at camping

699
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,270
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff.

700
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,090
He used to come to all
my Sweat Lodge meetings.

701
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,990
And afterwards,
we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.

702
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,324
l always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.

703
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,340
Then we sit on this one curb
right outside,

704
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:37,167
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones,

705
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:40,834
and whoever gets the most wins.

706
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,590
I like that curb.

707
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:50,565
That might sound boring,

708
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:54,881
but I think the boring stuff
is the stuff l remember the most.

709
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,471
Look! There it is!

710
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,448
Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell. Stand still.

711
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,602
Look at that bird go.
Wait up, you overgrown chicken.

712
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,337
That's it. Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

713
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:33,935
Run, Kevin! Run!

714
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,170
Oh, no!

715
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,529
Russell, give me your knife!

716
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,554
Get away from my bird!

717
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,062
No!

718
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:24,983
No!

719
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:34,067
Careful. We'll want her
in good shape for my return.

720
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,769
Let her go! Stop!

721
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,602
Kevin!

722
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:00,128
You gave away Kevin.

723
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:05,672
You just gave her away.

724
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:12,807
This is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of this!

725
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:18,591
Master, it's alright.

726
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:21,406
lam not your master!

727
01:08:22,365 --> 01:08:25,085
And if you hadn't have shown up,
none of this would've happened!

728
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,558
Bad dog! Bad dog!

729
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,022
Now, whether you assist me or not,

730
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,911
lam going to Paradise Falls
if it kills me.

731
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,867
Here. I don't want this anymore.

732
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:39,931
Russell?

733
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:45,987
Russell!

734
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:49,262
I'm gonna help Kevin, even if you won't!

735
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,822
No, Russell! No!

736
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:06,628
Russell?

737
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:10,105
Dug!

738
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:14,543
l was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

739
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,351
Can you stay?
Well, you're my dog, aren't you?

740
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:18,887
And I'm your master.

741
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:20,168
You're my master?

742
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:21,890
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

743
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:24,641
Good boy, Dug! You're a good boy!

744
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:51,740
Yes!

745
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,992
Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save...

746
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:09,080
And they wouldn't believe me.
Just wait till they get a look at you.

747
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:10,819
Master?

748
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:14,187
-The small mailman has returned.
-What?

749
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:16,334
Let me go.

750
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:20,241
Where's your elderly friend?

751
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:24,178
He's not my friend anymore.

752
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:28,000
Well, if you're here,
Fredricksen can't be far behind.

753
01:16:29,385 --> 01:16:31,285
Where are you keeping Kevin?

754
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,825
-Let me go!
-Scream all you want, small mailman.

755
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,468
None of your mailman friends
can hear you.

756
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,498
I'll unleash
all my Wilderness Explorer training!

757
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,236
Alpha, Fredricksen's coming back.

758
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:51,697
Guard that bird. If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

759
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:55,171
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not finished with you!

760
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:57,288
Nice talking with you.

761
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,321
Where are you, Fredricksen?

762
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,304
Russell!

763
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:39,331
-Mr. Fredricksen!
-Dug, bring her over!

764
01:17:41,557 --> 01:17:43,727
You came back for Kevin!
Let's go get her!

765
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:46,056
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.

766
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,448
But I wanna help.

767
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:48,596
I don't want your help.

768
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:50,588
l want you safe.

769
01:17:57,973 --> 01:18:00,053
How do we get past these dogs?

770
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:01,883
Point!

771
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,510
Kevin.

772
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,000
Don't worry, Kevin. We're on our way.

773
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,580
Allow no one to be entering
through these doors.

774
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,750
Guard well that bird, my minions.

775
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,607
What do we do now, Dug?

776
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:41,327
Who wants the ball?

777
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,429
-Me! I want it!
-Me! I do!

778
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,090
-l want the ball!
-Give it to me!

779
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:47,495
Then go get it!

780
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,806
I'm gonna get there first!

781
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:51,422
Getting the ball!

782
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:52,954
I got it!

783
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:54,412
Uh-oh.

784
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,980
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Let's get you out of here.

785
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:04,047
-Master! He's gone! The old man!
-He's here!

786
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,466
-He's got the bird!
-The bird's gone...

787
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,571
Calm down! One at a time!

788
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:15,248
l...want...to...help!

789
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,051
-He's in Hall D!
-He's in Hall C!

790
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:28,589
It's the old man!

791
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:31,794
Does anyone know where they are?

792
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,706
Gray Leader? Take down the house.

793
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:57,835
Gray Leader, checking in.

794
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:58,943
Gray Two, checking in.

795
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:00,221
Gray Three, checking in.

796
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,043
Target sighted.

797
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,050
Come on, Kevin.

798
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,330
Hi.

799
01:20:58,754 --> 01:21:01,654
Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on!
Spit it out!

800
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,794
-Come on.
-Enough!

801
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:12,560
lam taking that bird back with me.
Alive or dead!

802
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:40,891
Come on, Kevin.

803
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,632
I will have many enjoyments
from what l am about to do, Dug.

804
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:13,017
He wears the Cone of Shame!

805
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,722
What? Do not just continue sitting.
Attack!

806
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:23,142
No, no! Stop your laughing!
Get this off of me!

807
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,279
Listen, you dog. Sit!

808
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:28,196
Yes, Alpha.

809
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,724
Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is...

810
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,576
I can't do it.

811
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:39,237
-Russell!
-Huh?

812
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:46,096
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

813
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:04,755
Hey, squirrel!

814
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,100
-Squirrel? Where? Where? Where?
-Where's the squirrel?

815
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,786
l hate squirrels.

816
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:35,643
Dug!

817
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:37,331
Master!

818
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,480
Russell! Over here! Let's go!

819
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:48,305
Mr. Fredricksen!

820
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,557
Go on, Kevin!

821
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,667
No!

822
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:23,710
Russell! Get out of there!

823
01:24:26,028 --> 01:24:27,868
No! Leave them alone!

824
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:47,108
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go of her!

825
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:51,498
Kevin! Chocolate!

826
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:15,709
That was cool!

827
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:21,820
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Easy, Russell.

828
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:26,843
lam ready to not be up high.

829
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:52,852
Sorry about your house,
Mr. Fredricksen.

830
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,817
You know, it's just a house.

831
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,532
Look at you. You're so soft.

832
01:26:13,068 --> 01:26:14,648
I wish I could keep one.

833
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:21,464
Where's my cane? I just had it here.

834
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:32,451
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

835
01:26:33,789 --> 01:26:35,099
Bye, Kevin!

836
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:45,846
Ready?

837
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:47,541
Ready.

838
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:00,033
And by receiving their badges,

839
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:04,418
the following Explorers will graduate
to Senior Explorers.

840
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:08,727
For Extreme Mountaineering Lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.

841
01:27:09,491 --> 01:27:13,391
For Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.

842
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:16,299
For Assisting the Elderly...

843
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,329
Russell, is there someone that...

844
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:26,061
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

845
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:30,601
I'm here for him.

846
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:32,942
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

847
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:39,107
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly

848
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:43,644
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

849
01:27:45,127 --> 01:27:48,877
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

850
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,322
The Ellie badge.

851
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:57,471
Wow.

852
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:06,387
All right, 1 think that covers everybody.
So let's give a big Explorer call

853
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:10,322
to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers.

854
01:28:11,052 --> 01:28:12,012
Ready, everybody?

855
01:28:20,829 --> 01:28:22,318
-Blue one.
-Red one.

856
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:24,751
-Blue one.
-Gray one.

857
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,696
-Red one.
-That's a bike.

858
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,833
It's red, isn't it?

859
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,778
Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating.

860
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,760
No, I'm not. Red one.

861
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:35,655
